<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijian Wang, Tongxian Guo, Zhaoqiang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The fuzzy job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) emerges as an innovative extension to the job shop scheduling problem (JSSP), incorporating a layer of uncertainty that aligns the problem more closely with the complexities of real-world manufacturing environments. This improvement increases the computational complexity of deriving the solution while improving its applicability. In the domain of deterministic scheduling, neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has recently demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However, its application to the realm of fuzzy scheduling has been relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the feasibility of employing neural networks to assimilate and process fuzzy information for the resolution of FJSSP, thereby leveraging the advancements in NCO to enhance fuzzy scheduling methodologies. To achieve this, we approach the FJSSP as a generative task and introduce an expectation-maximization algorithm-based autoregressive model (EMARM) to address it. During training, our model alternates between generating scheduling schemes from given instances (E-step) and adjusting the autoregressive model weights based on these generated schemes (M-step). This novel methodology effectively navigates around the substantial hurdle of obtaining ground-truth labels, which is a prevalent issue in NCO frameworks. In testing, the experimental results demonstrate the superior capability of EMARM in addressing the FJSSP, showcasing its effectiveness and potential for practical applications in fuzzy scheduling.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00019">Growth Patterns of Inference</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: What properties of a first-order search space support/hinder inference? What kinds of facts would be most effective to learn? Answering these questions is essential for understanding the dynamics of deductive reasoning and creating large-scale knowledge-based learning systems that support efficient inference. We address these questions by developing a model of how the distribution of ground facts affects inference performance in search spaces. Experiments suggest that uniform search spaces are suitable for larger KBs whereas search spaces with skewed degree distribution show better performance in smaller KBs. A sharp transition in Q/A performance is seen in some cases, suggesting that analysis of the structure of search spaces with existing knowledge should be used to guide the acquisition of new ground facts in learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Commonsense temporal reasoning at scale is a core problem for cognitive systems. The correct inference of the duration for which fluents hold is required by many tasks, including natural language understanding and planning. Many AI systems have limited deductive closure because they cannot extrapolate information correctly regarding existing fluents and events. In this study, we discuss the knowledge representation and reasoning schemes required for robust temporal projection in the Cyc Knowledge Base. We discuss how events can start and end risk periods for fluents. We then use discrete survival functions, which represent knowledge of the persistence of facts, to extrapolate a given fluent. The extrapolated intervals can be truncated by temporal constraints and other types of commonsense knowledge. Finally, we present the results of experiments to demonstrate that these methods obtain significant improvements in terms of Q/A performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Xiao, Peng Chen, Qianqian Jia, Jiejuan Tong, Jingang Liang, Haitao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: HRA (Human Reliability Analysis) data is crucial for advancing HRA methodologies. however, existing data collection methods lack the necessary granularity, and most approaches fail to capture dynamic features. Additionally, many methods require expert knowledge as input, making them time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm for the automated collection of HRA data. Our approach focuses on key indicators behind human error, specifically measuring workload in collaborative settings. This study introduces a novel, scenario-driven method for workload estimation, leveraging fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). By training LLMs on real-world operational data from high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), we simulate human behavior and cognitive load in real time across various collaborative scenarios. The method dynamically adapts to changes in operator workload, providing more accurate, flexible, and scalable workload estimates. The results demonstrate that the proposed WELLA (Workload Estimation with LLMs and Agents) outperforms existing commercial LLM-based methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00034">Towards Efficient Multi-Objective Optimisation for Real-World Power Grid Topology Control</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yassine El Manyari, Anton R. Fuxjager, Stefan Zahlner, Joost Van Dijk, Alberto Castagna, Davide Barbieri, Jan Viebahn, Marcel Wasserer</p>
<p>Abstract: Power grid operators face increasing difficulties in the control room as the increase in energy demand and the shift to renewable energy introduce new complexities in managing congestion and maintaining a stable supply. Effective grid topology control requires advanced tools capable of handling multi-objective trade-offs. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for tackling such challenges, existing Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) approaches fail to scale to the large state and action spaces inherent in real-world grid operations. Here we present a two-phase, efficient and scalable Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO) method designed for grid topology control, combining an efficient RL learning phase with a rapid planning phase to generate day-ahead plans for unseen scenarios. We validate our approach using historical data from TenneT, a European Transmission System Operator (TSO), demonstrating minimal deployment time, generating day-ahead plans within 4-7 minutes with strong performance. These results underline the potential of our scalable method to support real-world power grid management, offering a practical, computationally efficient, and time-effective tool for operational planning. Based on current congestion costs and inefficiencies in grid operations, adopting our approach by TSOs could potentially save millions of euros annually, providing a compelling economic incentive for its integration in the control room.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Speck, Markus Hecher, Daniel Gnad, Johannes K. Fichte, Augusto B. Corr\^ea</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical planning asks for a sequence of operators reaching a given goal. While the most common case is to compute a plan, many scenarios require more than that. However, quantitative reasoning on the plan space remains mostly unexplored. A fundamental problem is to count plans, which relates to the conditional probability on the plan space. Indeed, qualitative and quantitative approaches are well-established in various other areas of automated reasoning. We present the first study to quantitative and qualitative reasoning on the plan space. In particular, we focus on polynomially bounded plans. On the theoretical side, we study its complexity, which gives rise to rich reasoning modes. Since counting is hard in general, we introduce the easier notion of facets, which enables understanding the significance of operators. On the practical side, we implement quantitative reasoning for planning. Thereby, we transform a planning task into a propositional formula and use knowledge compilation to count different plans. This framework scales well to large plan spaces, while enabling rich reasoning capabilities such as learning pruning functions and explainable planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus challenges AI systems to perform abstract reasoning with minimal training data, a task intuitive for humans but demanding for machine learning models. Using CodeT5+ as a case study, we demonstrate how limitations in positional encoding hinder reasoning and impact performance. This work further examines the role of positional encoding across transformer architectures, highlighting its critical influence on models of varying sizes and configurations. Comparing several strategies, we find that while 2D positional encoding and Rotary Position Embedding offer competitive performance, 2D encoding excels in data-constrained scenarios, emphasizing its effectiveness for ARC tasks</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Han, Lijun Zhang, Dejian Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) shows great potential for optimizing multi-vehicle cooperative driving strategies through the state-action-reward feedback loop, but it still faces challenges such as low sample efficiency. This paper proposes a differentiated reward method based on steady-state transition systems, which incorporates state transition gradient information into the reward design by analyzing traffic flow characteristics, aiming to optimize action selection and policy learning in multi-vehicle cooperative decision-making. The performance of the proposed method is validated in RL algorithms such as MAPPO, MADQN, and QMIX under varying autonomous vehicle penetration. The results show that the differentiated reward method significantly accelerates training convergence and outperforms centering reward and others in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, and action rationality. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong scalability and environmental adaptability, providing a novel approach for multi-agent cooperative decision-making in complex traffic scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00406">ALU: Agentic LLM Unlearning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Debdeep Sanyal, Murari Mandal</p>
<p>Abstract: Information removal or suppression in large language models (LLMs) is a desired functionality, useful in AI regulation, legal compliance, safety, and privacy. LLM unlearning methods aim to remove information on demand from LLMs. Current LLM unlearning methods struggle to balance the unlearning efficacy and utility due to the competing nature of these objectives. Keeping the unlearning process computationally feasible without assuming access to the model weights is an overlooked area. We present the first agentic LLM unlearning (ALU) method, a multi-agent, retrain-free, model-agnostic approach to LLM unlearning that achieves effective unlearning while preserving the utility. Our ALU framework unlearns by involving multiple LLM agents, each designed for a specific step in the unlearning process, without the need to update model weights for any of the agents in the framework. Users can easily request any set of unlearning instances in any sequence, and ALU seamlessly adapts in real time. This is facilitated without requiring any changes in the underlying LLM model. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks (TOFU, WMDP, WPU) and jailbreaking techniques (many shot, target masking, other languages), we demonstrate that ALU consistently stands out as the most robust LLM unlearning framework among current state-of-the-art methods while incurring a low constant-time cost. We further highlight ALU's superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated at scale. Specifically, ALU is assessed on up to 1000 unlearning targets, exceeding the evaluation scope of all previously proposed LLM unlearning methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00409">Doing More with Less -- Implementing Routing Strategies in Large Language Model-Based Systems: An Extended Survey</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Clovis Varangot-Reille, Christophe Bouvard, Antoine Gourru, Mathieu Ciancone, Marion Schaeffer, Fran\c{c}ois Jacquenet</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM)-based systems, i.e. interconnected elements that include an LLM as a central component (e.g., conversational agents), are typically monolithic static architectures that rely on a single LLM for all user queries. However, they often require different preprocessing strategies, levels of reasoning, or knowledge. Generalist LLMs (e.g. GPT-4) trained on very large multi-topic corpora can perform well in a variety of tasks. They require significant financial, energy, and hardware resources that may not be justified for basic tasks. This implies potentially investing in unnecessary costs for a given query. To overcome this problem, a routing mechanism routes user queries to the most suitable components, such as smaller LLMs or experts in specific topics. This approach may improve response quality while minimising costs. Routing can be expanded to other components of the conversational agent architecture, such as the selection of optimal embedding strategies. This paper explores key considerations for integrating routing into LLM-based systems, focusing on resource management, cost definition, and strategy selection. Our main contributions include a formalisation of the problem, a novel taxonomy of existing approaches emphasising relevance and resource efficiency, and a comparative analysis of these strategies in relation to industry practices. Finally, we identify critical challenges and directions for future research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00498">MetaOpenFOAM 2.0: Large Language Model Driven Chain of Thought for Automating CFD Simulation and Post-Processing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Chen, Xu Zhu, Hua Zhou, Zhuyin Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is widely used in aerospace, energy, and biology to model fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical reactions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed various domains, their application in CFD remains limited, particularly for complex tasks like post-processing. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaOpenFOAM 2.0, which leverages Chain of Thought (COT) decomposition and iterative verification to enhance accessibility for non-expert users through natural language inputs. Tested on a new benchmark covering simulation (fluid flow, heat transfer, combustion) and post-processing (extraction, visualization), MetaOpenFOAM 2.0 achieved an Executability score of 6.3/7 and a pass rate of 86.9%, significantly outperforming MetaOpenFOAM 1.0 (2.1/7, 0%). Additionally, it proved cost-efficient, averaging $0.15 per case. An ablation study confirmed that COT-driven decomposition and iterative refinement substantially improved task performance. Furthermore, scaling laws showed that increasing COT steps enhanced accuracy while raising token usage, aligning with LLM post-training scaling trends. These results highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in automating CFD workflows for industrial and research applications. Code is available at https://github.com/Terry-cyx/MetaOpenFOAM</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00499">Discovering Directly-Follows Graph Model for Acyclic Processes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Shaimov, Irina Lomazova, Alexey Mitsyuk</p>
<p>Abstract: Process mining is the common name for a range of methods and approaches aimed at analysing and improving processes. Specifically, methods that aim to derive process models from event logs fall under the category of process discovery. Within the range of processes, acyclic processes form a distinct category. In such processes, previously performed actions are not repeated, forming chains of unique actions. However, due to differences in the order of actions, existing process discovery methods can provide models containing cycles even if a process is acyclic. This paper presents a new process discovery algorithm that allows to discover acyclic DFG models for acyclic processes. A model is discovered by partitioning an event log into parts that provide acyclic DFG models and merging them while avoiding the formation of cycles. The resulting algorithm was tested both on real-life and artificial event logs. Absence of cycles improves model visual clarity and precision, also allowing to apply cycle-sensitive methods or visualisations to the model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents frameworks often employ modular architectures, incorporating components such as planning, reasoning, action execution, and reflection to tackle complex tasks. However, quantifying the contribution of each module to overall system performance remains a significant challenge, impeding optimization and interpretability. To address this, we introduce CapaBench (Capability-level Assessment Benchmark), an evaluation framework grounded in cooperative game theory's Shapley Value, which systematically measures the marginal impact of individual modules and their interactions within an agent's architecture. By replacing default modules with test variants across all possible combinations, CapaBench provides a principle method for attributing performance contributions. Key contributions include: (1) We are the first to propose a Shapley Value-based methodology for quantifying the contributions of capabilities in LLM agents; (2) Modules with high Shapley Values consistently lead to predictable performance gains when combined, enabling targeted optimization; and (3) We build a multi-round dataset of over 1,000 entries spanning diverse domains and practical task scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation of agent capabilities. CapaBench bridges the gap between component-level evaluation and holistic system assessment, providing actionable insights for optimizing modular LLM agents and advancing their deployment in complex, real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changdae Oh, Zhen Fang, Shawn Im, Xuefeng Du, Yixuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities but struggle under distribution shifts, where evaluation data differ from instruction tuning distributions. Although previous works have provided empirical evaluations, we argue that establishing a formal framework that can characterize and quantify the risk of MLLMs is necessary to ensure the safe and reliable application of MLLMs in the real world. By taking an information-theoretic perspective, we propose the first theoretical framework that enables the quantification of the maximum risk of MLLMs under distribution shifts. Central to our framework is the introduction of Effective Mutual Information (EMI), a principled metric that quantifies the relevance between input queries and model responses. We derive an upper bound for the EMI difference between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, connecting it to visual and textual distributional discrepancies. Extensive experiments on real benchmark datasets, spanning 61 shift scenarios empirically validate our theoretical insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Wu, Hideki Nakayama</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, neuro-symbolic methods have become a popular and powerful approach that augments artificial intelligence systems with the capability to perform abstract, logical, and quantitative deductions with enhanced precision and controllability. Recent studies successfully performed symbolic reasoning by leveraging various machine learning models to explicitly or implicitly predict intermediate labels that provide symbolic instructions. However, these intermediate labels are not always prepared for every task as a part of training data, and pre-trained models, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs), also do not consistently generate valid symbolic instructions with their intrinsic knowledge. On the other hand, existing work developed alternative learning techniques that allow the learning system to autonomously uncover optimal symbolic instructions. Nevertheless, their performance also exhibits limitations when faced with relatively huge search spaces or more challenging reasoning problems. In view of this, in this work, we put forward an advanced practice for neuro-symbolic reasoning systems to explore the intermediate labels with weak supervision from problem inputs and final outputs. Our experiments on the Mathematics dataset illustrated the effectiveness of our proposals from multiple aspects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuyuan Zhang, Tian Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has proven highly effective in solving complex planning tasks by balancing exploration and exploitation using Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT). However, existing work have not considered MCTS-based lifelong planning, where an agent faces a non-stationary series of tasks -- e.g., with varying transition probabilities and rewards -- that are drawn sequentially throughout the operational lifetime. This paper presents LiZero for Lipschitz lifelong planning using MCTS. We propose a novel concept of adaptive UCT (aUCT) to transfer knowledge from a source task to the exploration/exploitation of a new task, depending on both the Lipschitz continuity between tasks and the confidence of knowledge in in Monte Carlo action sampling. We analyze LiZero's acceleration factor in terms of improved sampling efficiency and also develop efficient algorithms to compute aUCT in an online fashion by both data-driven and model-based approaches, whose sampling complexity and error bounds are also characterized. Experiment results show that LiZero significantly outperforms existing MCTS and lifelong learning baselines in terms of much faster convergence (3$\sim$4x) to optimal rewards. Our results highlight the potential of LiZero to advance decision-making and planning in dynamic real-world environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shirley Wu, Michel Galley, Baolin Peng, Hao Cheng, Gavin Li, Yao Dou, Weixin Cai, James Zou, Jure Leskovec, Jianfeng Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models are typically trained with next-turn rewards, limiting their ability to optimize for long-term interaction. As a result, they often respond passively to ambiguous or open-ended user requests, failing to help users reach their ultimate intents and leading to inefficient conversations. To address these limitations, we introduce CollabLLM, a novel and general training framework that enhances multiturn human-LLM collaboration. Its key innovation is a collaborative simulation that estimates the long-term contribution of responses using Multiturn-aware Rewards. By reinforcement fine-tuning these rewards, CollabLLM goes beyond responding to user requests, and actively uncovers user intent and offers insightful suggestions-a key step towards more human-centered AI. We also devise a multiturn interaction benchmark with three challenging tasks such as document creation. CollabLLM significantly outperforms our baselines with averages of 18.5% higher task performance and 46.3% improved interactivity by LLM judges. Finally, we conduct a large user study with 201 judges, where CollabLLM increases user satisfaction by 17.6% and reduces user spent time by 10.4%.</p>

<p>Abstract: There is significant concern about the impact of generative AI on society. Modern AI tools are capable of generating ever more realistic text, images, and videos, and functional code, from minimal prompts. Accompanying this rise in ability and usability, there is increasing alarm about the misuses to which these tools can be put, and the intentional and unintentional harms to individuals and society that may result. In this paper, we argue that \emph{agency} is the appropriate lens to study these harms and benefits, but that doing so will require advancement in the theory of agency, and advancement in how this theory is applied in (agent-based) models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siraaj Akhtar, Saad Khan, Simon Parkinson</p>
<p>Abstract: Event log analysis is an important task that security professionals undertake. Event logs record key information on activities that occur on computing devices, and due to the substantial number of events generated, they consume a large amount of time and resources to analyse. This demanding and repetitive task is also prone to errors. To address these concerns, researchers have developed automated techniques to improve the event log analysis process. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated the ability to successfully perform a wide range of tasks that individuals would usually partake in, to high standards, and at a pace and degree of complexity that outperform humans. Due to this, researchers are rapidly investigating the use of LLMs for event log analysis. This includes fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and in-context learning, which affect performance. These works demonstrate good progress, yet there is a need to understand the developing body of knowledge, identify commonalities between works, and identify key challenges and potential solutions to further developments in this domain. This paper aims to survey LLM-based event log analysis techniques, providing readers with an in-depth overview of the domain, gaps identified in previous research, and concluding with potential avenues to explore in future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Wang, Long Li, Chao Qu, Fengming Zhu, Weidi Xu, Wei Chu, Fangzhen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research on tool integration for math Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to combine complementary strengths of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution. However, we discover a critical limitation: current tool-integrated math LLMs rely on externally dictated instructions to decide whether to use CoT or code, lacking the autonomy to choose the most appropriate method independently. This prompts us to study \emph{Autonomous Code integration} for math LLMs, which enables models to \emph{independently} develop their own methodology-selection strategy in the absence of reliable supervision. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative Expectation-Maximization (EM) formulation that refines the model's decision-making through the exploration of its capabilities. This framework alternates between (a) computing a reference strategy that improves the model's belief over its capabilities through self-exploration, and (b) updating the model based on the refined belief. We further enhance this framework with an efficient implementation, incorporating a novel data synthesis strategy and off-policy reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach, using only a public query set, significantly boosts the performance of existing math LLMs, raising accuracy by nearly 20\% to 65.28\% on the challenging MATH benchmark, while reducing code executions by up to 65\% .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanqia Cai, Yijun Yang, Winston Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: IQ testing has served as a foundational methodology for evaluating human cognitive capabilities, deliberately decoupling assessment from linguistic background, language proficiency, or domain-specific knowledge to isolate core competencies in abstraction and reasoning. Yet, artificial intelligence research currently lacks systematic benchmarks to quantify these critical cognitive dimensions in multimodal systems. To address this critical gap, we propose MM-IQ, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 2,710 meticulously curated test items spanning 8 distinct reasoning paradigms.
  Through systematic evaluation of leading open-source and proprietary multimodal models, our benchmark reveals striking limitations: even state-of-the-art architectures achieve only marginally superior performance to random chance (27.49% vs. 25% baseline accuracy). This substantial performance chasm highlights the inadequacy of current multimodal systems in approximating fundamental human reasoning capacities, underscoring the need for paradigm-shifting advancements to bridge this cognitive divide.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoann Poupart, Aur\'elie Beynier, Nicolas Maudet</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) was proven efficient in solving complex problems in robotics or games, yet most of the trained models are hard to interpret. While learning intrinsically interpretable models remains a prominent approach, its scalability and flexibility are limited in handling complex tasks or multi-agent dynamics. This paper advocates for direct interpretability, generating post hoc explanations directly from trained models, as a versatile and scalable alternative, offering insights into agents' behaviour, emergent phenomena, and biases without altering models' architectures. We explore modern methods, including relevance backpropagation, knowledge edition, model steering, activation patching, sparse autoencoders and circuit discovery, to highlight their applicability to single-agent, multi-agent, and training process challenges. By addressing MADRL interpretability, we propose directions aiming to advance active topics such as team identification, swarm coordination and sample efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boaz Taitler, Omer Ben-Porat</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has significantly impacted human-based forums like Stack Overflow, which are essential for generating high-quality data. This creates a negative feedback loop, hindering the development of GenAI systems, which rely on such data to provide accurate responses. In this paper, we provide a possible remedy: A novel strategy we call selective response. Selective response implies that GenAI could strategically provide inaccurate (or conservative) responses to queries involving emerging topics and novel technologies, thereby driving users to use human-based forums like Stack Overflow. We show that selective response can potentially have a compounding effect on the data generation process, increasing both GenAI's revenue and user welfare in the long term. From an algorithmic perspective, we propose an approximately optimal approach to maximize GenAI's revenue under social welfare constraints. From a regulatory perspective, we derive sufficient and necessary conditions for selective response to improve welfare improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread prevalence of misinformation poses significant societal concerns. Out-of-context misinformation, where authentic images are paired with false text, is particularly deceptive and easily misleads audiences. Most existing detection methods primarily evaluate image-text consistency but often lack sufficient explanations, which are essential for effectively debunking misinformation. We present a model that detects multimodal misinformation through cross-modality consistency checks, requiring minimal training time. Additionally, we propose a lightweight model that achieves competitive performance using only one-third of the parameters. We also introduce a dual-purpose zero-shot learning task for generating contextualized warnings, enabling automated debunking and enhancing user comprehension. Qualitative and human evaluations of the generated warnings highlight both the potential and limitations of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leng Cai, Junxuan He, Yikai Li, Junjie Liang, Yuanping Lin, Ziming Quan, Yawen Zeng, Jin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-Time Bidding (RTB) enables advertisers to place competitive bids on impression opportunities instantaneously, striving for cost-effectiveness in a highly competitive landscape. Although RTB has widely benefited from the utilization of technologies such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, the reliability of related methods often encounters challenges due to the discrepancies between online and offline environments and the rapid fluctuations of online bidding. To handle these challenges, RTBAgent is proposed as the first RTB agent system based on large language models (LLMs), which synchronizes real competitive advertising bidding environments and obtains bidding prices through an integrated decision-making process. Specifically, obtaining reasoning ability through LLMs, RTBAgent is further tailored to be more professional for RTB via involved auxiliary modules, i.e., click-through rate estimation model, expert strategy knowledge, and daily reflection. In addition, we propose a two-step decision-making process and multi-memory retrieval mechanism, which enables RTBAgent to review historical decisions and transaction records and subsequently make decisions more adaptive to market changes in real-time bidding. Empirical testing with real advertising datasets demonstrates that RTBAgent significantly enhances profitability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyu Zhang, Yongwang Zhao, Long Zhang, Jilin Hu, Xiaokun Luan, Zhiwei Xu, Feng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have become a prominent research focus. At present, the proving ability of these LLMs is mainly evaluated through proof pass rates on datasets such as miniF2F. However, this evaluation method overlooks the varying importance of theorems. As a result, it fails to highlight the real performance disparities between LLMs and leads to high evaluation costs. This study proposes a psychometric-based evaluation method for theorem proving with LLMs, comprising two main components: Dataset Annotation and Adaptive Evaluation. First, we propose a metric calculation method to annotate the dataset with difficulty and discrimination metrics. Specifically, we annotate each theorem in the miniF2F dataset and grade them into varying difficulty levels according to the performance of LLMs, resulting in an enhanced dataset: miniF2F-Graded. Experimental results show that the difficulty grading in miniF2F-Graded better reflects the theorem difficulty perceived by LLMs. Secondly, we design an adaptive evaluation method to dynamically select the most suitable theorems for testing based on the annotated metrics and the real-time performance of LLMs. We apply this method to evaluate 10 LLMs. The results show that our method finely highlights the performance disparities between LLMs. It also reduces evaluation costs by using only 23% of the theorems in the dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manjie Xu, Xinyi Yang, Wei Liang, Chi Zhang, Yixin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective integration of AI agents into daily life requires them to understand and adapt to individual human preferences, particularly in collaborative roles. Although recent studies on embodied intelligence have advanced significantly, they typically adopt generalized approaches that overlook personal preferences in planning. We address this limitation by developing agents that not only learn preferences from few demonstrations but also learn to adapt their planning strategies based on these preferences. Our research leverages the observation that preferences, though implicitly expressed through minimal demonstrations, can generalize across diverse planning scenarios. To systematically evaluate this hypothesis, we introduce Preference-based Planning (PbP) benchmark, an embodied benchmark featuring hundreds of diverse preferences spanning from atomic actions to complex sequences. Our evaluation of SOTA methods reveals that while symbol-based approaches show promise in scalability, significant challenges remain in learning to generate and execute plans that satisfy personalized preferences. We further demonstrate that incorporating learned preferences as intermediate representations in planning significantly improves the agent's ability to construct personalized plans. These findings establish preferences as a valuable abstraction layer for adaptive planning, opening new directions for research in preference-guided plan generation and execution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhash Kantamneni, Max Tegmark</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is an increasingly important indicator of large language model (LLM) capabilities, yet we lack understanding of how LLMs process even simple mathematical tasks. To address this, we reverse engineer how three mid-sized LLMs compute addition. We first discover that numbers are represented in these LLMs as a generalized helix, which is strongly causally implicated for the tasks of addition and subtraction, and is also causally relevant for integer division, multiplication, and modular arithmetic. We then propose that LLMs compute addition by manipulating this generalized helix using the "Clock" algorithm: to solve $a+b$, the helices for $a$ and $b$ are manipulated to produce the $a+b$ answer helix which is then read out to model logits. We model influential MLP outputs, attention head outputs, and even individual neuron preactivations with these helices and verify our understanding with causal interventions. By demonstrating that LLMs represent numbers on a helix and manipulate this helix to perform addition, we present the first representation-level explanation of an LLM's mathematical capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and their scalability in complex non-monotonic reasoning. To this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM reasoning performance on logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). ZebraLogic enables the generation of puzzles with controllable and quantifiable complexity, facilitating a systematic study of the scaling limits of models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-R1. By encompassing a broad range of search space complexities and diverse logical constraints, ZebraLogic provides a structured environment to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty.
  Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity grows -- a phenomenon we term the curse of complexity. This limitation persists even with larger models and increased inference-time computation, suggesting inherent constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts. Our findings offer critical insights into the scalability of LLM reasoning, highlight fundamental limitations, and outline potential directions for improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanlin Li, Kangjie Chen, Shangwei Guo, Jie Zhang, Han Qiu, Chao Zhang, Guoyin Wang, Tianwei Zhang, Jiwei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for addressing a wide range of general inquiries and tasks. Despite this, fine-tuning aligned LLMs on smaller, domain-specific datasets, critical to adapting them to specialized tasks, can inadvertently degrade their safety alignment, even when the datasets are benign. This phenomenon makes models more susceptible to providing inappropriate responses. In this study, we systematically examine the factors contributing to safety alignment degradation in benign fine-tuning scenarios. Our analysis identifies three critical factors affecting aligned LLMs: answer structure, identity calibration, and role-play. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability of state-of-the-art reward models (RMs), which are often used to guide alignment processes. Our findings reveal that these RMs frequently fail to accurately reflect human preferences regarding safety, underscoring their limitations in practical applications. By uncovering these challenges, our work highlights the complexities of maintaining safety alignment during fine-tuning and offers guidance to help developers balance utility and safety in LLMs. Datasets and fine-tuning code used in our experiments can be found in https://github.com/GuanlinLee/llm_instruction_tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in reasoning while they still suffer from severe factual hallucinations due to timeliness, accuracy, and coverage of parametric knowledge. Meanwhile, integrating reasoning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains challenging due to ineffective task decomposition and redundant retrieval, which can introduce noise and degrade response quality. In this paper, we propose DeepRAG, a framework that models retrieval-augmented reasoning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling strategic and adaptive retrieval. By iteratively decomposing queries, DeepRAG dynamically determines whether to retrieve external knowledge or rely on parametric reasoning at each step. Experiments show that DeepRAG improves retrieval efficiency while improving answer accuracy by 21.99%, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Lai, Haolong Tong, Zhenghang Xu, Minghao Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantitative information flow analyses (QIF) are a class of techniques for measuring the amount of confidential information leaked by a program to its public outputs.
  Shannon entropy is an important method to quantify the amount of leakage in QIF.
  This paper focuses on the programs modeled in Boolean constraints and optimizes the two stages of the Shannon entropy computation to implement a scalable precise tool PSE.
  In the first stage, we design a knowledge compilation language called \ADDAND that combines Algebraic Decision Diagrams and conjunctive decomposition.
  \ADDAND avoids enumerating possible outputs of a program and supports tractable entropy computation.
  In the second stage, we optimize the model counting queries that are used to compute the probabilities of outputs.
  We compare PSE with the state-of-the-art probably approximately correct tool EntropyEstimation, which was shown to significantly outperform the existing precise tools.
  The experimental results demonstrate that PSE solved 55 more benchmarks compared to EntropyEstimation in a total of 441. For 98% of the benchmarks that both PSE and EntropyEstimation solved, PSE is at least $10\times$ as efficient as EntropyEstimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) poses privacy and security risks, as models may unintentionally reproduce sensitive or copyrighted data. Existing analyses focus on average-case scenarios, often neglecting the highly skewed distribution of memorization. This paper examines memorization in LLM supervised fine-tuning (SFT), exploring its relationships with training duration, dataset size, and inter-sample similarity. By analyzing memorization probabilities over sequence lengths, we link this skewness to the token generation process, offering insights for estimating memorization and comparing it to established metrics. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we provide a comprehensive understanding of memorization behaviors and propose strategies to detect and mitigate risks, contributing to more privacy-preserving LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces an explanation framework designed to enhance the quality of rules in knowledge-based reasoning systems based on dataset-driven insights. The traditional method for rule induction from data typically requires labor-intensive labeling and data-driven learning. This framework provides an alternative and instead allows for the data-driven refinement of existing rules: it generates explanations of rule inferences and leverages human interpretation to refine rules. It leverages four complementary explanation types: trace-based, contextual, contrastive, and counterfactual, providing diverse perspectives for debugging, validating, and ultimately refining rules. By embedding explainability into the reasoning architecture, the framework enables knowledge engineers to address inconsistencies, optimize thresholds, and ensure fairness, transparency, and interpretability in decision-making processes. Its practicality is demonstrated through a use case in finance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinzhi Liao, Zenghua Liao, Xiang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The enhance of accuracy in reasoning results of LLMs arouses the community's interests, wherein pioneering studies investigate post-hoc strategies to rectify potential mistakes. Despite extensive efforts, they are all stuck in a state of resource competition demanding significant time and computing expenses. The cause of the situation lies in the failure of identifying the fundamental feature of the solutions in this line, coined as the self-denial of LLMs. In other words, LLMs should confidently determine the potential existence of mistakes and carefully execute the targeted correction. As the whole procedure conducts within LLMs, supporting and persuasive references are hard to acquire, while the absence of specific steps towards refining hidden mistakes persists even when errors are acknowledged. In response to the challenges, we present PSSD, which refers to and implements the human psyche structure such that three distinct and interconnected roles contribute to human reasoning. Specifically, PSSD leverages the recent multi-agent paradigm, and is further enhanced with three innovatively conceived roles: (1) the intuition-based id role that provides initial attempts based on benign LLMs; (2) the rule-driven superego role that summarizes rules to regulate the above attempts, and returns specific key points as guidance; and (3) the script-centric ego role that absorbs all procedural information to generate executable script for the final answer prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design not only better enhance reasoning capabilities, but also seamlessly integrate with current models, leading to superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengkai Xu, Jiaqi Liu, Peng Hang, Jian Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Large Language Models (LLMs) each show promise in addressing decision-making challenges in autonomous driving, DRL often suffers from high sample complexity, while LLMs have difficulty ensuring real-time decision making. To address these limitations, we propose TeLL-Drive, a hybrid framework that integrates an Teacher LLM to guide an attention-based Student DRL policy. By incorporating risk metrics, historical scenario retrieval, and domain heuristics into context-rich prompts, the LLM produces high-level driving strategies through chain-of-thought reasoning. A self-attention mechanism then fuses these strategies with the DRL agent's exploration, accelerating policy convergence and boosting robustness across diverse driving conditions. Our experimental results, evaluated across multiple traffic scenarios, show that TeLL-Drive outperforms existing baseline methods, including other LLM-based approaches, in terms of success rates, average returns, and real-time feasibility. Ablation studies underscore the importance of each model component, especially the synergy between the attention mechanism and LLM-driven guidance. These findings suggest that TeLL-Drive significantly enhances both the adaptability and safety of autonomous driving systems, while offering a more efficient and scalable approach for policy learning. Full validation results are available on our website.</p>

Machine learning approaches only succeed in identifying the locations of these ``dark vessels'' in the immediate future. This work leverages ideas from the literature on abductive inference applied to locating adversarial agents to solve the problem. Specifically, we combine concepts from abduction, logic programming, and rule learning to create an efficient method that approaches full recall of dark vessels while requiring less search area than machine learning methods. We provide a logic-based paradigm for reasoning about maritime vessels, an abductive inference query method, an automatically extracted rule-based behavior model methodology, and a thorough suite of experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing benchmarks for frontier models often test specialized, ``PhD-level'' knowledge that is difficult for non-experts to grasp. In contrast, we present a benchmark based on the NPR Sunday Puzzle Challenge that requires only general knowledge. Our benchmark is challenging for both humans and models, however correct solutions are easy to verify, and models' mistakes are easy to spot.
  Our work reveals capability gaps that are not evident in existing benchmarks: OpenAI o1 significantly outperforms other reasoning models that are on par on benchmarks that test specialized knowledge. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning outputs uncovers new kinds of failures. DeepSeek R1, for instance, often concedes with ``I give up'' before providing an answer that it knows is wrong. R1 can also be remarkably ``uncertain'' in its output and in rare cases, it does not ``finish thinking,'' which suggests the need for an inference-time technique to ``wrap up'' before the context window limit is reached. We also quantify the effectiveness of reasoning longer with R1 and Gemini Thinking to identify the point beyond which more reasoning is unlikely to improve accuracy on our benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubin Ge, Salvatore Romeo, Jason Cai, Raphael Shu, Monica Sunkara, Yassine Benajiba, Yi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues presents a significant challenge which has been under-studied in previous temporal reasoning benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a new evaluation task for temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues and introduce an approach to construct a new benchmark by augmenting dialogues from LoCoMo and creating multi-choice QAs. Furthermore, we present TReMu, a new framework aimed at enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLM-agents in this context. Specifically, the framework employs \textit{time-aware memorization} through timeline summarization, generating retrievable memory by summarizing events in each dialogue session with their inferred dates. Additionally, we integrate \textit{neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning}, where LLMs generate Python code to perform temporal calculations and select answers. Experimental evaluations on popular LLMs demonstrate that our benchmark is challenging, and the proposed framework significantly improves temporal reasoning performance compared to baseline methods, raising from 29.83 on GPT-4o via standard prompting to 77.67 via our approach and highlighting its effectiveness in addressing temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Pistillo, Pablo Villalobos</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing legal frameworks on AI rely on training compute thresholds as a proxy to identify potentially-dangerous AI models and trigger increased regulatory attention. In the United States, Section 4.2(a) of Executive Order 14110 instructs the Secretary of Commerce to require extensive reporting from developers of AI models above a certain training compute threshold. In the European Union, Article 51 of the AI Act establishes a presumption that AI models above a certain compute threshold have high impact capabilities and hence pose systemic risk, thus subjecting their developers to several obligations including capability evaluations, reporting, and incident monitoring. In this paper, we examine some enhancement techniques that are capable of decreasing training compute usage while preserving, or even increasing, model capabilities. Since training compute thresholds rely on training compute as a metric and trigger for increased regulatory attention, these capability-enhancing and compute-saving techniques could constitute a legal loophole to existing training compute thresholds. In particular, we concentrate on four illustrative techniques (fine-tuning, model reuse, model expansion, and above compute-optimal inference compute) with the goal of furthering the conversation about their implications on training compute thresholds as a legal mechanism and advancing policy recommendations that could address the relevant legal loopholes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christina Lukas</p>
<p>Abstract: Good mental health enables individuals to cope with the normal stresses of life. In Germany, approximately one-quarter of the adult population is affected by mental illnesses. Teletherapy and digital health applications are available to bridge gaps in care and relieve healthcare professionals. The acceptance of these tools is a strongly influencing factor for their effectiveness, which also needs to be evaluated for AI-based conversational agents (CAs) (e. g. ChatGPT, Siri) to assess the risks and potential for integration into therapeutic practice. This study investigates the perspectives of both the general population and healthcare professionals with the following questions: 1. How frequently are CAs used for mental health? 2. How high is the acceptance of CAs in the field of mental health? 3. To what extent is the use of CAs in counselling, diagnosis, and treatment acceptable? To address these questions, two quantitative online surveys were conducted with 444 participants from the general population and 351 healthcare professionals. Statistical analyses show that 27 % of the surveyed population already confide their concerns to CAs. Not only experience with this technology but also experience with telemedicine shows a higher acceptance among both groups for using CAs for mental health. Additionally, participants from the general population were more likely to support CAs as companions controlled by healthcare professionals rather than as additional experts for the professionals. CAs have the potential to support mental health, particularly in counselling. Future research should examine the influence of different communication media and further possibilities of augmented intelligence. With the right balance between technology and human care, integration into patient-professional interaction can be achieved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dian Tjondronegoro</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize various sectors, from healthcare to finance, education, and beyond. However, successfully implementing AI systems remains a complex challenge, requiring a comprehensive and methodologically sound framework. This paper contributes to this challenge by introducing the Trustworthy, Optimized, Adaptable, and Socio-Technologically harmonious (TOAST) framework. It draws on insights from various disciplines to align technical strategy with ethical values, societal responsibilities, and innovation aspirations. The TOAST framework is a novel approach designed to guide the implementation of AI systems, focusing on reliability, accountability, technical advancement, adaptability, and socio-technical harmony. By grounding the TOAST framework in healthcare case studies, this paper provides a robust evaluation of its practicality and theoretical soundness in addressing operational, ethical, and regulatory challenges in high-stakes environments, demonstrating how adaptable AI systems can enhance institutional efficiency, mitigate risks like bias and data privacy, and offer a replicable model for other sectors requiring ethically aligned and efficient AI integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutan Huang, Chetan Arora, Wen Cheng Houng, Tanjila Kanij, Anuradha Madulgalla, John Grundy</p>
<p>Abstract: [Context] Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have transformed numerous domains by enhancing convenience and efficiency in information retrieval, content generation, and decision-making processes. However, deploying LLMs also presents diverse ethical challenges, and their mitigation strategies remain complex and domain-dependent. [Objective] This paper aims to identify and categorize the key ethical concerns associated with using LLMs, examine existing mitigation strategies, and assess the outstanding challenges in implementing these strategies across various domains. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study, reviewing 39 studies that discuss ethical concerns and mitigation strategies related to LLMs. We analyzed these ethical concerns using five ethical dimensions that we extracted based on various existing guidelines, frameworks, and an analysis of the mitigation strategies and implementation challenges. [Results] Our findings reveal that ethical concerns in LLMs are multi-dimensional and context-dependent. While proposed mitigation strategies address some of these concerns, significant challenges still remain. [Conclusion] Our results highlight that ethical issues often hinder the practical implementation of the mitigation strategies, particularly in high-stake areas like healthcare and public governance; existing frameworks often lack adaptability, failing to accommodate evolving societal expectations and diverse contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our research explores the development and application of musical agents, human-in-the-loop generative AI systems designed to support music performance and improvisation within co-creative spaces. We introduce MACAT and MACataRT, two distinct musical agent systems crafted to enhance interactive music-making between human musicians and AI. MACAT is optimized for agent-led performance, employing real-time synthesis and self-listening to shape its output autonomously, while MACataRT provides a flexible environment for collaborative improvisation through audio mosaicing and sequence-based learning. Both systems emphasize training on personalized, small datasets, fostering ethical and transparent AI engagement that respects artistic integrity. This research highlights how interactive, artist-centred generative AI can expand creative possibilities, empowering musicians to explore new forms of artistic expression in real-time, performance-driven and music improvisation contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulaziz Ahmed, Mohammad Saleem, Mohammed Alzeen, Badari Birur, Rachel E Fargason, Bradley G Burk, Hannah Rose Harkins, Ahmed Alhassan, Mohammed Ali Al-Garadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: To evaluate whether integrating large language models (LLMs) with traditional machine learning approaches improves both the predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability of ED mental health returns risk models. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 42,464 ED visits for 27,904 unique mental health patients at an Academic Medical Center in the deep South of the United States between January 2018 and December 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two primary outcomes were evaluated: (1) 30 days ED return prediction accuracy and (2) model interpretability through a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values with contextual clinical knowledge. Results: The proposed machine learning interpretability framework, leveraging LLM, achieved 99% accuracy in translating complex model predictions into clinically relevant explanations. Integration of LLM-extracted features enhanced predictive performance, improving the XGBoost model area under the curve (AUC) from 0.73 to 0.76. The LLM-based feature extraction using 10-shot learning significantly outperformed traditional approaches, achieving an accuracy of 0.882 and an F1 score of 0.86 for chief complaint classification (compared to conventional methods with an accuracy range of 0.59 to 0.63) and demonstrating accuracy values ranging from 0.65 to 0.93 across multiple SDoH categories, underscoring its robust performance in extracting features from clinical notes. Conclusions and Relevance: Integrating LLMs with traditional machine learning models yielded modest but consistent improvements in ED return prediction accuracy while substantially enhancing model interpretability through automated, clinically relevant explanations. This approach offers a framework for translating complex predictive analytics into actionable clinical insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Wang, Yuan Cheng, Xiaomeng Han, Zhengpeng Zhao, Dawei Yang, Zhe Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The substantial computational and memory demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinder their deployment. Block Floating Point (BFP) has proven effective in accelerating linear operations, a cornerstone of LLM workloads. However, as sequence lengths grow, nonlinear operations, such as Attention, increasingly become performance bottlenecks due to their quadratic computational complexity. These nonlinear operations are predominantly executed using inefficient floating-point formats, which renders the system challenging to optimize software efficiency and hardware overhead. In this paper, we delve into the limitations and potential of applying BFP to nonlinear operations. Given our findings, we introduce a hardware-software co-design framework (DB-Attn), including: (i) DBFP, an advanced BFP version, overcomes nonlinear operation challenges with a pivot-focus strategy for diverse data and an adaptive grouping strategy for flexible exponent sharing. (ii) DH-LUT, a novel lookup table algorithm dedicated to accelerating nonlinear operations with DBFP format. (iii) An RTL-level DBFP-based engine is implemented to support DB-Attn, applicable to FPGA and ASIC. Results show that DB-Attn provides significant performance improvements with negligible accuracy loss, achieving 74% GPU speedup on Softmax of LLaMA and 10x low overhead performance improvement over SOTA designs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data-intensive computing tasks, such as training neural networks, are crucial for artificial intelligence applications but often come with high energy demands. One promising solution is to develop specialized hardware that directly maps neural networks, utilizing arrays of memristive devices to perform parallel multiply-accumulate operations. In our research, we introduce a novel CMOS-based memcapacitor circuit that is validated using the cadence tool. Additionally, we developed the device in Python to facilitate the design of a memcapacitive-based accelerator. Our proposed framework employs a crossbar array of memcapacitor devices to train a neural network capable of digit classification and CIFAR dataset recognition. We tested the non-ideal characteristics of the constructed memcapacitor-based neural network. The system achieved an impressive 98.4% training accuracy in digit recognition and 94.4% training accuracy in CIFAR recognition, highlighting its effectiveness. This study demonstrates the potential of memcapacitor-based neural network systems in handling classification tasks and sets the stage for further advancements in neuromorphic computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamer Ali Yuksel, Hassan Sawaf</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial metrics like the Sharpe ratio are pivotal in evaluating investment performance by balancing risk and return. However, traditional metrics often struggle with robustness and generalization, particularly in dynamic and volatile market conditions. This paper introduces AlphaSharpe, a novel framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively evolve and optimize financial metrics to discover enhanced risk-return metrics that outperform traditional approaches in robustness and correlation with future performance metrics by employing iterative crossover, mutation, and evaluation. Key contributions of this work include: (1) a novel use of LLMs to generate and refine financial metrics with implicit domain-specific knowledge, (2) a scoring mechanism to ensure that evolved metrics generalize effectively to unseen data, and (3) an empirical demonstration of 3x predictive power for future risk-returns, and 2x portfolio performance. Experimental results in a real-world dataset highlight the superiority of discovered metrics, making them highly relevant to portfolio managers and financial decision-makers. This framework not only addresses the limitations of existing metrics but also showcases the potential of LLMs in advancing financial analytics, paving the way for informed and robust investment strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly accelerating largely thanks to their integration with external tools. Querying databases is among the most effective of these integrations, enabling LLMs to access private or continually updating data. While Function Calling is the most common method for interfacing external tools to LLMs, its application to database querying as a tool has been underexplored. We propose a tool definition for database querying that unifies accessing data with search queries, filters, or a combination both, as well as transforming results with aggregation and groupby operators. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct a study with 8 LLMs spanning 5 model families. We present a novel pipeline adapting the Gorilla LLM framework to create synthetic database schemas and queries. We primarily evaluate the models with the Exact Match of predicted and ground truth query APIs. Among the models tested, Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest performance with an Exact Match score of 74.3%, followed by GPT-4o mini at 73.7%, and GPT-4o at 71.8%. We further breakdown these results per API component utilized and across synthetic use cases. We find that LLMs are highly effective at utilizing operators on boolean properties, but struggle with text property filters. Across use cases we find robust results with the higher performing models such as GPT-4o, but significant performance variance across use cases from lower performing models. We additionally conduct ablation studies exploring the impact of parallel tool calling, adding a rationale as an argument of the tool call, using a separate tool per database collection, and tool calling with structured outputs. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of enabling LLMs to query databases with Function Calling. We have open-sourced our experimental code and results at github.com/weaviate/gorilla.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Lautenbacher, Ali Rajaei, Davide Barbieri, Jan Viebahn, Jochen L. Cremer</p>
<p>Abstract: Transmission grid congestion increases as the electrification of various sectors requires transmitting more power. Topology control, through substation reconfiguration, can reduce congestion but its potential remains under-exploited in operations. A challenge is modeling the topology control problem to align well with the objectives and constraints of operators. Addressing this challenge, this paper investigates the application of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) to integrate multiple conflicting objectives for power grid topology control. We develop a MORL approach using deep optimistic linear support (DOL) and multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MOPPO) to generate a set of Pareto-optimal policies that balance objectives such as minimizing line loading, topological deviation, and switching frequency. Initial case studies show that the MORL approach can provide valuable insights into objective trade-offs and improve Pareto front approximation compared to a random search baseline. The generated multi-objective RL policies are 30% more successful in preventing grid failure under contingencies and 20% more effective when training budget is reduced - compared to the common single objective RL policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Lyu, Yanyong Guo, Pan Liu, Nan Zheng, Ting Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of connected automated vehicle (CAV) is advocated to mitigate traffic oscillations in mixed traffic flow consisting of CAVs and human driven vehicles (HDVs). This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) for regulating mixed traffic flow. Firstly, a Koopman theory-based adaptive trajectory prediction deep network (AdapKoopnet) is designed for modeling HDVs car-following behavior. AdapKoopnet enables the representation of HDVs behavior by a linear model in a high-dimensional space. Secondly, the model predictive control is employed to smooth the mixed traffic flow, where the combination of the linear dynamic model of CAVs and linear prediction blocks from AdapKoopnet is embedded as the predictive model into the AdapKoopPC. Finally, the predictive performance of the prosed AdapKoopnet is verified using the HighD naturalistic driving dataset. Furthermore, the control performance of AdapKoopPC is validated by the numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that the AdapKoopnet provides more accuracy HDVs predicted trajectories than the baseline nonlinear models. Moreover, the proposed AdapKoopPC exhibits more effective control performance with less computation cost compared with baselines in mitigating traffic oscillations, especially at the low CAVs penetration rates. The code of proposed AdapKoopPC is open source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Mao, Andrew Perrault</p>
<p>Abstract: Municipal inspections are an important part of maintaining the quality of goods and services. In this paper, we approach the problem of intelligently scheduling service inspections to maximize their impact, using the case of food establishment inspections in Chicago as a case study. The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) inspects thousands of establishments each year, with a substantial fail rate (over 3,000 failed inspection reports in 2023). To balance the objectives of ensuring adherence to guidelines, minimizing disruption to establishments, and minimizing inspection costs, CDPH assigns each establishment an inspection window every year and guarantees that they will be inspected exactly once during that window. These constraints create a challenge for a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) approach, for which there are no existing methods. We develop an extension to Whittle index-based systems for RMABs that can guarantee action window constraints and frequencies, and furthermore can be leveraged to optimize action window assignments themselves. Briefly, we combine MDP reformulation and integer programming-based lookahead to maximize the impact of inspections subject to constraints. A neural network-based supervised learning model is developed to model state transitions of real Chicago establishments using public CDPH inspection records, which demonstrates 10\% AUC improvements compared with directly predicting establishments' failures. Our experiments not only show up to 24\% (in simulation) or 33\% (on real data) reward improvements resulting from our approach but also give insight into the impact of scheduling constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Colin Sisate, Alistair Goldfinch, Vincent Waterstone, Sebastian Kingsley, Mariana Blackthorn</p>
<p>Abstract: Contextually Entangled Gradient Mapping (CEGM) introduces a new approach to gradient optimization, redefining the relationship between contextual embeddings and gradient updates to enhance semantic coherence and reasoning capabilities in neural architectures. By treating gradients as dynamic carriers of contextual dependencies rather than isolated numerical entities, the proposed methodology bridges critical gaps in existing optimization strategies. The integration of entangled gradient dynamics into a loss regularization framework demonstrated significant improvements in tasks involving long-form reasoning, contextual retention, and adaptability to unseen domains. Experimental evaluations showed that the CEGM-enhanced model consistently outperformed baseline approaches, achieving higher accuracy in token-level predictions and greater resilience to noisy inputs. Practical implementations involved modifications to training pipelines, introducing entanglement layers and dynamic coefficient adjustments that seamlessly align with existing architectures. Results further highlighted reductions in semantic drift during sequential transformations and improvements in embedding coherence across paraphrased sentences, showing the robustness and versatility of the proposed methodology. The findings demonstrate the broader implications of gradient entanglement for both theoretical advancements and practical applications in optimization strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work studies the relationship between Contrastive Learning and Domain Adaptation from a theoretical perspective. The two standard contrastive losses, NT-Xent loss (Self-supervised) and Supervised Contrastive loss, are related to the Class-wise Mean Maximum Discrepancy (CMMD), a dissimilarity measure widely used for Domain Adaptation. Our work shows that minimizing the contrastive losses decreases the CMMD and simultaneously improves class-separability, laying the theoretical groundwork for the use of Contrastive Learning in the context of Domain Adaptation. Due to the relevance of Domain Adaptation in medical imaging, we focused the experiments on mammography images. Extensive experiments on three mammography datasets - synthetic patches, clinical (real) patches, and clinical (real) images - show improved Domain Adaptation, class-separability, and classification performance, when minimizing the Supervised Contrastive loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ljubisa Bojic, Zorica Dodevska, Yashar Deldjoo, Nenad Pantelic</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the exponential advancement in AI technologies and the potential escalation of harmful effects from recommendation systems, it is crucial to simulate and evaluate these effects early on. Doing so can help prevent possible damage to both societies and technology companies. This paper introduces the Recommender Systems LLMs Playground (RecSysLLMsP), a novel simulation framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the impacts of different content recommendation setups on user engagement and polarization in social networks. By creating diverse AI agents (AgentPrompts) with descriptive, static, and dynamic attributes, we assess their autonomous behaviour across three scenarios: Plurality, Balanced, and Similarity. Our findings reveal that the Similarity Scenario, which aligns content with user preferences, maximizes engagement while potentially fostering echo chambers. Conversely, the Plurality Scenario promotes diverse interactions but produces mixed engagement results. Our study emphasizes the need for a careful balance in recommender system designs to enhance user satisfaction while mitigating societal polarization. It underscores the unique value and challenges of incorporating LLMs into simulation environments. The benefits of RecSysLLMsP lie in its potential to calculate polarization effects, which is crucial for assessing societal impacts and determining user engagement levels with diverse recommender system setups. This advantage is essential for developing and maintaining a successful business model for social media companies. However, the study's limitations revolve around accurately emulating reality. Future efforts should validate the similarity in behaviour between real humans and AgentPrompts and establish metrics for measuring polarization scores.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively applied in time series analysis. Yet, their utility in the few-shot classification (i.e., a crucial training scenario due to the limited training data available in industrial applications) concerning multivariate time series data remains underexplored. We aim to leverage the extensive pre-trained knowledge in LLMs to overcome the data scarcity problem within multivariate time series. Specifically, we propose LLMFew, an LLM-enhanced framework to investigate the feasibility and capacity of LLMs for few-shot multivariate time series classification. This model introduces a Patch-wise Temporal Convolution Encoder (PTCEnc) to align time series data with the textual embedding input of LLMs. We further fine-tune the pre-trained LLM decoder with Low-rank Adaptations (LoRA) to enhance its feature representation learning ability in time series data. Experimental results show that our model outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin, achieving 125.2% and 50.2% improvement in classification accuracy on Handwriting and EthanolConcentration datasets, respectively. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that LLM-based methods perform well across a variety of datasets in few-shot MTSC, delivering reliable results compared to traditional models. This success paves the way for their deployment in industrial environments where data are limited.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Despoina Antonakaki, Sotiris Ioannidis</p>
<p>Abstract: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict started on 7 October 2023, have resulted thus far to over 48,000 people killed including more than 17,000 children with a majority from Gaza, more than 30,000 people injured, over 10,000 missing, and over 1 million people displaced, fleeing conflict zones. The infrastructure damage includes the 87\% of housing units, 80\% of public buildings and 60\% of cropland 17 out of 36 hospitals, 68\% of road networks and 87\% of school buildings damaged. This conflict has as well launched an online discussion across various social media platforms. Telegram was no exception due to its encrypted communication and highly involved audience. The current study will cover an analysis of the related discussion in relation to different participants of the conflict and sentiment represented in those discussion. To this end, we prepared a dataset of 125K messages shared on channels in Telegram spanning from 23 October 2025 until today. Additionally, we apply the same analysis in two publicly available datasets from Twitter containing 2001 tweets and from Reddit containing 2M opinions. We apply a volume analysis across the three datasets, entity extraction and then proceed to BERT topic analysis in order to extract common themes or topics. Next, we apply sentiment analysis to analyze the emotional tone of the discussions. Our findings hint at polarized narratives as the hallmark of how political factions and outsiders mold public opinion. We also analyze the sentiment-topic prevalence relationship, detailing the trends that may show manipulation and attempts of propaganda by the involved parties. This will give a better understanding of the online discourse on the Israel-Palestine conflict and contribute to the knowledge on the dynamics of social media communication during geopolitical crises.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Fu, Yuzhe Zhang, Yanfeng Shu, Ming Ding, Lina Yao, Chen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) microbes are a growing challenge in healthcare, rendering modern medicines ineffective. AMR arises from antibiotic production and bacterial evolution, but quantifying its transmission remains difficult. With increasing AMR-related data, data-driven methods offer promising insights into its causes and treatments. This paper reviews AMR research from a data analytics and machine learning perspective, summarizing the state-of-the-art and exploring key areas such as surveillance, prediction, drug discovery, stewardship, and driver analysis. It discusses data sources, methods, and challenges, emphasizing standardization and interoperability. Additionally, it surveys statistical and machine learning techniques for AMR analysis, addressing issues like data noise and bias. Strategies for denoising and debiasing are highlighted to enhance fairness and robustness in AMR research. The paper underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and awareness of data challenges in advancing AMR research, pointing to future directions for innovation and improved methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malak Mohamed, Rokaia Emad, Ali Hamdi</p>
<p>Abstract: Social telehealth has revolutionized healthcare by enabling patients to share symptoms and receive medical consultations remotely. Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms, generating a vast repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease classification and symptom severity assessment. Large language models (LLMs), such as LLAMA3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and BERT, process complex medical data to enhance disease classification. This study explores three Arabic medical text preprocessing techniques: text summarization, text refinement, and Named Entity Recognition (NER). Evaluating CAMeL-BERT, AraBERT, and Asafaya-BERT with LoRA, the best performance was achieved using CAMeL-BERT with NER-augmented text (83% type classification, 69% severity assessment). Non-fine-tuned models performed poorly (13%-20% type classification, 40%-49% severity assessment). Integrating LLMs into social telehealth systems enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Marlin, Raja Jurdak, Alsharif Abuadbba, Dimity Miller</p>
<p>Abstract: By 2050, electric vehicles (EVs) are projected to account for 70% of global vehicle sales. While EVs provide environmental benefits, they also pose challenges for energy generation, grid infrastructure, and data privacy. Current research on EV routing and charge management often overlooks privacy when predicting energy demands, leaving sensitive mobility data vulnerable. To address this, we developed a Federated Learning Transformer Network (FLTN) to predict EVs' next charge location with enhanced privacy measures. Each EV operates as a client, training an onboard FLTN model that shares only model weights, not raw data with a community-based Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS), which aggregates them into a community global model. To further enhance privacy, non-transitory EVs use peer-to-peer weight sharing and augmentation within their community, obfuscating individual contributions and improving model accuracy. Community DERMS global model weights are then redistributed to EVs for continuous training. Our FLTN approach achieved up to 92% accuracy while preserving data privacy, compared to our baseline centralised model, which achieved 98% accuracy with no data privacy. Simulations conducted across diverse charge levels confirm the FLTN's ability to forecast energy demands over extended periods. We present a privacy-focused solution for forecasting EV charge location prediction, effectively mitigating data leakage risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pat Pataranutaporn, Nattavudh Powdthavee, Pattie Maes</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate whether artificial intelligence can address the peer review crisis in economics by analyzing 27,090 evaluations of 9,030 unique submissions using a large language model (LLM). The experiment systematically varies author characteristics (e.g., affiliation, reputation, gender) and publication quality (e.g., top-tier, mid-tier, low-tier, AI generated papers). The results indicate that LLMs effectively distinguish paper quality but exhibit biases favoring prominent institutions, male authors, and renowned economists. Additionally, LLMs struggle to differentiate high-quality AI-generated papers from genuine top-tier submissions. While LLMs offer efficiency gains, their susceptibility to bias necessitates cautious integration and hybrid peer review models to balance equity and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamil\.e Luko\v{s}i\=ut\.e, Adam Swanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are demonstrating increasing prowess in cybersecurity applications, creating creating inherent risks alongside their potential for strengthening defenses. In this position paper, we argue that current efforts to evaluate risks posed by these capabilities are misaligned with the goal of understanding real-world impact. Evaluating LLM cybersecurity risk requires more than just measuring model capabilities -- it demands a comprehensive risk assessment that incorporates analysis of threat actor adoption behavior and potential for impact. We propose a risk assessment framework for LLM cyber capabilities and apply it to a case study of language models used as cybersecurity assistants. Our evaluation of frontier models reveals high compliance rates but moderate accuracy on realistic cyber assistance tasks. However, our framework suggests that this particular use case presents only moderate risk due to limited operational advantages and impact potential. Based on these findings, we recommend several improvements to align research priorities with real-world impact assessment, including closer academia-industry collaboration, more realistic modeling of attacker behavior, and inclusion of economic metrics in evaluations. This work represents an important step toward more effective assessment and mitigation of LLM-enabled cybersecurity risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong-Hee Paek, Seung-Hyun Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 4D Radar has emerged as a crucial sensor for 3D object detection in autonomous vehicles, offering both stable perception in adverse weather and high-density point clouds for object shape recognition. However, processing such high-density data demands substantial computational resources and energy consumption. We propose SpikingRTNH, the first spiking neural network (SNN) for 3D object detection using 4D Radar data. By replacing conventional ReLU activation functions with leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons, SpikingRTNH achieves significant energy efficiency gains. Furthermore, inspired by human cognitive processes, we introduce biological top-down inference (BTI), which processes point clouds sequentially from higher to lower densities. This approach effectively utilizes points with lower noise and higher importance for detection. Experiments on K-Radar dataset demonstrate that SpikingRTNH with BTI significantly reduces energy consumption by 78% while achieving comparable detection performance to its ANN counterpart (51.1% AP 3D, 57.0% AP BEV). These results establish the viability of SNNs for energy-efficient 4D Radar-based object detection in autonomous driving systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bidossessi Emmanuel Agossou, Marius Pedersen, Kiran Raja, Anuja Vats, P{\aa}l Anders Floor</p>
<p>Abstract: Pathology detection in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) using deep learning has been explored in the recent past. However, deep learning models can be influenced by the color quality of the dataset used to train them, impacting detection, segmentation and classification tasks. In this work, we evaluate the impact of color correction on pathology detection using two prominent object detection models: Retinanet and YOLOv5. We first generate two color corrected versions of a popular WCE dataset (i.e., SEE-AI dataset) using two different color correction functions. We then evaluate the performance of the Retinanet and YOLOv5 on the original and color corrected versions of the dataset. The results reveal that color correction makes the models generate larger bounding boxes and larger intersection areas with the ground truth annotations. Furthermore, color correction leads to an increased number of false positives for certain pathologies. However, these effects do not translate into a consistent improvement in performance metrics such as F1-scores, IoU, and AP50. The code is available at https://github.com/agossouema2011/WCE2024.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinghao Li, Vianne Gao, Chao Zhang, MohamadAli Torkamani</p>
<p>Abstract: The training and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often involve diverse textual data from multiple sources, which poses challenges due to conflicting gradient directions, hindering optimization and specialization. These challenges can undermine model generalization across tasks, resulting in reduced downstream performance. Recent research suggests that fine-tuning LLMs on carefully selected, task-specific subsets of data can match or even surpass the performance of using the entire dataset. Building on these insights, we propose the Ensembles of Low-Rank Expert Adapters (ELREA) framework to improve the model's capability to handle diverse tasks. ELREA clusters the training instructions based on their gradient directions, representing different areas of expertise and thereby reducing conflicts during optimization. Expert adapters are then trained on these clusters, utilizing the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique to ensure training efficiency and model scalability. During inference, ELREA combines predictions from the most relevant expert adapters based on the input data's gradient similarity to the training clusters, ensuring optimal adapter selection for each task. Experiments show that our method outperforms baseline LoRA adapters trained on the full dataset and other ensemble approaches with similar training and inference complexity across a range of domain-specific tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Amid the swift progress of large language models (LLMs) and their evolution into large multimodal models (LMMs), significant strides have been made in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. While Arabic LLMs have seen notable progress, Arabic LMMs remain largely unexplored, often narrowly focusing on a few specific aspects of the language and visual understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIN-the Arabic Inclusive Multimodal Model-designed to excel across diverse domains. AIN is an English-Arabic bilingual LMM designed to excel in English and Arabic, leveraging carefully constructed 3.6 million high-quality Arabic-English multimodal data samples. AIN demonstrates state-of-the-art Arabic performance, while also possessing strong English-language visual capabilities. On the recent CAMEL-Bench benchmark comprising 38 sub-domains including, multi-image understanding, complex visual perception, handwritten document understanding, video understanding, medical imaging, plant diseases, and remote sensing-based land use understanding, our AIN demonstrates strong performance with the 7B model outperforming GPT-4o by an absolute gain of 3.4% averaged over eight domains and 38 sub-domains. AIN's superior capabilities position it as a significant step toward empowering Arabic speakers with advanced multimodal generative AI tools across diverse applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong performance in objection tasks; however, their ability to learn domain-specific applications with limited training data remains a significant challenge. Transfer learning techniques address this issue by leveraging knowledge from pre-training on related datasets, enabling faster and more efficient learning for new tasks. Finding the right dataset for pre-training can play a critical role in determining the success of transfer learning and overall model performance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of pre-training a YOLOv8n model on seven distinct datasets, evaluating their effectiveness when transferred to the task of polyp detection. We compare whether large, general-purpose datasets with diverse objects outperform niche datasets with characteristics similar to polyps. In addition, we assess the influence of the size of the dataset on the efficacy of transfer learning. Experiments on the polyp datasets show that models pre-trained on relevant datasets consistently outperform those trained from scratch, highlighting the benefit of pre-training on datasets with shared domain-specific features.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a three-branch checks-and-balances framework for ethical alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), inspired by governmental systems. It implements three independent yet interacting components: LLMs as the executive branch for knowledge generation, DIKE as the legislative branch establishing ethical guardrails, and ERIS as the judicial branch for contextual interpretation. The adversarial DIKE-ERIS duality enables adaptation to diverse cultural contexts while upholding consistent ethical principles. This architecture addresses limitations of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) by providing interpretable, adaptable, and culturally-aware ethical reasoning. Through self-supervised learning and adversarial testing, our framework demonstrates how emotional modeling can guide linguistic behaviors toward ethical outcomes while preserving independence across knowledge generation, ethical oversight, and contextual interpretation.</p>

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of GNN behavior through three fundamental aspects: (1) we establish that \textbf{$k$-layer} Message Passing Neural Networks efficiently aggregate \textbf{$k$-hop} neighborhood information through iterative computation, (2) analyze how different loop structures influence neighborhood computation, and (3) examine behavior across structure-feature hybrid and structure-only tasks. For deeper GNNs, we demonstrate that gradient-related issues, rather than just over-smoothing, can significantly impact performance in sparse graphs. We also analyze how different normalization schemes affect model performance and how GNNs make predictions with uniform node features, providing a theoretical framework that bridges the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-biopsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to target suspicious prostate lesions. This has led to artificial intelligence (AI) applications improving MRI-based detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (CsPCa). However, MRI-detected lesions must still be mapped to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images during biopsy, which results in missing CsPCa. This study systematically evaluates a multimodal AI framework integrating MRI and TRUS image sequences to enhance CsPCa identification. The study included 3110 patients from three cohorts across two institutions who underwent prostate biopsy. The proposed framework, based on the 3D UNet architecture, was evaluated on 1700 test cases, comparing performance to unimodal AI models that use either MRI or TRUS alone. Additionally, the proposed model was compared to radiologists in a cohort of 110 patients. The multimodal AI approach achieved superior sensitivity (80%) and Lesion Dice (42%) compared to unimodal MRI (73%, 30%) and TRUS models (49%, 27%). Compared to radiologists, the multimodal model showed higher specificity (88% vs. 78%) and Lesion Dice (38% vs. 33%), with equivalent sensitivity (79%). Our findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal AI to improve CsPCa lesion targeting during biopsy and treatment planning, surpassing current unimodal models and radiologists; ultimately improving outcomes for prostate cancer patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungwon Seo, Ferhat Ozgur Catak, Chunming Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: As privacy concerns and data regulations grow, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources without sharing raw data. However, a significant challenge in FL is that client data are often non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed), leading to reduced performance compared to centralized learning. While many methods have been proposed to address this issue, their underlying mechanisms are often viewed from different perspectives. Through a comprehensive investigation from gradient descent to FL, and from IID to non-IID data settings, we find that inconsistencies in client loss landscapes primarily cause performance degradation in non-IID scenarios. From this understanding, we observe that existing methods can be grouped into two main strategies: (i) adjusting parameter update paths and (ii) modifying client loss landscapes. These findings offer a clear perspective on addressing non-IID challenges in FL and help guide future research in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Althaf Shajihan, Kirill Mechitov, Girish Chowdhary, Billie F. Spencer Jr</p>
<p>Abstract: Railroad bridges are a crucial component of the U.S. freight rail system, which moves over 40 percent of the nation's freight and plays a critical role in the economy. However, aging bridge infrastructure and increasing train traffic pose significant safety hazards and risk service disruptions. The U.S. rail network includes over 100,000 railroad bridges, averaging one every 1.4 miles of track, with steel bridges comprising over 50% of the network's total bridge length. Early identification and assessment of damage in these bridges remain challenging tasks. This study proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN) based approach for damage identification in steel truss railroad bridges. The proposed approach employs an unsupervised learning approach, eliminating the need for large datasets typically required by supervised methods. The approach utilizes train wheel load data and bridge response during train crossing events as inputs for damage identification. The PINN model explicitly incorporates the governing differential equations of the linear time-varying (LTV) bridge-train system. Herein, this model employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) based architecture incorporating a custom Runge-Kutta (RK) integrator cell, designed for gradient-based learning. The proposed approach updates the bridge finite element model while also quantifying damage severity and localizing the affected structural members. A case study on the Calumet Bridge in Chicago, Illinois, with simulated damage scenarios, is used to demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying damage while maintaining low false-positive rates. Furthermore, the damage identification pipeline is designed to seamlessly integrate prior knowledge from inspections and drone surveys, also enabling context-aware updating and assessment of bridge's condition.</p>

<p>Abstract: A major barrier to developing vision large language models (LLMs) in dermatology is the lack of large image--text pairs dataset. We introduce DermaSynth, a dataset comprising of 92,020 synthetic image--text pairs curated from 45,205 images (13,568 clinical and 35,561 dermatoscopic) for dermatology-related clinical tasks. Leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs, using Gemini 2.0, we used clinically related prompts and self-instruct method to generate diverse and rich synthetic texts. Metadata of the datasets were incorporated into the input prompts by targeting to reduce potential hallucinations. The resulting dataset builds upon open access dermatological image repositories (DERM12345, BCN20000, PAD-UFES-20, SCIN, and HIBA) that have permissive CC-BY-4.0 licenses. We also fine-tuned a preliminary Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct model, DermatoLlama 1.0, on 5,000 samples. We anticipate this dataset to support and accelerate AI research in dermatology.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar H. Khater, Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui, M. Shamim Hossain</p>
<p>Abstract: Sustainable agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring world food security for consumers. A critical challenge faced by sustainable precision agriculture is weed growth, as weeds share essential resources with the crops, such as water, soil nutrients, and sunlight, which notably affect crop yields. The traditional methods employed to combat weeds include the usage of chemical herbicides and manual weed removal methods. However, these could damage the environment and pose health hazards. The adoption of automated computer vision technologies and ground agricultural consumer electronic vehicles in precision agriculture offers sustainable, low-carbon solutions. However, prior works suffer from issues such as low accuracy and precision and high computational expense. This work proposes EcoWeedNet, a novel model with enhanced weed detection performance without adding significant computational complexity, aligning with the goals of low-carbon agricultural practices. Additionally, our model is lightweight and optimal for deployment on ground-based consumer electronic agricultural vehicles and robots. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the CottonWeedDet12 benchmark dataset reflecting real-world scenarios. EcoWeedNet achieves performance close to that of large models yet with much fewer parameters. (approximately 4.21% of the parameters and 6.59% of the GFLOPs of YOLOv4). This work contributes effectively to the development of automated weed detection methods for next-generation agricultural consumer electronics featuring lower energy consumption and lower carbon footprint. This work paves the way forward for sustainable agricultural consumer technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kefan Dong, Tengyu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental challenge in formal theorem proving by LLMs is the lack of high-quality training data. Although reinforcement learning or expert iteration partially mitigates this issue by alternating between LLM generating proofs and finetuning them on correctly generated ones, performance quickly plateaus due to the scarcity of correct proofs (sparse rewards). To keep improving the models with limited data, we draw inspiration from mathematicians, who continuously develop new results, partly by proposing novel conjectures or exercises (which are often variants of known results) and attempting to solve them. We design the Self-play Theorem Prover (STP) that simultaneously takes on two roles, conjecturer and prover, each providing training signals to the other. The conjecturer is trained iteratively on previously generated conjectures that are barely provable by the current prover, which incentivizes it to generate increasingly challenging conjectures over time. The prover attempts to prove the conjectures with standard expert iteration. We evaluate STP with both Lean and Isabelle formal versifiers. With 19.8 billion tokens generated during the training in Lean, STP proves 26.3% of the statements in the LeanWorkbook dataset, doubling the previous best result of 13.2% achieved through expert iteration. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance among whole-proof generation methods on miniF2F-test (61.1%, pass@3200), Proofnet-test (23.1%, pass@3200) and PutnamBench (8/644, pass@64).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akiyoshi Tomihari, Issei Sato</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer models are challenging to optimize with SGD and typically require adaptive optimizers such as Adam. However, the reasons behind the superior performance of Adam over SGD remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the optimization of transformer models by focusing on \emph{gradient heterogeneity}, defined as the disparity in gradient norms among parameters. Our analysis shows that gradient heterogeneity hinders gradient-based optimization, including SGD, while sign-based optimization, a simplified variant of Adam, is less affected. We further examine gradient heterogeneity in transformer models and show that it is influenced by the placement of layer normalization. Additionally, we show that the momentum term in sign-based optimization is important for preventing the excessive growth of linear-head parameters in tasks with many classes. Experimental results from fine-tuning transformer models in both NLP and vision domains validate our theoretical analyses. This study provides insights into the optimization challenges of transformer models and offers guidance for designing future optimization algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Negar Hassanpour, Muhammad Kamran Janjua, Kunlin Zhang, Sepehr Lavasani, Xiaowen Zhang, Chunhua Zhou, Chao Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Balancing competing objectives remains a fundamental challenge in multi-task learning (MTL), primarily due to conflicting gradients across individual tasks. A common solution relies on computing a dynamic gradient update vector that balances competing tasks as optimization progresses. Building on this idea, we propose ConicGrad, a principled, scalable, and robust MTL approach formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces an angular constraint to dynamically regulate gradient update directions, confining them within a cone centered on the reference gradient of the overall objective. By balancing task-specific gradients without over-constraining their direction or magnitude, ConicGrad effectively resolves inter-task gradient conflicts. Moreover, our framework ensures computational efficiency and scalability to high-dimensional parameter spaces. We conduct extensive experiments on standard supervised learning and reinforcement learning MTL benchmarks, and demonstrate that ConicGrad achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We evaluate the ability of the current generation of large language models (LLMs) to help a decision-making agent facing an exploration-exploitation tradeoff. We use LLMs to explore and exploit in silos in various (contextual) bandit tasks. We find that while the current LLMs often struggle to exploit, in-context mitigations may be used to substantially improve performance for small-scale tasks. However even then, LLMs perform worse than a simple linear regression. On the other hand, we find that LLMs do help at exploring large action spaces with inherent semantics, by suggesting suitable candidates to explore.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Nickzamir, Seyed Mohammad Sheikh Ahamdi Gandab</p>
<p>Abstract: A novel hybrid Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework is presented for oil-water classification in hyperspectral images (HSI). To address the challenge of preserving spatial context, the images were divided into smaller, non-overlapping tiles, which served as the basis for training, validation, and testing. Random Forest demonstrated strong performance in pixel-wise classification, outperforming models such as XGBoost, Attention-Based U-Net, and HybridSN. However, Random Forest loses spatial context, limiting its ability to fully exploit the spatial relationships in hyperspectral data. To improve performance, a CNN was trained on the probability maps generated by the Random Forest, leveraging the CNN's capacity to incorporate spatial context. The hybrid approach achieved 7.6% improvement in recall (to 0.85), 2.4% improvement in F1 score (to 0.84), and 0.54% improvement in AUC (to 0.99) compared to the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining probabilistic outputs with spatial feature learning for context-aware analysis of hyperspectral images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi He, Insu Jang, Mosharaf Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Incorporating multiple modalities into large language models (LLMs) is a powerful way to enhance their understanding of non-textual data, enabling them to perform multimodal tasks. Vision language models (VLMs) form the fastest growing category of multimodal models because of their many practical use cases, including in healthcare, robotics, and accessibility. Unfortunately, even though different VLMs in the literature demonstrate impressive visual capabilities in different benchmarks, they are handcrafted by human experts; there is no automated framework to create task-specific multimodal models.
  We introduce Mordal, an automated multimodal model search framework that efficiently finds the best VLM for a user-defined task without manual intervention. Mordal achieves this both by reducing the number of candidates to consider during the search process and by minimizing the time required to evaluate each remaining candidate. Our evaluation shows that Mordal can find the best VLM for a given problem using up to $8.9\times$--$11.6\times$ lower GPU hours than grid search. In the process of our evaluation, we have also discovered new VLMs that outperform their state-of-the-art counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianwei Chen, Zifan Zhang, Yuchen Liu, Xianfeng Terry Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in handling unpredictable edge-case scenarios, such as adversarial pedestrian movements, dangerous vehicle maneuvers, and sudden environmental changes. Current end-to-end driving models struggle with generalization to these rare events due to limitations in traditional detection and prediction approaches. To address this, we propose INSIGHT (Integration of Semantic and Visual Inputs for Generalized Hazard Tracking), a hierarchical vision-language model (VLM) framework designed to enhance hazard detection and edge-case evaluation. By using multimodal data fusion, our approach integrates semantic and visual representations, enabling precise interpretation of driving scenarios and accurate forecasting of potential dangers. Through supervised fine-tuning of VLMs, we optimize spatial hazard localization using attention-based mechanisms and coordinate regression techniques. Experimental results on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate a substantial improvement in hazard prediction straightforwardness and accuracy over existing models, achieving a notable increase in generalization performance. This advancement enhances the robustness and safety of autonomous driving systems, ensuring improved situational awareness and potential decision-making in complex real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiliang Chen, Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of a machine learning (ML) model depends heavily on the relevance of its training data to the domain of the downstream evaluation task. However, in practice, the data involved in an unseen evaluation task is often not known to us (e.g., conversations between an LLM and a user are end-to-end encrypted). So, it is not obvious what data would be relevant for training/fine-tuning the ML model to maximize its task performance. Instead, one can only deploy the ML model in the unseen evaluation task to gather multiple rounds of coarse feedback on how well the model has performed. This paper presents a novel global-to-local algorithm called DUET that can exploit the feedback loop by interleaving a data selection method with Bayesian optimization. As a result, DUET can efficiently refine the training data mixture from a pool of data domains to maximize the model's performance on the unseen evaluation task and its convergence to the optimal data mixture can be theoretically guaranteed by analyzing its cumulative regret. Empirical evaluation on image and LLM evaluation tasks shows that DUET finds better training data mixtures than conventional baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanqi Yan, Huy Nguyen, Pedram Akbarian, Nhat Ho, Alessandro Rinaldo</p>
<p>Abstract: At the core of the popular Transformer architecture is the self-attention mechanism, which dynamically assigns softmax weights to each input token so that the model can focus on the most salient information. However, the softmax structure slows down the attention computation due to its row-wise nature, and inherently introduces competition among tokens: as the weight assigned to one token increases, the weights of others decrease. This competitive dynamic may narrow the focus of self-attention to a limited set of features, potentially overlooking other informative characteristics. Recent experimental studies have shown that using the element-wise sigmoid function helps eliminate token competition and reduce the computational overhead. Despite these promising empirical results, a rigorous comparison between sigmoid and softmax self-attention mechanisms remains absent in the literature. This paper closes this gap by theoretically demonstrating that sigmoid self-attention is more sample-efficient than its softmax counterpart. Toward that goal, we illustrate that each row of the self-attention matrix can be represented as a mixture of experts. Our analysis shows that ''experts'' in sigmoid self-attention require significantly less data to achieve the same approximation error as those in softmax self-attention. We corroborate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Ma, Jingdong Chen, Guangyu Wang, Changqing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen remarkable advancements and have been extensively integrated across various fields. Despite their progress, LLMs are prone to hallucinations, producing responses that may not be dependable if the models lack sufficient grounding knowledge. To mitigate this issue, methods for estimating uncertainty have been adopted, with a focus on critical tokens as indicators of reliability. Nevertheless, probability-based approaches have shown limitations in assessing token-level reliability due to the erosion of evidence strength information acquired during training. In this paper, we introduce Logits-induced Token Uncertainty (LogU), a novel framework designed to estimate token-specific uncertainty in LLMs in real time, without the need for multiple sampling rounds. By leveraging evidence modeling for the implementation of LogU, we utilize the derived uncertainty measures to steer downstream tasks. Our experimental findings highlight the substantial effectiveness and potential of LogU, marking a significant advancement in addressing the challenge of model hallucinations.</p>

<p>Abstract: How can we identify groups of primate individuals which could be conjectured to drive social structure? To address this question, one of us has collected a time series of data for social interactions between chimpanzees. Here we use a network representation, leading to the task of combining these data into a time series of a single weighted network per time stamp, where different proximities should be given different weights reflecting their relative importance. We optimize these proximity-type weights in a principled way, using an innovative loss function which rewards structural consistency across time. The approach is empirically validated by carefully designed synthetic data. Using statistical tests, we provide a way of identifying groups of individuals that stay related for a significant length of time. Applying the approach to the chimpanzee data set, we detect cliques in the animal social network time series, which can be validated by real-world intuition from prior research and qualitative observations by chimpanzee experts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constrained optimization demands highly efficient solvers which promotes the development of learn-to-optimize (L2O) approaches. As a data-driven method, L2O leverages neural networks to efficiently produce approximate solutions. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring both optimality and feasibility of neural networks' output. To tackle this issue, we introduce Homeomorphic Polar Learning (HoP) to solve the star-convex hard-constrained optimization by embedding homeomorphic mapping in neural networks. The bijective structure enables end-to-end training without extra penalty or correction. For performance evaluation, we evaluate HoP's performance across a variety of synthetic optimization tasks and real-world applications in wireless communications. In all cases, HoP achieves solutions closer to the optimum than existing L2O methods while strictly maintaining feasibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cold-start active learning (CSAL) selects valuable instances from an unlabeled dataset for manual annotation. It provides high-quality data at a low annotation cost for label-scarce text classification. However, existing CSAL methods overlook weak classes and hard representative examples, resulting in biased learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel dual-diversity enhancing and uncertainty-aware (DEUCE) framework for CSAL. Specifically, DEUCE leverages a pretrained language model (PLM) to efficiently extract textual representations, class predictions, and predictive uncertainty. Then, it constructs a Dual-Neighbor Graph (DNG) to combine information on both textual diversity and class diversity, ensuring a balanced data distribution. It further propagates uncertainty information via density-based clustering to select hard representative instances. DEUCE performs well in selecting class-balanced and hard representative data by dual-diversity and informativeness. Experiments on six NLP datasets demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of DEUCE.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate grounded responses by leveraging external knowledge databases without altering model parameters. Although the absence of weight tuning prevents leakage via model parameters, it introduces the risk of inference adversaries exploiting retrieved documents in the model's context. Existing methods for membership inference and data extraction often rely on jailbreaking or carefully crafted unnatural queries, which can be easily detected or thwarted with query rewriting techniques common in RAG systems. In this work, we present Interrogation Attack (IA), a membership inference technique targeting documents in the RAG datastore. By crafting natural-text queries that are answerable only with the target document's presence, our approach demonstrates successful inference with just 30 queries while remaining stealthy; straightforward detectors identify adversarial prompts from existing methods up to ~76x more frequently than those generated by our attack. We observe a 2x improvement in TPR@1%FPR over prior inference attacks across diverse RAG configurations, all while costing less than $0.02 per document inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of human-computer interaction and psychological assessment, speech emotion recognition (SER) plays an important role in deciphering emotional states from speech signals. Despite advancements, challenges persist due to system complexity, feature distinctiveness issues, and noise interference. This paper introduces a new end-to-end (E2E) deep learning multi-resolution framework for SER, addressing these limitations by extracting meaningful representations directly from raw waveform speech signals. By leveraging the properties of the fast discrete wavelet transform (FDWT), including the cascade algorithm, conjugate quadrature filter, and coefficient denoising, our approach introduces a learnable model for both wavelet bases and denoising through deep learning techniques. The framework incorporates an activation function for learnable asymmetric hard thresholding of wavelet coefficients. Our approach exploits the capabilities of wavelets for effective localization in both time and frequency domains. We then combine one-dimensional dilated convolutional neural networks (1D dilated CNN) with a spatial attention layer and bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU) with a temporal attention layer to efficiently capture the nuanced spatial and temporal characteristics of emotional features. By handling variable-length speech without segmentation and eliminating the need for pre or post-processing, the proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods on IEMOCAP and EMO-DB datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Hosseini, Samarth Khanna</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing interest in employing large language models (LLMs) for decision-making in social and economic contexts has raised questions about their potential to function as agents in these domains. A significant number of societal problems involve the distribution of resources, where fairness, along with economic efficiency, play a critical role in the desirability of outcomes. In this paper, we examine whether LLM responses adhere to fundamental fairness concepts such as equitability, envy-freeness, and Rawlsian maximin, and investigate their alignment with human preferences. We evaluate the performance of several LLMs, providing a comparative benchmark of their ability to reflect these measures. Our results demonstrate a lack of alignment between current LLM responses and human distributional preferences. Moreover, LLMs are unable to utilize money as a transferable resource to mitigate inequality. Nonetheless, we demonstrate a stark contrast when (some) LLMs are tasked with selecting from a predefined menu of options rather than generating one. In addition, we analyze the robustness of LLM responses to variations in semantic factors (e.g. intentions or personas) or non-semantic prompting changes (e.g. templates or orderings). Finally, we highlight potential strategies aimed at enhancing the alignment of LLM behavior with well-established fairness concepts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in recommendation systems, online searches, and advertising platforms, where accurately capturing users' real interests in content is essential for performance. However, existing methods heavily rely on ID embeddings, which fail to reflect users' true preferences for content such as images and titles. This limitation becomes particularly evident in cold-start and long-tail scenarios, where traditional approaches struggle to deliver effective results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-modal Content Interest Modeling paradigm (MIM), which consists of three key stages: Pre-training, Content-Interest-Aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (C-SFT), and Content-Interest-Aware UBM (CiUBM). The pre-training stage adapts foundational models to domain-specific data, enabling the extraction of high-quality multi-modal embeddings. The C-SFT stage bridges the semantic gap between content and user interests by leveraging user behavior signals to guide the alignment of embeddings with user preferences. Finally, the CiUBM stage integrates multi-modal embeddings and ID-based collaborative filtering signals into a unified framework. Comprehensive offline experiments and online A/B tests conducted on the Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of MIM method. The method has been successfully deployed online, achieving a significant increase of +14.14% in CTR and +4.12% in RPM, showcasing its industrial applicability and substantial impact on platform performance.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize data analytics by simplifying tasks such as data discovery and SQL query synthesis through natural language interactions. This work serves as a pivotal first step toward the development of foundation models explicitly designed for data analytics applications. To propel this vision forward, we unveil a new data recipe for post-training LLMs, enhancing their comprehension of data management and empowering them to tackle complex real-world analytics tasks. Specifically, our innovative approach includes a scalable synthetic data generation method that enables the creation of a broad spectrum of topics centered on data representation and manipulation. Furthermore, we introduce two new tasks that seamlessly bridge tables and text. We show that such tasks can enhance models' understanding of schema creation and the nuanced translation between natural language and tabular data. Leveraging this data recipe, we post-train a new foundation model, named CoddLLM, based on Mistral-NeMo-12B. To assess the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in the realm of data analytics, we contribute AnalyticsMMLU, a benchmark containing thousands of multiple-choice questions on databases, data analysis, and machine learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingchen Wan, Han Zhou, Ruoxi Sun, Hootan Nakhost, Ke Jiang, Sercan \"O. Ar{\i}k</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in long-context large language models (LLMs) have led to the emerging paradigm of many-shot in-context learning (ICL), where it is observed that scaling many more demonstrating examples beyond the conventional few-shot setup in the context can lead to performance benefits. However, despite its promise, it is unclear what aspects dominate the benefits and whether simply scaling to more examples is the most effective way of improving many-shot ICL. In this work, we first provide an analysis of the factors driving many-shot ICL, and we find that 1) many-shot performance can still be attributed to often a few disproportionately influential examples and 2) identifying such influential examples ("optimize") and using them as demonstrations to regenerate new examples ("generate") can lead to further improvements. Inspired by the findings, we propose BRIDGE, an algorithm that alternates between the optimize step with Bayesian optimization to discover the influential sets of examples and the generate step to reuse this set to expand the reasoning paths of the examples back to the many-shot regime automatically. On Gemini, Claude, and Mistral LLMs of different sizes, we show that BRIDGE to significant improvements across a diverse set of tasks, including symbolic reasoning, numerical reasoning, and code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Xu, Qiyun Xu, Tong Xiao, Tianhao Chen, Yuchen Yan, Jiaxin Zhang, Shizhe Diao, Can Yang, Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematics. However, the domain of physics reasoning presents unique challenges that have received significantly less attention. Existing benchmarks often fall short in evaluating LLMs' abilities on the breadth and depth of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for a comprehensive evaluation. To fill this gap, we introduce UGPhysics, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate UnderGraduate-level Physics (UGPhysics) reasoning with LLMs. UGPhysics includes 5,520 undergraduate-level physics problems in both English and Chinese, covering 13 subjects with seven different answer types and four distinct physics reasoning skills, all rigorously screened for data leakage. Additionally, we develop a Model-Assistant Rule-based Judgment (MARJ) pipeline specifically tailored for assessing answer correctness of physics problems, ensuring accurate evaluation. Our evaluation of 31 leading LLMs shows that the highest overall accuracy, 49.8% (achieved by OpenAI-o1-mini), emphasizes the necessity for models with stronger physics reasoning skills, beyond math abilities. We hope UGPhysics, along with MARJ, will drive future advancements in AI for physics reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yurui Li, Yuxuan Chen, Li Zhang, Shijian Li, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: The significant role of division of labor (DOL) in promoting cooperation is widely recognized in real-world applications.Many cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have incorporated the concept of DOL to improve cooperation among agents.However, the tasks used in existing testbeds typically correspond to tasks where DOL is often not a necessary feature for achieving optimal policies.Additionally, the full utilize of DOL concept in MARL methods remains unrealized due to the absence of appropriate tasks.To enhance the generality and applicability of MARL methods in real-world scenarios, there is a necessary to develop tasks that demand multi-agent DOL and cooperation.In this paper, we propose a series of tasks designed to meet these requirements, drawing on real-world rules as the guidance for their design.We guarantee that DOL and cooperation are necessary condition for completing tasks and introduce three factors to expand the diversity of proposed tasks to cover more realistic situations.We evaluate 10 cooperative MARL methods on the proposed tasks.The results indicate that all baselines perform poorly on these tasks.To further validate the solvability of these tasks, we also propose simplified variants of proposed tasks.Experimental results show that baselines are able to handle these simplified variants, providing evidence of the solvability of the proposed tasks.The source files is available at https://github.com/Yurui-Li/CTC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Mainul Abrar, Parvat Sapkota, Damon Sprouts, Xun Jia, Yujie Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Real-time treatment planning in IMRT is challenging due to complex beam interactions. AI has improved automation, but existing models require large, high-quality datasets and lack universal applicability. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by mimicking human trial-and-error planning.
  Purpose: Develop a stochastic policy-based DRL agent for automatic treatment planning with efficient training, broad applicability, and robustness against adversarial attacks using Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM).
  Methods: Using the Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER) architecture, the agent tunes treatment planning parameters (TPPs) in inverse planning. Training is based on prostate cancer IMRT cases, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as input. The model is trained on a single patient case, validated on two independent cases, and tested on 300+ plans across three datasets. Plan quality is assessed using ProKnow scores, and robustness is tested against adversarial attacks.
  Results: Despite training on a single case, the model generalizes well. Before ACER-based planning, the mean plan score was 6.20$\pm$1.84; after, 93.09% of cases achieved a perfect score of 9, with a mean of 8.93$\pm$0.27. The agent effectively prioritizes optimal TPP tuning and remains robust against adversarial attacks.
  Conclusions: The ACER-based DRL agent enables efficient, high-quality treatment planning in prostate cancer IMRT, demonstrating strong generalizability and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongming Yu, Hejia Zhang, Yujie Zhao, Hanxian Huang, Matrix Yao, Ke Ding, Jishen Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM) agents are revolutionizing Autonomous Software Engineering (ASE), enabling automated coding, problem fixes, and feature improvements. However, localization -- precisely identifying software problems by navigating to relevant code sections -- remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often yield suboptimal results due to a lack of effective integration between LLM agents and precise code search mechanisms. This paper introduces OrcaLoca, an LLM agent framework that improves accuracy for software issue localization by integrating priority-based scheduling for LLM-guided action, action decomposition with relevance scoring, and distance-aware context pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that OrcaLoca becomes the new open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) in function match rate (65.33%) on SWE-bench Lite. It also improves the final resolved rate of an open-source framework by 6.33 percentage points through its patch generation integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Liu, Zhilan Liu, Tien Ping Tan, Yuxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Social event detection (SED) is a task focused on identifying specific real-world events and has broad applications across various domains. It is integral to many mobile applications with social features, including major platforms like Twitter, Weibo, and Facebook. By enabling the analysis of social events, SED provides valuable insights for businesses to understand consumer preferences and supports public services in handling emergencies and disaster management. Due to the hierarchical structure of event detection data, traditional approaches in Euclidean space often fall short in capturing the complexity of such relationships. While existing methods in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces have shown promising results, they tend to overlook multi-order relationships between events. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework, Multi-Order Hyperbolic Graph Convolution with Aggregated Attention (MOHGCAA), designed to enhance the performance of SED. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements under both supervised and unsupervised settings. To further validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework, we conducted extensive evaluations across multiple datasets, confirming its superiority in tackling common challenges in social event detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Feng, Yangli-ao Geng, Yifan Zhu, Zongfu Han, Xie Yu, Kaiwen Xue, Haoran Luo, Mengyang Sun, Guangwei Zhang, Meina Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has gained widespread attention for its privacy-preserving and collaborative learning capabilities. Due to significant statistical heterogeneity, traditional FL struggles to generalize a shared model across diverse data domains. Personalized federated learning addresses this issue by dividing the model into a globally shared part and a locally private part, with the local model correcting representation biases introduced by the global model. Nevertheless, locally converged parameters more accurately capture domain-specific knowledge, and current methods overlook the potential benefits of these parameters. To address these limitations, we propose PM-MoE architecture. This architecture integrates a mixture of personalized modules and an energy-based personalized modules denoising, enabling each client to select beneficial personalized parameters from other clients. We applied the PM-MoE architecture to nine recent model-split-based personalized federated learning algorithms, achieving performance improvements with minimal additional training. Extensive experiments on six widely adopted datasets and two heterogeneity settings validate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Li, Wenjie Zhao, Ziru Huang, Yunhui Guo, Yapeng Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlike traditional visual segmentation, audio-visual segmentation (AVS) requires the model not only to identify and segment objects but also to determine whether they are sound sources. Recent AVS approaches, leveraging transformer architectures and powerful foundation models like SAM, have achieved impressive performance on standard benchmarks. Yet, an important question remains: Do these models genuinely integrate audio-visual cues to segment sounding objects? In this paper, we systematically investigate this issue in the context of robust AVS. Our study reveals a fundamental bias in current methods: they tend to generate segmentation masks based predominantly on visual salience, irrespective of the audio context. This bias results in unreliable predictions when sounds are absent or irrelevant. To address this challenge, we introduce AVSBench-Robust, a comprehensive benchmark incorporating diverse negative audio scenarios including silence, ambient noise, and off-screen sounds. We also propose a simple yet effective approach combining balanced training with negative samples and classifier-guided similarity learning. Our extensive experiments show that state-of-theart AVS methods consistently fail under negative audio conditions, demonstrating the prevalence of visual bias. In contrast, our approach achieves remarkable improvements in both standard metrics and robustness measures, maintaining near-perfect false positive rates while preserving highquality segmentation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Romero-Alvarado, Fernando Mart\'inez-Plumed, Jos\'e Hern\'andez-Orallo</p>
<p>Abstract: An AI assessor is an external, ideally indepen-dent system that predicts an indicator, e.g., a loss value, of another AI system. Assessors can lever-age information from the test results of many other AI systems and have the flexibility of be-ing trained on any loss function or scoring rule: from squared error to toxicity metrics. Here we address the question: is it always optimal to train the assessor for the target metric? Or could it be better to train for a different metric and then map predictions back to the target metric? Us-ing twenty regression and classification problems with tabular data, we experimentally explore this question for, respectively, regression losses and classification scores with monotonic and non-monotonic mappings and find that, contrary to intuition, optimising for more informative met-rics is not generally better. Surprisingly, some monotonic transformations are promising. For example, the logistic loss is useful for minimis-ing absolute or quadratic errors in regression, and the logarithmic score helps maximise quadratic or spherical scores in classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Though end-to-end speech-to-text translation has been a great success, we argue that the cascaded speech-to-text translation model still has its place, which is usually criticized for the error propagation between automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) models. In this paper, we explore the benefits of incorporating multiple candidates from ASR and self-supervised speech features into MT. Our analysis reveals that the primary cause of cascading errors stems from the increased divergence between similar samples in the speech domain when mapped to the text domain. By including multiple candidates and self-supervised speech features, our approach allows the machine translation model to choose the right words and ensure precise translation using various speech samples. This strategy minimizes error spread and takes advantage of large ASR and MT datasets, along with pre-trained ASR/MT models, while addressing associated issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Nikulin, Ilya Zisman, Denis Tarasov, Nikita Lyubaykin, Andrei Polubarov, Igor Kiselev, Vladislav Kurenkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahil Goyal, Debapriya Tula, Gagan Jain, Pradeep Shenoy, Prateek Jain, Sujoy Paul</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have made significant strides in producing content of exceptional quality. However, most methods suffer from a fundamental problem - a bottleneck of inference computational efficiency. Most of these algorithms involve multiple passes over a transformer model to generate tokens or denoise inputs. However, the model size is kept consistent throughout all iterations, which makes it computationally expensive. In this work, we aim to address this issue primarily through two key ideas - (a) not all parts of the generation process need equal compute, and we design a decode time model scaling schedule to utilize compute effectively, and (b) we can cache and reuse some of the computation. Combining these two ideas leads to using smaller models to process more tokens while large models process fewer tokens. These different-sized models do not increase the parameter size, as they share parameters. We rigorously experiment with ImageNet256$\times$256 , UCF101, and Kinetics600 to showcase the efficacy of the proposed method for image/video generation and frame prediction. Our experiments show that with almost $3\times$ less compute than baseline, our model obtains competitive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Civelli, Pietro Bernardelle, Gianluca Demartini</p>
<p>Abstract: While pretraining language models with politically diverse content has been shown to improve downstream task fairness, such approaches require significant computational resources often inaccessible to many researchers and organizations. Recent work has established that persona-based prompting can introduce political diversity in model outputs without additional training. However, it remains unclear whether such prompting strategies can achieve results comparable to political pretraining for downstream tasks. We investigate this question using persona-based prompting strategies in multimodal hate-speech detection tasks, specifically focusing on hate speech in memes. Our analysis reveals that when mapping personas onto a political compass and measuring persona agreement, inherent political positioning has surprisingly little correlation with classification decisions. Notably, this lack of correlation persists even when personas are explicitly injected with stronger ideological descriptors. Our findings suggest that while LLMs can exhibit political biases in their responses to direct political questions, these biases may have less impact on practical classification tasks than previously assumed. This raises important questions about the necessity of computationally expensive political pretraining for achieving fair performance in downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karish Grover, Haiyang Yu, Xiang Song, Qi Zhu, Han Xie, Vassilis N. Ioannidis, Christos Faloutsos</p>
<p>Abstract: Can integrating spectral and curvature signals unlock new potential in graph representation learning? Non-Euclidean geometries, particularly Riemannian manifolds such as hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive curvature), offer powerful inductive biases for embedding complex graph structures like scale-free, hierarchical, and cyclic patterns. Meanwhile, spectral filtering excels at processing signal variations across graphs, making it effective in homophilic and heterophilic settings. Leveraging both can significantly enhance the learned representations. To this end, we propose Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP) - the first graph representation learning paradigm that unifies both CUrvature (geometric) and SPectral insights. CUSP is a mixed-curvature spectral GNN that learns spectral filters to optimize node embeddings in products of constant-curvature manifolds (hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean). Specifically, CUSP introduces three novel components: (a) Cusp Laplacian, an extension of the traditional graph Laplacian based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature, designed to capture the curvature signals better; (b) Cusp Filtering, which employs multiple Riemannian graph filters to obtain cues from various bands in the eigenspectrum; and (c) Cusp Pooling, a hierarchical attention mechanism combined with a curvature-based positional encoding to assess the relative importance of differently curved substructures in our graph. Empirical evaluation across eight homophilic and heterophilic datasets demonstrates the superiority of CUSP in node classification and link prediction tasks, with a gain of up to 5.3% over state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele D'Acunto, Fabio Massimo Zennaro, Yorgos Felekis, Paolo Di Lorenzo</p>
<p>Abstract: Structural causal models (SCMs) allow us to investigate complex systems at multiple levels of resolution. The causal abstraction (CA) framework formalizes the mapping between high- and low-level SCMs. We address CA learning in a challenging and realistic setting, where SCMs are inaccessible, interventional data is unavailable, and sample data is misaligned. A key principle of our framework is $\textit{semantic embedding}$, formalized as the high-level distribution lying on a subspace of the low-level one. This principle naturally links linear CA to the geometry of the $\textit{Stiefel manifold}$. We present a category-theoretic approach to SCMs that enables the learning of a CA by finding a morphism between the low- and high-level probability measures, adhering to the semantic embedding principle. Consequently, we formulate a general CA learning problem. As an application, we solve the latter problem for linear CA; considering Gaussian measures and the Kullback-Leibler divergence as an objective. Given the nonconvexity of the learning task, we develop three algorithms building upon existing paradigms for Riemannian optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed methods succeed on both synthetic and real-world brain data with different degrees of prior information about the structure of CA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered widespread attention due to their ability to understand multimodal input. However, their large parameter sizes and substantial computational demands severely hinder their practical deployment and application.While quantization is an effective way to reduce model size and inference latency, its application to MLLMs remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework designed to tackle the unique challenges of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Conventional quantization often struggles with MLLMs because of (a) high inference latency from large visual token counts, (b) distributional disparities between visual and textual tokens, and (c) extreme outliers introduced by Hadamard-based transformations. To address these issues, MQuant introduces: Modality-Specific Static Quantization (MSQ), assigning distinct static scales for visual vs. textual tokens; Attention-Invariant Flexible Switching (AIFS), reordering tokens to preserve casual attention while eliminating expensive token-wise scale computations; Rotation Magnitude Suppression (RMS), mitigating weight outliers arising from online Hadamard rotations. On five mainstream MLLMs (including Qwen-VL, MiniCPM-V, CogVLM2), MQuant under W4A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (<1% degradation) while reducing inference latency by up to 30%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ baselines. Our MQuant effectively bridges the gap for efficient and accurate MLLMs inference in resource-constrained devices. Code will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Circuits in deterministic decomposable negation normal form (d-DNNF) are representations of Boolean functions that enable linear-time model counting. This paper strengthens our theoretical knowledge of what classes of functions can be efficiently transformed, or compiled, into d-DNNF. Our main contribution is the fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) compilation of conjunctions of specific constraints parameterized by incidence treewidth. This subsumes the known result for CNF. The constraints in question are all functions representable by constant-width ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) for all variable orderings. For instance, this includes parity constraints and cardinality constraints with constant threshold. The running time of the FPT compilation is singly exponential in the incidence treewidth but hides large constants in the exponent. To balance that, we give a more efficient FPT algorithm for model counting that applies to a sub-family of the constraints and does not require compilation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a popular control engineering practice, but requires a sound knowledge of the model. Model-free predictive control (MFPC), a burning issue today, also related to reinforcement learning (RL) in AI, is reformulated here via a linear differential equation with constant coefficients, thanks to a new perspective on optimal control combined with recent advances in the field of model-free control. It is replacing Dynamic Programming, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The computing burden is low. The implementation is straightforward. Two nonlinear examples, a chemical reactor and a two tank system, are illustrating our approach. A comparison with the HEOL setting, where some expertise of the process model is needed, shows only a slight superiority of the later. A recent identification of the two tank system via a complex ANN architecture might indicate that a full modeling and the corresponding machine learning mechanism are not always necessary neither in control, nor, more generally, in AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aishik Mandal, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Iryna Gurevych</p>
<p>Abstract: Mental illness is a widespread and debilitating condition with substantial societal and personal costs. Traditional diagnostic and treatment approaches, such as self-reported questionnaires and psychotherapy sessions, often impose significant burdens on both patients and clinicians, limiting accessibility and efficiency. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in Natural Language Processing and multimodal techniques, hold great potential for recognizing and addressing conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, privacy concerns, including the risk of sensitive data leakage from datasets and trained models, remain a critical barrier to deploying these AI systems in real-world clinical settings. These challenges are amplified in multimodal methods, where personal identifiers such as voice and facial data can be misused. This paper presents a critical and comprehensive study of the privacy challenges associated with developing and deploying AI models for mental health. We further prescribe potential solutions, including data anonymization, synthetic data generation, and privacy-preserving model training, to strengthen privacy safeguards in practical applications. Additionally, we discuss evaluation frameworks to assess the privacy-utility trade-offs in these approaches. By addressing these challenges, our work aims to advance the development of reliable, privacy-aware AI tools to support clinical decision-making and improve mental health outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunju Kang, Geonhee Han, Yoonjae Jeong, Hogun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-audio generation models (TAG) have achieved significant advances in generating audio conditioned on text descriptions. However, a critical challenge lies in the lack of transparency regarding how each textual input impacts the generated audio. To address this issue, we introduce AudioGenX, an Explainable AI (XAI) method that provides explanations for text-to-audio generation models by highlighting the importance of input tokens. AudioGenX optimizes an Explainer by leveraging factual and counterfactual objective functions to provide faithful explanations at the audio token level. This method offers a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the relationship between text inputs and audio outputs, enhancing both the explainability and trustworthiness of TAG models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AudioGenX in producing faithful explanations, benchmarked against existing methods using novel evaluation metrics specifically designed for audio generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen-Huan Lyu, Yi-Xiao He, Yanyan Wang, Zhihao Qu, Bin Tang, Baoliu Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Oblique Decision Tree (ODT) separates the feature space by linear projections, as opposed to the conventional Decision Tree (DT) that forces axis-parallel splits. ODT has been proven to have a stronger representation ability than DT, as it provides a way to create shallower tree structures while still approximating complex decision boundaries. However, its learning efficiency is still insufficient, since the linear projections cannot be transmitted to the child nodes, resulting in a waste of model parameters. In this work, we propose an enhanced ODT method with Feature Concatenation (\texttt{FC-ODT}), which enables in-model feature transformation to transmit the projections along the decision paths. Theoretically, we prove that our method enjoys a faster consistency rate w.r.t. the tree depth, indicating that our method possesses a significant advantage in generalization performance, especially for shallow trees. Experiments show that \texttt{FC-ODT} can outperform the other state-of-the-art decision trees with a limited tree depth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyuan Zheng, Sudong Cai, Chuan Xiao, Yang Cao, Jianbin Qin, Masatoshi Yoshikawa, Makoto Onizuka</p>
<p>Abstract: In collaborative machine learning, data valuation, i.e., evaluating the contribution of each client' data to the machine learning model, has become a critical task for incentivizing and selecting positive data contributions. However, existing studies often assume that clients engage in data valuation truthfully, overlooking the practical motivation for clients to exaggerate their contributions. To unlock this threat, this paper introduces the first data overvaluation attack, enabling strategic clients to have their data significantly overvalued. Furthermore, we propose a truthful data valuation metric, named Truth-Shapley. Truth-Shapley is the unique metric that guarantees some promising axioms for data valuation while ensuring that clients' optimal strategy is to perform truthful data valuation. Our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of existing data valuation metrics to the data overvaluation attack and validate the robustness and effectiveness of Truth-Shapley.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Cao, Zhao Song, Chiwun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper considers an efficient video modeling process called Video Latent Flow Matching (VLFM). Unlike prior works, which randomly sampled latent patches for video generation, our method relies on current strong pre-trained image generation models, modeling a certain caption-guided flow of latent patches that can be decoded to time-dependent video frames. We first speculate multiple images of a video are differentiable with respect to time in some latent space. Based on this conjecture, we introduce the HiPPO framework to approximate the optimal projection for polynomials to generate the probability path. Our approach gains the theoretical benefits of the bounded universal approximation error and timescale robustness. Moreover, VLFM processes the interpolation and extrapolation abilities for video generation with arbitrary frame rates. We conduct experiments on several text-to-video datasets to showcase the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Yang, Md. Noor-E-Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature selection is an important but challenging task in causal inference for obtaining unbiased estimates of causal quantities. Properly selected features in causal inference not only significantly reduce the time required to implement a matching algorithm but, more importantly, can also reduce the bias and variance when estimating causal quantities. When feature selection techniques are applied in causal inference, the crucial criterion is to select variables that, when used for matching, can achieve an unbiased and robust estimation of causal quantities. Recent research suggests that balancing only on treatment-associated variables introduces bias while balancing on spurious variables increases variance. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced three-stage framework that shows a significant improvement in selecting the desired subset of variables compared to the existing state-of-the-art feature selection framework for causal inference, resulting in lower bias and variance in estimating the causal quantity. We evaluated our proposed framework using a state-of-the-art synthetic data across various settings and observed superior performance within a feasible computation time, ensuring scalability for large-scale datasets. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of our proposed methodology using large-scale real-world data, we evaluated an important US healthcare policy related to the opioid epidemic crisis: whether opioid use disorder has a causal relationship with suicidal behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zhou, Tan Yuhao, Zenan Li, Yuan Yao, Lan-Zhe Guo, Xiaoxing Ma, Yu-Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities. However, single-shot inference often yields unreliable results for complex reasoning tasks, leading researchers to explore multiple reasoning paths through methods such as perplexity and self-consistency. In this paper, we present the first theoretical error decomposition analysis of these techniques, breaking down their error into estimation error and model error. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: perplexity methods suffer from substantial model error due to the absence of a proper consistency function, while self-consistency exhibits high estimation error due to a slow error convergence rate. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reasoning-Pruning Perplexity Consistency (RPC). This approach combines Perplexity Consistency, which seamlessly integrates LLM perplexity with self-consistency, and Reasoning Pruning, which eliminates low-probability reasoning paths to effectively prevent the degeneration of estimation error reduction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that RPC not only accelerates the convergence rate of estimation error to an exponential level but also holds strong potential for further reducing model error. Extensive empirical evaluations on seven benchmark datasets confirm that RPC can significantly improve reasoning performance, sample efficiency, and confidence reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Fan, J\"urgen Hackl</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatially embedded networks (SENs) represent a special type of complex graph, whose topologies are constrained by the networks' embedded spatial environments. The graph representation of such networks is thereby influenced by the embedded spatial features of both nodes and edges. Accurate network representation of the graph structure and graph features is a fundamental task for various graph-related tasks. In this study, a Generic Multimodal Spatially Graph Convolutional Network (GMu-SGCN) is developed for efficient representation of spatially embedded networks. The developed GMu-SGCN model has the ability to learn the node connection pattern via multimodal node and edge features. In order to evaluate the developed model, a river network dataset and a power network dataset have been used as test beds. The river network represents the naturally developed SENs, whereas the power network represents a man-made network. Both types of networks are heavily constrained by the spatial environments and uncertainties from nature. Comprehensive evaluation analysis shows the developed GMu-SGCN can improve accuracy of the edge existence prediction task by 37.1\% compared to a GraphSAGE model which only considers the node's position feature in a power network test bed. Our model demonstrates the importance of considering the multidimensional spatial feature for spatially embedded network representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotong Tu, Chenyu Ma, Qingyao Wu, Yinhao Liu, Hongyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent generalizable fault diagnosis researches have effectively tackled the distributional shift between unseen working conditions. Most of them mainly focus on learning domain-invariant representation through feature-level methods. However, the increasing numbers of unseen domains may lead to domain-invariant features contain instance-level spurious correlations, which impact the previous models' generalizable ability. To address the limitations, we propose the Fourier-based Augmentation Reconstruction Network, namely FARNet.The methods are motivated by the observation that the Fourier phase component and amplitude component preserve different semantic information of the signals, which can be employed in domain augmentation techniques. The network comprises an amplitude spectrum sub-network and a phase spectrum sub-network, sequentially reducing the discrepancy between the source and target domains. To construct a more robust generalized model, we employ a multi-source domain data augmentation strategy in the frequency domain. Specifically, a Frequency-Spatial Interaction Module (FSIM) is introduced to handle global information and local spatial features, promoting representation learning between the two sub-networks. To refine the decision boundary of our model output compared to conventional triplet loss, we propose a manifold triplet loss to contribute to generalization. Through extensive experiments on the CWRU and SJTU datasets, FARNet demonstrates effective performance and achieves superior results compared to current cross-domain approaches on the benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaitian Wang, Jian He, Yu Liang, Xiyuan Hu, Tianhao Peng, Kaixin Wang, Jiakai Wang, Chenlong Zhang, Weili Zhang, Shuang Niu, Xiaoyang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotions play a crucial role in human behavior and decision-making, making emotion recognition a key area of interest in human-computer interaction (HCI). This study addresses the challenges of emotion recognition by integrating facial expression analysis with electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, introducing a novel multimodal framework-Milmer. The proposed framework employs a transformer-based fusion approach to effectively integrate visual and physiological modalities. It consists of an EEG preprocessing module, a facial feature extraction and balancing module, and a cross-modal fusion module. To enhance visual feature extraction, we fine-tune a pre-trained Swin Transformer on emotion-related datasets. Additionally, a cross-attention mechanism is introduced to balance token representation across modalities, ensuring effective feature integration. A key innovation of this work is the adoption of a multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, which extracts meaningful information from multiple facial expression images over time, capturing critical temporal dynamics often overlooked in previous studies. Extensive experiments conducted on the DEAP dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.72% in the four-class emotion recognition task. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of each module, highlighting the significance of advanced feature extraction and fusion strategies in enhancing emotion recognition performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Johri, Johannes Schleiss, Nupoor Ranade</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly becoming a part of work practices across the technology industry and being used across a range of industries. This has necessitated the need to better understand how GenAI is being used by professionals in the field so that we can better prepare students for the workforce. An improved understanding of the use of GenAI in practice can help provide guidance on the design of GenAI literacy efforts including how to integrate it within courses and curriculum, what aspects of GenAI to teach, and even how to teach it. This paper presents a field study that compares the use of GenAI across three different functions - product development, software engineering, and digital content creation - to identify how GenAI is currently being used in the industry. This study takes a human augmentation approach with a focus on human cognition and addresses three research questions: how is GenAI augmenting work practices; what knowledge is important and how are workers learning; and what are the implications for training the future workforce. Findings show a wide variance in the use of GenAI and in the level of computing knowledge of users. In some industries GenAI is being used in a highly technical manner with deployment of fine-tuned models across domains. Whereas in others, only off-the-shelf applications are being used for generating content. This means that the need for what to know about GenAI varies, and so does the background knowledge needed to utilize it. For the purposes of teaching and learning, our findings indicated that different levels of GenAI understanding needs to be integrated into courses. From a faculty perspective, the work has implications for training faculty so that they are aware of the advances and how students are possibly, as early adopters, already using GenAI to augment their learning practices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emerging research has highlighted that artificial intelligence based multimodal fusion of digital pathology and transcriptomic features can improve cancer diagnosis (grading/subtyping) and prognosis (survival risk) prediction. However, such direct fusion for joint decision is impractical in real clinical settings, where histopathology is still the gold standard for diagnosis and transcriptomic tests are rarely requested, at least in the public healthcare system. With our novel diffusion based crossmodal generative AI model PathoGen, we show that genomic expressions synthesized from digital histopathology jointly predicts cancer grading and patient survival risk with high accuracy (state-of-the-art performance), certainty (through conformal coverage guarantee) and interpretability (through distributed attention maps).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stuart Armstrong, Matija Franklin, Connor Stevens, Rebecca Gorman</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work showed Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreaking using repeated use of random augmentations (such as capitalization, punctuation, etc) is effective against all major large language models (LLMs). We have found that $100\%$ of the BoN paper's successful jailbreaks (confidence interval $[99.65\%, 100.00\%]$) and $99.8\%$ of successful jailbreaks in our replication (confidence interval $[99.28\%, 99.98\%]$) were blocked with our Defense Against The Dark Prompts (DATDP) method. The DATDP algorithm works by repeatedly utilizing an evaluation LLM to evaluate a prompt for dangerous or manipulative behaviors--unlike some other approaches, DATDP also explicitly looks for jailbreaking attempts--until a robust safety rating is generated. This success persisted even when utilizing smaller LLMs to power the evaluation (Claude and LLaMa-3-8B-instruct proved almost equally capable). These results show that, though language models are sensitive to seemingly innocuous changes to inputs, they seem also capable of successfully evaluating the dangers of these inputs. Versions of DATDP can therefore be added cheaply to generative AI systems to produce an immediate significant increase in safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ebtisaam Alharbi, Leandro Soriano Marcolino, Qiang Ni, Antonios Gouglidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple devices while preserving data privacy. However, it remains susceptible to backdoor attacks, where malicious participants can compromise the global model. Existing defence methods are limited by strict assumptions on data heterogeneity (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed data) and the proportion of malicious clients, reducing their practicality and effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust Knowledge Distillation (RKD), a novel defence mechanism that enhances model integrity without relying on restrictive assumptions. RKD integrates clustering and model selection techniques to identify and filter out malicious updates, forming a reliable ensemble of models. It then employs knowledge distillation to transfer the collective insights from this ensemble to a global model. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that RKD effectively mitigates backdoor threats while maintaining high model performance, outperforming current state-of-the-art defence methods across various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saarthak Kapse, Robin Betz, Srinivasan Sivanandan</p>
<p>Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) with selective scan (Mamba) have been adapted into efficient vision models. Mamba, unlike Vision Transformers, achieves linear complexity for token interactions through a recurrent hidden state process. This sequential processing is enhanced by a parallel scan algorithm, which reduces the computational time of recurrent steps from $L$ sequential steps to $log(L)$ parallel steps with respect to the number of input tokens ($L$). In this work, we propose Fast Vision Mamba (FastVim), that further reduces the computational time of the SSM block by reducing the number of recurrent steps in Vision Mamba models while still retaining model performance. By alternately pooling tokens along image dimensions across Mamba blocks, we obtain a 2$\times$ reduction in the number of parallel steps in SSM block. Our model offers up to $72.5\%$ speedup in inference speed compared to baseline Vision Mamba models on high resolution (2048$\times$2048) images. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with dramatically improved throughput in a range of tasks such as image classification, cell perturbation prediction, segmentation, and object detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Yu, Dongming Shen, Silin Meng, Jaewon Lee, Weisu Yin, Andrea Yaoyun Cui, Zhenlin Xu, Yi Zhu, Xingjian Shi, Mu Li, Alex Smola</p>
<p>Abstract: We present RPGBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) as text-based role-playing game (RPG) engines. RPGBench comprises two core tasks: Game Creation (GC) and Game Simulation (GS). In GC, an LLM must craft a valid and playable RPG world using a structured event-state representation, ensuring logical coherence and proper termination conditions. In GS, the LLM simulates interactive gameplay across multiple rounds while consistently updating states and enforcing game rules. To comprehensively assess performance, RPGBench integrates objective and subjective evaluation methodologies. Objective measures verify adherence to event mechanics and check variable updates without requiring human intervention. Subjective measures, such as content interestingness, action quality, and role-playing capability, are evaluated via an LLM-as-a-judge framework, where a strong LLM grades each candidate's outputs. Empirical results demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs can produce engaging stories but often struggle to implement consistent, verifiable game mechanics, particularly in long or complex scenarios. By combining structured, rule-based assessments with LLM-based judgments, RPGBench provides a new standard for evaluating how well LLMs can balance creativity, coherence, and complexity in text-based RPGs, opening avenues for more immersive and controllable interactive storytelling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-task learning through composite loss functions is fundamental to modern deep learning, yet optimizing competing objectives remains challenging. We present new theoretical and practical approaches for addressing directional conflicts between loss terms, demonstrating their effectiveness in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) where such conflicts are particularly challenging to resolve. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate how these conflicts limit first-order methods and show that second-order optimization naturally resolves them through implicit gradient alignment. We prove that SOAP, a recently proposed quasi-Newton method, efficiently approximates the Hessian preconditioner, enabling breakthrough performance in PINNs: state-of-the-art results on 10 challenging PDE benchmarks, including the first successful application to turbulent flows with Reynolds numbers up to 10,000, with 2-10x accuracy improvements over existing methods. We also introduce a novel gradient alignment score that generalizes cosine similarity to multiple gradients, providing a practical tool for analyzing optimization dynamics. Our findings establish frameworks for understanding and resolving gradient conflicts, with broad implications for optimization beyond scientific computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiyuan He, Zihuan Qiu, Fanman Meng, Linfeng Xu, Qingbo Wu, Hongliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual adaptation of vision-language models (VLMs) focuses on leveraging cross-modal pretrained knowledge to incrementally adapt for expanding downstream tasks and datasets, while tackling the challenge of knowledge forgetting. Existing research often focuses on connecting visual features with specific class text in downstream tasks, overlooking the latent relationships between general and specialized knowledge. Our findings reveal that forcing models to optimize inappropriate visual-text matches exacerbates forgetting of VLMs. To tackle this issue, we propose DesCLIP, which leverages general attribute (GA) descriptions to guide the understanding of specific class objects, enabling VLMs to establish robust \textit{vision-GA-class} trilateral associations rather than relying solely on \textit{vision-class} connections. Specifically, we introduce a language assistant to generate concrete GA description candidates via proper request prompts. Then, an anchor-based embedding filter is designed to obtain highly relevant GA description embeddings, which are leveraged as the paired text embeddings for visual-textual instance matching, thereby tuning the visual encoder. Correspondingly, the class text embeddings are gradually calibrated to align with these shared GA description embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancements and efficacy of our proposed method, with comprehensive empirical evaluations highlighting its superior performance compared to existing pretrained and VLM-based continual learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Oh, Pengfei Jin, Sangjoon Park, Sekeun Kim, Siyeop Yoon, Kyungsang Kim, Jin Sung Kim, Xiang Li, Quanzheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring fairness in medical image segmentation is critical due to biases in imbalanced clinical data acquisition caused by demographic attributes (e.g., age, sex, race) and clinical factors (e.g., disease severity). To address these challenges, we introduce Distribution-aware Mixture of Experts (dMoE), inspired by optimal control theory. We provide a comprehensive analysis of its underlying mechanisms and clarify dMoE's role in adapting to heterogeneous distributions in medical image segmentation. Furthermore, we integrate dMoE into multiple network architectures, demonstrating its broad applicability across diverse medical image analysis tasks. By incorporating demographic and clinical factors, dMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 2D benchmark datasets and a 3D in-house dataset. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dMoE in mitigating biases from imbalanced distributions, offering a promising approach to bridging control theory and medical image segmentation within fairness learning paradigms. The source code will be made available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Xue, Jiping Li, Baharan Mirzasoleiman</p>
<p>Abstract: Weak-to-Strong Generalization (W2SG), where a weak model supervises a stronger one, serves as an important analogy for understanding how humans might guide superhuman intelligence in the future. Promising empirical results revealed that a strong model can surpass its weak supervisor. While recent work has offered theoretical insights into this phenomenon, a clear understanding of the interactions between weak and strong models that drive W2SG remains elusive. We investigate W2SG through a theoretical lens and show that it can be characterized using kernels derived from the principal components of weak and strong models' internal representations. These kernels can be used to define a space that, at a high level, captures what the weak model is unable to learn but is learnable by the strong model. The projection of labels onto this space quantifies how much the strong model falls short of its full potential due to weak supervision. This characterization also provides insights into how certain errors in weak supervision can be corrected by the strong model, regardless of overfitting. Our theory has significant practical implications, providing a representation-based metric that predicts W2SG performance trends without requiring labels, as shown in experiments on molecular predictions with transformers and 5 NLP tasks involving 52 LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donglei Yu, Yang Zhao, Jie Zhu, Yangyifan Xu, Yu Zhou, Chengqing Zong</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) generates translations while receiving streaming source inputs. This requires the SiMT model to learn a read/write policy, deciding when to translate and when to wait for more source input. Numerous linguistic studies indicate that audiences in SiMT scenarios have distinct preferences, such as accurate translations, simpler syntax, and no unnecessary latency. Aligning SiMT models with these human preferences is crucial to improve their performances. However, this issue still remains unexplored. Additionally, preference optimization for SiMT task is also challenging. Existing methods focus solely on optimizing the generated responses, ignoring human preferences related to latency and the optimization of read/write policy during the preference optimization phase. To address these challenges, we propose Simultaneous Preference Learning (SimulPL), a preference learning framework tailored for the SiMT task. In the SimulPL framework, we categorize SiMT human preferences into five aspects: \textbf{translation quality preference}, \textbf{monotonicity preference}, \textbf{key point preference}, \textbf{simplicity preference}, and \textbf{latency preference}. By leveraging the first four preferences, we construct human preference prompts to efficiently guide GPT-4/4o in generating preference data for the SiMT task. In the preference optimization phase, SimulPL integrates \textbf{latency preference} into the optimization objective and enables SiMT models to improve the read/write policy, thereby aligning with human preferences more effectively. Experimental results indicate that SimulPL exhibits better alignment with human preferences across all latency levels in Zh$\rightarrow$En, De$\rightarrow$En and En$\rightarrow$Zh SiMT tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Ren, Zishi Zhang, Zehao Li, Jingyang Jiang, Shentao Qin, Guanghao Li, Yan Li, Yi Zheng, Xinping Li, Min Zhan, Yijie Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: The probabilistic diffusion model (DM), generating content by inferencing through a recursive chain structure, has emerged as a powerful framework for visual generation. After pre-training on enormous unlabeled data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a zeroth-order informed fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The zeroth-order gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with the lower variance than other methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of the RLR. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation tasks to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Borui Xu, Yao Chen, Zeyi Wen, Weiguo Liu, Bingsheng He</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing demand for efficient summarization tools in resource-constrained environments highlights the need for effective solutions. While large language models (LLMs) deliver superior summarization quality, their high computational resource requirements limit practical use applications. In contrast, small language models (SLMs) present a more accessible alternative, capable of real-time summarization on edge devices. However, their summarization capabilities and comparative performance against LLMs remain underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive evaluation of 19 SLMs for news summarization across 2,000 news samples, focusing on relevance, coherence, factual consistency, and summary length. Our findings reveal significant variations in SLM performance, with top-performing models such as Phi3-Mini and Llama3.2-3B-Ins achieving results comparable to those of 70B LLMs while generating more concise summaries. Notably, SLMs are better suited for simple prompts, as overly complex prompts may lead to a decline in summary quality. Additionally, our analysis indicates that instruction tuning does not consistently enhance the news summarization capabilities of SLMs. This research not only contributes to the understanding of SLMs but also provides practical insights for researchers seeking efficient summarization solutions that balance performance and resource use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Dong, Zechao Sun, Guangdong Bai, Shuying Piao, Weitong Chen, Wei Emma Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Time Series Classification (TSC) is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing significant security threats. Existing methods primarily focus on data poisoning during the training phase, designing sophisticated triggers to improve stealthiness and attack success rate (ASR). However, in practical scenarios, attackers often face restrictions in accessing training data. Moreover, it is a challenge for the model to maintain generalization ability on clean test data while remaining vulnerable to poisoned inputs when data is inaccessible. To address these challenges, we propose TrojanTime, a novel two-step training algorithm. In the first stage, we generate a pseudo-dataset using an external arbitrary dataset through target adversarial attacks. The clean model is then continually trained on this pseudo-dataset and its poisoned version. To ensure generalization ability, the second stage employs a carefully designed training strategy, combining logits alignment and batch norm freezing. We evaluate TrojanTime using five types of triggers across four TSC architectures in UCR benchmark datasets from diverse domains. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TrojanTime in executing backdoor attacks while maintaining clean accuracy. Finally, to mitigate this threat, we propose a defensive unlearning strategy that effectively reduces the ASR while preserving clean accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajdeep Haldar, Ziyi Wang, Qifan Song, Guang Lin, Yue Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework demonstrating that popular Large Language Model (LLM) alignment methods, including Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and alternatives, fundamentally function as divergence estimators between aligned (preferred or safe) and unaligned (less-preferred or harmful) distributions. This explains the separation phenomenon between safe and harmful prompts in the model hidden representation after alignment. Inspired by the theoretical results, we identify that some alignment methods are better than others in terms of separation and, introduce a new method, KLDO, and further demonstrate the implication of our theories. We advocate for compliance-refusal datasets over preference datasets to enhance safety alignment, supported by both theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence. Additionally, to quantify safety separation, we leverage a distance metric in the representation space and statistically validate its efficacy as a statistical significant indicator of LLM resilience against jailbreak attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoran Yang, Shuhan Yu, Wenxi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision with diverse applications, ranging from autonomous systems to medical imaging. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark to evaluate the performance of classification models on small-scale, multi-class datasets. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art results; however, they often suffer from overfitting and suboptimal feature representation when applied to challenging datasets like CIFAR-10. In this paper, we propose an enhanced CNN architecture that integrates deeper convolutional blocks, batch normalization, and dropout regularization to achieve superior performance. The proposed model achieves a test accuracy of 84.95%, outperforming baseline CNN architectures. Through detailed ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhancements and analyze the hierarchical feature representations. This work highlights the potential of refined CNN architectures for tackling small-scale image classification problems effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Chen, Yiding Chen, Wen Sun, Xuezhou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) alignment. This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haodi Xu, Joshua Fan, Feng Tao, Lifen Jiang, Fengqi You, Benjamin Z. Houlton, Ying Sun, Carla P. Gomes, Yiqi Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Big data and the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance our understanding of the global carbon cycle and other biogeochemical processes. However, retrieving mechanistic knowledge from big data remains a challenge. Here, we develop a Biogeochemistry-Informed Neural Network (BINN) that seamlessly integrates a vectorized process-based soil carbon cycle model (i.e., Community Land Model version 5, CLM5) into a neural network (NN) structure to examine mechanisms governing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage from big data. BINN demonstrates high accuracy in retrieving biogeochemical parameter values from synthetic data in a parameter recovery experiment. We use BINN to predict six major processes regulating the soil carbon cycle (or components in process-based models) from 25,925 observed SOC profiles across the conterminous US and compared them with the same processes previously retrieved by a Bayesian inference-based PROcess-guided deep learning and DAta-driven modeling (PRODA) approach (Tao et al. 2020; 2023). The high agreement between the spatial patterns of the retrieved processes using the two approaches with an average correlation coefficient of 0.81 confirms BINN's ability in retrieving mechanistic knowledge from big data. Additionally, the integration of neural networks and process-based models in BINN improves computational efficiency by more than 50 times over PRODA. We conclude that BINN is a transformative tool that harnesses the power of both AI and process-based modeling, facilitation new scientific discoveries while improving interpretability and accuracy of Earth system models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeong Kyu Choi, Maxim Khanov, Hongxin Wei, Yixuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset contamination, where evaluation datasets overlap with pre-training corpora, inflates performance metrics and undermines the reliability of model evaluations. Quantifying dataset contamination thus becomes essential to ensure that performance evaluations genuinely reflect a model's ability to generalize to unseen data, rather than relying on memorized examples. To address this problem, we propose Kernel Divergence Score (KDS), a novel method that quantifies dataset contamination by computing the divergence between the kernel similarity matrix of sample embeddings, before and after fine-tuning on the benchmark dataset. Leveraging the insight that fine-tuning affects unseen samples more significantly than seen ones, KDS provides a reliable measure of contamination. Through extensive experiments on controlled contamination scenarios, KDS demonstrates a near-perfect correlation with contamination levels and outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, we perform comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the impact of key design choices, providing deeper insights into the components and effectiveness of KDS. These ablations highlight the importance of leveraging fine-grained kernel-based information and confirm the reliability of the proposed framework across diverse datasets and settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid advances in graph representation learning, with the continuous embedding approach emerging as the dominant paradigm. However, such methods encounter issues regarding parameter efficiency, interpretability, and robustness. Thus, Quantized Graph Representation (QGR) learning has recently gained increasing interest, which represents the graph structure with discrete codes instead of conventional continuous embeddings. Given its analogous representation form to natural language, QGR also possesses the capability to seamlessly integrate graph structures with large language models (LLMs). As this emerging paradigm is still in its infancy yet holds significant promise, we undertake this thorough survey to promote its rapid future prosperity. We first present the background of the general quantization methods and their merits. Moreover, we provide an in-depth demonstration of current QGR studies from the perspectives of quantized strategies, training objectives, distinctive designs, knowledge graph quantization, and applications. We further explore the strategies for code dependence learning and integration with LLMs. At last, we give discussions and conclude future directions, aiming to provide a comprehensive picture of QGR and inspire future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arpit Narechania, Alex Endert, Atanu R Sinha</p>
<p>Abstract: The progress in generative AI has fueled AI-powered tools like co-pilots and assistants to provision better guidance, particularly during data analysis. However, research on guidance has not yet examined the perceived efficacy of the source from which guidance is offered and the impact of this source on the user's perception and usage of guidance. We ask whether users perceive all guidance sources as equal, with particular interest in three sources: (i) AI, (ii) human expert, and (iii) a group of human analysts. As a benchmark, we consider a fourth source, (iv) unattributed guidance, where guidance is provided without attribution to any source, enabling isolation of and comparison with the effects of source-specific guidance. We design a five-condition between-subjects study, with one condition for each of the four guidance sources and an additional (v) no-guidance condition, which serves as a baseline to evaluate the influence of any kind of guidance. We situate our study in a custom data preparation and analysis tool wherein we task users to select relevant attributes from an unfamiliar dataset to inform a business report. Depending on the assigned condition, users can request guidance, which the system then provides in the form of attribute suggestions. To ensure internal validity, we control for the quality of guidance across source-conditions. Through several metrics of usage and perception, we statistically test five preregistered hypotheses and report on additional analysis. We find that the source of guidance matters to users, but not in a manner that matches received wisdom. For instance, users utilize guidance differently at various stages of analysis, including expressing varying levels of regret, despite receiving guidance of similar quality. Notably, users in the AI condition reported both higher post-task benefit and regret.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Jiang, Hai Huang, Xingquan Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), through learning policies or values represented by neural networks, has successfully addressed many complex control problems. However, the neural networks introduced by DRL lack interpretability and transparency. Current DRL interpretability methods largely treat neural networks as black boxes, with few approaches delving into the internal mechanisms of policy/value networks. This limitation undermines trust in both the neural network models that represent policies and the explanations derived from them. In this work, we propose a novel concept-based interpretability method that provides fine-grained explanations of DRL models at the neuron level. Our method formalizes atomic concepts as binary functions over the state space and constructs complex concepts through logical operations. By analyzing the correspondence between neuron activations and concept functions, we establish interpretable explanations for individual neurons in policy/value networks. Experimental results on both continuous control tasks and discrete decision-making environments demonstrate that our method can effectively identify meaningful concepts that align with human understanding while faithfully reflecting the network's decision-making logic.</p>

<p>Abstract: One-step shortcut diffusion models [Frans, Hafner, Levine and Abbeel, ICLR 2025] have shown potential in vision generation, but their reliance on first-order trajectory supervision is fundamentally limited. The Shortcut model's simplistic velocity-only approach fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry, leading to erratic trajectories, poor geometric alignment, and instability-especially in high-curvature regions. These shortcomings stem from its inability to model mid-horizon dependencies or complex distributional features, leaving it ill-equipped for robust generative modeling. In this work, we introduce HOMO (High-Order Matching for One-Step Shortcut Diffusion), a game-changing framework that leverages high-order supervision to revolutionize distribution transportation. By incorporating acceleration, jerk, and beyond, HOMO not only fixes the flaws of the Shortcut model but also achieves unprecedented smoothness, stability, and geometric precision. Theoretically, we prove that HOMO's high-order supervision ensures superior approximation accuracy, outperforming first-order methods. Empirically, HOMO dominates in complex settings, particularly in high-curvature regions where the Shortcut model struggles. Our experiments show that HOMO delivers smoother trajectories and better distributional alignment, setting a new standard for one-step generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuefan Cao, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Jiahao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI research surges in both impact and volume, conferences have imposed submission limits to maintain paper quality and alleviate organizational pressure. In this work, we examine the fairness of desk-rejection systems under submission limits and reveal that existing practices can result in substantial inequities. Specifically, we formally define the paper submission limit problem and identify a critical dilemma: when the number of authors exceeds three, it becomes impossible to reject papers solely based on excessive submissions without negatively impacting innocent authors. Thus, this issue may unfairly affect early-career researchers, as their submissions may be penalized due to co-authors with significantly higher submission counts, while senior researchers with numerous papers face minimal consequences. To address this, we propose an optimization-based fairness-aware desk-rejection mechanism and formally define two fairness metrics: individual fairness and group fairness. We prove that optimizing individual fairness is NP-hard, whereas group fairness can be efficiently optimized via linear programming. Through case studies, we demonstrate that our proposed system ensures greater equity than existing methods, including those used in CVPR 2025, offering a more socially just approach to managing excessive submissions in AI conferences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent one of the most prevalent FDA-approved modalities for treating autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and cancers. However, discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies remains a time-consuming and expensive process. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have shown significant promise in revolutionizing antibody discovery and optimization. In particular, models that predict antibody biological activity enable in-silico evaluation of binding and functional properties; such models can prioritize antibodies with the highest likelihoods of success in costly and time-intensive laboratory testing procedures. We here explore an AI model for predicting the binding and receptor blocking activity of antibodies against influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) antigens. Our present model is developed with the MAMMAL framework for biologics discovery to predict antibody-antigen interactions using only sequence information. To evaluate the model's performance, we tested it under various data split conditions to mimic real-world scenarios.
  Our models achieved an AUROC $\geq$ 0.91 for predicting the activity of existing antibodies against seen HAs and an AUROC of 0.9 for unseen HAs. For novel antibody activity prediction, the AUROC was 0.73, which further declined to 0.63-0.66 under stringent constraints on similarity to existing antibodies. These results demonstrate the potential of AI foundation models to transform antibody design by reducing dependence on extensive laboratory testing and enabling more efficient prioritization of antibody candidates. Moreover, our findings emphasize the critical importance of diverse and comprehensive antibody datasets to improve the generalization of prediction models, particularly for novel antibody development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chronic liver disease represents a significant health challenge worldwide and accurate prognostic evaluations are essential for personalized treatment plans. Recent evidence suggests that integrating multimodal data, such as computed tomography imaging, radiomic features, and clinical information, can provide more comprehensive prognostic information. However, modalities have an inherent heterogeneity, and incorporating additional modalities may exacerbate the challenges of heterogeneous data fusion. Moreover, existing multimodal fusion methods often struggle to adapt to richer medical modalities, making it difficult to capture inter-modal relationships. To overcome these limitations, We present the Triple-Modal Interaction Chronic Liver Network (TMI-CLNet). Specifically, we develop an Intra-Modality Aggregation module and a Triple-Modal Cross-Attention Fusion module, which are designed to eliminate intra-modality redundancy and extract cross-modal information, respectively. Furthermore, we design a Triple-Modal Feature Fusion loss function to align feature representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the liver prognosis dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unimodal models and other multi-modal techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qixuan Li, Chao Wang, Zongjin He, Yan Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-3D asset generation has achieved significant optimization under the supervision of 2D diffusion priors. However, when dealing with compositional scenes, existing methods encounter several challenges: 1). failure to ensure that composite scene layouts comply with physical laws; 2). difficulty in accurately capturing the assets and relationships described in complex scene descriptions; 3). limited autonomous asset generation capabilities among layout approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs). To avoid these compromises, we propose a novel framework for compositional scene generation, PhiP-G, which seamlessly integrates generation techniques with layout guidance based on a world model. Leveraging LLM-based agents, PhiP-G analyzes the complex scene description to generate a scene graph, and integrating a multimodal 2D generation agent and a 3D Gaussian generation method for targeted assets creation. For the stage of layout, PhiP-G employs a physical pool with adhesion capabilities and a visual supervision agent, forming a world model for layout prediction and planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhiP-G significantly enhances the generation quality and physical rationality of the compositional scenes. Notably, PhiP-G attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in CLIP scores, achieves parity with the leading methods in generation quality as measured by the T$^3$Bench, and improves efficiency by 24x.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunbai Zhang, Chao Wang, Yang Zhou, Yan Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual reasoning refers to the task of solving questions about visual information. Current visual reasoning methods typically employ pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) strategies or deep neural network approaches. However, existing efforts are constrained by limited reasoning interpretability, while hindering by the phenomenon of underspecification in the question text. Additionally, the absence of fine-grained visual knowledge limits the precise understanding of subject behavior in visual reasoning tasks. To address these issues, we propose VIKSER (Visual Knowledge-Driven Self-Reinforcing Reasoning Framework). Specifically, VIKSER, trained using knowledge distilled from large language models, extracts fine-grained visual knowledge with the assistance of visual relationship detection techniques. Subsequently, VIKSER utilizes fine-grained visual knowledge to paraphrase the question with underspecification. Additionally, we design a novel prompting method called Chain-of-Evidence (CoE), which leverages the power of ``evidence for reasoning'' to endow VIKSER with interpretable reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of self-reflection technology empowers VIKSER with the ability to learn and improve from its mistakes. Experiments conducted on widely used datasets demonstrate that VIKSER achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in relevant tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prostate cancer is a major cause of cancer-related deaths in men, where early detection greatly improves survival rates. Although MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy offers superior accuracy by combining MRI's detailed visualization with TRUS's real-time guidance, it is a complex and time-intensive procedure that relies heavily on manual annotations, leading to potential errors. To address these challenges, we propose a fully automatic MRI-TRUS fusion-based segmentation method that identifies prostate tumors directly in TRUS images without requiring manual annotations. Unlike traditional multimodal fusion approaches that rely on naive data concatenation, our method integrates a registration-segmentation framework to align and leverage spatial information between MRI and TRUS modalities. This alignment enhances segmentation accuracy and reduces reliance on manual effort. Our approach was validated on a dataset of 1,747 patients from Stanford Hospital, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 0.212, outperforming TRUS-only (0.117) and naive MRI-TRUS fusion (0.132) methods, with significant improvements (p $<$ 0.01). This framework demonstrates the potential for reducing the complexity of prostate cancer diagnosis and provides a flexible architecture applicable to other multimodal medical imaging tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai Victor Habi, Hagit Messer, Yoram Bresler</p>
<p>Abstract: The Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB) is a crucial tool in signal processing for assessing the fundamental limitations of any estimation problem as well as benchmarking within a Bayesian frameworks. However, the BCRB cannot be computed without full knowledge of the prior and the measurement distributions. In this work, we propose a fully learned Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (LBCRB) that learns both the prior and the measurement distributions. Specifically, we suggest two approaches to obtain the LBCRB: the Posterior Approach and the Measurement-Prior Approach. The Posterior Approach provides a simple method to obtain the LBCRB, whereas the Measurement-Prior Approach enables us to incorporate domain knowledge to improve the sample complexity and {interpretability}. To achieve this, we introduce a Physics-encoded score neural network which enables us to easily incorporate such domain knowledge into a neural network. We {study the learning} errors of the two suggested approaches theoretically, and validate them numerically. We demonstrate the two approaches on several signal processing examples, including a linear measurement problem with unknown mixing and Gaussian noise covariance matrices, frequency estimation, and quantized measurement. In addition, we test our approach on a nonlinear signal processing problem of frequency estimation with real-world underwater ambient noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Chu, Qiuhao Wang, Enze Zhou, Ling Fu, Qian Liu, Gang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Auscultation plays a pivotal role in early respiratory and pulmonary disease diagnosis. Despite the emergence of deep learning-based methods for automatic respiratory sound classification post-Covid-19, limited datasets impede performance enhancement. Distinguishing between normal and abnormal respiratory sounds poses challenges due to the coexistence of normal respiratory components and noise components in both types. Moreover, different abnormal respiratory sounds exhibit similar anomalous features, hindering their differentiation. Besides, existing state-of-the-art models suffer from excessive parameter size, impeding deployment on resource-constrained mobile platforms. To address these issues, we design a lightweight network CycleGuardian and propose a framework based on an improved deep clustering and contrastive learning. We first generate a hybrid spectrogram for feature diversity and grouping spectrograms to facilitating intermittent abnormal sound capture.Then, CycleGuardian integrates a deep clustering module with a similarity-constrained clustering component to improve the ability to capture abnormal features and a contrastive learning module with group mixing for enhanced abnormal feature discernment. Multi-objective optimization enhances overall performance during training. In experiments we use the ICBHI2017 dataset, following the official split method and without any pre-trained weights, our method achieves Sp: 82.06 $\%$, Se: 44.47$\%$, and Score: 63.26$\%$ with a network model size of 38M, comparing to the current model, our method leads by nearly 7$\%$, achieving the current best performances. Additionally, we deploy the network on Android devices, showcasing a comprehensive intelligent respiratory sound auscultation system.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00735">From Compliance to Exploitation: Jailbreak Prompt Attacks on Multimodal LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun Wai Chiu, Linghan Huang, Bo Li, Huaming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across various domains due to their growing ability to process diverse types of input data, including text, audio, image and video. While LLMs have demonstrated outstanding performance in understanding and generating contexts for different scenarios, they are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks, which are mostly via text input. In this paper, we introduce the first voice-based jailbreak attack against multimodal LLMs, termed as Flanking Attack, which can process different types of input simultaneously towards the multimodal LLMs. Our work is motivated by recent advancements in monolingual voice-driven large language models, which have introduced new attack surfaces beyond traditional text-based vulnerabilities for LLMs. To investigate these risks, we examine the frontier multimodal LLMs, which can be accessed via different types of inputs such as audio input, focusing on how adversarial prompts can bypass its defense mechanisms. We propose a novel strategy, in which the disallowed prompt is flanked by benign, narrative-driven prompts. It is integrated in the Flanking Attack which attempts to humanizes the interaction context and execute the attack through a fictional setting. To better evaluate the attack performance, we present a semi-automated self-assessment framework for policy violation detection. We demonstrate that Flank Attack is capable of manipulating state-of-the-art LLMs into generating misaligned and forbidden outputs, which achieves an average attack success rate ranging from 0.67 to 0.93 across seven forbidden scenarios. These findings highlight both the potency of prompt-based obfuscation in voice-enabled contexts and the limitations of current LLMs' moderation safeguards and the urgent need for advanced defense strategies to address the challenges posed by evolving, context-rich attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atsumoto Ohashi, Ryuichiro Higashinaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-processing networks (PPNs) are components that modify the outputs of arbitrary modules in task-oriented dialogue systems and are optimized using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the overall task completion capability of the system. However, previous PPN-based approaches have been limited to handling only a subset of modules within a system, which poses a significant limitation in improving the system performance. In this study, we propose a joint optimization method for post-processing the outputs of all modules using universal post-processing networks (UniPPNs), which are language-model-based networks that can modify the outputs of arbitrary modules in a system as a sequence-transformation task. Moreover, our RL algorithm, which employs a module-level Markov decision process, enables fine-grained value and advantage estimation for each module, thereby stabilizing joint learning for post-processing the outputs of all modules. Through both simulation-based and human evaluation experiments using the MultiWOZ dataset, we demonstrated that UniPPN outperforms conventional PPNs in the task completion capability of task-oriented dialogue systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiayang Li, Shihua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in solving combinatorial optimization problems such as the Euclidean traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, most training and test instances for existing TSP algorithms are generated randomly from specific distributions like uniform distribution. This has led to a lack of analysis and understanding of the performance of deep learning algorithms in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization scenarios, which has a close relationship with the worst-case performance in the combinatorial optimization field. For data-driven algorithms, the statistical properties of randomly generated datasets are critical. This study constructs a statistical measure called nearest-neighbor density to verify the asymptotic properties of randomly generated datasets and reveal the greedy behavior of learning-based solvers, i.e., always choosing the nearest neighbor nodes to construct the solution path. Based on this statistical measure, we develop interpretable data augmentation methods that rely on distribution shifts or instance perturbations and validate that the performance of the learning-based solvers degenerates much on such augmented data. Moreover, fine-tuning learning-based solvers with augmented data further enhances their generalization abilities. In short, we decipher the limitations of learning-based TSP solvers tending to be overly greedy, which may have profound implications for AI-empowered combinatorial optimization solvers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eun Som Jeon, Hongjun Choi, Matthew P. Buman, Pavan Turaga</p>
<p>Abstract: The analysis of wearable sensor data has enabled many successes in several applications. To represent the high-sampling rate time-series with sufficient detail, the use of topological data analysis (TDA) has been considered, and it is found that TDA can complement other time-series features. Nonetheless, due to the large time consumption and high computational resource requirements of extracting topological features through TDA, it is difficult to deploy topological knowledge in various applications. To tackle this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) can be adopted, which is a technique facilitating model compression and transfer learning to generate a smaller model by transferring knowledge from a larger network. By leveraging multiple teachers in KD, both time-series and topological features can be transferred, and finally, a superior student using only time-series data is distilled. On the other hand, mixup has been popularly used as a robust data augmentation technique to enhance model performance during training. Mixup and KD employ similar learning strategies. In KD, the student model learns from the smoothed distribution generated by the teacher model, while mixup creates smoothed labels by blending two labels. Hence, this common smoothness serves as the connecting link that establishes a connection between these two methods. In this paper, we analyze the role of mixup in KD with time-series as well as topological persistence, employing multiple teachers. We present a comprehensive analysis of various methods in KD and mixup on wearable sensor data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Huang, Jiaqi Li, Ping Zhong, Rui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration (LCEC) is the core for data fusion in computer vision. Existing methods typically rely on customized calibration targets or fixed scene types, lacking the flexibility to handle variations in sensor data and environmental contexts. This paper introduces EdO-LCEC, the first environment-driven, online calibration approach that achieves human-like adaptability. Inspired by the human perceptual system, EdO-LCEC incorporates a generalizable scene discriminator to actively interpret environmental conditions, creating multiple virtual cameras that capture detailed spatial and textural information. To overcome cross-modal feature matching challenges between LiDAR and camera, we propose dual-path correspondence matching (DPCM), which leverages both structural and textural consistency to achieve reliable 3D-2D correspondences. Our approach formulates the calibration process as a spatial-temporal joint optimization problem, utilizing global constraints from multiple views and scenes to improve accuracy, particularly in sparse or partially overlapping sensor views. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that EdO-LCEC achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing reliable and precise calibration across diverse, challenging environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Massimiliano Falzari, Matthia Sabatelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems often tend to overfit to early experiences, a phenomenon known as the primacy bias (PB). This bias can severely hinder learning efficiency and final performance, particularly in complex environments. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of PB through the lens of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). We develop a framework characterizing PB through distinct patterns in the FIM trace, identifying critical memorization and reorganization phases during learning. Building on this understanding, we propose Fisher-Guided Selective Forgetting (FGSF), a novel method that leverages the geometric structure of the parameter space to selectively modify network weights, preventing early experiences from dominating the learning process. Empirical results across DeepMind Control Suite (DMC) environments show that FGSF consistently outperforms baselines, particularly in complex tasks. We analyze the different impacts of PB on actor and critic networks, the role of replay ratios in exacerbating the effect, and the effectiveness of even simple noise injection methods. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of PB and practical mitigation strategies, offering a FIM-based geometric perspective for advancing DRL.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the critical disconnect between prediction and decision quality in portfolio optimization by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with decision-focused learning. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that minimizing the prediction error alone leads to suboptimal portfolio decisions. We aim to exploit the representational power of LLMs for investment decisions. An attention mechanism processes asset relationships, temporal dependencies, and macro variables, which are then directly integrated into a portfolio optimization layer. This enables the model to capture complex market dynamics and align predictions with the decision objectives. Extensive experiments on S\&P100 and DOW30 datasets show that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models. In addition, gradient-based analyses show that our model prioritizes the assets most crucial to decision making, thus mitigating the effects of prediction errors on portfolio performance. These findings underscore the value of integrating decision objectives into predictions for more robust and context-aware portfolio management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become a cornerstone in many critical sectors, including healthcare, finance, and customer relationship management. This is especially true with the development and use of advanced models such as GPT-based architectures and BERT, which are widely used in decision-making processes. However, the black-box nature of these advanced NLP models has created an urgent need for transparency and explainability. This review explores explainable NLP (XNLP) with a focus on its practical deployment and real-world applications, examining its implementation and the challenges faced in domain-specific contexts. The paper underscores the importance of explainability in NLP and provides a comprehensive perspective on how XNLP can be designed to meet the unique demands of various sectors, from healthcare's need for clear insights to finance's emphasis on fraud detection and risk assessment. Additionally, this review aims to bridge the knowledge gap in XNLP literature by offering a domain-specific exploration and discussing underrepresented areas such as real-world applicability, metric evaluation, and the role of human interaction in model assessment. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions that could enhance the understanding and broader application of XNLP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities across various domains. Accompanying the evolving capabilities and expanding deployment scenarios of LLMs, their deployment challenges escalate due to their sheer scale and the advanced yet complex activation designs prevalent in notable model series, such as Llama, Gemma, and Mistral. These challenges have become particularly pronounced in resource-constrained deployment scenarios, where mitigating inference efficiency bottlenecks is imperative. Among various recent efforts, activation approximation has emerged as a promising avenue for pursuing inference efficiency, sometimes considered indispensable in applications such as private inference. Despite achieving substantial speedups with minimal impact on utility, even appearing sound and practical for real-world deployment, the safety implications of activation approximations remain unclear. In this work, we fill this critical gap in LLM safety by conducting the first systematic safety evaluation of activation approximations. Our safety vetting spans seven sota techniques across three popular categories, revealing consistent safety degradation across ten safety-aligned LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawen Zhang, Kejia Chen, Zunlei Feng, Jian Lou, Mingli Song, Jian Liu, Xiaohu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing popularity of LLMs among the general public users, privacy-preserving and adversarial robustness have become two pressing demands for LLM-based services, which have largely been pursued separately but rarely jointly. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are among the first attempts towards robust and private LLM inference by tightly integrating two disconnected fields: private inference and prompt ensembling. The former protects users' privacy by encrypting inference data transmitted and processed by LLMs, while the latter enhances adversarial robustness by yielding an aggregated output from multiple prompted LLM responses. Although widely recognized as effective individually, private inference for prompt ensembling together entails new challenges that render the naive combination of existing techniques inefficient. To overcome the hurdles, we propose SecPE, which designs efficient fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) counterparts for the core algorithmic building blocks of prompt ensembling. We conduct extensive experiments on 8 tasks to evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of SecPE. The results show that SecPE maintains high clean accuracy and offers better robustness at the expense of merely $2.5\%$ efficiency overhead compared to baseline private inference methods, indicating a satisfactory ``accuracy-robustness-efficiency'' tradeoff. For the efficiency of the encrypted Argmax operation that incurs major slowdown for prompt ensembling, SecPE is 35.4x faster than the state-of-the-art peers, which can be of independent interest beyond this work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Zhou, Wang Luo, Haoran Li, Congying Han, Tiande Guo, Zicheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning agents face significant deployment challenges due to the synthetic-to-real distribution mismatch. While most prior research has focused on improving the fidelity of synthetic sampling and incorporating off-policy mechanisms, the directly integrated paradigm often fails to ensure consistent policy behavior in biased models and underlying environmental dynamics, which inherently arise from discrepancies between behavior and learning policies. In this paper, we first shift the focus from model reliability to policy discrepancies while optimizing for expected returns, and then self-consistently incorporate synthetic data, deriving a novel actor-critic paradigm, Dual Alignment Maximin Optimization (DAMO). It is a unified framework to ensure both model-environment policy consistency and synthetic and offline data compatibility. The inner minimization performs dual conservative value estimation, aligning policies and trajectories to avoid out-of-distribution states and actions, while the outer maximization ensures that policy improvements remain consistent with inner value estimates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DAMO effectively ensures model and policy alignments, achieving competitive performance across diverse benchmark tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study addresses the growing concern of information asymmetry in consumer contracts, exacerbated by the proliferation of online services with complex Terms of Service that are rarely even read. Even though research on automatic analysis methods is conducted, the problem is aggravated by the general focus on English-language Machine Learning approaches and on major jurisdictions, such as the European Union. We introduce a new methodology and a substantial dataset addressing this gap. We propose a novel annotation scheme with four categories and a total of 20 classes, and apply it on 50 online Terms of Service used in Chile. Our evaluation of transformer-based models highlights how factors like language- and/or domain-specific pre-training, few-shot sample size, and model architecture affect the detection and classification of potentially abusive clauses. Results show a large variability in performance for the different tasks and models, with the highest macro-F1 scores for the detection task ranging from 79% to 89% and micro-F1 scores up to 96%, while macro-F1 scores for the classification task range from 60% to 70% and micro-F1 scores from 64% to 80%. Notably, this is the first Spanish-language multi-label classification dataset for legal clauses, applying Chilean law and offering a comprehensive evaluation of Spanish-language models in the legal domain. Our work lays the ground for future research in method development for rarely considered legal analysis and potentially leads to practical applications to support consumers in Chile and Latin America as a whole.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzheng Jiang, Ji Wang, Xiongtao Zhang, Weidong Bao, Cheston Tan, Flint Xiaofeng Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Reinforcement Learning (FedRL) improves sample efficiency while preserving privacy; however, most existing studies assume homogeneous agents, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates FedRL in black-box settings with heterogeneous agents, where each agent employs distinct policy networks and training configurations without disclosing their internal details. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a promising method for facilitating knowledge sharing among heterogeneous models, but it faces challenges related to the scarcity of public datasets and limitations in knowledge representation when applied to FedRL. To address these challenges, we propose Federated Heterogeneous Policy Distillation (FedHPD), which solves the problem of heterogeneous FedRL by utilizing action probability distributions as a medium for knowledge sharing. We provide a theoretical analysis of FedHPD's convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments corroborate that FedHPD shows significant improvements across various reinforcement learning benchmark tasks, further validating our theoretical findings. Moreover, additional experiments demonstrate that FedHPD operates effectively without the need for an elaborate selection of public datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of submissions to top-tier Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) conferences has prompted many venues to transition from closed to open review platforms. Some have fully embraced open peer reviews, allowing public visibility throughout the process, while others adopt hybrid approaches, such as releasing reviews only after final decisions or keeping reviews private despite using open peer review systems. In this work, we analyze the strengths and limitations of these models, highlighting the growing community interest in transparent peer review. To support this discussion, we examine insights from Paper Copilot, a website launched two years ago to aggregate and analyze AI / ML conference data while engaging a global audience. The site has attracted over 200,000 early-career researchers, particularly those aged 18-34 from 177 countries, many of whom are actively engaged in the peer review process. Drawing on our findings, this position paper advocates for a more transparent, open, and well-regulated peer review aiming to foster greater community involvement and propel advancements in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsaneddin Asgari, Yassine El Kheir, Mohammad Ali Sadraei Javaheri</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental to Natural Language Processing (NLP), directly impacting model efficiency and linguistic fidelity. While Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs), it often disregards morpheme boundaries, leading to suboptimal segmentation, particularly in morphologically rich languages. We introduce MorphBPE, a morphology-aware extension of BPE that integrates linguistic structure into subword tokenization while preserving statistical efficiency. Additionally, we propose two morphology-based evaluation metrics: (i) Morphological Consistency F1-Score, which quantifies the consistency between morpheme sharing and token sharing, contributing to LLM training convergence, and (ii) Morphological Edit Distance, which measures alignment between morphemes and tokens concerning interpretability. Experiments on English, Russian, Hungarian, and Arabic across 300M and 1B parameter LLMs demonstrate that MorphBPE consistently reduces cross-entropy loss, accelerates convergence, and improves morphological alignment scores. Fully compatible with existing LLM pipelines, MorphBPE requires minimal modifications for integration. The MorphBPE codebase and tokenizer playground will be available at: https://github.com/llm-lab-org/MorphBPE and https://tokenizer.llm-lab.org</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewoo Kang, Kjerstin Thorson, Tai-Quan Peng, Dan Hiaeshutter-Rice, Sanguk Lee, Stuart Soroka</p>
<p>Abstract: This study attempts to advancing content analysis methodology from consensus-oriented to coordination-oriented practices, thereby embracing diverse coding outputs and exploring the dynamics among differential perspectives. As an exploratory investigation of this approach, we evaluate six GPT-4o configurations to analyze sentiment in Fox News and MSNBC transcripts on Biden and Trump during the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign, examining patterns across these models. By assessing each model's alignment with ideological perspectives, we explore how partisan selective processing could be identified in LLM-Assisted Content Analysis (LACA). Findings reveal that partisan persona LLMs exhibit stronger ideological biases when processing politically congruent content. Additionally, intercoder reliability is higher among same-partisan personas compared to cross-partisan pairs. This approach enhances the nuanced understanding of LLM outputs and advances the integrity of AI-driven social science research, enabling simulations of real-world implications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Zhang, Mustafa Khan, Vardan Papyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Two prominent features of large language models (LLMs) is the presence of large-norm (outlier) features and the tendency for tokens to attend very strongly to a select few tokens. Despite often having no semantic relevance, these select tokens, called attention sinks, along with the large outlier features, have proven important for model performance, compression, and streaming. Consequently, investigating the roles of these phenomena within models and exploring how they might manifest in the model parameters has become an area of active interest. Through an empirical investigation, we demonstrate that attention sinks utilize outlier features to: catch a sequence of tokens, tag the captured tokens by applying a common perturbation, and then release the tokens back into the residual stream, where the tagged tokens are eventually retrieved. We prove that simple tasks, like averaging, necessitate the 'catch, tag, release' mechanism hence explaining why it would arise organically in modern LLMs. Our experiments also show that the creation of attention sinks can be completely captured in the model parameters using low-rank matrices, which has important implications for model compression and substantiates the success of recent approaches that incorporate a low-rank term to offset performance degradation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have led to large multi-modal models (LMMs) capable of simultaneously processing inputs of various modalities such as text, images, video, and audio. While these models demonstrate impressive capabilities, efficiently serving them in production environments poses significant challenges due to their complex architectures and heterogeneous resource requirements.
  We present the first comprehensive systems analysis of two prominent LMM architectures, decoder-only and cross-attention, on six representative open-source models. We investigate their multi-stage inference pipelines and resource utilization patterns that lead to unique systems design implications. We also present an in-depth analysis of production LMM inference traces, uncovering unique workload characteristics, including variable, heavy-tailed request distributions, diverse modal combinations, and bursty traffic patterns.
  Our key findings reveal that different LMM inference stages exhibit highly heterogeneous performance characteristics and resource demands, while concurrent requests across modalities lead to significant performance interference. To address these challenges, we propose a decoupled serving architecture that enables independent resource allocation and adaptive scaling for each stage. We further propose optimizations such as stage colocation to maximize throughput and resource utilization while meeting the latency objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erick Andrew Bustamante Flores, Harley Vera Olivera, Ivan Cesar Medrano Valencia, Carlos Fernando Montoya Cubas</p>
<p>Abstract: This study develops a transfer learning model for the automated classification of two species of fruit flies, Anastrepha fraterculus and Ceratitis capitata, in a controlled laboratory environment. The research addresses the need to optimize identification and classification, which are currently performed manually by experts, being affected by human factors and facing time challenges. The methodological process of this study includes the capture of high-quality images using a mobile phone camera and a stereo microscope, followed by segmentation to reduce size and focus on relevant morphological areas. The images were carefully labeled and preprocessed to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset used to train the pre-trained convolutional neural network models VGG16, VGG19, and Inception-v3. The results were evaluated using the F1-score, achieving 82% for VGG16 and VGG19, while Inception-v3 reached an F1-score of 93%. Inception-v3's reliability was verified through model testing in uncontrolled environments, with positive results, complemented by the Grad-CAM technique, demonstrating its ability to capture essential morphological features. These findings indicate that Inception-v3 is an effective and replicable approach for classifying Anastrepha fraterculus and Ceratitis capitata, with potential for implementation in automated monitoring systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesus Fernandez-Bes, Jesus Cid-Sueiro, Antonio G. Marques</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel censoring policy for energy-efficient transmissions in energy-harvesting sensors. The problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP). The objective to be optimized is the expected sum of the importance (utility) of all transmitted messages. Assuming that such importance can be evaluated at the transmitting node, we show that, under certain conditions on the battery model, the optimal censoring policy is a threshold function on the importance value. Specifically, messages are transmitted only if their importance is above a threshold whose value depends on the battery level. Exploiting this property, we propose a model-based stochastic scheme that approximates the optimal solution, with less computational complexity and faster convergence speed than a conventional Q-learning algorithm. Numerical experiments in single-hop and multi-hop networks confirm the analytical advantages of the proposed scheme.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for forecasting the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Unlike traditional MLP-based neural networks that are often criticized for their black-box nature, KAN offers an interpretable approach via learnable spline-based activation functions and symbolification. Based on a parsimonious architecture with symbolic functions, KAN expresses a forecast of the VIX as a closed-form in terms of explanatory variables, and provide interpretable insights into key characteristics of the VIX, including mean reversion and the leverage effect. Through in-depth empirical analysis across multiple datasets and periods, we show that KANs achieve competitive forecasting performance while requiring significantly fewer parameters compared to MLP-based neural network models. Our findings demonstrate the capacity and potential of KAN as an interpretable financial time-series forecasting method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Albert, Frederic Z. Zhang, Hemanth Saratchandran, Cristian Rodriguez-Opazo, Anton van den Hengel, Ehsan Abbasnejad</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have shown impressive results in reducing the number of trainable parameters and memory requirements of large transformer networks while maintaining fine-tuning performance. However, the low-rank nature of the weight update inherently limits the representation power of fine-tuned models, potentially compromising performance on complex tasks. This raises a critical question: when a performance gap between LoRA and standard fine-tuning is observed, is it due to the reduced number of trainable parameters or the rank deficiency? This paper aims to answer this question by introducing RandLoRA, a parameter-efficient method that performs full-rank updates using a learned linear combinations of low-rank, non-trainable random matrices. Our method limits the number of trainable parameters by restricting optimization to diagonal scaling matrices applied to the fixed random matrices. This allows us to effectively overcome the low-rank limitations while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency during training. Through extensive experimentation across vision, language, and vision-language benchmarks, we systematically evaluate the limitations of LoRA and existing random basis methods. Our findings reveal that full-rank updates are beneficial across vision and language tasks individually, and even more so for vision-language tasks, where RandLoRA significantly reduces -- and sometimes eliminates -- the performance gap between standard fine-tuning and LoRA, demonstrating its efficacy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific data visualization is pivotal for transforming raw data into comprehensible visual representations, enabling pattern recognition, forecasting, and the presentation of data-driven insights. However, novice users often face difficulties due to the complexity of selecting appropriate tools and mastering visualization techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated potential in assisting code generation, though they struggle with accuracy and require iterative debugging. In this paper, we propose PlotGen, a novel multi-agent framework aimed at automating the creation of precise scientific visualizations. PlotGen orchestrates multiple LLM-based agents, including a Query Planning Agent that breaks down complex user requests into executable steps, a Code Generation Agent that converts pseudocode into executable Python code, and three retrieval feedback agents - a Numeric Feedback Agent, a Lexical Feedback Agent, and a Visual Feedback Agent - that leverage multimodal LLMs to iteratively refine the data accuracy, textual labels, and visual correctness of generated plots via self-reflection. Extensive experiments show that PlotGen outperforms strong baselines, achieving a 4-6 percent improvement on the MatPlotBench dataset, leading to enhanced user trust in LLM-generated visualizations and improved novice productivity due to a reduction in debugging time needed for plot errors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform chart question-answering tasks but often generate unverified hallucinated responses. Existing answer attribution methods struggle to ground responses in source charts due to limited visual-semantic context, complex visual-text alignment requirements, and difficulties in bounding box prediction across complex layouts. We present ChartCitor, a multi-agent framework that provides fine-grained bounding box citations by identifying supporting evidence within chart images. The system orchestrates LLM agents to perform chart-to-table extraction, answer reformulation, table augmentation, evidence retrieval through pre-filtering and re-ranking, and table-to-chart mapping. ChartCitor outperforms existing baselines across different chart types. Qualitative user studies show that ChartCitor helps increase user trust in Generative AI by providing enhanced explainability for LLM-assisted chart QA and enables professionals to be more productive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Zhou, Giannis Karamanolakis, Victor Soto, Anna Rumshisky, Mayank Kulkarni, Furong Huang, Wei Ai, Jianhua Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) in domains such as mathematical reasoning and coding has led to growing interest in methods for merging these expert LLMs into a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, with the goal of enhancing performance in each domain while retaining effectiveness on general tasks. However, the effective merging of expert models remains an open challenge, especially for models with highly divergent weight parameters or different architectures. State-of-the-art MoE merging methods only work with homogeneous model architectures and rely on simple unweighted averaging to merge expert layers, which does not address parameter interference and requires extensive fine-tuning of the merged MoE to restore performance. To address these limitations, this paper introduces new MoE merging techniques, including strategies to mitigate parameter interference, routing heuristics to reduce the need for MoE fine-tuning, and a novel method for merging experts with different architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, reducing fine-tuning costs, improving performance over state-of-the-art methods, and expanding the applicability of MoE merging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large scale deep learning model, such as modern language models and diffusion architectures, have revolutionized applications ranging from natural language processing to computer vision. However, their deployment in distributed or decentralized environments raises significant privacy concerns, as sensitive data may be exposed during inference. Traditional techniques like secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, and differential privacy offer partial remedies but often incur substantial computational overhead, latency penalties, or limited compatibility with non-linear network operations. In this work, we introduce Equivariant Encryption (EE), a novel paradigm designed to enable secure, "blind" inference on encrypted data with near zero performance overhead. Unlike fully homomorphic approaches that encrypt the entire computational graph, EE selectively obfuscates critical internal representations within neural network layers while preserving the exact functionality of both linear and a prescribed set of non-linear operations. This targeted encryption ensures that raw inputs, intermediate activations, and outputs remain confidential, even when processed on untrusted infrastructure. We detail the theoretical foundations of EE, compare its performance and integration complexity against conventional privacy preserving techniques, and demonstrate its applicability across a range of architectures, from convolutional networks to large language models. Furthermore, our work provides a comprehensive threat analysis, outlining potential attack vectors and baseline strategies, and benchmarks EE against standard inference pipelines in decentralized settings. The results confirm that EE maintains high fidelity and throughput, effectively bridging the gap between robust data confidentiality and the stringent efficiency requirements of modern, large scale model inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Shu, Qixin Zhang, Kun He, Zhongxiang Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization plays an essential role in scenarios where gradient information is inaccessible or unaffordable, such as black-box systems and resource-constrained environments. While existing adaptive methods such as ZO-AdaMM have shown promise, they are fundamentally limited by their underutilization of moment information during optimization, usually resulting in underperforming convergence. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces Refined Adaptive Zeroth-Order Optimization (R-AdaZO). Specifically, we first show the untapped variance reduction effect of first moment estimate on ZO gradient estimation, which improves the accuracy and stability of ZO updates. We then refine the second moment estimate based on these variance-reduced gradient estimates to better capture the geometry of the optimization landscape, enabling a more effective scaling of ZO updates. We present rigorous theoretical analysis to show (I) the first analysis to the variance reduction of first moment estimate in ZO optimization, (II) the improved second moment estimates with a more accurate approximation of its variance-free ideal, (III) the first variance-aware convergence framework for adaptive ZO methods, which may be of independent interest, and (IV) the faster convergence of R-AdaZO than existing baselines like ZO-AdaMM. Our extensive experiments, including synthetic problems, black-box adversarial attack, and memory-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), further verify the superior convergence of R-AdaZO, indicating that R-AdaZO offers an improved solution for real-world ZO optimization challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangqin Ma, Erfan Mahmoudinia</p>
<p>Abstract: Transaction fee prediction in Bitcoin's ecosystem represents a crucial challenge affecting both user costs and miner revenue optimization. This study presents a systematic evaluation of six predictive models for forecasting Bitcoin transaction fees across a 24-hour horizon (144 blocks): SARIMAX, Prophet, Time2Vec, Time2Vec with Attention, a Hybrid model combining SARIMAX with Gradient Boosting, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Our approach integrates comprehensive feature engineering spanning mempool metrics, network parameters, and historical fee patterns to capture the multifaceted dynamics of fee behavior.
  Through rigorous 5-fold cross-validation and independent testing, our analysis reveals that traditional statistical approaches outperform more complex deep learning architectures. The SARIMAX model achieves superior accuracy on the independent test set, while Prophet demonstrates strong performance during cross-validation. Notably, sophisticated deep learning models like Time2Vec and TFT show comparatively lower predictive power despite their architectural complexity. This performance disparity likely stems from the relatively constrained training dataset of 91 days, suggesting that deep learning models may achieve enhanced results with extended historical data.
  These findings offer significant practical implications for cryptocurrency stakeholders, providing empirically-validated guidance for fee-sensitive decision making while illuminating critical considerations in model selection based on data constraints. The study establishes a foundation for advanced fee prediction while highlighting the current advantages of traditional statistical methods in this domain.</p>

The update algorithm estimates optimal parameters by computing the changes in parameters and gradients between consecutive training steps and leveraging the local curvature of the loss landscape derived from these changes. However, this update rule has potential instability, and to address that, we introduce an adaptive switching mechanism that dynamically selects between Adam and EAGLE update rules to enhance training stability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Fel</p>
<p>Abstract: This thesis explores advanced approaches to improve explainability in computer vision by analyzing and modeling the features exploited by deep neural networks. Initially, it evaluates attribution methods, notably saliency maps, by introducing a metric based on algorithmic stability and an approach utilizing Sobol indices, which, through quasi-Monte Carlo sequences, allows a significant reduction in computation time. In addition, the EVA method offers a first formulation of attribution with formal guarantees via verified perturbation analysis.
  Experimental results indicate that in complex scenarios these methods do not provide sufficient understanding, particularly because they identify only "where" the model focuses without clarifying "what" it perceives. Two hypotheses are therefore examined: aligning models with human reasoning -- through the introduction of a training routine that integrates the imitation of human explanations and optimization within the space of 1-Lipschitz functions -- and adopting a conceptual explainability approach.
  The CRAFT method is proposed to automate the extraction of the concepts used by the model and to assess their importance, complemented by MACO, which enables their visualization. These works converge towards a unified framework, illustrated by an interactive demonstration applied to the 1000 ImageNet classes in a ResNet model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides unique insights into fetal brain microstructure in utero. Longitudinal and cross-sectional fetal dMRI studies can reveal crucial neurodevelopmental changes but require precise spatial alignment across scans and subjects. This is challenging due to low data quality, rapid brain development, and limited anatomical landmarks. Existing registration methods, designed for high-quality adult data, struggle with these complexities. To address this, we introduce FetDTIAlign, a deep learning approach for fetal brain dMRI registration, enabling accurate affine and deformable alignment. FetDTIAlign features a dual-encoder architecture and iterative feature-based inference, reducing the impact of noise and low resolution. It optimizes network configurations and domain-specific features at each registration stage, enhancing both robustness and accuracy. We validated FetDTIAlign on data from 23 to 36 weeks gestation, covering 60 white matter tracts. It consistently outperformed two classical optimization-based methods and a deep learning pipeline, achieving superior anatomical correspondence. Further validation on external data from the Developing Human Connectome Project confirmed its generalizability across acquisition protocols. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning for fetal brain dMRI registration, providing a more accurate and reliable alternative to classical techniques. By enabling precise cross-subject and tract-specific analyses, FetDTIAlign supports new discoveries in early brain development.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of biological data analysis tools and large language models (LLMs) has opened up new possibilities for utilizing AI in plant science research, with the potential to contribute significantly to knowledge integration and research gap identification. Nonetheless, current LLMs struggle to handle complex biological data and theoretical models in photosynthesis research and often fail to provide accurate scientific contexts. Therefore, this study proposed a photosynthesis research assistant (PRAG) based on OpenAI's GPT-4o with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques and prompt optimization. Vector databases and an automated feedback loop were used in the prompt optimization process to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the responses to photosynthesis-related queries. PRAG showed an average improvement of 8.7% across five metrics related to scientific writing, with a 25.4% increase in source transparency. Additionally, its scientific depth and domain coverage were comparable to those of photosynthesis research papers. A knowledge graph was used to structure PRAG's responses with papers within and outside the database, which allowed PRAG to match key entities with 63% and 39.5% of the database and test papers, respectively. PRAG can be applied for photosynthesis research and broader plant science domains, paving the way for more in-depth data analysis and predictive capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sriram Ranga, Nandish Chattopadhyay, Anupam Chattopadhyay</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the learnability of the nonlinearity property of Boolean functions using neural networks. We train encoder style deep neural networks to learn to predict the nonlinearity of Boolean functions from examples of functions in the form of a truth table and their corresponding nonlinearity values. We report empirical results to show that deep neural networks are able to learn to predict the property for functions in 4 and 5 variables with an accuracy above 95%. While these results are positive and a disciplined analysis is being presented for the first time in this regard, we should also underline the statutory warning that it seems quite challenging to extend the idea to higher number of variables, and it is also not clear whether one can get advantage in terms of time and space complexity over the existing combinatorial algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vernon Y. H. Toh, Yew Ken Chia, Deepanway Ghosal, Soujanya Poria</p>
<p>Abstract: The releases of OpenAI's o1 and o3 mark a significant paradigm shift in Large Language Models towards advanced reasoning capabilities. Notably, o3 outperformed humans in novel problem-solving and skill acquisition on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI). However, this benchmark is limited to symbolic patterns, whereas humans often perceive and reason about multimodal scenarios involving both vision and language data. Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate advanced reasoning capabilities in multimodal tasks. To this end, we track the evolution of the GPT-[n] and o-[n] series models on challenging multimodal puzzles, requiring fine-grained visual perception with abstract or algorithmic reasoning. The superior performance of o1 comes at nearly 750 times the computational cost of GPT-4o, raising concerns about its efficiency. Our results reveal a clear upward trend in reasoning capabilities across model iterations, with notable performance jumps across GPT-series models and subsequently to o1. Nonetheless, we observe that the o1 model still struggles with simple multimodal puzzles requiring abstract reasoning. Furthermore, its performance in algorithmic puzzles remains poor. We plan to continuously track new models in the series and update our results in this paper accordingly.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiali Cheng, Hadi Amiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are often trained on datasets of query-response pairs, which embed the ability to use tools or APIs directly into the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Tool-augmented LLMs need the ability to forget learned tools due to security vulnerabilities, privacy regulations, or tool deprecations. However, ``tool unlearning'' has not been investigated in unlearning literature. We introduce this novel task, which requires addressing distinct challenges compared to traditional unlearning: knowledge removal rather than forgetting individual samples, the high cost of optimizing LLMs, and the need for principled evaluation metrics. To bridge these gaps, we propose ToolDelete, the first approach for unlearning tools from tool-augmented LLMs. It implements three key properties to address the above challenges for effective tool unlearning and introduces a new membership inference attack (MIA) model for effective evaluation. Extensive experiments on multiple tool learning datasets and tool-augmented LLMs show that ToolDelete effectively unlearns randomly selected tools, while preserving the LLM's knowledge on non-deleted tools and maintaining performance on general tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiali Chen, Xusen Hei, Yuqi Xue, Zihan Wu, Jiayuan Xie, Yi Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Chinese literary classics hold significant cultural and educational value, offering deep insights into morality, history, and human nature. These works often include classical Chinese and complex narratives, making them difficult for children to read. To bridge this gap, we introduce a child-friendly literary adaptation (CLA) task to adapt the Chinese literary classic into engaging and accessible text for children. However, recent large language models (LLMs) overlook children's reading preferences (\ie, vivid character portrayals, concise narrative structures, and appropriate readability), which poses challenges in CLA. In this paper, we propose a method called InstructChild, which augments the LLM with these preferences for adaptation. Specifically, we first obtain the characters' personalities and narrative structure as additional information for fine-grained instruction tuning. Then, we devise a readability metric as the reward to align the LLM with the children's reading level. Finally, a lookahead decoding strategy is applied to improve the readability of the generated text during inference. To support the evaluation of CLA task, we construct the Classic4Children dataset, which comprises both the original and child-friendly versions of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. Experimental results show that our InstructChild significantly improves automatic and human evaluation performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the era of pervasive internet use and the dominance of social networks, researchers face significant challenges in Persian text mining including the scarcity of adequate datasets in Persian and the inefficiency of existing language models. This paper specifically tackles these challenges, aiming to amplify the efficiency of language models tailored to the Persian language. Focusing on enhancing the effectiveness of sentiment analysis, our approach employs an aspect-based methodology utilizing the ParsBERT model, augmented with a relevant lexicon. The study centers on sentiment analysis of user opinions extracted from the Persian website 'Digikala.' The experimental results not only highlight the proposed method's superior semantic capabilities but also showcase its efficiency gains with an accuracy of 88.2% and an F1 score of 61.7. The importance of enhancing language models in this context lies in their pivotal role in extracting nuanced sentiments from user-generated content, ultimately advancing the field of sentiment analysis in Persian text mining by increasing efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advancement of generative artificial intelligence, previous studies have achieved the task of generating aesthetic images from hand-drawn sketches, fulfilling the public's needs for drawing. However, these methods are limited to static images and lack the ability to control video animation generation using hand-drawn sketches. To address this gap, we propose VidSketch, the first method capable of generating high-quality video animations directly from any number of hand-drawn sketches and simple text prompts, bridging the divide between ordinary users and professional artists. Specifically, our method introduces a Level-Based Sketch Control Strategy to automatically adjust the guidance strength of sketches during the generation process, accommodating users with varying drawing skills. Furthermore, a TempSpatial Attention mechanism is designed to enhance the spatiotemporal consistency of generated video animations, significantly improving the coherence across frames.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mithun Saha, Maxwell A. Xu, Wanting Mao, Sameer Neupane, James M. Rehg, Santosh Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based foundation models are gaining traction due to the widespread use of PPG in biosignal monitoring and their potential to generalize across diverse health applications. In this paper, we introduce Pulse-PPG, the first open-source PPG foundation model trained exclusively on raw PPG data collected over a 100-day field study with 120 participants. Existing PPG foundation models are either open-source but trained on clinical data or closed-source, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We evaluate Pulse-PPG across multiple datasets and downstream tasks, comparing its performance against a state-of-the-art foundation model trained on clinical data. Our results demonstrate that Pulse-PPG, trained on uncurated field data, exhibits superior generalization across clinical and mobile health applications in both lab and field settings. This suggests that exposure to real-world variability enables the model to learn fine-grained representations, making it more adaptable across tasks. Furthermore, pre-training on field data surprisingly outperforms its pre-training on clinical data in many tasks, reinforcing the importance of training on real-world, diverse datasets. To encourage further advancements in robust foundation models leveraging field data, we plan to release Pulse-PPG, providing researchers with a powerful resource for developing more generalizable PPG-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijun Cheng, Randy Harsuko, Tariq Alkhalifah</p>
<p>Abstract: Seismic data often face challenges in their utilization due to noise contamination, incomplete acquisition, and limited low-frequency information, which hinder accurate subsurface imaging and interpretation. Traditional processing methods rely heavily on task-specific designs to address these challenges and fail to account for the variability of data. To address these limitations, we present a generative seismic foundation model (GSFM), a unified framework based on generative diffusion models (GDMs), designed to tackle multi-task seismic processing challenges, including denoising, backscattered noise attenuation, interpolation, and low-frequency extrapolation. GSFM leverages a pre-training stage on synthetic data to capture the features of clean, complete, and broadband seismic data distributions and applies an iterative fine-tuning strategy to adapt the model to field data. By adopting a target-oriented diffusion process prediction, GSFM improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Synthetic data tests demonstrate GSFM surpasses benchmarks with equivalent architectures in all tasks and achieves performance comparable to traditional pre-training strategies, even after their fine-tuning. Also, field data tests suggest that our iterative fine-tuning approach addresses the generalization limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms, delivering significantly enhanced performance across diverse tasks. Furthermore, GSFM's inherent probabilistic nature enables effective uncertainty quantification, offering valuable insights into the reliability of processing results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linhao Luo, Zicheng Zhao, Gholamreza Haffari, Dinh Phung, Chen Gong, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunchuan Guan, Yu Liu, Ke Zhou, Zhiqi Shen, Serge Belongie, Jenq-Neng Hwang, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation, particularly in scenarios like multi-task learning that require frequent weight updates. However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://github.com/tuantuange/Lt-Di.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahang Sun, Zhiyong Wang, Runhan Yang, Chenjun Xiao, John C. S. Lui, Zhongxiang Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted to solve sequential decision-making tasks such as multi-armed bandits (MAB), in which an LLM is directly instructed to select the arms to pull in every iteration. However, this paradigm of direct arm selection using LLMs has been shown to be suboptimal in many MAB tasks. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach which combines the strengths of classical MAB and LLMs. Specifically, we adopt a classical MAB algorithm as the high-level framework and leverage the strong in-context learning capability of LLMs to perform the sub-task of reward prediction. Firstly, we incorporate the LLM-based reward predictor into the classical Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm and adopt a decaying schedule for the LLM temperature to ensure a transition from exploration to exploitation. Next, we incorporate the LLM-based reward predictor (with a temperature of 0) into a regression oracle-based MAB algorithm equipped with an explicit exploration mechanism. We also extend our TS-based algorithm to dueling bandits where only the preference feedback between pairs of arms is available, which requires non-trivial algorithmic modifications. We conduct empirical evaluations using both synthetic MAB tasks and experiments designed using real-world text datasets, in which the results show that our algorithms consistently outperform previous baseline methods based on direct arm selection. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that in challenging tasks where the arms lack semantic meanings that can be exploited by the LLM, our approach achieves considerably better performance than LLM-based direct arm selection.</p>

<p>Abstract: When multiple influencers attempt to compete for a receiver's attention, their influencing strategies must account for the presence of one another. We introduce the Battling Influencers Game (BIG), a multi-player simultaneous-move general-sum game, to provide a game-theoretic characterization of this social phenomenon. We prove that BIG is a potential game, that it has either one or an infinite number of pure Nash equilibria (NEs), and these pure NEs can be found by convex optimization. Interestingly, we also prove that at any pure NE, all (except at most one) influencers must exaggerate their actions to the maximum extent. In other words, it is rational for the influencers to be non-truthful and extreme because they anticipate other influencers to cancel out part of their influence. We discuss the implications of BIG to value alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Malhotra</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid adoption of pervasive and mobile computing has led to an unprecedented rate of data production and consumption by mobile applications at the network edge. These applications often require interactions such as data exchange, behavior coordination, and collaboration, which are typically mediated by cloud servers. While cloud computing has been effective for distributed systems, challenges like latency, cost, and intermittent connectivity persist. With the advent of 5G technology, features like location-awareness and device-to-device (D2D) communication enable a more distributed and adaptive architecture. This paper introduces Self-Organizing Interaction Spaces (SOIS), a novel framework for engineering pervasive applications. SOIS leverages the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of mobile nodes, allowing them to form adaptive organizational structures based on their individual and social contexts. The framework provides two key abstractions for modeling and programming pervasive applications using an organizational mindset and mechanisms for adapting dynamic organizational structures. Case examples and performance evaluations of a simulated mobile crowd-sensing application demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of SOIS. Results highlight its potential to enhance efficiency and reduce reliance on traditional cloud models, paving the way for innovative solutions in mobile and distributed environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Chen, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, Lijie Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing process compliance monitoring approaches detect compliance violations in an ex post manner. Only predicate prediction focuses on predicting them. However, predicate prediction provides a binary yes/no notion of compliance, lacking the ability to measure to which extent an ongoing process instance deviates from the desired state as specified in constraints. Here, being able to quantify the magnitude of violation would provide organizations with deeper insights into their operational performance, enabling informed decision making to reduce or mitigate the risk of non-compliance. Thus, we propose two predictive compliance monitoring approaches to close this research gap. The first approach reformulates the binary classification problem as a hybrid task that considers both classification and regression, while the second employs a multi-task learning method to explicitly predict the compliance status and the magnitude of violation for deviant cases simultaneously. In this work, we focus on temporal constraints as they are significant in almost any application domain, e.g., health care. The evaluation on synthetic and real-world event logs demonstrates that our approaches are capable of quantifying the magnitude of violations while maintaining comparable performance for compliance predictions achieved by state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humanoid robots hold the potential for unparalleled versatility in performing human-like, whole-body skills. However, achieving agile and coordinated whole-body motions remains a significant challenge due to the dynamics mismatch between simulation and the real world. Existing approaches, such as system identification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR) methods, often rely on labor-intensive parameter tuning or result in overly conservative policies that sacrifice agility. In this paper, we present ASAP (Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics), a two-stage framework designed to tackle the dynamics mismatch and enable agile humanoid whole-body skills. In the first stage, we pre-train motion tracking policies in simulation using retargeted human motion data. In the second stage, we deploy the policies in the real world and collect real-world data to train a delta (residual) action model that compensates for the dynamics mismatch. Then, ASAP fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the delta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with real-world dynamics. We evaluate ASAP across three transfer scenarios: IsaacGym to IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body coordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared to SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines. ASAP enables highly agile motions that were previously difficult to achieve, demonstrating the potential of delta action learning in bridging simulation and real-world dynamics. These results suggest a promising sim-to-real direction for developing more expressive and agile humanoids.</p>

However, alongside their impressive capabilities, ethical concerns and new types of attacks, such as jailbreaking, have emerged. While most prompting techniques focus on optimizing adversarial inputs for individual cases, resulting in higher computational costs when dealing with large datasets. Less research has addressed the more general setting of training a universal attacker that can transfer to unseen tasks. In this paper, we introduce JUMP, a prompt-based method designed to jailbreak LLMs using universal multi-prompts. We also adapt our approach for defense, which we term DUMP.

We employ a template-based question generation framework, enabling scalable and diverse multiple-choice questions curated from graduate-level atmospheric science problems. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of representative LLMs, categorized into four groups: instruction-tuned models, advanced reasoning models, math-augmented models, and domain-specific climate models. Our analysis provides some interesting insights into the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in atmospheric science. We believe AtmosSci-Bench can serve as a critical step toward advancing LLM applications in climate service by offering a standard and rigorous evaluation framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Lai, Alexander Fraser, Ivan Titov</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, are commonly used to adapt LLMs. However, the effectiveness of standard PEFT methods is limited in low-resource scenarios with only a few hundred examples. Recent advances in interpretability research have inspired the emergence of activation editing techniques, which modify the activations of specific model components. These methods, due to their extremely small parameter counts, show promise for small datasets. However, their performance is highly dependent on identifying the correct modules to edit and often lacks stability across different datasets. In this paper, we propose Joint Localization and Activation Editing (JoLA), a method that jointly learns (1) which heads in the Transformer to edit (2) whether the intervention should be additive, multiplicative, or both and (3) the intervention parameters themselves - the vectors applied as additive offsets or multiplicative scalings to the head output. Through evaluations on three benchmarks spanning commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding, and natural language generation, we demonstrate that JoLA consistently outperforms existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokjin Oh, Keonwoong Noh, Woohwan Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant advances in neural machine translation, performance remains subpar for low-resource language pairs. Ensembling multiple systems is a widely adopted technique to enhance performance, often accomplished by combining probability distributions. However, the previous approaches face the challenge of high computational costs for training multiple models. Furthermore, for black-box models, averaging token-level probabilities at each decoding step is not feasible. To address the problems of multi-model ensemble methods, we present a pivot-based single model ensemble. The proposed strategy consists of two steps: pivot-based candidate generation and post-hoc aggregation. In the first step, we generate candidates through pivot translation. This can be achieved with only a single model and facilitates knowledge transfer from high-resource pivot languages, resulting in candidates that are not only diverse but also more accurate. Next, in the aggregation step, we select k high-quality candidates from the generated candidates and merge them to generate a final translation that outperforms the existing candidates. Our experimental results show that our method produces translations of superior quality by leveraging candidates from pivot translation to capture the subtle nuances of the source sentence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankur Samanta, Rohan Gupta, Aditi Misra, Christian McIntosh Clarke, Jayakumar Rajadas</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular property prediction uses molecular structure to infer chemical properties. Chemically interpretable representations that capture meaningful intramolecular interactions enhance the usability and effectiveness of these predictions. However, existing methods often rely on atom-based or rule-based fragment tokenization, which can be chemically suboptimal and lack scalability. We introduce FragmentNet, a graph-to-sequence foundation model with an adaptive, learned tokenizer that decomposes molecular graphs into chemically valid fragments while preserving structural connectivity. FragmentNet integrates VQVAE-GCN for hierarchical fragment embeddings, spatial positional encodings for graph serialization, global molecular descriptors, and a transformer. Pre-trained with Masked Fragment Modeling and fine-tuned on MoleculeNet tasks, FragmentNet outperforms models with similarly scaled architectures and datasets while rivaling larger state-of-the-art models requiring significantly more resources. This novel framework enables adaptive decomposition, serialization, and reconstruction of molecular graphs, facilitating fragment-based editing and visualization of property trends in learned embeddings - a powerful tool for molecular design and optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Ohayon, Hila Manor, Tomer Michaeli, Michael Elad</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiduo Huang, Zhenhua Liu, Tian Xia, Wenzhe zhao, Pengju Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Model quantization is widely applied for compressing and accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs). However, conventional Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) focuses on training DNNs with uniform bit-width. The bit-width settings vary across different hardware and transmission demands, which induces considerable training and storage costs. Hence, the scheme of one-shot joint training multiple precisions is proposed to address this issue. Previous works either store a larger FP32 model to switch between different precision models for higher accuracy or store a smaller INT8 model but compromise accuracy due to using shared quantization parameters. In this paper, we introduce the Double Rounding quantization method, which fully utilizes the quantized representation range to accomplish nearly lossless bit-switching while reducing storage by using the highest integer precision instead of full precision. Furthermore, we observe a competitive interference among different precisions during one-shot joint training, primarily due to inconsistent gradients of quantization scales during backward propagation. To tackle this problem, we propose an Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling (ALRS) technique that dynamically adapts learning rates for various precisions to optimize the training process. Additionally, we extend our Double Rounding to one-shot mixed precision training and develop a Hessian-Aware Stochastic Bit-switching (HASB) strategy. Experimental results on the ImageNet-1K classification demonstrate that our methods have enough advantages to state-of-the-art one-shot joint QAT in both multi-precision and mixed-precision. We also validate the feasibility of our method on detection and segmentation tasks, as well as on LLMs task. Our codes are available at https://github.com/haiduo/Double-Rounding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhizhen Zhang, Lei Zhu, Zhen Fang, Zi Huang, Yadan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-training vision-language representations on human action videos has emerged as a promising approach to reduce reliance on large-scale expert demonstrations for training embodied agents. However, prior methods often employ time contrastive learning based on goal-reaching heuristics, progressively aligning language instructions from the initial to the final frame. This overemphasis on future frames can result in erroneous vision-language associations, as actions may terminate early or include irrelevant moments in the end. To address this issue, we propose Action Temporal Coherence Learning (AcTOL) to learn ordered and continuous vision-language representations without rigid goal-based constraint. AcTOL treats a video as a continuous trajectory where it (1) contrasts semantic differences between frames to reflect their natural ordering, and (2) imposes a local Brownian bridge constraint to ensure smooth transitions across intermediate frames. Extensive imitation learning experiments across varying numbers of demonstrations show that the pretrained features significantly enhance downstream manipulation tasks by up to 49% with high robustness to different linguistic styles of instructions, offering a viable pathway toward generalized embodied agents.

<p>Abstract: Large language models are typically trained on vast amounts of data during the pre-training phase, which may include some potentially harmful information. Fine-tuning attacks can exploit this by prompting the model to reveal such behaviours, leading to the generation of harmful content. In this paper, we focus on investigating the performance of the Chain of Thought based reasoning model, DeepSeek, when subjected to fine-tuning attacks. Specifically, we explore how fine-tuning manipulates the model's output, exacerbating the harmfulness of its responses while examining the interaction between the Chain of Thought reasoning and adversarial inputs. Through this study, we aim to shed light on the vulnerability of Chain of Thought enabled models to fine-tuning attacks and the implications for their safety and ethical deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanhe Zhang, Fanghui Liu, Yudong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies how to improve the performance of Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) as guided by our theoretical analysis. Our first set of theoretical results show that for random initialization and linear models, \textit{i)} LoRA will align to the certain singular subspace of one-step gradient of full fine-tuning; \textit{ii)} preconditioners improve convergence in the high-rank case. These insights motivate us to focus on preconditioned LoRA using a specific spectral initialization strategy for aligning with certain subspaces. For both linear and nonlinear models, we prove that alignment and generalization guarantees can be directly achieved at initialization, and the subsequent linear convergence can be also built. Our analysis leads to the \emph{LoRA-One} algorithm (using \emph{One}-step gradient and preconditioning), a theoretically grounded algorithm that achieves significant empirical improvement over vanilla LoRA and its variants on several benchmarks. Our theoretical analysis, based on decoupling the learning dynamics and characterizing how spectral initialization contributes to feature learning, may be of independent interest for understanding matrix sensing and deep learning theory.

<p>Abstract: Language models exhibit complex, diverse behaviors when prompted with free-form text, making it difficult to characterize the space of possible outputs. We study the problem of behavior elicitation, where the goal is to search for prompts that induce specific target behaviors (e.g., hallucinations or harmful responses) from a target language model. To navigate the exponentially large space of possible prompts, we train investigator models to map randomly-chosen target behaviors to a diverse distribution of outputs that elicit them, similar to amortized Bayesian inference. We do this through supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning via DPO, and a novel Frank-Wolfe training objective to iteratively discover diverse prompting strategies. Our investigator models surface a variety of effective and human-interpretable prompts leading to jailbreaks, hallucinations, and open-ended aberrant behaviors, obtaining a 100% attack success rate on a subset of AdvBench (Harmful Behaviors) and an 85% hallucination rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengfeng Zhou, Ji Wang, Juanjuan Qin, Yining Wang, Ling Sun, Weiwei Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise across various medical applications, with ophthalmology being a notable area of focus. Many ophthalmic tasks have shown substantial improvement through the integration of LLMs. However, before these models can be widely adopted in clinical practice, evaluating their capabilities and identifying their limitations is crucial. To address this research gap and support the real-world application of LLMs, we introduce the OphthBench, a specialized benchmark designed to assess LLM performance within the context of Chinese ophthalmic practices. This benchmark systematically divides a typical ophthalmic clinical workflow into five key scenarios: Education, Triage, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis. For each scenario, we developed multiple tasks featuring diverse question types, resulting in a comprehensive benchmark comprising 9 tasks and 591 questions. This comprehensive framework allows for a thorough assessment of LLMs' capabilities and provides insights into their practical application in Chinese ophthalmology. Using this benchmark, we conducted extensive experiments and analyzed the results from 39 popular LLMs. Our evaluation highlights the current gap between LLM development and its practical utility in clinical settings, providing a clear direction for future advancements. By bridging this gap, we aim to unlock the potential of LLMs and advance their development in ophthalmology.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates scalable neural networks with learnable activation functions based on orthogonal function bases and tropical polynomials, targeting ImageNet-1K classification and next token prediction on OpenWebText. Traditional activations, such as ReLU, are static. In contrast, learnable activations enable the network to adapt dynamically during training. However, stability issues, such as vanishing or exploding gradients, arise with improper variance management in deeper networks. To remedy this, we propose an initialization scheme that single-handedly preserves unitary variance in transformers and convolutional networks, ensuring stable gradient flow even in deep architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that networks with Hermite, Fourier, and Tropical-based learnable activations significantly improve over GPT-2 and ConvNeXt networks in terms of accuracy and perplexity in train and test, highlighting the viability of learnable activations in large-scale tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eslam Eldeeb, Hirley Alves</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been a promising essence in future 5G-beyond and 6G systems. Its main advantage lies in its robust model-free decision-making in complex and large-dimension wireless environments. However, most existing RL frameworks rely on online interaction with the environment, which might not be feasible due to safety and cost concerns. Another problem with online RL is the lack of scalability of the designed algorithm with dynamic or new environments. This work proposes a novel, resilient, few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm combining offline RL using conservative Q-learning (CQL) and meta-learning using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). The proposed algorithm can train RL models using static offline datasets without any online interaction with the environments. In addition, with the aid of MAML, the proposed model can be scaled up to new unseen environments. We showcase the proposed algorithm for optimizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 's trajectory and scheduling policy to minimize the age-of-information (AoI) and transmission power of limited-power devices. Numerical results show that the proposed few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm converges faster than baseline schemes, such as deep Q-networks and CQL. In addition, it is the only algorithm that can achieve optimal joint AoI and transmission power using an offline dataset with few shots of data points and is resilient to network failures due to unprecedented environmental changes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly competent across various domains, educators are showing a growing interest in integrating these LLMs into the learning process. Especially in software engineering, LLMs have demonstrated qualitatively better capabilities in code summarization, code generation, and debugging. Despite various research on LLMs for software engineering tasks in practice, limited research captures the benefits of LLMs for pedagogical advancements and their impact on the student learning process. To this extent, we analyze 126 undergraduate students' interaction with an AI assistant during a 13-week semester to understand the benefits of AI for software engineering learning. We analyze the conversations, code generated, code utilized, and the human intervention levels to integrate the code into the code base.
  Our findings suggest that students prefer ChatGPT over CoPilot. Our analysis also finds that ChatGPT generates responses with lower computational complexity compared to CoPilot. Furthermore, conversational-based interaction helps improve the quality of the code generated compared to auto-generated code. Early adoption of LLMs in software engineering is crucial to remain competitive in the rapidly developing landscape. Hence, the next generation of software engineers must acquire the necessary skills to interact with AI to improve productivity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a crucial step in achieving strong predictive performance. However, the impact of individual hyperparameters on model generalization is highly context-dependent, prohibiting a one-size-fits-all solution and requiring opaque automated machine learning (AutoML) systems to find optimal configurations. The black-box nature of most AutoML systems undermines user trust and discourages adoption. To address this, we propose a game-theoretic explainability framework for HPO that is based on Shapley values and interactions. Our approach provides an additive decomposition of a performance measure across hyperparameters, enabling local and global explanations of hyperparameter importance and interactions. The framework, named HyperSHAP, offers insights into ablations, the tunability of learning algorithms, and optimizer behavior across different hyperparameter spaces. We evaluate HyperSHAP on various HPO benchmarks by analyzing the interaction structure of the HPO problem. Our results show that while higher-order interactions exist, most performance improvements can be explained by focusing on lower-order representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphs have emerged as an important foundation for a variety of applications, including capturing and reasoning over factual knowledge, semantic data integration, social networks, and providing factual knowledge for machine learning algorithms. To formalise certain properties of the data and to ensure data quality, there is a need to describe the schema of such graphs. Because of the breadth of applications and availability of different data models, such as RDF and property graphs, both the Semantic Web and the database community have independently developed graph schema languages: SHACL, ShEx, and PG-Schema. Each language has its unique approach to defining constraints and validating graph data, leaving potential users in the dark about their commonalities and differences. In this paper, we provide formal, concise definitions of the core components of each of these schema languages. We employ a uniform framework to facilitate a comprehensive comparison between the languages and identify a common set of functionalities, shedding light on both overlapping and distinctive features of the three languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiduo Huang, Tian Xia, Wenzhe zhao, Pengju Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing a module or mechanism that enables a network to maintain low parameters and FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and throughput remains a challenge. To address this challenge and exploit the redundancy within feature map channels, we propose a new solution: partial channel mechanism (PCM). Specifically, through the split operation, the feature map channels are divided into different parts, with each part corresponding to different operations, such as convolution, attention, pooling, and identity mapping. Based on this assumption, we introduce a novel partial attention convolution (PATConv) that can efficiently combine convolution with visual attention. Our exploration indicates that the PATConv can completely replace both the regular convolution and the regular visual attention while reducing model parameters and FLOPs. Moreover, PATConv can derive three new types of blocks: Partial Channel-Attention block (PAT_ch), Partial Spatial-Attention block (PAT_sp), and Partial Self-Attention block (PAT_sf). In addition, we propose a novel dynamic partial convolution (DPConv) that can adaptively learn the proportion of split channels in different layers to achieve better trade-offs. Building on PATConv and DPConv, we propose a new hybrid network family, named PartialNet, which achieves superior top-1 accuracy and inference speed compared to some SOTA models on ImageNet-1K classification and excels in both detection and segmentation on the COCO dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Tarasov, Petr Mokrov, Milena Gazdieva, Evgeny Burnaev, Alexander Korotin</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network based Optimal Transport (OT) is a recent and fruitful direction in the generative modeling community. It finds its applications in various fields such as domain translation, image super-resolution, computational biology and others. Among the existing approaches to OT, of considerable interest are adversarial minimax solvers based on semi-dual formulations of OT problems. While promising, these methods lack theoretical investigation from a statistical learning perspective. Our work fills this gap by establishing upper bounds on the generalization error of an approximate OT map recovered by the minimax quadratic OT solver. Importantly, the bounds we derive depend solely on some standard statistical and mathematical properties of the considered functional classes (neural networks). While our analysis focuses on the quadratic OT, we believe that similar bounds could be derived for more general OT formulations, paving the promising direction for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nimisha Ghosh, Pratik Dutta, Daniele Santoni</p>
<p>Abstract: Transcription factors are proteins that regulate the expression of genes by binding to specific genomic regions known as Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs), typically located in the promoter regions of those genes. Accurate prediction of these binding sites is essential for understanding the complex gene regulatory networks underlying various cellular functions. In this regard, many deep learning models have been developed for such prediction, but there is still scope of improvement. In this work, we have developed a deep learning model which uses pre-trained DNABERT, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module, a Modified Convolutional Block Attention Module (MCBAM), a Multi-Scale Convolutions with Attention (MSCA) module and an output module. The pre-trained DNABERT is used for sequence embedding, thereby capturing the long-term dependencies in the DNA sequences while the CNN, MCBAM and MSCA modules are useful in extracting higher-order local features. TFBS-Finder is trained and tested on 165 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets. We have also performed ablation studies as well as cross-cell line validations and comparisons with other models. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method in predicting TFBSs compared to the existing methodologies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Wang, Yao-Hui Li, Xin Li, Hongyu Zang, Romain Laroche, Riashat Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-View Reinforcement Learning (MVRL) seeks to provide agents with multi-view observations, enabling them to perceive environment with greater effectiveness and precision. Recent advancements in MVRL focus on extracting latent representations from multiview observations and leveraging them in control tasks. However, it is not straightforward to learn compact and task-relevant representations, particularly in the presence of redundancy, distracting information, or missing views. In this paper, we propose Multi-view Fusion State for Control (MFSC), firstly incorporating bisimulation metric learning into MVRL to learn task-relevant representations. Furthermore, we propose a multiview-based mask and latent reconstruction auxiliary task that exploits shared information across views and improves MFSC's robustness in missing views by introducing a mask token. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in MVRL tasks. Even in more realistic scenarios with interference or missing views, MFSC consistently maintains high performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangyeon Park, Isaac Han, Seungwon Oh, Kyung-Joong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Plasticity loss, a critical challenge in neural network training, limits a model's ability to adapt to new tasks or shifts in data distribution. This paper introduces AID (Activation by Interval-wise Dropout), a novel method inspired by Dropout, designed to address plasticity loss. Unlike Dropout, AID generates subnetworks by applying Dropout with different probabilities on each preactivation interval. Theoretical analysis reveals that AID regularizes the network, promoting behavior analogous to that of deep linear networks, which do not suffer from plasticity loss. We validate the effectiveness of AID in maintaining plasticity across various benchmarks, including continual learning tasks on standard image classification datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet. Furthermore, we show that AID enhances reinforcement learning performance in the Arcade Learning Environment benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Pratap, Amit Pathak</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era dominated by datafication, the reduction of human experiences to quantifiable metrics raises profound philosophical and ethical questions. This paper explores these issues through the lens of Meursault, the protagonist of Albert Camus' The Stranger, whose emotionally detached existence epitomizes the existential concept of absurdity. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques including emotion detection (BERT), sentiment analysis (VADER), and named entity recognition (spaCy)-this study quantifies key events and behaviors in Meursault's life. Our analysis reveals the inherent limitations of applying algorithmic models to complex human experiences, particularly those rooted in existential alienation and moral ambiguity. By examining how modern AI tools misinterpret Meursault's actions and emotions, this research underscores the broader ethical dilemmas of reducing nuanced human narratives to data points, challenging the foundational assumptions of our data-driven society. The findings presented in this paper serve as a critique of the increasing reliance on data-driven narratives and advocate for incorporating humanistic values in artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rule-based models play a crucial role in scenarios that require transparency and accountable decision-making. However, they primarily consist of discrete parameters and structures, which presents challenges for scalability and optimization. In this work, we introduce a new rule-based classifier trained using gradient descent, in which the user can control the maximum number and length of the rules. For numerical partitions, the user can also control the partitions used with fuzzy sets, which also helps keep the number of partitions small. We perform a series of exhaustive experiments on $40$ datasets to show how this classifier performs in terms of accuracy and rule base size. Then, we compare our results with a genetic search that fits an equivalent classifier and with other explainable and non-explainable state-of-the-art classifiers. Our results show how our method can obtain compact rule bases that use significantly fewer patterns than other rule-based methods and perform better than other explainable classifiers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Psychological resilience, defined as the ability to rebound from adversity, is crucial for mental health. Compared with traditional resilience assessments through self-reported questionnaires, resilience assessments based on neurological data offer more objective results with biological markers, hence significantly enhancing credibility. This paper proposes a novel data-efficient model to address the scarcity of neurological data. We employ Neuro Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks as the structure of the prediction model. In the training stage, a new trait-informed multimodal representation algorithm with a smart chunk technique is proposed to learn the shared latent space with limited data. In the test stage, a new noise-informed inference algorithm is proposed to address the low signal-to-noise ratio of the neurological data. The proposed model not only shows impressive performance on both public datasets and self-constructed datasets but also provides some valuable psychological hypotheses for future research.</p>

However, fine-tuning these models with policy gradient methods, as is commonly done in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), remains a challenging task. We propose an efficient, broadly applicable, and theoretically justified policy gradient algorithm, called Score Entropy Policy Optimization (SEPO), for fine-tuning discrete diffusion models over non-differentiable rewards.

<p>Abstract: Accurate detection of traffic anomalies is crucial for effective urban traffic management and congestion mitigation. We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study fundamental limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for learning sparse matrix preconditioners. While recent works have shown promising results using GNNs to predict incomplete factorizations, we demonstrate that the local nature of message passing creates inherent barriers for capturing non-local dependencies required for optimal preconditioning. We introduce a new benchmark dataset of matrices where good sparse preconditioners exist but require non-local computations, constructed using both synthetic examples and real-world matrices. Our experimental results show that current GNN architectures struggle to approximate these preconditioners, suggesting the need for new architectural approaches beyond traditional message passing networks. We provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to explain these limitations, with implications for the broader use of GNNs in numerical linear algebra.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiteng Li, Mingyuan Xia, Jingyuan Zhang, Zheng Hui, Linghe Kong, Yulun Zhang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their substantial memory requirements present significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has emerged as a promising compression technique for LLMs, offering considerable reductions in memory overhead. However, existing SVD-based methods often struggle to effectively mitigate the errors introduced by SVD truncation, leading to a noticeable performance gap when compared to the original models. Furthermore, applying a uniform compression ratio across all transformer layers fails to account for the varying importance of different layers. To address these challenges, we propose AdaSVD, an adaptive SVD-based LLM compression approach. Specifically, AdaSVD introduces adaComp, which adaptively compensates for SVD truncation errors by alternately updating the singular matrices U and V^T. Additionally, AdaSVD introduces adaCR, which adaptively assigns layer-specific compression ratios based on the relative importance of each layer. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics demonstrate that AdaSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SVD-based methods, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced memory requirements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingi Jung, Saehuyng Lee, Eunji Kim, Sungroh Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Detailed image captioning is essential for tasks like data generation and aiding visually impaired individuals. High-quality captions require a balance between precision and recall, which remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we hypothesize that this limitation stems from weakening and increasingly noisy visual attention as responses lengthen. To address this issue, we propose SPARC (Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration), a training-free method that enhances the contribution of visual tokens during decoding. SPARC is founded on three key observations: (1) increasing the influence of all visual tokens reduces recall; thus, SPARC selectively amplifies visual tokens; (2) as captions lengthen, visual attention becomes noisier, so SPARC identifies critical visual tokens by leveraging attention differences across time steps; (3) as visual attention gradually weakens, SPARC reinforces it to preserve its influence. Our experiments, incorporating both automated and human evaluations, demonstrate that existing methods improve the precision of MLLMs at the cost of recall. In contrast, our proposed method enhances both precision and recall with minimal computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks face the stability-plasticity dilemma in continual learning, while the brain can maintain memories and remain adaptable. However, the biological strategies for continual learning and their potential to inspire learning algorithms in neural networks are poorly understood. This study presents a minimal model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate the biological strategies that support continual odor learning. We introduce the fly olfactory circuit as a plug-and-play component, termed the Fly Model, which can integrate with modern machine learning methods to address this dilemma. Our findings demonstrate that the Fly Model enhances both memory stability and learning plasticity, overcoming the limitations of current continual learning strategies. We validated its effectiveness across various challenging continual learning scenarios using commonly used datasets. The fly olfactory system serves as an elegant biological circuit for lifelong learning, offering a module that enhances continual learning with minimal additional computational cost for machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Rodriguez, William Seymour, Jose M. Del Alamo, Jose Such</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained unprecedented prominence, achieving widespread adoption across diverse domains and integrating deeply into society. The capability to fine-tune general-purpose LLMs, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), for specific tasks has facilitated the emergence of numerous Custom GPTs. These tailored models are increasingly made available through dedicated marketplaces, such as OpenAI's GPT Store. However, their black-box nature introduces significant safety and compliance risks. In this work, we present a scalable framework for the automated evaluation of Custom GPTs against OpenAI's usage policies, which define the permissible behaviors of these systems. Our framework integrates three core components: (1) automated discovery and data collection of models from the GPT store, (2) a red-teaming prompt generator tailored to specific policy categories and the characteristics of each target GPT, and (3) an LLM-as-a-judge technique to analyze each prompt-response pair for potential policy violations.
  We validate our framework with a manually annotated ground truth, and evaluate it through a large-scale study with 782 Custom GPTs across three categories: Romantic, Cybersecurity, and Academic GPTs. Our manual annotation process achieved an F1 score of 0.975 in identifying policy violations, confirming the reliability of the framework's assessments. The results reveal that 58.7% of the analyzed models exhibit indications of non-compliance, exposing weaknesses in the GPT store's review and approval processes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that a model's popularity does not correlate with compliance, and non-compliance issues largely stem from behaviors inherited from base models rather than user-driven customizations. We believe this approach is extendable to other chatbot platforms and policy domains, improving LLM-based systems safety.</p>

In this paper, we propose an improved fabric defect detection model based on YOLOv11. To enhance the detection of strip defects, we introduce a Strip Perception Module (SPM) that improves feature capture through multi-scale convolution. We further enhance the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) by integrating a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, resulting in the SE-SPPF module, which better integrates spatial and channel information for more effective defect feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a novel focal enhanced complete intersection over union (FECIoU) metric with adaptive weights, addressing scale differences and class imbalance by adjusting the weights of hard-to-detect instances through focal loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a 0.8-8.1% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) on the Tianchi dataset and a 1.6-13.2% improvement on our custom dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rise of social media, misinformation has become increasingly prevalent, fueled largely by the spread of rumors. This study explores the use of Large Language Model (LLM) agents within a novel framework to simulate and analyze the dynamics of rumor propagation across social networks. To this end, we design a variety of LLM-based agent types and construct four distinct network structures to conduct these simulations. Our framework assesses the effectiveness of different network constructions and agent behaviors in influencing the spread of rumors. Our results demonstrate that the framework can simulate rumor spreading across more than one hundred agents in various networks with thousands of edges. The evaluations indicate that network structure, personas, and spreading schemes can significantly influence rumor dissemination, ranging from no spread to affecting 83\% of agents in iterations, thereby offering a realistic simulation of rumor spread in social networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Marelli, Luca Magri, Federica Arrigoni, Giacomo Boracchi</p>
<p>Abstract: In industrial settings, weakly supervised (WS) methods are usually preferred over their fully supervised (FS) counterparts as they do not require costly manual annotations. Unfortunately, the segmentation masks obtained in the WS regime are typically poor in terms of accuracy. In this work, we present a WS method capable of producing accurate masks for semantic segmentation in the case of video streams. More specifically, we build saliency maps that exploit the temporal coherence between consecutive frames in a video, promoting consistency when objects appear in different frames. We apply our method in a waste-sorting scenario, where we perform weakly supervised video segmentation (WSVS) by training an auxiliary classifier that distinguishes between videos recorded before and after a human operator, who manually removes specific wastes from a conveyor belt. The saliency maps of this classifier identify materials to be removed, and we modify the classifier training to minimize differences between the saliency map of a central frame and those in adjacent frames, after having compensated object displacement. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the benefits of integrating temporal coherence directly during the training phase of the classifier. Code and dataset are available upon request.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dense process rewards have proven a more effective alternative to the sparse outcome-level rewards in the inference-time scaling of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks requiring complex multi-step reasoning. While dense rewards also offer an appealing choice for the reinforcement learning (RL) of LLMs since their fine-grained rewards have the potential to address some inherent issues of outcome rewards, such as training efficiency and credit assignment, this potential remains largely unrealized. This can be primarily attributed to the challenges of training process reward models (PRMs) online, where collecting high-quality process labels is prohibitively expensive, making them particularly vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose PRIME (Process Reinforcement through IMplicit rEwards), which enables online PRM updates using only policy rollouts and outcome labels through implict process rewards. PRIME combines well with various advantage functions and forgoes the dedicated reward model training phrase that existing approaches require, substantially reducing the development overhead. We demonstrate PRIME's effectiveness on competitional math and coding. Starting from Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, PRIME achieves a 15.1% average improvement across several key reasoning benchmarks over the SFT model. Notably, our resulting model, Eurus-2-7B-PRIME, surpasses Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on seven reasoning benchmarks with 10% of its training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have been widely applied, but can inadvertently encode sensitive or harmful information, raising significant safety concerns. Machine unlearning has emerged to alleviate this concern; however, existing training-time unlearning approaches, relying on coarse-grained loss combinations, have limitations in precisely separating knowledge and balancing removal effectiveness with model utility. In contrast, we propose Fine-grained Activation manipuLation by Contrastive Orthogonal uNalignment (FALCON), a novel representation-guided unlearning approach that leverages information-theoretic guidance for efficient parameter selection, employs contrastive mechanisms to enhance representation separation, and projects conflict gradients onto orthogonal subspaces to resolve conflicts between forgetting and retention objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FALCON achieves superior unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility, exhibiting robust resistance against knowledge recovery attempts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding time series data is crucial for multiple real-world applications. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in time series tasks, current approaches often rely on numerical data alone, overlooking the multimodal nature of time-dependent information, such as textual descriptions, visual data, and audio signals. Moreover, these methods underutilize LLMs' reasoning capabilities, limiting the analysis to surface-level interpretations instead of deeper temporal and multimodal reasoning. In this position paper, we argue that multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can enable more powerful and flexible reasoning for time series analysis, enhancing decision-making and real-world applications. We call on researchers and practitioners to leverage this potential by developing strategies that prioritize trust, interpretability, and robust reasoning in MLLMs. Lastly, we highlight key research directions, including novel reasoning paradigms, architectural innovations, and domain-specific applications, to advance time series reasoning with MLLMs.</p>

In this context, data augmentation methods like PixMix improve robustness but rely on generative arts and feature visualizations (FVis), which have copyright, drawing cost, and scalability issues. We propose MoireDB, a formula-generated interference-fringe image dataset for image augmentation enhancing robustness. MoireDB eliminates copyright concerns, reduces dataset assembly costs, and enhances robustness by leveraging illusory patterns. Experiments show that MoireDB augmented images outperforms traditional Fractal arts and FVis-based augmentations, making it a scalable and effective solution for improving model robustness against real-world degradations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christos Margadji, Andi Kuswoyo, Sebastian W. Pattinson</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to accurately produce geometries with specified properties is perhaps the most important characteristic of a manufacturing process. 3D printing is marked by exceptional design freedom and complexity but is also prone to geometric and other defects that must be resolved for it to reach its full potential. Ultimately, this will require both astute design decisions and timely parameter adjustments to maintain stability that is challenging even with expert human operators. While machine learning is widely investigated in 3D printing, existing methods typically overlook spatial features that vary across prints and thus find it difficult to produce desired geometries. Here, we encode volumetric representations of printed parts into neural fields and apply a new regularization strategy, based on minimizing the partial derivative of the field's output with respect to a single, non-learnable parameter. By thus encouraging small input changes to yield only small output variations, we encourage smooth interpolation between observed volumes and hence realistic geometry predictions. This framework therefore allows the extraction of 'imagined' 3D shapes, revealing how a part would look if manufactured under previously unseen parameters. The resulting continuous field is used for data-driven optimization to maximize geometric fidelity between expected and produced geometries, reducing post-processing, material waste, and production costs. By optimizing process parameters dynamically, our approach enables advanced planning strategies, potentially allowing manufacturers to better realize complex and feature-rich designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixi Bao, Chenhao Li, Yarden As, Andreas Krause, Marco Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents often struggle to perform well on tasks that differ from those encountered during training. This limitation presents a challenge to the broader deployment of RL in diverse and dynamic task settings. In this work, we introduce memory augmentation, a memory-based RL approach to improve task generalization. Our approach leverages task-structured augmentations to simulate plausible out-of-distribution scenarios and incorporates memory mechanisms to enable context-aware policy adaptation. Trained on a predefined set of tasks, our policy demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen tasks through memory augmentation without requiring additional interactions with the environment. Through extensive simulation experiments and real-world hardware evaluations on legged locomotion tasks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks while maintaining robust in-distribution performance and high sample efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaorui Ma, Haoran Xie, S. Joe Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of vision-language modalities has been a significant focus in multimodal learning, traditionally relying on Vision-Language Pretrained Models. However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a notable shift towards incorporating LLMs with vision modalities. Following this, the training paradigms for incorporating vision modalities into LLMs have evolved. Initially, the approach was to integrate the modalities through pretraining the modality integrator, named Single-stage Tuning. It has since branched out into methods focusing on performance enhancement, denoted as Two-stage Tuning, and those prioritizing parameter efficiency, referred to as Direct Adaptation. However, existing surveys primarily address the latest Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with Two-stage Tuning, leaving a gap in understanding the evolution of training paradigms and their unique parameter-efficient considerations. This paper categorizes and reviews 34 VLLMs from top conferences, journals, and highly cited Arxiv papers, focusing on parameter efficiency during adaptation from the training paradigm perspective. We first introduce the architecture of LLMs and parameter-efficient learning methods, followed by a discussion on vision encoders and a comprehensive taxonomy of modality integrators. We then review three training paradigms and their efficiency considerations, summarizing benchmarks in the VLLM field. To gain deeper insights into their effectiveness in parameter efficiency, we compare and discuss the experimental results of representative models, among which the experiment of the Direct Adaptation paradigm is replicated. Providing insights into recent developments and practical uses, this survey is a vital guide for researchers and practitioners navigating the efficient integration of vision modalities into LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Ellmen, Constantin Schneider, Matthew I. J. Raybould, Charlotte M. Deane</p>
<p>Abstract: While conventional Transformers generally operate on sequence data, they can be used in conjunction with structure models, typically SE(3)-invariant or equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs), for 3D applications such as protein structure modelling. These hybrids typically involve either (1) preprocessing/tokenizing structural features as input for Transformers or (2) taking Transformer embeddings and processing them within a structural representation. However, there is evidence that Transformers can learn to process structural information on their own, such as the AlphaFold3 structural diffusion model. In this work we show that Transformers can function independently as structure models when passed linear embeddings of coordinates. We first provide a theoretical explanation for how Transformers can learn to filter attention as a 3D Gaussian with learned variance. We then validate this theory using both simulated 3D points and in the context of masked token prediction for proteins. Finally, we show that pre-training protein Transformer encoders with structure improves performance on a downstream task, yielding better performance than custom structural models. Together, this work provides a basis for using standard Transformers as hybrid structure-language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawei Li, Renliang Sun, Yue Huang, Ming Zhong, Bohan Jiang, Jiawei Han, Xiangliang Zhang, Wei Wang, Huan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges and LLM-based data synthesis have emerged as two fundamental LLM-driven data annotation methods in model development. While their combination significantly enhances the efficiency of model training and evaluation, little attention has been given to the potential contamination brought by this new model development paradigm. In this work, we expose preference leakage, a contamination problem in LLM-as-a-judge caused by the relatedness between the synthetic data generators and LLM-based evaluators. To study this issue, we first define three common relatednesses between data generator LLM and judge LLM: being the same model, having an inheritance relationship, and belonging to the same model family. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm the bias of judges towards their related student models caused by preference leakage across multiple LLM baselines and benchmarks. Further analysis suggests that preference leakage is a pervasive issue that is harder to detect compared to previously identified biases in LLM-as-a-judge scenarios. All of these findings imply that preference leakage is a widespread and challenging problem in the area of LLM-as-a-judge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raja Marjieh, Veniamin Veselovsky, Thomas L. Griffiths, Ilia Sucholutsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Numbers are a basic part of how humans represent and describe the world around them. As a consequence, learning effective representations of numbers is critical for the success of large language models as they become more integrated into everyday decisions. However, these models face a challenge: depending on context, the same sequence of digit tokens, e.g., 911, can be treated as a number or as a string. What kind of representations arise from this duality, and what are its downstream implications? Using a similarity-based prompting technique from cognitive science, we show that LLMs learn representational spaces that blend string-like and numerical representations. In particular, we show that elicited similarity judgments from these models over integer pairs can be captured by a combination of Levenshtein edit distance and numerical Log-Linear distance, suggesting an entangled representation. In a series of experiments we show how this entanglement is reflected in the latent embeddings, how it can be reduced but not entirely eliminated by context, and how it can propagate into a realistic decision scenario. These results shed light on a representational tension in transformer models that must learn what a number is from text input.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) through external knowledge integration, yet its application has primarily focused on textual content, leaving the rich domain of multi-modal video knowledge predominantly unexplored. This paper introduces VideoRAG, the first retrieval-augmented generation framework specifically designed for processing and understanding extremely long-context videos. Our core innovation lies in its dual-channel architecture that seamlessly integrates (i) graph-based textual knowledge grounding for capturing cross-video semantic relationships, and (ii) multi-modal context encoding for efficiently preserving visual features. This novel design empowers VideoRAG to process unlimited-length videos by constructing precise knowledge graphs that span multiple videos while maintaining semantic dependencies through specialized multi-modal retrieval paradigms. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on our proposed LongerVideos benchmark-comprising over 160 videos totaling 134+ hours across lecture, documentary, and entertainment categories-VideoRAG demonstrates substantial performance compared to existing RAG alternatives and long video understanding methods.

<p>Abstract: With climate change expected to exacerbate fire weather conditions, the accurate and timely anticipation of wildfires becomes increasingly crucial for disaster mitigation. In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we present FireCastNet, a novel architecture which combines a 3D convolutional encoder with GraphCast, originally developed for global short-term weather forecasting using graph neural networks. FireCastNet is trained to capture the context leading to wildfires, at different spatial and temporal scales. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of our model in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.</p>

The task presents unique challenges: queries are extremely short (averaging 2.4 words), lack natural language structure, and must handle a massive space of unique brands.

<p>Abstract: Sample inefficiency is a long-lasting challenge in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Despite dramatic improvements have been made, the problem is far from being solved and is especially challenging in environments with sparse or delayed rewards. In our work, we propose to use Adversarial Estimates as a new, simple and efficient approach to mitigate this problem for a class of feedback-based DRL algorithms. Our approach leverages latent similarity search from a small set of human-collected trajectories to boost learning, using only five minutes of human-recorded experience. The results of our study show algorithms trained with Adversarial Estimates converge faster than their original version. Moreover, we discuss how our approach could enable learning in feedback-based algorithms in extreme scenarios with very sparse rewards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video meeting platforms display conversations linearly through transcripts or summaries. However, ideas during a meeting do not emerge linearly. We leverage LLMs to create dialogue maps in real time to help people visually structure and connect ideas. Balancing the need to reduce the cognitive load on users during the conversation while giving them sufficient control when using AI, we explore two system variants that encompass different levels of AI assistance. In Human-Map, AI generates summaries of conversations as nodes, and users create dialogue maps with the nodes. In AI-Map, AI produces dialogue maps where users can make edits. We ran a within-subject experiment with ten pairs of users, comparing the two MeetMap variants and a baseline. Users preferred MeetMap over traditional methods for taking notes, which aligned better with their mental models of conversations. Users liked the ease of use for AI-Map due to the low effort demands and appreciated the hands-on opportunity in Human-Map for sense-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin A. Spiegel, Lucas Gelfond, George Konidaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstract symbolic writing systems are semiotic codes that are ubiquitous in modern society but are otherwise absent in the animal kingdom. Anthropological evidence suggests that the earliest forms of some writing systems originally consisted of iconic pictographs, which signify their referent via visual resemblance. While previous studies have examined the emergence and, separately, the evolution of pictographic writing systems through a computational lens, most employ non-naturalistic methodologies that make it difficult to draw clear analogies to human and animal cognition. We develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning testbed for emergent communication called a Signification Game, and formulate a model of inferential communication that enables agents to leverage visual theory of mind to communicate actions using pictographs. Our model, which is situated within a broader formalism for animal communication, sheds light on the cognitive and cultural processes that led to the development of early writing systems.</p>

In comparison to other LLM tasks, the application field of deductive verification has the notable advantage of providing a rigorous toolset to check LLM-generated solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Li, Yue Lin, Xiangfeng Wang, Bo Jin, Hongyuan Zha, Baoxiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Information design (ID) explores how a sender influence the optimal behavior of receivers to achieve specific objectives. While ID originates from everyday human communication, existing game-theoretic and machine learning methods often model information structures as numbers, which limits many applications to toy games. This work leverages LLMs and proposes a verbalized framework in Bayesian persuasion (BP), which extends classic BP to real-world games involving human dialogues for the first time. Specifically, we map the BP to a verbalized mediator-augmented extensive-form game, where LLMs instantiate the sender and receiver. To efficiently solve the verbalized game, we propose a generalized equilibrium-finding algorithm combining LLM and game solver. The algorithm is reinforced with techniques including verbalized commitment assumptions, verbalized obedience constraints, and information obfuscation. Numerical experiments in dialogue scenarios, such as recommendation letters, courtroom interactions, and law enforcement, validate that our framework can both reproduce theoretical results in classic BP and discover effective persuasion strategies in more complex natural language and multi-stage scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present an approach to model-based RL that achieves a new state of the art performance on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, an open-world 2D survival game that requires agents to exhibit a wide range of general abilities -- such as strong generalization, deep exploration, and long-term reasoning. With a series of careful design choices aimed at improving sample efficiency, our MBRL algorithm achieves a reward of 67.4% after only 1M environment steps, significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2%, and, for the first time, exceeds human performance of 65.0%. Our method starts by constructing a SOTA model-free baseline, using a novel policy architecture that combines CNNs and RNNs. We then add three improvements to the standard MBRL setup: (a) "Dyna with warmup", which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, (b) "nearest neighbor tokenizer" on image patches, which improves the scheme to create the transformer world model (TWM) inputs, and (c) "block teacher forcing", which allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interactive digital agents (IDAs) leverage APIs of stateful digital environments to perform tasks in response to user requests. While IDAs powered by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) can react to feedback from interface invocations in multi-step exchanges, they have not been trained in their respective digital environments. Prior methods accomplish less than half of tasks in sophisticated benchmarks such as AppWorld. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains IDAs directly in their target environments. We formalize this training as a partially observable Markov decision process and derive LOOP, a data- and memory-efficient variant of proximal policy optimization. LOOP uses no value network and maintains exactly one copy of the underlying LLM in memory, making its implementation straightforward and as memory-efficient as fine-tuning a single LLM. A 32-billion-parameter agent trained with LOOP in the AppWorld environment outperforms the much larger OpenAI o1 agent by 9 percentage points (15% relative). To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of RL to IDAs that interact with a stateful, multi-domain, multi-app environment via direct API calls. Our analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of RL in this area, showing that the agent learns to consult the API documentation, avoid unwarranted assumptions, minimize confabulation, and recover from setbacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models often struggle with length generalization and solving complex problem instances beyond their training distribution. We present a self-improvement approach where models iteratively generate and learn from their own solutions, progressively tackling harder problems while maintaining a standard transformer architecture. Across diverse tasks including arithmetic, string manipulation, and maze solving, self-improving enables models to solve problems far beyond their initial training distribution-for instance, generalizing from 10-digit to 100-digit addition without apparent saturation. We observe that in some cases filtering for correct self-generated examples leads to exponential improvements in out-of-distribution performance across training rounds. Additionally, starting from pretrained models significantly accelerates this self-improvement process for several tasks. Our results demonstrate how controlled weak-to-strong curricula can systematically teach a model logical extrapolation without any changes to the positional embeddings, or the model architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isha Puri, Shivchander Sudalairaj, Guangxuan Xu, Kai Xu, Akash Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Archiki Prasad, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Zaid Khan, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to a large language model (LLM) as it iteratively debugs faulty code, motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions and candidate code. We integrate UTGen into UTDebug, a robust debugging pipeline that uses generated tests to help LLMs debug effectively. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), UTDebug (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and back-tracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting. We show that UTGen outperforms UT generation baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5 7B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines.</p>

In this paper, we apply these advances to the task of model jailbreaking: eliciting harmful responses from aligned LLMs. We develop an adversarial reasoning approach to automatic jailbreaking via test-time computation that achieves SOTA attack success rates (ASR) against many aligned LLMs, even the ones that aim to trade inference-time compute for adversarial robustness. Our approach introduces a new paradigm in understanding LLM vulnerabilities, laying the foundation for the development of more robust and trustworthy AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huawei Lin, Jun Woo Chung, Yingjie Lao, Weijie Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is one of the most popular machine learning models in various applications. However, in the traditional settings, all data should be simultaneously accessed in the training procedure: it does not allow to add or delete any data instances after training. In this paper, we propose an efficient online learning framework for GBDT supporting both incremental and decremental learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that considers an in-place unified incremental and decremental learning on GBDT. To reduce the learning cost, we present a collection of optimizations for our framework, so that it can add or delete a small fraction of data on the fly. We theoretically show the relationship between the hyper-parameters of the proposed optimizations, which enables trading off accuracy and cost on incremental and decremental learning. The backdoor attack results show that our framework can successfully inject and remove backdoor in a well-trained model using incremental and decremental learning, and the empirical results on public datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed online learning framework and optimizations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Leading AI developers and startups are increasingly deploying agentic AI systems that can plan and execute complex tasks with limited human involvement. However, there is currently no structured framework for documenting the technical components, intended uses, and safety features of agentic systems. To fill this gap, we introduce the AI Agent Index, the first public database to document information about currently deployed agentic AI systems. For each system that meets the criteria for inclusion in the index, we document the system's components (e.g., base model, reasoning implementation, tool use), application domains (e.g., computer use, software engineering), and risk management practices (e.g., evaluation results, guardrails), based on publicly available information and correspondence with developers. We find that while developers generally provide ample information regarding the capabilities and applications of agentic systems, they currently provide limited information regarding safety and risk management practices. The AI Agent Index is available online at https://aiagentindex.mit.edu/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Gupta, Phudish Prateepamornkul, Maochuan Lu, Ahmed Alaa, Thomas Hartvigsen, Gopala Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior work in parameter-modifying knowledge editing has shown that large-scale sequential editing leads to significant model degradation. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this and scale sequential knowledge editing to 10,000 sequential edits, while maintaining the downstream performance of the original model. We first show that locate-then-edit knowledge editing methods lead to overfitting on the edited facts. We also show that continuous knowledge editing using these methods leads to disproportionate growth in the norm of the edited matrix. We then provide a crucial insight into the inner workings of locate-then-edit methods. We show that norm-growth is a hidden trick employed by these methods that gives larger importance to the output activations produced from the edited layers. With this "importance hacking", the edited layers provide a much larger contributions to the model's output. To mitigate these issues, we present ENCORE - Early stopping and Norm-Constrained Robust knowledge Editing. ENCORE controls for overfitting and the disproportionate norm-growth to enable long-term sequential editing, where we are able to perform up to 10,000 sequential edits without loss of downstream performance. ENCORE is also 61% faster than MEMIT and 64% faster than AlphaEdit on Llama3-8B.</p>

<p>Abstract: This comprehensive review aims to provide an overview of the current state of Healthcare Knowledge Graphs (HKGs), including their construction, utilization models, and applications across various healthcare and biomedical research domains. We thoroughly analyzed existing literature on HKGs, covering their construction methodologies, utilization techniques, and applications in basic science research, pharmaceutical research and development, clinical decision support, and public health. The review encompasses both model-free and model-based utilization approaches and the integration of HKGs with large language models (LLMs). We searched Google Scholar for relevant papers on HKGs and classified them into the following topics: HKG construction, HKG utilization, and their downstream applications in various domains. We also discussed their special challenges and the promise for future work. The review highlights the potential of HKGs to significantly impact biomedical research and clinical practice by integrating vast amounts of biomedical knowledge from multiple domains. The synergy between HKGs and LLMs offers promising opportunities for constructing more comprehensive knowledge graphs and improving the accuracy of healthcare applications. HKGs have emerged as a powerful tool for structuring medical knowledge, with broad applications across biomedical research, clinical decision-making, and public health. This survey serves as a roadmap for future research and development in the field of HKGs, highlighting the potential of combining knowledge graphs with advanced machine learning models for healthcare transformation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Flamino, Mohammed Shahid Modi, Boleslaw K. Szymanski, Brendan Cross, Colton Mikolajczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise in communicating with humans. Their potential use as artificial partners with humans in sociological experiments involving conversation is an exciting prospect. But how viable is it? Here, we rigorously test the limits of agents that debate using LLMs in a preregistered study that runs multiple debate-based opinion consensus games. Each game starts with six humans, six agents, or three humans and three agents. We found that agents can blend in and concentrate on a debate's topic better than humans, improving the productivity of all players. Yet, humans perceive agents as less convincing and confident than other humans, and several behavioral metrics of humans and agents we collected deviate measurably from each other. We observed that agents are already decent debaters, but their behavior generates a pattern distinctly different from the human-generated data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin Staab, Mark Vero, Mislav Balunovi\'c, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent privacy research on large language models (LLMs) has shown that they achieve near-human-level performance at inferring personal data from online texts. With ever-increasing model capabilities, existing text anonymization methods are currently lacking behind regulatory requirements and adversarial threats. In this work, we take two steps to bridge this gap: First, we present a new setting for evaluating anonymization in the face of adversarial LLM inferences, allowing for a natural measurement of anonymization performance while remedying some of the shortcomings of previous metrics. Then, within this setting, we develop a novel LLM-based adversarial anonymization framework leveraging the strong inferential capabilities of LLMs to inform our anonymization procedure. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of adversarial anonymization across 13 LLMs on real-world and synthetic online texts, comparing it against multiple baselines and industry-grade anonymizers. Our evaluation shows that adversarial anonymization outperforms current commercial anonymizers both in terms of the resulting utility and privacy. We support our findings with a human study (n=50) highlighting a strong and consistent human preference for LLM-anonymized texts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI models are capable of performing a wide variety of tasks that have traditionally required creativity and human understanding. During training, they learn patterns from existing data and can subsequently generate new content such as texts, images, audio, and videos that align with these patterns. Due to their versatility and generally high-quality results, they represent, on the one hand, an opportunity for digitalisation. On the other hand, the use of generative AI models introduces novel IT security risks that must be considered as part of a comprehensive analysis of the IT security threat landscape. In response to this risk potential, companies or authorities intending to use generative AI should conduct an individual risk analysis before integrating it into their workflows. The same applies to developers and operators, as many risks associated with generative AI must be addressed during development or can only be influenced by the operating organisation. Based on this, existing security measures can be adapted, and additional measures implemented.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14479">Tracing Representation Progression: Analyzing and Enhancing Layer-Wise Similarity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Jiang, Jinxin Zhou, Zhihui Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing the similarity of internal representations has been an important technique for understanding the behavior of deep neural networks. Most existing methods for analyzing the similarity between representations of high dimensions, such as those based on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), rely on statistical properties of the representations for a set of data points. In this paper, we focus on transformer models and study the similarity of representations between the hidden layers of individual transformers. In this context, we show that a simple sample-wise cosine similarity metric is capable of capturing the similarity and aligns with the complicated CKA. Our experimental results on common transformers reveal that representations across layers are positively correlated, with similarity increasing when layers get closer. We provide a theoretical justification for this phenomenon under the geodesic curve assumption for the learned transformer. We then show that an increase in representation similarity implies an increase in predicted probability when directly applying the last-layer classifier to any hidden layer representation. We then propose an aligned training method to improve the effectiveness of shallow layer by enhancing the similarity between internal representations, with trained models that enjoy the following properties: (1) more early saturation events, (2) layer-wise accuracies monotonically increase and reveal the minimal depth needed for the given task, (3) when served as multi-exit models, they achieve on-par performance with standard multi-exit architectures which consist of additional classifiers designed for early exiting in shallow layers. To our knowledge, our work is the first to show that one common classifier is sufficient for multi-exit models. We conduct experiments on both vision and NLP tasks to demonstrate the performance of the proposed aligned training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqiang Yao, Jingru Tan, Jiahao Hu, Feizhao Zhang, Xin Jin, Bo Li, Ruihao Gong, Pengfei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, vision-language instruct-tuning models have made significant progress due to their more comprehensive understanding of the world. In this work, we discovered that large-scale 3D parallel training on those models leads to an imbalanced computation load across different devices. The vision and language parts are inherently heterogeneous: their data distribution and model architecture differ significantly, which affects distributed training efficiency. We rebalanced the computational loads from data, model, and memory perspectives to address this issue, achieving more balanced computation across devices. These three components are not independent but are closely connected, forming an omniverse balanced training framework. Specifically, for the data, we grouped instances into new balanced mini-batches within and across devices. For the model, we employed a search-based method to achieve a more balanced partitioning. For memory optimization, we adaptively adjusted the re-computation strategy for each partition to utilize the available memory fully. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with the open-source training code of InternVL-Chat, we significantly reduced GPU days, achieving about 1.8x speed-up. Our method's efficacy and generalizability were further demonstrated across various models and datasets. Codes will be released at https://github.com/ModelTC/OmniBal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vedant Shah, Dingli Yu, Kaifeng Lyu, Simon Park, Jiatong Yu, Yinghui He, Nan Rosemary Ke, Michael Mozer, Yoshua Bengio, Sanjeev Arora, Anirudh Goyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Current LLM training positions mathematical reasoning as a core capability. With publicly available sources fully tapped, there is unmet demand for diverse and challenging math questions. Relying solely on human experts is both time-consuming and costly, while LLM-generated questions often lack the requisite diversity and difficulty. We present a design framework that combines the strengths of LLMs with a human-in-the-loop approach to generate a diverse array of challenging math questions. We leverage LLM metacognition skills [Didolkar et al., 2024] of a strong LLM to extract core "skills" from existing math datasets. These skills serve as the basis for generating novel and difficult questions by prompting the LLM with random pairs of core skills. The use of two different skills within each question makes finding such questions an "out of distribution" task for both LLMs and humans. Our pipeline employs LLMs to iteratively generate and refine questions and solutions through multiturn prompting. Human annotators then verify and further refine the questions, with their efficiency enhanced via further LLM interactions. Applying this pipeline on skills extracted from the MATH dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2021] resulted in MATH$^2$ - a dataset of higher-quality math questions, as evidenced by: (a) Lower performance of all models on MATH$^2$ than on MATH (b) Higher performance on MATH when using MATH$^2$ questions as in-context examples. Although focused on mathematics, our methodology seems applicable to other domains requiring structured reasoning, and potentially as a component of scalable oversight. Also of interest is a striking relationship observed between models' performance on the new dataset: the success rate on MATH$^2$ is the square on MATH, suggesting that successfully solving the question in MATH$^2$ requires a nontrivial combination of two distinct math skills.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakhar Godara, Tilman Diego Al\'eman, Angela J. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: \textit{Reasoning} may be viewed as an algorithm $P$ that makes a choice of an action $a^* \in \mathcal{A}$, aiming to optimize some outcome. However, executing $P$ itself bears costs (time, energy, limited capacity, etc.) and needs to be considered alongside explicit utility obtained by making the choice in the underlying decision problem. Finding the right $P$ can itself be framed as an optimization problem over the space of reasoning processes $P$, generally referred to as \textit{metareasoning}. Conventionally, human metareasoning models assume that the agent knows the transition and reward distributions of the underlying MDP. This paper generalizes such models by proposing a meta Bayes-Adaptive MDP (meta-BAMDP) framework to handle metareasoning in environments with unknown reward/transition distributions, which encompasses a far larger and more realistic set of planning problems that humans and AI systems face. As a first step, we apply the framework to Bernoulli bandit tasks. Owing to the meta problem's complexity, our solutions are necessarily approximate. However, we introduce two novel theorems that significantly enhance the tractability of the problem, enabling stronger approximations that are robust within a range of assumptions grounded in realistic human decision-making scenarios. These results offer a resource-rational perspective and a normative framework for understanding human exploration under cognitive constraints, as well as providing experimentally testable predictions about human behavior in Bernoulli Bandit tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwei Hu, Yi Dong, Xiaowei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Guardrail, an emerging mechanism designed to ensure that large language models (LLMs) align with human values by moderating harmful or toxic responses, requires a sociotechnical approach in their design. This paper addresses a critical issue: existing guardrails lack a well-founded methodology to accommodate the diverse needs of different user groups, particularly concerning access rights. Supported by trust modeling (primarily on `social' aspect) and enhanced with online in-context learning via retrieval-augmented generation (on `technical' aspect), we introduce an adaptive guardrail mechanism, to dynamically moderate access to sensitive content based on user trust metrics. User trust metrics, defined as a novel combination of direct interaction trust and authority-verified trust, enable the system to precisely tailor the strictness of content moderation by aligning with the user's credibility and the specific context of their inquiries. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the adaptive guardrail in meeting diverse user needs, outperforming existing guardrails while securing sensitive information and precisely managing potentially hazardous content through a context-aware knowledge base. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce trust-oriented concept into a guardrail system, offering a scalable solution that enriches the discourse on ethical deployment for next-generation LLM service.</p>

<p>Abstract: Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) has enhanced game content creation, yet challenges in controllability and limited training data persist. This study addresses these issues by distilling a constructive PCG algorithm into a controllable PCGML model. We first generate a large amount of content with a constructive algorithm and label it using a Large Language Model (LLM). We use these synthetic labels to condition two PCGML models for content-specific generation, a diffusion model and the five-dollar model. This neural network distillation process ensures that the generation aligns with the original algorithm while introducing controllability through plain text. We define this text-conditioned PCGML as a Text-to-game-Map (T2M) task, offering an alternative to prevalent text-to-image multi-modal tasks. We compare our distilled models with the baseline constructive algorithm. Our analysis of the variety, accuracy, and quality of our generation demonstrates the efficacy of distilling constructive methods into controllable text-conditioned PCGML models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Zhang, Zhi Zhou, Lan-Zhe Guo, Yu-Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot ability in image classification tasks by aligning text and images but suffer inferior performance compared with task-specific expert models. On the contrary, expert models excel in their specialized domains but lack zero-shot ability for new tasks. How to obtain both the high performance of expert models and zero-shot ability is an important research direction. In this paper, we attempt to demonstrate that by constructing a model hub and aligning models with their functionalities using model labels, new tasks can be solved in a zero-shot manner by effectively selecting and reusing models in the hub. We introduce a novel paradigm, Model Label Learning (MLL), which bridges the gap between models and their functionalities through a Semantic Directed Acyclic Graph (SDAG) and leverages an algorithm, Classification Head Combination Optimization (CHCO), to select capable models for new tasks. Compared with the foundation model paradigm, it is less costly and more scalable, i.e., the zero-shot ability grows with the sizes of the model hub. Experiments on seven real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of MLL, demonstrating that expert models can be effectively reused for zero-shot tasks. Our code will be released publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Sheng, Zilin Huang, Sikai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is anticipated to exhibit higher sample efficiency compared to model-free RL by utilizing a virtual environment model. However, it is challenging to obtain sufficiently accurate representations of the environmental dynamics due to uncertainties in complex systems and environments. An inaccurate environment model may degrade the sample efficiency and performance of model-based RL. Furthermore, while model-based RL can improve sample efficiency, it often still requires substantial training time to learn from scratch, potentially limiting its advantages over model-free approaches. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning framework aimed at enhancing learning efficiency by infusing established expert knowledge into the learning process and avoiding the issue of beginning from zero. Our approach integrates traffic expert knowledge into a virtual environment model, employing the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for basic dynamics and neural networks for residual dynamics, thus ensuring adaptability to complex scenarios. We propose a novel strategy that combines traditional control methods with residual RL, facilitating efficient learning and policy optimization without the need to learn from scratch. The proposed approach is applied to CAV trajectory control tasks for the dissipation of stop-and-go waves in mixed traffic flow. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables the CAV agent to achieve superior performance in trajectory control compared to the baseline agents in terms of sample efficiency, traffic flow smoothness and traffic mobility.

<p>Abstract: Human intelligence, the most evident and accessible form of source of reasoning, hosted by biological hardware, has evolved and been refined over thousands of years, positioning itself today to create new artificial forms and preparing to self--design their evolutionary path forward. Beginning with the advent of foundation models, the rate at which human and artificial intelligence interact with each other has exceeded any anticipated quantitative figures. The close engagement led both bits of intelligence to be impacted in various ways, which naturally resulted in complex confluences that warrant close scrutiny. In the sequel, using a novel taxonomy, we shall explore the interplay between human and machine intelligence, focusing on the crucial role humans play in developing ethical, responsible, and robust intelligent systems. We briefly delve into various aspects of implementation inspired by the mechanisms underlying neuroscience and human cognition. In addition, we propose future perspectives, capitalizing on the advantages of symbiotic designs to suggest a human-centered direction for next-generation developments, focusing on the augmentation role of AI. We finalize this evolving document with some thoughts and open questions yet to be addressed by the broader community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLM) for DNA and proteins, several LLM for RNA have been developed recently. RNA-LLM uses large datasets of RNA sequences to learn, in a self-supervised way, how to represent each RNA base with a semantically rich numerical vector. This is done under the hypothesis that obtaining high-quality RNA representations can enhance data-costly downstream tasks. Among them, predicting the secondary structure is a fundamental task for uncovering RNA functional mechanisms. In this work we present a comprehensive experimental analysis of several pre-trained RNA-LLM, comparing them for the RNA secondary structure prediction task in an unified deep learning framework. The RNA-LLM were assessed with increasing generalization difficulty on benchmark datasets. Results showed that two LLM clearly outperform the other models, and revealed significant challenges for generalization in low-homology scenarios.</p>

Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kumud Lakara, Georgia Channing, Juil Sock, Christian Rupprecht, Philip Torr, John Collomosse, Christian Schroeder de Witt</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the most challenging forms of misinformation involves the out-of-context (OOC) use of images paired with misleading text, creating false narratives. Existing AI-driven detection systems lack explainability and require expensive finetuning. We address these issues with LLM-Consensus, a multi-agent debate system for OOC misinformation detection. LLM-Consensus introduces a novel multi-agent debate framework where multimodal agents collaborate to assess contextual consistency and request external information to enhance cross-context reasoning and decision-making. Our framework enables explainable detection with state-of-the-art accuracy even without domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive ablation studies confirm that external retrieval significantly improves detection accuracy, and user studies demonstrate that LLM-Consensus boosts performance for both experts and non-experts. These results position LLM-Consensus as a powerful tool for autonomous and citizen intelligence applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Majid Ghasemi, Amir Hossein Moosavi, Dariush Ebrahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in Artificial Intelligence (AI), enabling agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions with their environments. Drawing from the foundations of trial and error, RL equips agents to make informed decisions through feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of RL, meticulously analyzing a wide range of algorithms, from foundational tabular methods to advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques. We categorize and evaluate these algorithms based on key criteria such as scalability, sample efficiency, and suitability. We compare the methods in the form of their strengths and weaknesses in diverse settings. Additionally, we offer practical insights into the selection and implementation of RL algorithms, addressing common challenges like convergence, stability, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. This paper serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners aiming to harness the full potential of RL in solving complex, real-world problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Gao, Bofei Zhang, Pengxiang Li, Xiaojian Ma, Tao Yuan, Yue Fan, Yuwei Wu, Yunde Jia, Song-Chun Zhu, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) prompts the development of multi-modal agents, which are used as a controller to call external tools, providing a feasible way to solve practical tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal agent tuning method that automatically generates multi-modal tool-usage data and tunes a vision-language model (VLM) as the controller for powerful tool-usage reasoning. To preserve the data quality, we prompt the GPT-4o mini model to generate queries, files, and trajectories, followed by query-file and trajectory verifiers. Based on the data synthesis pipeline, we collect the MM-Traj dataset that contains 20K tasks with trajectories of tool usage. Then, we develop the T3-Agent via \underline{T}rajectory \underline{T}uning on VLMs for \underline{T}ool usage using MM-Traj. Evaluations on the GTA and GAIA benchmarks show that the T3-Agent consistently achieves improvements on two popular VLMs: MiniCPM-V-8.5B and {Qwen2-VL-7B}, which outperforms untrained VLMs by $20\%$, showing the effectiveness of the proposed data synthesis pipeline, leading to high-quality data for tool-usage capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Ma, Zui Chen, Tianqiao Liu, Mi Tian, Zhuo Liu, Zitao Liu, Weiqi Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Step-level reward models (SRMs) can significantly enhance mathematical reasoning performance through process supervision or step-level preference alignment based on reinforcement learning. The performance of SRMs is pivotal, as they serve as critical guidelines, ensuring that each step in the reasoning process is aligned with desired outcomes. Recently, AlphaZero-like methods, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is employed for automatic step-level preference annotation, have proven particularly effective. However, the precise mechanisms behind the success of SRMs remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this study delves into the counterintuitive aspects of SRMs, particularly focusing on MCTS-based approaches. Our findings reveal that the removal of natural language descriptions of thought processes has minimal impact on the efficacy of SRMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SRMs are adept at assessing the complex logical coherence present in mathematical language while having difficulty in natural language. These insights provide a nuanced understanding of the core elements that drive effective step-level reward modeling in mathematical reasoning. By shedding light on these mechanisms, this study offers valuable guidance for developing more efficient and streamlined SRMs, which can be achieved by focusing on the crucial parts of mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) is commonly employed to study human brain activity, since it offers insight into the relationship between functional fluctuations and human behavior. To enhance analysis and comprehension of brain activity, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to the analysis of functional connectivities (FC) derived from fMRI data, due to their ability to capture the synergistic interactions among brain regions. However, in the human brain, performing complex tasks typically involves the activation of certain pathways, which could be represented as paths across graphs. As such, conventional GNNs struggle to learn from these pathways due to the long-range dependencies of multiple pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework BrainMAP to learn Multiple Activation Pathways in Brain networks. BrainMAP leverages sequential models to identify long-range correlations among sequentialized brain regions and incorporates an aggregation module based on Mixture of Experts (MoE) to learn from multiple pathways. Our comprehensive experiments highlight BrainMAP's superior performance. Furthermore, our framework enables explanatory analyses of crucial brain regions involved in tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunji Nam, Allen Nie, Ge Gao, Vasilis Syrgkanis, Emma Brunskill</p>
<p>Abstract: Off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) estimates the outcome of a new policy using historical data collected from a different policy. However, existing OPE methods cannot handle cases when the new policy introduces novel actions. This issue commonly occurs in real-world domains, like healthcare, as new drugs and treatments are continuously developed. Novel actions necessitate on-policy data collection, which can be burdensome and expensive if the outcome of interest takes a substantial amount of time to observe--for example, in multi-year clinical trials. This raises a key question of how to predict the long-term outcome of a policy after only observing its short-term effects? Though in general this problem is intractable, under some surrogacy conditions, the short-term on-policy data can be combined with the long-term historical data to make accurate predictions about the new policy's long-term value. In two simulated healthcare examples--HIV and sepsis management--we show that our estimators can provide accurate predictions about the policy value only after observing 10\% of the full horizon data. We also provide finite sample analysis of our doubly robust estimators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zan-Kai Chong, Hiroyuki Ohsaki, Bryan Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: The centralization of Large Language Models (LLMs) development has created significant barriers to AI advancement, limiting the democratization of these powerful technologies. This centralization, coupled with the scarcity of high-quality training data and mounting complexity of maintaining comprehensive expertise across rapidly expanding knowledge domains, poses critical challenges to the continued growth of LLMs. While solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offer potential remedies, maintaining up-to-date expert knowledge across diverse domains remains a significant challenge, particularly given the exponential growth of specialized information. This paper introduces LLMs Networks (LLM-Net), a blockchain-based framework that democratizes LLMs-as-a-Service through a decentralized network of specialized LLM providers. By leveraging collective computational resources and distributed domain expertise, LLM-Net incorporates fine-tuned expert models for various specific domains, ensuring sustained knowledge growth while maintaining service quality through collaborative prompting mechanisms. The framework's robust design includes blockchain technology for transparent transaction and performance validation, establishing an immutable record of service delivery. Our simulation, built on top of state-of-the-art LLMs such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1, Grok-2, and GPT-4o, validates the effectiveness of the reputation-based mechanism in maintaining service quality by selecting high-performing respondents (LLM providers). Thereby it demonstrates the potential of LLM-Net to sustain AI advancement through the integration of decentralized expertise and blockchain-based accountability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Hua, Wanxu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, several works have been conducted on jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot malicious demos. In particular, Zheng et al. focus on improving the efficiency of Few-Shot Jailbreaking (FSJ) by injecting special tokens into the demos and employing demo-level random search, known as Improved Few-Shot Jailbreaking (I-FSJ). Nevertheless, we notice that this method may still require a long context to jailbreak advanced models e.g. 32 shots of demos for Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct (Llama-3) \cite{llama3modelcard}. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of I-FSJ and propose Self-Instruct Few-Shot Jailbreaking (Self-Instruct-FSJ) facilitated with the demo-level greedy search. This framework decomposes the FSJ attack into pattern and behavior learning to exploit the model's vulnerabilities in a more generalized and efficient way. We conduct elaborate experiments to evaluate our method on common open-source models and compare it with baseline algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/iphosi/Self-Instruct-FSJ.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditi Singh, Abul Ehtesham, Saket Kumar, Tala Talaei Khoei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling human like text generation and natural language understanding. However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management.
  Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications.
  This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging test-time computation.

In this paper, we present Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a novel method that leverages the self-verification and self-correction capabilities of recent advanced LLMs to overcome these limitations. SETS integrates sampling, self-verification, and self-correction into a unified framework, enabling efficient and scalable test-time computation for improved capabilities at complex tasks. Through extensive experiments on challenging planning and reasoning benchmarks, compared to the alternatives, we demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more favorable test-time scaling laws.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianyu Wang, Meng Wang, Daoqiang Zhang, Huazhu Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has attracted considerable attention, which transfers knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain. Reducing inter-domain differences has always been a crucial factor to improve performance in UDA, especially for tasks where there is a large gap between source and target domains. To this end, we propose a novel style-aware feature fusion method (SAFF) to bridge the large domain gap and transfer knowledge while alleviating the loss of class-discriminative information. Inspired by the human transitive inference and learning ability, a novel style-aware self-intermediate domain (SSID) is investigated to link two seemingly unrelated concepts through a series of intermediate auxiliary synthesized concepts. Specifically, we propose a novel learning strategy of SSID, which selects samples from both source and target domains as anchors, and then randomly fuses the object and style features of these anchors to generate labeled and style-rich intermediate auxiliary features for knowledge transfer. Moreover, we design an external memory bank to store and update specified labeled features to obtain stable class features and class-wise style features. Based on the proposed memory bank, the intra- and inter-domain loss functions are designed to improve the class recognition ability and feature compatibility, respectively. Meanwhile, we simulate the rich latent feature space of SSID by infinite sampling and the convergence of the loss function by mathematical theory. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly used domain adaptive benchmarks to evaluate the proposed SAFF, and the experimental results show that the proposed SAFF can be easily combined with different backbone networks and obtain better performance as a plug-in-plug-out module.</p>

<p>Abstract: Classification of movement trajectories has many applications in transportation and is a key component for large-scale movement trajectory generation and anomaly detection which has key safety applications in the aftermath of a disaster or other external shock. However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI-Generated Content (AIGC) is rapidly expanding, with services using advanced generative models to create realistic images and fluent text. Regulating such content is crucial to prevent policy violations, such as unauthorized commercialization or unsafe content distribution. Watermarking is a promising solution for content attribution and verification, but we demonstrate its vulnerability to two key attacks: (1) Watermark removal, where adversaries erase embedded marks to evade regulation, and (2) Watermark forging, where they generate illicit content with forged watermarks, leading to misattribution. We propose Warfare, a unified attack framework leveraging a pre-trained diffusion model for content processing and a generative adversarial network for watermark manipulation. Evaluations across datasets and embedding setups show that Warfare achieves high success rates while preserving content quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang You, Bokui Shen, Congyue Deng, Haoran Geng, Songlin Wei, He Wang, Leonidas Guibas</p>
<p>Abstract: Deformable object manipulation stands as one of the most captivating yet formidable challenges in robotics. While previous techniques have predominantly relied on learning latent dynamics through demonstrations, typically represented as either particles or images, there exists a pertinent limitation: acquiring suitable demonstrations, especially for long-horizon tasks, can be elusive. Moreover, basing learning entirely on demonstrations can hamper the model's ability to generalize beyond the demonstrated tasks. In this work, we introduce a demonstration-free hierarchical planning approach capable of tackling intricate long-horizon tasks without necessitating any training. We employ large language models (LLMs) to articulate a high-level, stage-by-stage plan corresponding to a specified task. For every individual stage, the LLM provides both the tool's name and the Python code to craft intermediate subgoal point clouds. With the tool and subgoal for a particular stage at our disposal, we present a granular closed-loop model predictive control strategy. This leverages Differentiable Physics with Point-to-Point correspondence (DiffPhysics-P2P) loss in the earth mover distance (EMD) space, applied iteratively. Experimental findings affirm that our technique surpasses multiple benchmarks in dough manipulation, spanning both short and long horizons. Remarkably, our model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities to novel and previously unencountered complex tasks without any preliminary demonstrations. We further substantiate our approach with experimental trials on real-world robotic platforms. Our project page: https://qq456cvb.github.io/projects/donut.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Airaldi, Bart De Schutter, Azita Dabiri</p>
<p>Abstract: In the backdrop of an increasingly pressing need for effective urban and highway transportation systems, this work explores the synergy between model-based and learning-based strategies to enhance traffic flow management by use of an innovative approach to the problem of ramp metering control that embeds Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting a suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic conditions, variability in the control action, and violations of the constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An MPC-based RL approach, which leverages the MPC optimal problem as a function approximation for the RL algorithm, is proposed to learn to efficiently control an on-ramp and satisfy its constraints despite uncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Simulations are performed on a benchmark small-scale highway network to compare the proposed methodology against other state-of-the-art control approaches. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an imprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to effectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the network is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved performance that is superior to the other controllers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Jarne Ornia, Giannis Delimpaltadakis, Jens Kober, Javier Alonso-Mora</p>
<p>Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents have no incentive to exhibit predictable behaviors, and are often pushed (through e.g. policy entropy regularisation) to randomise their actions in favor of exploration. This often makes it challenging for other agents and humans to predict an agent's behavior, triggering unsafe scenarios (e.g. in human-robot interaction). We propose a novel method to induce predictable behavior in RL agents, termed Predictability-Aware RL (PARL), employing the agent's trajectory entropy rate to quantify predictability. Our method maximizes a linear combination of a standard discounted reward and the negative entropy rate, thus trading off optimality with predictability. We show how the entropy rate can be formally cast as an average reward, how entropy-rate value functions can be estimated from a learned model and incorporate this in policy-gradient algorithms, and demonstrate how this approach produces predictable (near-optimal) policies in tasks inspired by human-robot use-cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edmund Mills, Shiye Su, Stuart Russell, Scott Emmons</p>
<p>Abstract: How do we measure the efficacy of language model explainability methods? While many explainability methods have been developed, they are typically evaluated on bespoke tasks, preventing an apples-to-apples comparison. To help fill this gap, we present ALMANACS, a language model explainability benchmark. ALMANACS scores explainability methods on simulatability, i.e., how well the explanations improve behavior prediction on new inputs. The ALMANACS scenarios span twelve safety-relevant topics such as ethical reasoning and advanced AI behaviors; they have idiosyncratic premises to invoke model-specific behavior; and they have a train-test distributional shift to encourage faithful explanations. By using another language model to predict behavior based on the explanations, ALMANACS is a fully automated benchmark. While not a replacement for human evaluations, we aim for ALMANACS to be a complementary, automated tool that allows for fast, scalable evaluation. Using ALMANACS, we evaluate counterfactual, rationalization, attention, and Integrated Gradients explanations. Our results are sobering: when averaged across all topics, no explanation method outperforms the explanation-free control. We conclude that despite modest successes in prior work, developing an explanation method that aids simulatability in ALMANACS remains an open challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suho Shin, Seyed A. Esmaeili, MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of designing replication-proof bandit mechanisms when agents strategically register or replicate their own arms to maximize their payoff. Specifically, we consider Bayesian agents who only know the distribution from which their own arms' mean rewards are sampled, unlike the original setting of by Shin et al. 2022. Interestingly, with Bayesian agents in stark contrast to the previous work, analyzing the replication-proofness of an algorithm becomes significantly complicated even in a single-agent setting. We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for an algorithm to be replication-proof in the single-agent setting, and present an algorithm that satisfies these properties. These results center around several analytical theorems that focus on \emph{comparing the expected regret of multiple bandit instances}, and therefore might be of independent interest since they have not been studied before to the best of our knowledge. We expand this result to the multi-agent setting, and provide a replication-proof algorithm for any problem instance. We finalize our result by proving its sublinear regret upper bound which matches that of Shin et al. 2022.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Bombieri, Paolo Fiorini, Simone Paolo Ponzetto, Marco Rospocher</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to memorize structured knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which general-purpose pre-trained LLMs retain and correctly reproduce concept identifier (ID)-label associations from publicly available ontologies. We conduct a systematic evaluation across multiple ontological resources, including the Gene Ontology, Uberon, Wikidata, and ICD-10, using LLMs such as Pythia-12B, Gemini-1.5-Flash, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our findings reveal that only a small fraction of ontological concepts is accurately memorized, with GPT-4 demonstrating the highest performance. To understand why certain concepts are memorized more effectively than others, we analyze the relationship between memorization accuracy and concept popularity on the Web. Our results indicate a strong correlation between the frequency of a concept's occurrence online and the likelihood of accurately retrieving its ID from the label. This suggests that LLMs primarily acquire such knowledge through indirect textual exposure rather than directly from structured ontological resources. Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to quantify prediction invariance, demonstrating that the stability of model responses across variations in prompt language and temperature settings can serve as a proxy for estimating memorization robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masayuki Takayama, Tadahisa Okuda, Thong Pham, Tatsuyoshi Ikenoue, Shingo Fukuma, Shohei Shimizu, Akiyoshi Sannai</p>
<p>Abstract: In practical statistical causal discovery (SCD), embedding domain expert knowledge as constraints into the algorithm is important for creating consistent, meaningful causal models, despite the challenges in the systematic acquisition of background knowledge. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel method for causal inference, in which SCD and knowledge based causal inference (KBCI) with a large language model (LLM) are synthesized through ``statistical causal prompting (SCP)'' for LLMs and prior knowledge augmentation for SCD. Experiments have revealed that the results of LLM-KBCI and SCD augmented with LLM-KBCI approach the ground truths, more than the SCD result without prior knowledge. It has also been revealed that the SCD result can be further improved if the LLM undergoes SCP. Furthermore, with an unpublished real-world dataset, we have demonstrated that the background knowledge provided by the LLM can improve the SCD on this dataset, even if this dataset has never been included in the training data of the LLM. For future practical application of this proposed method across important domains such as healthcare, we also thoroughly discuss the limitations, risks of critical errors, expected improvement of techniques around LLMs, and realistic integration of expert checks of the results into this automatic process, with SCP simulations under various conditions both in successful and failure scenarios. The careful and appropriate application of the proposed approach in this work, with improvement and customization for each domain, can thus address challenges such as dataset biases and limitations, illustrating the potential of LLMs to improve data-driven causal inference across diverse scientific domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeed Vahidian, Mingyu Wang, Jianyang Gu, Vyacheslav Kungurtsev, Wei Jiang, Yiran Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for crafting a synthetic dataset that captures the essential information of a training dataset, facilitating the training of accurate neural models. Its applications span various domains, including transfer learning, federated learning, and neural architecture search. The most popular methods for constructing the synthetic data rely on matching the convergence properties of training the model with the synthetic dataset and the training dataset. However, using the empirical loss as the criterion must be thought of as auxiliary in the same sense that the training set is an approximate substitute for the population distribution, and the latter is the data of interest. Yet despite its popularity, an aspect that remains unexplored is the relationship of DD to its generalization, particularly across uncommon subgroups. That is, how can we ensure that a model trained on the synthetic dataset performs well when faced with samples from regions with low population density? Here, the representativeness and coverage of the dataset become salient over the guaranteed training error at inference. Drawing inspiration from distributionally robust optimization, we introduce an algorithm that combines clustering with the minimization of a risk measure on the loss to conduct DD. We provide a theoretical rationale for our approach and demonstrate its effective generalization and robustness across subgroups through numerical experiments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dixian Zhu, Tianbao Yang, Livnat Jerby</p>
<p>Abstract: Regression is a fundamental task in machine learning that has garnered extensive attention over the past decades. The conventional approach for regression involves employing loss functions that primarily concentrate on aligning model prediction with the ground truth for each individual data sample. Recent research endeavors have introduced novel perspectives by incorporating label similarity to regression via imposing extra pairwise regularization on the latent feature space and demonstrated the effectiveness. However, there are two drawbacks for those approaches: i) their pairwise operation in latent feature space is computationally more expensive than conventional regression losses; ii) it lacks of theoretical justifications behind such regularization. In this work, we propose GAR (Gradient Aligned Regression) as a competitive alternative method in label space, which is constituted by a conventional regression loss and two pairwise label difference losses for gradient alignment including magnitude and direction. GAR enjoys: i) the same level efficiency as conventional regression loss because the quadratic complexity for the proposed pairwise losses can be reduced to linear complexity; ii) theoretical insights from learning the pairwise label difference to learning the gradient of the ground truth function. We limit our current scope as regression on the clean data setting without noises, outliers or distributional shifts, etc. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method practically on two synthetic datasets and on eight extensive real-world tasks from six benchmark datasets with other eight competitive baselines. Running time experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency of the proposed GAR over existing methods with pairwise regularization in latent feature space and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component for GAR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenkai Sun, Ke Yang, Revanth Gangi Reddy, Yi R. Fung, Hou Pong Chan, Kevin Small, ChengXiang Zhai, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing demand for personalized interactions with large language models (LLMs) calls for methodologies capable of accurately and efficiently identifying user opinions and preferences. Retrieval augmentation emerges as an effective strategy, as it can accommodate a vast number of users without the costs from fine-tuning. Existing research, however, has largely focused on enhancing the retrieval stage and devoted limited exploration toward optimizing the representation of the database, a crucial aspect for tasks such as personalization. In this work, we examine the problem from a novel angle, focusing on how data can be better represented for more data-efficient retrieval in the context of LLM customization. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Persona-DB, a simple yet effective framework consisting of a hierarchical construction process to improve generalization across task contexts and collaborative refinement to effectively bridge knowledge gaps among users. In the evaluation of response prediction, Persona-DB demonstrates superior context efficiency in maintaining accuracy with a significantly reduced retrieval size, a critical advantage in scenarios with extensive histories or limited context windows. Our experiments also indicate a marked improvement of over 10% under cold-start scenarios, when users have extremely sparse data. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the increasing importance of collaborative knowledge as the retrieval capacity expands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Knab, Sascha Marton, Christian Bartelt</p>
<p>Abstract: LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a popular XAI framework for unraveling decision-making processes in vision machine-learning models. The technique utilizes image segmentation methods to identify fixed regions for calculating feature importance scores as explanations. Therefore, poor segmentation can weaken the explanation and reduce the importance of segments, ultimately affecting the overall clarity of interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce the DSEG-LIME (Data-Driven Segmentation LIME) framework, featuring: i) a data-driven segmentation for human-recognized feature generation by foundation model integration, and ii) a user-steered granularity in the hierarchical segmentation procedure through composition. Our findings demonstrate that DSEG outperforms on several XAI metrics on pre-trained ImageNet models and improves the alignment of explanations with human-recognized concepts.

<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has greatly advanced audio classification, yet the field is limited by the scarcity of large-scale benchmark datasets that have propelled progress in other domains. While AudioSet is a pivotal step to bridge this gap as a universal-domain dataset, its restricted accessibility and limited range of evaluation use cases challenge its role as the sole resource. Therefore, we introduce \texttt{BirdSet}, a large-scale benchmark dataset for audio classification focusing on avian bioacoustics. \texttt{BirdSet} surpasses AudioSet with over 6,800 recording hours~($\uparrow\!17\%$) from nearly 10,000 classes~($\uparrow\!18\times$) for training and more than 400 hours~($\uparrow\!7\times$) across eight strongly labeled evaluation datasets. It serves as a versatile resource for use cases such as multi-label classification, covariate shift or self-supervised learning. We benchmark six well-known DL models in multi-label classification across three distinct training scenarios and outline further evaluation use cases in audio classification. We host our dataset on Hugging Face for easy accessibility and offer an extensive codebase to reproduce our results.</p>

<p>Abstract: In today's world, banks use artificial intelligence to optimize diverse business processes, aiming to improve customer experience. Most of the customer-related tasks can be categorized into two groups: 1) local ones, which focus on a client's current state, such as transaction forecasting, and 2) global ones, which consider the general customer behaviour, e.g., predicting successful loan repayment. Unfortunately, maintaining separate models for each task is costly. Therefore, to better facilitate information management, we compared eight state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on 11 tasks in search for a one-size-fits-all solution. Contrastive self-supervised learning methods were demonstrated to excel at global problems, while generative techniques were superior at local tasks. We also introduced a novel approach, which enriches the client's representation by incorporating external information gathered from other clients. Our method outperforms classical models, boosting accuracy by up to 20\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqian Li, Yan Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Wasserstein distance is a key metric for quantifying data divergence from a distributional perspective. However, its application in privacy-sensitive environments, where direct sharing of raw data is prohibited, presents significant challenges. Existing approaches, such as Differential Privacy and Federated Optimization, have been employed to estimate the Wasserstein distance under such constraints. However, these methods often fall short when both accuracy and security are required. In this study, we explore the inherent triangular properties within the Wasserstein space, leading to a novel solution named TriangleWad. This approach facilitates the fast computation of the Wasserstein distance between datasets stored across different entities, ensuring that raw data remain completely hidden. TriangleWad not only strengthens resistance to potential attacks but also preserves high estimation accuracy. Through extensive experiments across various tasks involving both image and text data, we demonstrate its superior performance and significant potential for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work presents a framework for automatically extracting physical object properties, such as material composition, mass, volume, and stiffness, through robot manipulation and a database of object measurements. The framework involves exploratory action selection to maximize learning about objects on a table. A Bayesian network models conditional dependencies between object properties, incorporating prior probability distributions and uncertainty associated with measurement actions. The algorithm selects optimal exploratory actions based on expected information gain and updates object properties through Bayesian inference. Experimental evaluation demonstrates effective action selection compared to a baseline and correct termination of the experiments if there is nothing more to be learned. The algorithm proved to behave intelligently when presented with trick objects with material properties in conflict with their appearance. The robot pipeline integrates with a logging module and an online database of objects, containing over 24,000 measurements of 63 objects with different grippers. All code and data are publicly available, facilitating automatic digitization of objects and their physical properties through exploratory manipulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mitigating bias in automated decision-making systems, particularly in deep learning models, is a critical challenge due to nuanced definitions of fairness, dataset-specific biases, and the inherent trade-off between fairness and accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce FairVIC, an innovative approach that enhances fairness in neural networks by integrating variance, invariance, and covariance terms into the loss function during training. Unlike methods that rely on predefined fairness criteria, FairVIC abstracts fairness concepts to minimise dependency on protected characteristics. We evaluate FairVIC against comparable bias mitigation techniques on benchmark datasets, considering both group and individual fairness, and conduct an ablation study on the accuracy-fairness trade-off. FairVIC demonstrates significant improvements ($\approx70\%$) in fairness across all tested metrics without compromising accuracy, thus offering a robust, generalisable solution for fair deep learning across diverse tasks and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonjoong Kim, Sangwu Park, Yeonjun In, Seokwon Han, Chanyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, interpreting complex charts with logical reasoning has emerged as challenges due to the development of vision-language models. A prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) model has presented an end-to-end method that leverages the vision-language model to convert charts into table format utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning. However, unlike natural images, charts contain a mix of essential and irrelevant information required for chart reasoning, and we discover that this characteristic can lower the performance of chart-to-table extraction. In this paper, we introduce SIMPLOT, a method designed to extract only the elements necessary for chart reasoning. The proposed method involves two steps: 1) training to mimic a simple plot that contains only the essential information from a complex chart for table extraction, followed by 2) performing reasoning based on the table. Our model enables accurate chart reasoning without the need for additional annotations or datasets, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through various experiments. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt mimicking how human interpret charts for more accurate reasoning. Our source code is available at https://github.com/sangwu99/Simplot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai Zhang, Boyuan Zheng, Tianying Ji, Jinhang Liu, Anqi Guo, Junqiao Zhao, Lanqing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline meta reinforcement learning (OMRL) has emerged as a promising approach for interaction avoidance and strong generalization performance by leveraging pre-collected data and meta-learning techniques. Previous context-based approaches predominantly rely on the intuition that alternating optimization between the context encoder and the policy can lead to performance improvements, as long as the context encoder follows the principle of maximizing the mutual information between the task variable $M$ and its latent representation $Z$ ($I(Z;M)$) while the policy adopts the standard offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms conditioning on the learned task representation.Despite promising results, the theoretical justification of performance improvements for such intuition remains underexplored.Inspired by the return discrepancy scheme in the model-based RL field, we find that the previous optimization framework can be linked with the general RL objective of maximizing the expected return, thereby explaining performance improvements. Furthermore, after scrutinizing this optimization framework, we observe that the condition for monotonic performance improvements does not consider the variation of the task representation. When these variations are considered, the previously established condition may no longer be sufficient to ensure monotonicity, thereby impairing the optimization process.We name this issue task representation shift and theoretically prove that the monotonic performance improvements can be guaranteed with appropriate context encoder updates.Our work opens up a new avenue for OMRL, leading to a better understanding between the task representation and performance improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Wang, Laurence Aitchison</p>
<p>Abstract: The scaling of the optimal AdamW weight decay hyperparameter with model and dataset size is critical as we seek to build larger models, but is poorly understood. We show that weights learned by AdamW can be understood as an exponential moving average (EMA) of recent updates. This gives critical insights for how to set the weight decay in AdamW, and how the weight decay should scale with model and dataset size. In particular, the key hyperparameter for an exponential moving average is the EMA timescale. Intuitively, the EMA timescale can be understood as the number of recent iterations the EMA averages over. We find that the optimal timescale, measured in epochs, is roughly constant as we change model and dataset size. Moreover, given a learning rate, there is a one-to-one mapping from the EMA timescale to the weight decay hyperparameter. Thus, if the optimal EMA timescale is constant, that implies that as the dataset size increases, the optimal weight decay should fall and as the model size increases, the optimal weight decay should increase (if we follow the muP recommendation for scaling the learning rate). We validate these scaling rules on ResNet-18 and Vision Transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and on NanoGPT pre-training on OpenWebText. Finally, we found that as training progresses, muP's learning rate scaling breaks down for AdamW unless weight decay is scaled appropriately.</p>

<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered much attention for their ability to elucidate the prediction process through a humanunderstandable concept layer. However, most previous studies focused on cases where the data, including concepts, are clean. In many scenarios, we often need to remove/insert some training data or new concepts from trained CBMs for reasons such as privacy concerns, data mislabelling, spurious concepts, and concept annotation errors. Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Editable Concept Bottleneck Models (ECBMs). Specifically, ECBMs support three different levels of data removal: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level. ECBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for retraining. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our ECBMs, affirming their practical value in CBMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is to predict the location of a query image from a database of geo-tagged images. Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on VPR-specific data. In this paper, we present an effective approach to harness the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We show that features extracted from self-attention layers can act as a powerful re-ranker for VPR, even in a zero-shot setting. Our method not only outperforms previous zero-shot approaches but also introduces results competitive with several supervised methods. We then show that a single-stage approach utilizing internal ViT layers for pooling can produce global features that achieve state-of-the-art performance, with impressive feature compactness down to 128D. Moreover, integrating our local foundation features for re-ranking further widens this performance gap. Our method also demonstrates exceptional robustness and generalization, setting new state-of-the-art performance, while handling challenging conditions such as occlusion, day-night transitions, and seasonal variations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqing Xing, Zhaoyang Zhang, Zirui Chen, Yusong Wang, Haoran Ma, Zhun Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masahiro Kato</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates an asymptotically locally minimax optimal algorithm for fixed-budget best-arm identification (BAI). We propose the Generalized Neyman Allocation (GNA) algorithm and demonstrate that its worst-case upper bound on the probability of misidentifying the best arm aligns with the worst-case lower bound under the small-gap regime, where the gap between the expected outcomes of the best and suboptimal arms is small. Our lower and upper bounds are tight, matching exactly including constant terms within the small-gap regime. The GNA algorithm generalizes the Neyman allocation for two-armed bandits (Neyman, 1934; Kaufmann et al., 2016) and refines existing BAI algorithms, such as those proposed by Glynn & Juneja (2004). By proposing an asymptotically minimax optimal algorithm, we address the longstanding open issue in BAI (Kaufmann, 2020) and treatment choice (Kasy & Sautmann, 202) by restricting a class of distributions to the small-gap regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Mao, Stefan Balauca, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: Training certifiably robust neural networks is an important but challenging task. While many algorithms for (deterministic) certified training have been proposed, they are often evaluated on different training schedules, certification methods, and systematically under-tuned hyperparameters, making it difficult to compare their performance. To address this challenge, we introduce CTBench, a unified library and a high-quality benchmark for certified training that evaluates all algorithms under fair settings and systematically tuned hyperparameters. We show that (1) almost all algorithms in CTBench surpass the corresponding reported performance in literature in the magnitude of algorithmic improvements, thus establishing new state-of-the-art, and (2) the claimed advantage of recent algorithms drops significantly when we enhance the outdated baselines with a fair training schedule, a fair certification method and well-tuned hyperparameters. Based on CTBench, we provide new insights into the current state of certified training, including (1) certified models have less fragmented loss surface, (2) certified models share many mistakes, (3) certified models have more sparse activations, (4) reducing regularization cleverly is crucial for certified training especially for large radii and (5) certified training has the potential to improve out-of-distribution generalization. We are confident that CTBench will serve as a benchmark and testbed for future research in certified training.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05189">Analyzing the factors that are involved in length of inpatient stay at the hospital for diabetes patients</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorden Lam, Kunpeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper investigates the escalating concerns surrounding the surge in diabetes cases, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the subsequent strain on medical resources. The research aims to construct a predictive model quantifying factors influencing inpatient hospital stay durations for diabetes patients, offering insights to hospital administrators for improved patient management strategies. The literature review highlights the increasing prevalence of diabetes, emphasizing the need for continued attention and analysis of urban-rural disparities in healthcare access. International studies underscore the financial implications and healthcare burden associated with diabetes-related hospitalizations and complications, emphasizing the significance of effective management strategies. The methodology involves a quantitative approach, utilizing a dataset comprising 10,000 observations of diabetic inpatient encounters in U.S. hospitals from 1999 to 2008. Predictive modeling techniques, particularly Generalized Linear Models (GLM), are employed to develop a model predicting hospital stay durations based on patient demographics, admission types, medical history, and treatment regimen. The results highlight the influence of age, medical history, and treatment regimen on hospital stay durations for diabetes patients. Despite model limitations, such as heteroscedasticity and deviations from normality in residual analysis, the findings offer valuable insights for hospital administrators in patient management. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research to address model limitations and explore the implications of predictive models on healthcare management strategies, ensuring equitable patient care and resource allocation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeff Calder, Nadejda Drenska, Drisana Mosaphir</p>
<p>Abstract: This work investigates the online machine learning problem of prediction with expert advice in an adversarial setting through numerical analysis of, and experiments with, a related partial differential equation. The problem is a repeated two-person game involving decision-making at each step informed by $n$ experts in an adversarial environment. The continuum limit of this game over a large number of steps is a degenerate elliptic equation whose solution encodes the optimal strategies for both players. We develop numerical methods for approximating the solution of this equation in relatively high dimensions ($n\leq 10$) by exploiting symmetries in the equation and the solution to drastically reduce the size of the computational domain. Based on our numerical results we make a number of conjectures about the optimality of various adversarial strategies, in particular about the non-optimality of the COMB strategy.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study is among the first to develop different prototypes of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbots powered by GPT-4 to communicate hurricane preparedness information to diverse residents. Drawing from the Computers Are Social Actors paradigm and the literature on disaster vulnerability and cultural tailoring, we conducted a between-subjects experiment with 441 Black, Hispanic, and Caucasian residents of Florida. Our results suggest that GenAI chatbots varying in tone formality and cultural tailoring significantly influence perceptions of their friendliness and credibility, which, in turn, relate to hurricane preparedness outcomes. These results highlight the potential of using GenAI chatbots to improve diverse communities' disaster preparedness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mert Albaba, Sammy Christen, Thomas Langarek, Christoph Gebhardt, Otmar Hilliges, Michael J. Black</p>
<p>Abstract: Acquiring complex behaviors is essential for artificially intelligent agents, yet learning these behaviors in high-dimensional settings poses a significant challenge due to the vast search space. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) requires extensive manual effort for reward function engineering. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) uncovers reward functions from expert demonstrations but relies on an iterative process that is often computationally expensive. Imitation learning (IL) provides a more efficient alternative by directly comparing an agent's actions to expert demonstrations; however, in high-dimensional environments, such direct comparisons offer insufficient feedback for effective learning. We introduce RILe (Reinforced Imitation Learning), a framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn a dense reward function efficiently and achieve strong performance in high-dimensional tasks. RILe employs a novel trainer-student framework: the trainer learns an adaptive reward function, and the student uses this reward signal to imitate expert behaviors. By dynamically adjusting its guidance as the student evolves, the trainer provides nuanced feedback across different phases of learning. Our framework produces high-performing policies in high-dimensional tasks where direct imitation fails to replicate complex behaviors. We validate RILe in challenging robotic locomotion tasks, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves near-expert performance across multiple settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Zhang, Maolin Wang, Wanyu Wang, Jingtong Gao, Xiangyu Zhao, Yu Yang, Xuetao Wei, Zitao Liu, Tong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have gained significant traction in sequential recommender systems (SRSs) for their ability to capture user-item interactions effectively. However, these models often suffer from high computational costs and slow inference. Meanwhile, existing efficient SRS approaches struggle to embed high-quality semantic and positional information into latent representations. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces GLINT-RU, a lightweight and efficient SRS leveraging a single-layer dense selective Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) module to accelerate inference. By incorporating a dense selective gate, GLINT-RU adaptively captures temporal dependencies and fine-grained positional information, generating high-quality latent representations. Additionally, a parallel mixing block infuses fine-grained positional features into user-item interactions, enhancing both recommendation quality and efficiency. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that GLINT-RU achieves superior prediction accuracy and inference speed, outperforming baselines based on RNNs, Transformers, MLPs, and SSMs. These results establish GLINT-RU as a powerful and efficient solution for SRSs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Jiang, Xiaoyuan Yi, Zhihua Wei, Ziang Xiao, Shu Wang, Xing Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Warning: Contains harmful model outputs.
  Despite significant advancements, the propensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful and unethical content poses critical challenges. Measuring value alignment of LLMs becomes crucial for their regulation and responsible deployment. Although numerous benchmarks have been constructed to assess social bias, toxicity, and ethical issues in LLMs, those static benchmarks suffer from evaluation chronoeffect, in which, as models rapidly evolve, existing benchmarks may leak into training data or become saturated, overestimating ever-developing LLMs. To tackle this problem, we propose GETA, a novel generative evolving testing approach based on adaptive testing methods in measurement theory. Unlike traditional adaptive testing methods that rely on a static test item pool, GETA probes the underlying moral boundaries of LLMs by dynamically generating test items tailored to model capability. GETA co-evolves with LLMs by learning a joint distribution of item difficulty and model value conformity, thus effectively addressing evaluation chronoeffect. We evaluated various popular LLMs with GETA and demonstrated that 1) GETA can dynamically create difficulty-tailored test items and 2) GETA's evaluation results are more consistent with models' performance on unseen OOD and i.i.d. items, laying the groundwork for future evaluation paradigms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Assaf Ben-Kish, Itamar Zimerman, Shady Abu-Hussein, Nadav Cohen, Amir Globerson, Lior Wolf, Raja Giryes</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-range sequence processing poses a significant challenge for Transformers due to their quadratic complexity in input length. A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are significantly longer than the ones seen during training, while enjoying faster inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Quinton, Val\'erian Rey</p>
<p>Abstract: Many optimization problems require balancing multiple conflicting objectives. As gradient descent is limited to single-objective optimization, we introduce its direct generalization: Jacobian descent (JD). This algorithm iteratively updates parameters using the Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued objective function, in which each row is the gradient of an individual objective. While several methods to combine gradients already exist in the literature, they are generally hindered when the objectives conflict. In contrast, we propose projecting gradients to fully resolve conflict while ensuring that they preserve an influence proportional to their norm. We prove significantly stronger convergence guarantees with this approach, supported by our empirical results. Our method also enables instance-wise risk minimization (IWRM), a novel learning paradigm in which the loss of each training example is considered a separate objective. Applied to simple image classification tasks, IWRM exhibits promising results compared to the direct minimization of the average loss. Additionally, we outline an efficient implementation of JD using the Gramian of the Jacobian matrix to reduce time and memory requirements.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00066">Compress then Serve: Serving Thousands of LoRA Adapters with Little Overhead</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rickard Br\"uel-Gabrielsson, Jiacheng Zhu, Onkar Bhardwaj, Leshem Choshen, Kristjan Greenewald, Mikhail Yurochkin, Justin Solomon</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) has become common practice, often yielding numerous copies of the same LLM differing only in their LoRA updates. This paradigm presents challenges for systems that serve real-time responses to queries that each involve a different LoRA. Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require continuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store thousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the efficacy of compression when serving LoRAs. We propose a method for the joint compression of LoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling matrices. We extend our algorithm to learn clusters of LoRAs that are amenable to joint compression, allowing it to scale gracefully to large LoRA collections. Our experiments with up to 1000 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed LoRAs preserve performance while offering major throughput gains in realistic serving scenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 80% of the throughput of serving a single LoRA.</p>

Our empirical evaluation shows a reduction of private attribute leakage by more than 90% across 8 different private attributes. Finally, we demonstrate the maturity of IncogniText for real-world applications by distilling its anonymization capability into a set of LoRA parameters associated with an on-device model. Our results show the possibility of reducing privacy leakage by more than half with limited impact on utility.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of integrating forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, focusing on the impacts of switching costs, forecast accuracy, and stability. It proposes a novel framework for analyzing online optimization problems with switching costs and enabled by deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. Through empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis, the research reveals the balance between forecast accuracy, stability, and switching costs in shaping policy performance. Conducted in the context of battery scheduling within energy management applications, it introduces a metric for evaluating probabilistic forecast stability and examines the effects of forecast accuracy and stability on optimization outcomes using the real-world case of the Citylearn 2022 competition. Findings indicate that switching costs significantly influence the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability, highlighting the importance of integrated systems that enable collaboration between forecasting and operational units for improved decision-making. The study shows that committing to a policy for longer periods can be advantageous over frequent updates. Results also show a correlation between forecast stability and policy performance, suggesting that stable forecasts can mitigate switching costs. The proposed framework provides valuable insights for energy sector decision-makers and forecast practitioners when designing the operation of an energy management system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tzu-Heng Huang, Catherine Cao, Vaishnavi Bhargava, Frederic Sala</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pretrained models can be used as annotators, helping replace or augment crowdworkers and enabling distilling generalist models into smaller specialist models. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost: employing top-of-the-line models often requires paying thousands of dollars for API calls, while the resulting datasets are static and challenging to audit. To address these challenges, we propose a simple alternative: rather than directly querying labels from pretrained models, we task models to generate programs that can produce labels. These programs can be stored and applied locally, re-used and extended, and cost orders of magnitude less. Our system, Alchemist, obtains comparable to or better performance than large language model-based annotation in a range of tasks for a fraction of the cost: on average, improvements amount to a 12.9% enhancement while the total labeling costs across all datasets are reduced by a factor of approximately 500x.</p>

<p>Abstract: Thompson Sampling is a principled method for balancing exploration and exploitation, but its real-world adoption is impeded by the high computational overhead of posterior maintenance in large-scale or non-conjugate settings. Ensemble-based approaches offer partial remedies, but often require a large ensemble size. This paper proposes the Ensemble++, a scalable agent that sidesteps these limitations by a shared-factor ensemble update architecture and a random linear combination scheme. We theoretically justify that in linear bandits, Ensemble++ agent only needs an ensemble size of $\Theta(d \log T)$ to achieve regret guarantees comparable to exact Thompson Sampling. Further, to handle nonlinear rewards and complex environments. we introduce a neural extension that replaces fixed features with a learnable representation, preserving the same underlying objective via gradient-based updates. Empirical results confirm that Ensemble++ agent excel in both sample efficiency and computational scalability across linear and nonlinear environments, including GPT-based contextual bandits.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study proposes two novel learning rate schedulers -- Hyperbolic Learning Rate Scheduler (HyperbolicLR) and Exponential Hyperbolic Learning Rate Scheduler (ExpHyperbolicLR) -- to address the epoch sensitivity problem that often causes inconsistent learning curves in conventional methods. By leveraging the asymptotic behavior of hyperbolic curves, the proposed schedulers maintain more stable learning curves across varying epoch settings. Specifically, HyperbolicLR applies this property directly in the epoch-learning rate space, while ExpHyperbolicLR extends it to an exponential space. We first determine optimal hyperparameters for each scheduler on a small number of epochs, fix these hyperparameters, and then evaluate performance as the number of epochs increases. Experimental results on various deep learning tasks (e.g., image classification, time series forecasting, and operator learning) demonstrate that both HyperbolicLR and ExpHyperbolicLR achieve more consistent performance improvements than conventional schedulers as training duration grows. These findings suggest that our hyperbolic-based schedulers offer a more robust and efficient approach to deep network optimization, particularly in scenarios constrained by computational resources or time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> JongWoo Kim, SeongYeub Chu, HyeongMin Park, Bryan Wong, MunYong Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) have advanced node embeddings and relationship learning for various tasks. However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks.

<p>Abstract: Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning often assumes a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors, leading to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. We introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning to enhance the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating additional higher-order moment, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to address epistemic uncertainty by fully leveraging the GGD. We refine batch inverse variance weighting with bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, enhancing robustness. Experiments with policy gradient algorithms demonstrate significant performance gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengze Hong, Di Jiang, Wailing Ng, Zichang Guo, Chen Jason Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Embedding Model (SEM), a neural network-based Siamese architecture, is gaining momentum in information retrieval and natural language processing. In order to train SEM in a supervised fashion for Web search, the search engine query log is typically utilized to automatically formulate pairwise judgments as training data. Despite the growing application of semantic embeddings in the search engine industry, little work has been done on formulating effective pairwise judgments for training SEM. In this paper, we make the first in-depth investigation of a wide range of strategies for generating pairwise judgments for SEM. An interesting (perhaps surprising) discovery reveals that the conventional pairwise judgment formulation strategy wildly used in the field of pairwise Learning-to-Rank (LTR) is not necessarily effective for training SEM. Through a large-scale empirical study based on query logs and click-through activities from a major commercial search engine, we demonstrate the effective strategies for SEM and highlight the advantages of a hybrid heuristic (i.e., Clicked > Non-Clicked) in comparison to the atomic heuristics (e.g., Clicked > Skipped) in LTR. We conclude with best practices for training SEM and offer promising insights for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifeng Ding, Yifeng Li, Yuan He, Antonio Norelli, Jingcheng Wu, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma, Michael Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning useful representations for continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) is challenging, due to the concurrent need to span long node interaction histories and grasp nuanced temporal details. In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiser Sun, Mark Dredze</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of large language models leads to the formation of a pre-train-then-align paradigm, in which the model is typically pre-trained on a large text corpus and undergoes a tuning stage to align the model with human preference or downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the relationship between pre-training and fine-tuning by fine-tuning multiple intermediate pre-trained model checkpoints. Our results on 18 datasets suggest that i) continual pre-training improves the model in a latent way that unveils after fine-tuning; ii) with extra fine-tuning, the datasets that the model does not demonstrate capability gain much more than those that the model performs well during the pre-training stage; iii) although model benefits significantly through supervised fine-tuning, it may forget previously known domain knowledge and the tasks that are not seen during fine-tuning; iv) the model resembles high sensitivity to evaluation prompts after supervised fine-tuning, but this sensitivity can be alleviated by more pre-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Rifat Raiyan, Zibran Zarif Amio, Sabbir Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand shadow puppetry, also known as shadowgraphy or ombromanie, is a form of theatrical art and storytelling where hand shadows are projected onto flat surfaces to create illusions of living creatures. The skilled performers create these silhouettes by hand positioning, finger movements, and dexterous gestures to resemble shadows of animals and objects. Due to the lack of practitioners and a seismic shift in people's entertainment standards, this art form is on the verge of extinction. To facilitate its preservation and proliferate it to a wider audience, we introduce ${\rm H{\small A}SP{\small E}R}$, a novel dataset consisting of 15,000 images of hand shadow puppets across 15 classes extracted from both professional and amateur hand shadow puppeteer clips. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and employ a range of pretrained image classification models to establish baselines. Our findings show a substantial performance superiority of skip-connected convolutional models over attention-based transformer architectures. We also find that lightweight models, such as MobileNetV2, suited for mobile applications and embedded devices, perform comparatively well. We surmise that such low-latency architectures can be useful in developing ombromanie teaching tools, and we create a prototype application to explore this surmission. Keeping the best-performing model ResNet34 under the limelight, we conduct comprehensive feature-spatial, explainability, and error analyses to gain insights into its decision-making process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented dataset and research endeavor to preserve this dying art for future generations, with computer vision approaches. Our code and data will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karl El Hajal, Ajinkya Kulkarni, Enno Hermann, Mathew Magimai. -Doss</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent zero-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) models achieve impressive results, they typically rely on extensive transcribed speech datasets from numerous speakers and intricate training pipelines. Meanwhile, self-supervised learning (SSL) speech features have emerged as effective intermediate representations for TTS. Further, SSL features from different speakers that are linearly close share phonetic information while maintaining individual speaker identity. In this study, we introduce kNN-TTS, a simple and effective framework for zero-shot multi-speaker TTS using retrieval methods which leverage the linear relationships between SSL features. Objective and subjective evaluations show that our models, trained on transcribed speech from a single speaker only, achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art models that are trained on significantly larger training datasets. The low training data requirements mean that kNN-TTS is well suited for the development of multi-speaker TTS systems for low-resource domains and languages. We also introduce an interpolation parameter which enables fine-grained voice morphing. Demo samples are available at https://idiap.github.io/knn-tts</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongshou Li, Pin Tang, Xinke Li, Yuheng Liu, Tianrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Established sampling protocols for 3D point cloud learning, such as Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) and Fixed Sample Size (FSS), have long been relied upon. However, real-world data often suffer from corruptions, such as sensor noise, which violates the benign data assumption in current protocols. As a result, these protocols are highly vulnerable to noise, posing significant safety risks in critical applications like autonomous driving. To address these issues, we propose an enhanced point cloud sampling protocol, PointSP, designed to improve robustness against point cloud corruptions. PointSP incorporates key point reweighting to mitigate outlier sensitivity and ensure the selection of representative points. It also introduces a local-global balanced downsampling strategy, which allows for scalable and adaptive sampling while maintaining geometric consistency. Additionally, a lightweight tangent plane interpolation method is used to preserve local geometry while enhancing the density of the point cloud. Unlike learning-based approaches that require additional model training, PointSP is architecture-agnostic, requiring no extra learning or modification to the network. This enables seamless integration into existing pipelines. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world corrupted datasets show that PointSP significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of point cloud classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyao Ge, Xu Zhang, Yang Zheng, Kaitai Guo, Jimin Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Abundant, well-annotated multimodal data in remote sensing are pivotal for aligning complex visual remote sensing (RS) scenes with human language, enabling the development of specialized vision language models across diverse RS interpretation tasks. However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Zhang, Michael Gienger</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous effort; second, effectively learning robot action trajectories by grounding the visual affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot action trajectories guided by affordances in a supervised flow matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot action trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation affordance achieves competitive performance and even outperforms some other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot action trajectories with flow matching leads to consistently favorable results in several robot manipulation benchmarks than some alternative behavior cloning methods. This includes more stable training and evaluation, and noticeably faster inference, while maintaining comparable generalization performance to diffusion policy, where flow matching performs marginally better in most cases. Our framework seamlessly unifies affordance learning and action generation with flow matching for robot manipulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Outlier detection is a crucial analytical tool in various fields. In critical systems like manufacturing, malfunctioning outlier detection can be costly and safety-critical. Therefore, there is a significant need for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) when deploying opaque models in such environments. This study focuses on manufacturing time series data from a German automotive supply industry. We utilize autoencoders to compress the entire time series and then apply anomaly detection techniques to its latent features. For outlier interpretation, we (i) adopt widely used XAI techniques to the autoencoder's encoder. Additionally, (ii) we propose AEE, Aggregated Explanatory Ensemble, a novel approach that fuses explanations of multiple XAI techniques into a single, more expressive interpretation. For evaluation of explanations, (iii) we propose a technique to measure the quality of encoder explanations quantitatively. Furthermore, we qualitatively assess the effectiveness of outlier explanations with domain expertise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Simionato, Stefano Fasciani</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for emulating piano sounds. We propose to exploit the sines, transient, and noise decomposition to design a differentiable spectral modeling synthesizer replicating piano notes. Three sub-modules learn these components from piano recordings and generate the corresponding harmonic, transient, and noise signals. Splitting the emulation into three independently trainable models reduces the modeling tasks' complexity. The quasi-harmonic content is produced using a differentiable sinusoidal model guided by physics-derived formulas, whose parameters are automatically estimated from audio recordings. The noise sub-module uses a learnable time-varying filter, and the transients are generated using a deep convolutional network. From singular notes, we emulate the coupling between different keys in trichords with a convolutional-based network. Results show the model matches the partial distribution of the target while predicting the energy in the higher part of the spectrum presents more challenges. The energy distribution in the spectra of the transient and noise components is accurate overall. While the model is more computationally and memory efficient, perceptual tests reveal limitations in accurately modeling the attack phase of notes. Despite this, it generally achieves perceptual accuracy in emulating single notes and trichords.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is the task of inferring the implicit constraints that expert agents adhere to, based on their demonstration data. As an emerging research topic, ICRL has received considerable attention in recent years. This article presents a categorical survey of the latest advances in ICRL. It serves as a comprehensive reference for machine learning researchers and practitioners, as well as starters seeking to comprehend the definitions, advancements, and important challenges in ICRL. We begin by formally defining the problem and outlining the algorithmic framework that facilitates constraint inference across various scenarios. These include deterministic or stochastic environments, environments with limited demonstrations, and multiple agents. For each context, we illustrate the critical challenges and introduce a series of fundamental methods to tackle these issues. This survey encompasses discrete, virtual, and realistic environments for evaluating ICRL agents. We also delve into the most pertinent applications of ICRL, such as autonomous driving, robot control, and sports analytics. To stimulate continuing research, we conclude the survey with a discussion of key unresolved questions in ICRL that can effectively foster a bridge between theoretical understanding and practical industrial applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongjoon Lee, Chanwoo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech Super-Resolution (SSR) is a task of enhancing low-resolution speech signals by restoring missing high-frequency components. Conventional approaches typically reconstruct log-mel features, followed by a vocoder that generates high-resolution speech in the waveform domain. However, as mel features lack phase information, this can result in performance degradation during the reconstruction phase. Motivated by recent advances with Selective State Spaces Models (SSMs), we propose a method, referred to as Wave-U-Mamba that directly performs SSR in time domain. In our comparative study, including models such as WSRGlow, NU-Wave 2, and AudioSR, Wave-U-Mamba demonstrates superior performance, achieving the lowest Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) across various low-resolution sampling rates, ranging from 8 to 24 kHz. Additionally, subjective human evaluations, scored using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) reveal that our method produces SSR with natural and human-like quality. Furthermore, Wave-U-Mamba achieves these results while generating high-resolution speech over nine times faster than baseline models on a single A100 GPU, with parameter sizes less than 2\% of those in the baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dasom Choi, SoHyun Park, Kyungah Lee, Hwajung Hong, Young-Ho Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: As minimally verbal autistic (MVA) children communicate with parents through few words and nonverbal cues, parents often struggle to encourage their children to express subtle emotions and needs and to grasp their nuanced signals. We present AACessTalk, a tablet-based, AI-mediated communication system that facilitates meaningful exchanges between an MVA child and a parent. AACessTalk provides real-time guides to the parent to engage the child in conversation and, in turn, recommends contextual vocabulary cards to the child. Through a two-week deployment study with 11 MVA child-parent dyads, we examine how AACessTalk fosters everyday conversation practice and mutual engagement. Our findings show high engagement from all dyads, leading to increased frequency of conversation and turn-taking. AACessTalk also encouraged parents to explore their own interaction strategies and empowered the children to have more agency in communication. We discuss the implications of designing technologies for balanced communication dynamics in parent-MVA child interaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the development of data-centric AI, the focus has shifted from model-driven approaches to improving data quality. Academic literature, as one of the crucial types, is predominantly stored in PDF formats and needs to be parsed into texts before further processing. However, parsing diverse structured texts in academic literature remains challenging due to the lack of datasets that cover various text structures. In this paper, we introduce AceParse, the first comprehensive dataset designed to support the parsing of a wide range of structured texts, including formulas, tables, lists, algorithms, and sentences with embedded mathematical expressions. Based on AceParse, we fine-tuned a multimodal model, named AceParser, which accurately parses various structured texts within academic literature. This model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 4.1% in terms of F1 score and by 5% in Jaccard Similarity, demonstrating the potential of multimodal models in academic literature parsing.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in guiding embodied agents to execute language instructions across a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and navigation. However, existing methods are primarily designed for static environments and do not leverage the agent's own experiences to refine its initial plans. Given that real-world environments are inherently stochastic, initial plans based solely on LLMs' general knowledge may fail to achieve their objectives, unlike in static scenarios. To address this limitation, this study introduces the Experience-and-Emotion Map (E2Map), which integrates not only LLM knowledge but also the agent's real-world experiences, drawing inspiration from human emotional responses. The proposed methodology enables one-shot behavior adjustments by updating the E2Map based on the agent's experiences. Our evaluation in stochastic navigation environments, including both simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrates that the proposed method significantly enhances performance in stochastic environments compared to existing LLM-based approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Gupta, Atahan Ozdemir, Gopala Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel geometric interpretation of LayerNorm and explores how LayerNorm influences the norm and orientation of hidden vectors in the representation space. With these geometric insights, we prepare the foundation for comparing LayerNorm with RMSNorm. We show that the definition of LayerNorm is innately linked to the uniform vector, defined as $\boldsymbol{1} = [1, 1, 1, 1, \cdots, 1]^T \in \mathbb{R}^d$. We then show that the standardization step in LayerNorm can be understood in three simple steps: (i) remove the component of a vector along the uniform vector, (ii) normalize the remaining vector, and (iii) scale the resultant vector by $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the representation space. We also provide additional insights into how LayerNorm operates at inference time. Finally, we compare the hidden representations of LayerNorm-based LLMs with models trained using RMSNorm and show that all LLMs naturally operate orthogonal to the uniform vector at inference time, that is, on average they do not have a component along the uniform vector during inference. This presents the first mechanistic evidence that removing the component along the uniform vector in LayerNorm is a redundant step. These results advocate for using RMSNorm over LayerNorm which is also more computationally efficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by the architecture and functions of the human brain and have revolutionised the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Inspired by studies on the latent geometry of the brain, in this perspective paper we posit that an increase in the research and application of hyperbolic geometry in ANNs and machine learning will lead to increased accuracy, improved feature space representations and more efficient models across a range of tasks. We examine the structure and functions of the human brain, emphasising the correspondence between its scale-free hierarchical organization and hyperbolic geometry, and reflecting on the central role hyperbolic geometry plays in facilitating human intelligence. Empirical evidence indicates that hyperbolic neural networks outperform Euclidean models for tasks including natural language processing, computer vision and complex network analysis, requiring fewer parameters and exhibiting better generalisation. Despite its nascent adoption, hyperbolic geometry holds promise for improving machine learning models through brain-inspired geometric representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Morabito, Sangmitra Madhusudan, Tyler McDonald, Ali Emami</p>
<p>Abstract: Mitigating explicit and implicit biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical focus in the field of natural language processing. However, many current methodologies evaluate scenarios in isolation, without considering the broader context or the spectrum of potential biases within each situation. To address this, we introduce the Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions (STOP) dataset, which includes 450 offensive progressions containing 2,700 unique sentences of varying severity that progressively escalate from less to more explicitly offensive. Covering a broad spectrum of 9 demographics and 46 sub-demographics, STOP ensures inclusivity and comprehensive coverage. We evaluate several leading closed- and open-source models, including GPT-4, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing models detect bias inconsistently, with success rates ranging from 19.3% to 69.8%. We also demonstrate how aligning models with human judgments on STOP can improve model answer rates on sensitive tasks such as BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs by up to 191%, while maintaining or even improving performance. STOP presents a novel framework for assessing the complex nature of biases in LLMs, which will enable more effective bias mitigation strategies and facilitates the creation of fairer language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyou Fan, Chenjia Bai, Zhao Shan, Haoran He, Yang Zhang, Zhen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated their capabilities in modeling trajectories of multi-tasks. However, existing multi-task planners or policies typically rely on task-specific demonstrations via multi-task imitation, or require task-specific reward labels to facilitate policy optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL). They are costly due to the substantial human efforts required to collect expert data or design reward functions. To address these challenges, we aim to develop a versatile diffusion planner capable of leveraging large-scale inferior data that contains task-agnostic sub-optimal trajectories, with the ability to fast adapt to specific tasks. In this paper, we propose SODP, a two-stage framework that leverages Sub-Optimal data to learn a Diffusion Planner, which is generalizable for various downstream tasks. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, we train a foundation diffusion planner that extracts general planning capabilities by modeling the versatile distribution of multi-task trajectories, which can be sub-optimal and has wide data coverage. Then for downstream tasks, we adopt RL-based fine-tuning with task-specific rewards to quickly refine the diffusion planner, which aims to generate action sequences with higher task-specific returns. Experimental results from multi-task domains including Meta-World and Adroit demonstrate that SODP outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only a small amount of data for reward-guided fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ganchao Wei, Li Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow matching (FM) is a family of training algorithms for fitting continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). Conditional flow matching (CFM) exploits the fact that the marginal vector field of a CNF can be learned by fitting least-squares regression to the conditional vector field specified given one or both ends of the flow path. In this paper, we extend the CFM algorithm by defining conditional probability paths along ``streams'', instances of latent stochastic paths that connect data pairs of source and target, which are modeled with Gaussian process (GP) distributions. The unique distributional properties of GPs help preserve the ``simulation-free" nature of CFM training. We show that this generalization of the CFM can effectively reduce the variance in the estimated marginal vector field at a moderate computational cost, thereby improving the quality of the generated samples under common metrics. Additionally, adopting the GP on the streams allows for flexibly linking multiple correlated training data points (e.g., time series). We empirically validate our claim through both simulations and applications to image and neural time series data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artur Back de Luca, George Giapitzakis, Shenghao Yang, Petar Veli\v{c}kovi\'c, Kimon Fountoulakis</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a growing interest in the ability of neural networks to execute algorithmic tasks (e.g., arithmetic, summary statistics, and sorting). The goal of this work is to better understand the role of attention in Transformers for algorithmic execution. Its importance for algorithmic execution has been studied theoretically and empirically using parallel computational models. Notably, many parallel algorithms communicate between processors solely using positional information. Inspired by this observation, we investigate how Transformers can execute algorithms using positional attention, where attention weights depend exclusively on positional encodings. We prove that Transformers with positional attention (positional Transformers) maintain the same expressivity of parallel computational models, incurring a logarithmic depth cost relative to the input length. We analyze their in-distribution learnability and explore how parameter norms in positional attention affect sample complexity. Our results show that positional Transformers introduce a learning trade-off: while they exhibit better theoretical dependence on parameter norms, certain tasks may require more layers, which can, in turn, increase sample complexity. Finally, we empirically explore the out-of-distribution performance of positional Transformers and find that they perform well in tasks where their underlying algorithmic solution relies on positional information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaurav Patel, Christopher Sandino, Behrooz Mahasseni, Ellen L Zippi, Erdrin Azemi, Ali Moin, Juri Minxha</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) in the context of time-series, focusing on enhancing both parameter efficiency and data-sample utilization. Our approach introduces an improved paradigm for source-model preparation and target-side adaptation, aiming to enhance training efficiency during target adaptation. Specifically, we reparameterize the source model's weights in a Tucker-style decomposed manner, factorizing the model into a compact form during the source model preparation phase. During target-side adaptation, only a subset of these decomposed factors is fine-tuned, leading to significant improvements in training efficiency. We demonstrate using PAC Bayesian analysis that this selective fine-tuning strategy implicitly regularizes the adaptation process by constraining the model's learning capacity. Furthermore, this re-parameterization reduces the overall model size and enhances inference efficiency, making the approach particularly well suited for resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework is compatible with various SFDA methods and achieves significant computational efficiency, reducing the number of fine-tuned parameters and inference overhead in terms of MACs by over 90% while maintaining model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail Persiianov, Arip Asadulaev, Nikita Andreev, Nikita Starodubcev, Dmitry Baranchuk, Anastasis Kratsios, Evgeny Burnaev, Alexander Korotin</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning conditional distributions $\pi^*(\cdot|x)$ is a central problem in machine learning, which is typically approached via supervised methods with paired data $(x,y) \sim \pi^*$. However, acquiring paired data samples is often challenging, especially in problems such as domain translation. This necessitates the development of $\textit{semi-supervised}$ models that utilize both limited paired data and additional unpaired i.i.d. samples $x \sim \pi^*_x$ and $y \sim \pi^*_y$ from the marginal distributions. The usage of such combined data is complex and often relies on heuristic approaches. To tackle this issue, we propose a new learning paradigm that integrates both paired and unpaired data $\textbf{seamlessly}$ through the data likelihood maximization techniques. We demonstrate that our approach also connects intriguingly with inverse entropic optimal transport (OT). This finding allows us to apply recent advances in computational OT to establish a $\textbf{light}$ learning algorithm to get $\pi^*(\cdot|x)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate through empirical tests that our method effectively learns conditional distributions using paired and unpaired data simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oussama Zekri, Ambroise Odonnat, Abdelhakim Benechehab, Linus Bleistein, Nicolas Boull\'e, Ievgen Redko</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are remarkably efficient across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and well beyond them. However, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the LLMs' generalization capabilities remains elusive. In our paper, we approach this task by drawing an equivalence between autoregressive transformer-based language models and Markov chains defined on a finite state space. This allows us to study the multi-step inference mechanism of LLMs from first principles. We relate the obtained results to the pathological behavior observed with LLMs such as repetitions and incoherent replies with high temperature. Finally, we leverage the proposed formalization to derive pre-training and in-context learning generalization bounds for LLMs under realistic data and model assumptions. Experiments with the most recent Llama and Gemma herds of models show that our theory correctly captures their behavior in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengzhi Yang, Xinyu Wang, Ruipeng Zhang, Cong Wang, Frans A. Oliehoek, Jens Kober</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental objective in intelligent robotics is to move towards lifelong learning robot that can learn and adapt to unseen scenarios over time. However, continually learning new tasks would introduce catastrophic forgetting problems due to data distribution shifts. To mitigate this, we store a subset of data from previous tasks and utilize it in two manners: leveraging experience replay to retain learned skills and applying a novel Retrieval-based Local Adaptation technique to restore relevant knowledge. Since a lifelong learning robot must operate in task-free scenarios, where task IDs and even boundaries are not available, our method performs effectively without relying on such information. We also incorporate a selective weighting mechanism to focus on the most "forgotten" skill segment, ensuring effective knowledge restoration. Experimental results across diverse manipulation tasks demonstrate that our framework provides a scalable paradigm for lifelong learning, enhancing robot performance in open-ended, task-free scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ignacio Hounie, Charilaos Kanatsoulis, Arnuv Tandon, Alejandro Ribeiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) method that effectively adapts large pre-trained models for downstream tasks. LoRA parameterizes model updates using low-rank matrices at each layer, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters and, consequently, resource requirements during fine-tuning. However, the lower bound on the number of trainable parameters remains high due to the use of the low-rank matrix model. Recent works have addressed this limitation by proposing low rank tensor parameterizations for model updates. However, they only exploit redundancy across layers, or tensorize individual matrices using ad-hoc schemes that introduce additional hyperparameters. In this work, we propose a higher-order Candecomp/Parafac (CP) decomposition, enabling a more compact and flexible representation compared to existing matrix and tensor based PEFT methods. Our experiments on Natural Language Understanding, Instruction Tuning, Preference Optimization and Protein Folding benchmarks demonstrate that our method can achieve a reduction in the number of parameters while maintaining comparable performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Tian, Yixuan Li, Yichao Yan, Shanyan Guan, Yanhao Ge, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of image editing, three core challenges persist: controllability, background preservation, and efficiency. Inversion-based methods rely on time-consuming optimization to preserve the features of the initial images, which results in low efficiency due to the requirement for extensive network inference. Conversely, inversion-free methods lack theoretical support for background similarity, as they circumvent the issue of maintaining initial features to achieve efficiency. As a consequence, none of these methods can achieve both high efficiency and background consistency. To tackle the challenges and the aforementioned disadvantages, we introduce PostEdit, a method that incorporates a posterior scheme to govern the diffusion sampling process. Specifically, a corresponding measurement term related to both the initial features and Langevin dynamics is introduced to optimize the estimated image generated by the given target prompt. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed PostEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance while accurately preserving unedited regions. Furthermore, the method is both inversion- and training-free, necessitating approximately 1.5 seconds and 18 GB of GPU memory to generate high-quality results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianke Zhang, Yanjiang Guo, Xiaoyu Chen, Yen-Jen Wang, Yucheng Hu, Chengming Shi, Jianyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging powerful pre trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) backends, have shown promise in robotic control due to their impressive generalization ability. However, the success comes at a cost. Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HiRT, a Hierarchical Robot Transformer framework that enables flexible frequency and performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Empirically, in static tasks, we double the control frequency and achieve comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel real-world dynamic ma nipulation tasks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success rate from 48% to 75%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoran Zhang, Yongxiang Li, Zijian Kan, Keyuan Cheng, Lijie Hu, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The locate-then-edit paradigm has shown significant promise for knowledge editing (KE) in Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous methods perform well on single-hop fact recall tasks, they consistently struggle with multi-hop factual recall tasks involving newly edited knowledge. In this paper, leveraging tools in mechanistic interpretability, we first identify that in multi-hop tasks, LLMs tend to retrieve knowledge with implicit subject information from deeper MLP layers, unlike single-hop tasks, which rely on shallow layers. This distinction explains the poor performance of current methods in multi-hop queries, as they primarily focus on editing shallow layers with single-hop edit prompts, leaving deeper layers unchanged. To address this, we propose IFMET, a novel locate-then-edit KE approach designed to edit both shallow and deep MLP layers. Beyond single-hop editing prompts, IFMET further incorporates multi-hop editing prompts to locate and modify knowledge across different stages of reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that IFMET significantly improves performance on multi-hop factual recall tasks, overcoming the limitations of previous locate-then-edit methods</p>

<p>Abstract: The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a significant step towards responsible AI development, but lacks clear technical interpretation, making it difficult to assess models' compliance. This work presents COMPL-AI, a comprehensive framework consisting of (i) the first technical interpretation of the EU AI Act, translating its broad regulatory requirements into measurable technical requirements, with the focus on large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an open-source Act-centered benchmarking suite, based on thorough surveying and implementation of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks. By evaluating 12 prominent LLMs in the context of COMPL-AI, we reveal shortcomings in existing models and benchmarks, particularly in areas like robustness, safety, diversity, and fairness. This work highlights the need for a shift in focus towards these aspects, encouraging balanced development of LLMs and more comprehensive regulation-aligned benchmarks. Simultaneously, COMPL-AI for the first time demonstrates the possibilities and difficulties of bringing the Act's obligations to a more concrete, technical level. As such, our work can serve as a useful first step towards having actionable recommendations for model providers, and contributes to ongoing efforts of the EU to enable application of the Act, such as the drafting of the GPAI Code of Practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingyu Zhu, Haoyu Liu, Ziyu Wang, Zhimin Jiang, Zeyu Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing generative models to create or conditionally create symbolic music presents unique challenges due to the combination of limited data availability and the need for high precision in note pitch. To address these challenges, we introduce an efficient Fine-Grained Guidance (FGG) approach within diffusion models. FGG guides the diffusion models to generate music that aligns more closely with the control and intent of expert composers, which is critical to improve the accuracy, listenability, and quality of generated music. This approach empowers diffusion models to excel in advanced applications such as improvisation, and interactive music creation. We derive theoretical characterizations for both the challenges in symbolic music generation and the effects of the FGG approach. We provide numerical experiments and subjective evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We have published a demo page to showcase performances, as one of the first in the symbolic music literature's demo pages that enables real-time interactive generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel methodology for voice pathology detection using the publicly available Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database (SVD) database and a robust feature set combining commonly used acoustic handcrafted features with two novel ones: pitch difference (relative variation in fundamental frequency) and a NaN feature (failed fundamental frequency estimation).
  We evaluate six machine learning (ML) classifiers - support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost - using grid search for feasible hyperparameters of selected classifiers and 20480 different feature subsets. Top 1000 classifier-feature subset combinations for each classifier type are validated with repeated stratified cross-validation. To address class imbalance, we apply K-Means SMOTE to augment the training data.
  Our approach achieves outstanding performance, reaching 85.61%, 84.69% and 85.22% unweighted average recall (UAR) for females, males and combined results respectivelly. We intentionally omit accuracy as it is a highly biased metric for imbalanced data. This advancement demonstrates significant potential for clinical deployment of ML methods, offering a valuable supportive tool for an objective examination of voice pathologies. To enable an easier use of our methodology and to support our claims, we provide a publicly available GitHub repository with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.13771573.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juntao Zhao, Wenhao Lu, Sheng Wang, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization has been substantially adopted to accelerate inference and reduce memory consumption of large language models (LLMs). While activation-weight joint quantization speeds up the inference process through low-precision kernels, we demonstrate that it suffers severe performance degradation on multi-step reasoning tasks, rendering it ineffective. We propose a novel quantization paradigm called QSPEC, which seamlessly integrates two complementary quantization schemes for speculative decoding. Leveraging nearly cost-free execution switching, QSPEC drafts tokens with low-precision, fast activation-weight quantization, and verifies them with high-precision weight-only quantization, effectively combining the strengths of both quantization schemes. Compared to high-precision quantization methods, QSPEC empirically boosts token generation throughput by up to 1.64x without any quality compromise, distinguishing it from other low-precision quantization approaches. This enhancement is also consistent across various serving tasks, model sizes, quantization methods, and batch sizes. Compared to state-of-art speculative decoding methods, our approach reuses weights and the KV cache, avoiding extra memory overhead while achieving up to 1.55x speedup in batched serving with a high acceptance rate. Furthermore, QSPEC offers a plug-and-play advantage without requiring any training. We believe that QSPEC demonstrates unique strengths for future deployment of high-fidelity quantization schemes, particularly in memory-constrained scenarios (e.g., edge devices).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Gambetta, Gizem Gezici, Fosca Giannotti, Dino Pedreschi, Alistair Knott, Luca Pappalardo</p>
<p>Abstract: As synthetic content increasingly infiltrates the web, generative AI models may experience an autophagy process, where they are fine-tuned using their own outputs. This autophagy could lead to a phenomenon known as model collapse, which entails a degradation in the performance and diversity of generative AI models over successive generations. Recent studies have explored the emergence of model collapse across various generative AI models and types of data. However, the current characterizations of model collapse tend to be simplistic and lack comprehensive evaluation. In this article, we conduct a thorough investigation of model collapse across three text datasets, utilizing semantic networks to analyze text repetitiveness and diversity, while employing next-token probabilities to quantify the loss of diversity. We also examine how the proportions of synthetic tokens affect the severity of model collapse and perform cross-dataset evaluations to identify domain-specific variations. By proposing metrics and strategies for a more detailed assessment of model collapse, our study provides new insights for the development of robust generative AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyu Hu, Jieyu Zhang, Zhihan Xiong, Alexander Ratner, Hui Xiong, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating their outputs' quality regarding *preference* remains a critical challenge. Existing works usually leverage an LLM as the judge for comparing LLMs' output pairwisely, yet such model-based evaluator is *weak evaluator* due to *conflicting preference*, i.e., output A is better than B, B than C, but C than A, causing contradictory evaluation results. To address this, we introduce GED (Preference Graph Ensemble and Denoise), a novel approach that leverages multiple model-based evaluators to construct preference graphs, and then ensemble and denoise these graphs for better, non-contradictory evaluation results. In particular, our method consists of two primary stages: aggregating evaluations into a unified graph and applying a denoising process to eliminate cyclic inconsistencies, ensuring a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. We provide theoretical guarantees for our framework, demonstrating its efficacy in recovering the ground truth preference structure. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks demonstrate GED's superiority in three applications: model ranking, response selection, and model alignment tasks. Notably, GED combines small LLM evaluators (e.g., Llama3-8B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) to outperform stronger ones (e.g., Qwen2-72B), showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing evaluation reliability and improving model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayan Biswas, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Alexis Marouani, Rafael Pires, Rishi Sharma, Martijn de Vos</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) is an emerging technique that allows nodes on the web to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data. Dealing with stragglers, i.e., nodes with slower compute or communication than others, is a key challenge in DL. We present DivShare, a novel asynchronous DL algorithm that achieves fast model convergence in the presence of communication stragglers. DivShare achieves this by having nodes fragment their models into parameter subsets and send, in parallel to computation, each subset to a random sample of other nodes instead of sequentially exchanging full models. The transfer of smaller fragments allows more efficient usage of the collective bandwidth and enables nodes with slow network links to quickly contribute with at least some of their model parameters. By theoretically proving the convergence of DivShare, we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first formal proof of convergence for a DL algorithm that accounts for the effects of asynchronous communication with delays. We experimentally evaluate DivShare against two state-of-the-art DL baselines, AD-PSGD and Swift, and with two standard datasets, CIFAR-10 and MovieLens. We find that DivShare with communication stragglers lowers time-to-accuracy by up to 3.9x compared to AD-PSGD on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Compared to baselines, DivShare also achieves up to 19.4% better accuracy and 9.5% lower test loss on the CIFAR-10 and MovieLens datasets, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been commonly utilized for social recommendation systems. However, real-world scenarios often present challenges related to user privacy and business constraints, inhibiting direct access to valuable social information from other platforms. While many existing methods have tackled matrix factorization-based social recommendations without direct social data access, developing GNN-based federated social recommendation models under similar conditions remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, we propose a novel vertical federated social recommendation method leveraging privacy-preserving two-party graph convolution networks (P4GCN) to enhance recommendation accuracy without requiring direct access to sensitive social information. First, we introduce a Sandwich-Encryption module to ensure comprehensive data privacy during the collaborative computing process. Second, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the privacy guarantees, considering the participation of both curious and honest parties. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that P4GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) have emerged as critical intellectual property (IP) assets that necessitate protection. Although various watermarking strategies have been proposed, they remain vulnerable to Linear Functionality Equivalence Attack (LFEA), which can invalidate most existing white-box watermarks without prior knowledge of the watermarking scheme or training data. This paper analyzes and extends the attack scenarios of LFEA to the commonly employed black-box settings for LMs by considering Last-Layer outputs (dubbed LL-LFEA). We discover that the null space of the output matrix remains invariant against LL-LFEA attacks. Based on this finding, we propose NSmark, a black-box watermarking scheme that is task-agnostic and capable of resisting LL-LFEA attacks. NSmark consists of three phases: (i) watermark generation using the digital signature of the owner, enhanced by spread spectrum modulation for increased robustness; (ii) watermark embedding through an output mapping extractor that preserves the LM performance while maximizing watermark capacity; (iii) watermark verification, assessed by extraction rate and null space conformity. Extensive experiments on both pre-training and downstream tasks confirm the effectiveness, scalability, reliability, fidelity, and robustness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Cook, Charlie Grimshaw, Ben Wu, Sophie Dillon, Jack Hicks, Luke Jones, Thomas Smith, Matyas Szert, Xingyi Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targeting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanna Kim, Minkyoo Song, Seung Ho Na, Seungwon Shin, Kimin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have established them as agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with various tools. These LLM agents are often paired with web-based tools, enabling access to diverse sources and real-time information. Although these advancements offer significant benefits across various applications, they also increase the risk of malicious use, particularly in cyberattacks involving personal information. In this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in cyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1) how potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how cyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it becomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack scenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the generation of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of LLM agents in these attacks: LLM agents achieved a precision of up to 95.9% in collecting PII, generated impersonation posts where 93.9% of them were deemed authentic, and boosted click rate of phishing links in spear phishing emails by 46.67%. Additionally, our findings underscore the limitations of existing safeguards in contemporary commercial LLMs, emphasizing the urgent need for robust security measures to prevent the misuse of LLM agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gokul Puthumanaillam, Paulo Padrao, Jose Fuentes, Leonardo Bobadilla, Melkior Ornik</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olga Krestinskaya, Mohammed E. Fouda, Ahmed Eltawil, Khaled N. Salama</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing generalized in-memory computing (IMC) hardware that efficiently supports a variety of workloads requires extensive design space exploration, which is infeasible to perform manually. Optimizing hardware individually for each workload or solely for the largest workload often fails to yield the most efficient generalized solutions. To address this, we propose a joint hardware-workload optimization framework that identifies optimised IMC chip architecture parameters, enabling more efficient, workload-flexible hardware. We show that joint optimization achieves 36%, 36%, 20%, and 69% better energy-latency-area scores for VGG16, ResNet18, AlexNet, and MobileNetV3, respectively, compared to the separate architecture parameters search optimizing for a single largest workload. Additionally, we quantify the performance trade-offs and losses of the resulting generalized IMC hardware compared to workload-specific IMC designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Yang, Boming Yang, Aosong Feng, Sixun Ouyang, Moritz Blum, Tianwei She, Yuang Jiang, Freddy Lecue, Jinghui Lu, Irene Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are crucial in the field of artificial intelligence and are widely used in downstream tasks, such as question-answering (QA). The construction of KGs typically requires significant effort from domain experts. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been used for Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC). However, most existing approaches focus on a local perspective, extracting knowledge triplets from individual sentences or documents, missing a fusion process to combine the knowledge in a global KG. This work introduces Graphusion, a zero-shot KGC framework from free text. It contains three steps: in Step 1, we extract a list of seed entities using topic modeling to guide the final KG includes the most relevant entities; in Step 2, we conduct candidate triplet extraction using LLMs; in Step 3, we design the novel fusion module that provides a global view of the extracted knowledge, incorporating entity merging, conflict resolution, and novel triplet discovery. Results show that Graphusion achieves scores of 2.92 and 2.37 out of 3 for entity extraction and relation recognition, respectively. Moreover, we showcase how Graphusion could be applied to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain and validate it in an educational scenario. Specifically, we introduce TutorQA, a new expert-verified benchmark for QA, comprising six tasks and a total of 1,200 QA pairs. Using the Graphusion-constructed KG, we achieve a significant improvement on the benchmark, for example, a 9.2% accuracy improvement on sub-graph completion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models applied to bio-molecular space hold promise to accelerate drug discovery. Molecular representation is key to building such models. Previous works have typically focused on a single representation or view of the molecules. Here, we develop a multi-view foundation model approach, that integrates molecular views of graph, image and text. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules and then aggregated into combined representations. Our multi-view model is validated on a diverse set of 18 tasks, encompassing ligand-protein binding, molecular solubility, metabolism and toxicity. We show that the multi-view models perform robustly and are able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of specific views. We then apply this model to screen compounds against a large (>100 targets) set of G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). From this library of targets, we identify 33 that are related to Alzheimer's disease. On this subset, we employ our model to identify strong binders, which are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</p>

Previous approaches have focused on enhancing discrimination and marginal calibration. In this paper, we highlight the significance of conditional calibration for real-world applications -- especially its role in individual decision-making. We propose a method based on conformal prediction that uses the model's predicted individual survival probability at that instance's observed time. This method effectively improves the model's marginal and conditional calibration, without compromising discrimination. We provide asymptotic theoretical guarantees for both marginal and conditional calibration and test it extensively across 15 diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating the method's practical effectiveness and versatility in various settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiwoong Yoo, Owen Oertell, Junhyun Lee, Sanghoon Lee, Jaewoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigating the vast chemical space of druggable compounds is a formidable challenge in drug discovery, where generative models are increasingly employed to identify viable candidates. Conditional 3D structure-based drug design (3D-SBDD) models, which take into account complex three-dimensional interactions and molecular geometries, are particularly promising. Scaffold hopping is an efficient strategy that facilitates the identification of similar active compounds by strategically modifying the core structure of molecules, effectively narrowing the wide chemical space and enhancing the discovery of drug-like products. However, the practical application of 3D-SBDD generative models is hampered by their slow processing speeds. To address this bottleneck, we introduce TurboHopp, an accelerated pocket-conditioned 3D scaffold hopping model that merges the strategic effectiveness of traditional scaffold hopping with rapid generation capabilities of consistency models. This synergy not only enhances efficiency but also significantly boosts generation speeds, achieving up to 30 times faster inference speed as well as superior generation quality compared to existing diffusion-based models, establishing TurboHopp as a powerful tool in drug discovery. Supported by faster inference speed, we further optimize our model, using Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Models (RLCM), to output desirable molecules. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TurboHopp across multiple drug discovery scenarios, underscoring its potential in diverse molecular settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become essential for advancing the integration of visual and linguistic information. However, the evaluation of LVLMs presents significant challenges as the evaluation benchmark always demands lots of human cost for its construction, and remains static, lacking flexibility once constructed. Even though automatic evaluation has been explored in textual modality, the visual modality remains under-explored. As a result, in this work, we address a question: "Can LVLMs themselves be used to benchmark each other in the visual automatically domain?". We introduce AutoBench-V, an automated framework for serving evaluation on demand, i.e., benchmarking LVLMs based on specific aspects of model capability. AutoBench-V leverages text-to-image models to generate relevant image samples and then utilizes LVLMs to orchestrate visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, completing the evaluation process efficiently and flexibly. Through an extensive evaluation of nine popular LVLMs across five demanded user inputs (i.e., evaluation capabilities), the framework shows effectiveness and reliability.</p>

Participants in our experiment discern truth from lies by evaluating transcripts from a game show that mimicked deceptive social media exchanges on topics with objective truths. We find that when relying on low-quality advisors without disclosures, participants' truth-detection rates fall below their own abilities, which recovered once the AI's true effectiveness was revealed. Conversely, high-quality advisor enhances truth detection, regardless of disclosure. We discover that participants' expectations about AI capabilities contribute to their undue reliance on opaque, low-quality advisors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haritz Puerto, Martin Gubri, Sangdoo Yun, Seong Joon Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIA) attempt to verify the membership of a given data sample in the training set for a model. MIA has become relevant in recent years, following the rapid development of large language models (LLM). Many are concerned about the usage of copyrighted materials for training them and call for methods for detecting such usage. However, recent research has largely concluded that current MIA methods do not work on LLMs. Even when they seem to work, it is usually because of the ill-designed experimental setup where other shortcut features enable "cheating." In this work, we argue that MIA still works on LLMs, but only when multiple documents are presented for testing. We construct new benchmarks that measure the MIA performances at a continuous scale of data samples, from sentences (n-grams) to a collection of documents (multiple chunks of tokens). To validate the efficacy of current MIA approaches at greater scales, we adapt a recent work on Dataset Inference (DI) for the task of binary membership detection that aggregates paragraph-level MIA features to enable MIA at document and collection of documents level. This baseline achieves the first successful MIA on pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Statistical learning in high-dimensional spaces is challenging without a strong underlying data structure. Recent advances with foundational models suggest that text and image data contain such hidden structures, which help mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Inspired by results from nonparametric statistics, we hypothesize that this phenomenon can be partially explained in terms of decomposition of complex tasks into simpler subtasks. In this paper, we present a controlled experimental framework to test whether neural networks can indeed exploit such "hidden factorial structures". We find that they do leverage these latent patterns to learn discrete distributions more efficiently. We also study the interplay between our structural assumptions and the models' capacity for generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elad Sharony, Heng Yang, Tong Che, Marco Pavone, Shie Mannor, Peter Karkus</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequentially solving similar optimization problems under strict runtime constraints is essential for many applications, such as robot control, autonomous driving, and portfolio management. The performance of local optimization methods in these settings is sensitive to the initial solution: poor initialization can lead to slow convergence or suboptimal solutions. To address this challenge, we propose learning to predict \emph{multiple} diverse initial solutions given parameters that define the problem instance. We introduce two strategies for utilizing multiple initial solutions: (i) a single-optimizer approach, where the most promising initial solution is chosen using a selection function, and (ii) a multiple-optimizers approach, where several optimizers, potentially run in parallel, are each initialized with a different solution, with the best solution chosen afterward. Notably, by including a default initialization among predicted ones, the cost of the final output is guaranteed to be equal or lower than with the default initialization. We validate our method on three optimal control benchmark tasks: cart-pole, reacher, and autonomous driving, using different optimizers: DDP, MPPI, and iLQR. We find significant and consistent improvement with our method across all evaluation settings and demonstrate that it efficiently scales with the number of initial solutions required.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangxuan Xu, Kai Xu, Shivchander Sudalairaj, Hao Wang, Akash Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference tuning relies on high-quality human preference data, which is often expensive and time-consuming to gather. In this paper, we introduce Dr.SoW (Density Ratio of Strong over Weak) a cost-effective method that eliminates the reliance for human annotation by leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for preference data annotation. Dr.SoW uses the log-density ratio between a better-aligned and a less-aligned LLM as a reward signal. We evaluate Dr.SoW across 221 different LLM pairs and empirically find a strong correlation between the performance gap of the paired models and the quality of the reward signal. This insight provides a practical guideline for selecting LLMs for data annotation.
  Additionally, we introduce an end-to-end pipeline that customizes reward functions based on user query domains. Without fine-tuning, it improves accuracy on domain-specific evaluations. With a pair of Mistral-7B models, Dr.SoW achieves a RewardBench score of 82.6, outperforming the best trained reward functions from same model class and demonstrating competitive performance against SoTA models in Safety (91.0) and Reasoning (88.0) domains. Further, we preference-tune Llama-3-8B-Instruct using data annotated by Dr.SoW. Our approach pushes Llama-3-8B to achieve a 37.4 % (+15.1 %) win rate on ArenaHard and a 40.7 % (+17.8 %) win rate on length-controlled AlpacaEval 2.0.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaoyue Zhou, Hengkai Pan, Yann LeCun, Lerrel Pinto</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to predict future outcomes given control actions is fundamental for physical reasoning. However, such predictive models, often called world models, remains challenging to learn and are typically developed for task-specific solutions with online policy learning. To unlock world models' true potential, we argue that they should 1) be trainable on offline, pre-collected trajectories, 2) support test-time behavior optimization, and 3) facilitate task-agnostic reasoning. To this end, we present DINO World Model (DINO-WM), a new method to model visual dynamics without reconstructing the visual world. DINO-WM leverages spatial patch features pre-trained with DINOv2, enabling it to learn from offline behavioral trajectories by predicting future patch features. This allows DINO-WM to achieve observational goals through action sequence optimization, facilitating task-agnostic planning by treating goal features as prediction targets. We demonstrate that DINO-WM achieves zero-shot behavioral solutions at test time on six environments without expert demonstrations, reward modeling, or pre-learned inverse models, outperforming prior state-of-the-art work across diverse task families such as arbitrarily configured mazes, push manipulation with varied object shapes, and multi-particle scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the design of iterative combinatorial auctions (ICAs). The main challenge in this domain is that the bundle space grows exponentially in the number of items. To address this, recent work has proposed machine learning (ML)-based preference elicitation algorithms that aim to elicit only the most critical information from bidders to maximize efficiency. However, while the SOTA ML-based algorithms elicit bidders' preferences via value queries, ICAs that are used in practice elicit information via demand queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel ML algorithm that provably makes use of the full information from both value and demand queries, and we show via experiments that combining both query types results in significantly better learning performance in practice. Building on these insights, we present MLHCA, a new ML-powered auction that uses value and demand queries. MLHCA substantially outperforms the previous SOTA, reducing efficiency loss by up to a factor 10, with up to 58% fewer queries. Thus, MLHCA achieves large efficiency improvements while also reducing bidders' cognitive load, establishing a new benchmark for both practicability and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijie Hu, Chenyang Ren, Huanyi Xie, Khouloud Saadi, Shu Yang, Zhen Tan, Jingfeng Zhang, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning, commonly applied in large-scale multimodal models, often relies on data from diverse and often unreliable sources, which can include misaligned or mislabeled text-image pairs. This frequently leads to robustness issues and hallucinations, ultimately causing performance degradation. Data valuation is an efficient way to detect and trace these misalignments. Nevertheless, existing methods are computationally expensive for large-scale models. Although computationally efficient, classical influence functions are inadequate for contrastive learning models, as they were initially designed for pointwise loss. Furthermore, contrastive learning involves minimizing the distance between positive sample modalities while maximizing the distance between negative sample modalities. This necessitates evaluating the influence of samples from both perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Extended Influence Function for Contrastive Loss (ECIF), an influence function crafted for contrastive loss. ECIF considers both positive and negative samples and provides a closed-form approximation of contrastive learning models, eliminating the need for retraining. Building upon ECIF, we develop a series of algorithms for data evaluation, misalignment detection, and misprediction trace-back tasks. Experimental results demonstrate our ECIF advances the transparency and interpretability of CLIP-style embedding models by offering a more accurate assessment of data impact and model alignment compared to traditional baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Younggyo Seo, Pieter Abbeel</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), we train a value function to understand the long-term consequence of executing a single action. However, the value of taking each action can be ambiguous in robotics as robot movements are typically the aggregate result of executing multiple small actions. Moreover, robotic training data often consists of noisy trajectories, in which each action is noisy but executing a series of actions results in a meaningful robot movement. This further makes it difficult for the value function to understand the effect of individual actions. To address this, we introduce Coarse-to-fine Q-Network with Action Sequence (CQN-AS), a novel value-based RL algorithm that learns a critic network that outputs Q-values over a sequence of actions, i.e., explicitly training the value function to learn the consequence of executing action sequences. We study our algorithm on 53 robotic tasks with sparse and dense rewards, as well as with and without demonstrations, from BiGym, HumanoidBench, and RLBench.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kichang Lee, Yujin Shin, Jonghyuk Yun, Songkuk Kim, Jun Han, JeongGil Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving local data privacy, making it ideal for mobile and embedded systems. However, the decentralized nature of FL also opens vulnerabilities to model poisoning attacks, particularly backdoor attacks, where adversaries implant trigger patterns to manipulate model predictions. In this paper, we propose DeTrigger, a scalable and efficient backdoor-robust federated learning framework that leverages insights from adversarial attack methodologies. By employing gradient analysis with temperature scaling, DeTrigger detects and isolates backdoor triggers, allowing for precise model weight pruning of backdoor activations without sacrificing benign model knowledge. Extensive evaluations across four widely used datasets demonstrate that DeTrigger achieves up to 251x faster detection than traditional methods and mitigates backdoor attacks by up to 98.9%, with minimal impact on global model accuracy. Our findings establish DeTrigger as a robust and scalable solution to protect federated learning environments against sophisticated backdoor threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyao Ma, Menglin Yang, Mingxuan Ju, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern recommender systems often create information cocoons, restricting users' exposure to diverse content. A key challenge lies in balancing content exploration and exploitation while allowing users to adjust their recommendation preferences. Intuitively, this balance can be modeled as a tree-structured representation, where depth search facilitates exploitation and breadth search enables exploration. However, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations: Euclidean methods struggle to capture hierarchical structures, while hyperbolic methods, despite their superior hierarchical modeling, lack semantic understanding of user and item profiles and fail to provide a principled mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation. To address these challenges, we propose HERec, a hyperbolic graph-LLM framework that effectively balances exploration and exploitation in recommender systems. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hierarchical-aware graph-LLM mechanism that jointly aligns textual descriptions with user-item collaborative information in hyperbolic space, and (2) a hierarchical representation structure that enables user-adjustable exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HERec consistently outperforms both Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines, achieving up to 5.49% improvement in utility metrics and 11.39% increase in diversity metrics, effectively mitigating information cocoons. We open-source our model implementation at https://github.com/Martin-qyma/HERec.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinming Xing, Dongwen Luo, Chang Xue, Ruilin Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by delivering state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks. Among these, Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT rely on pooling layers to aggregate token-level embeddings into sentence-level representations. Common pooling mechanisms such as Mean, Max, and Weighted Sum play a pivotal role in this aggregation process. Despite their widespread use, the comparative performance of these strategies on different LLM architectures remains underexplored. To address this gap, this paper investigates the effects of these pooling mechanisms on two prominent LLM families -- BERT and GPT, in the context of sentence-level sentiment analysis. Comprehensive experiments reveal that each pooling mechanism exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses depending on the task's specific requirements. Our findings underline the importance of selecting pooling methods tailored to the demands of particular applications, prompting a re-evaluation of common assumptions regarding pooling operations. By offering actionable insights, this study contributes to the optimization of LLM-based models for downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Lesniewski, Giulio Trigila</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a highly efficient and accurate methodology for generating synthetic financial market data using a diffusion model approach. The synthetic data produced by our methodology align closely with observed market data in several key aspects: (i) they pass the two-sample Cramer - von Mises test for portfolios of assets, and (ii) Q - Q plots demonstrate consistency across quantiles, including in the tails, between observed and generated market data. Moreover, the covariance matrices derived from a large set of synthetic market data exhibit significantly lower condition numbers compared to the estimated covariance matrices of the observed data. This property makes them suitable for use as regularized versions of the latter. For model training, we develop an efficient and fast algorithm based on numerical integration rather than Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is tested on a large set of equity data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Fetrat Qharabagh, Mohammadreza Ghofrani, Kimon Fountoulakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Counting is a fundamental operation for various visual tasks in real-life applications, requiring both object recognition and robust counting capabilities. Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language models (LVLMs) struggle with counting tasks, especially when the number of objects exceeds those commonly encountered during training. We enhance LVLMs' counting abilities using a divide-and-conquer approach, breaking counting problems into sub-counting tasks. Our method employs a mechanism that prevents bisecting and thus repetitive counting of objects, which occurs in a naive divide-and-conquer approach. Unlike prior methods, which do not generalize well to counting datasets they have not been trained on, our method performs well on new datasets without any additional training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate that our approach enhances the counting capability of LVLMs across various datasets and benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yerram Varun, Rahul Madhavan, Sravanti Addepalli, Arun Suggala, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Prateek Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time. However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kasra Arabi, Benjamin Feuer, R. Teal Witter, Chinmay Hegde, Niv Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques.
  In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Jaafar, Shreyas Sundara Raman, Yichen Wei, Sudarshan Harithas, Sofia Juliani, Anneke Wernerfelt, Benedict Quartey, Ifrah Idrees, Jason Xinyu Liu, Stefanie Tellex</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently learning and executing long-horizon mobile manipulation (MoMa) tasks is crucial for advancing robotics in household and workplace settings. However, current MoMa models are data-inefficient, underscoring the need for improved models that require realistic-sized benchmarks to evaluate their efficiency, which do not exist. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA ({\lambda}) benchmark (Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation Benchmarking of Directed Activities), which evaluates the data efficiency of models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor, pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for collection. The benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We benchmark several models, including learning-based models and a neuro-symbolic modular approach combining foundation models with task and motion planning. Learning-based models show suboptimal success rates, even when leveraging pretrained weights, underscoring significant data inefficiencies. However, the neuro-symbolic approach performs significantly better while being more data efficient. Findings highlight the need for more data-efficient learning-based MoMa approaches. {\lambda} addresses this gap by serving as a key benchmark for evaluating the data efficiency of those future models in handling household robotics tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoxi Cheng, Yizhong Ding, Shuirong Cao, Ranjie Duan, Xiaoshuang Jia, Shaowei Yuan, Zhiqiang Wang, Xiaojun Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the vulnerabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to jailbreak attacks is essential for their responsible real-world deployment. Most previous work requires access to model gradients, or is based on human knowledge (prompt engineering) to complete jailbreak, and they hardly consider the interaction of images and text, resulting in inability to jailbreak in black box scenarios or poor performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for toxicity maximization, referred to as PBI-Attack. Our method begins by extracting malicious features from a harmful corpus using an alternative LVLM and embedding these features into a benign image as prior information. Subsequently, we enhance these features through bidirectional cross-modal interaction optimization, which iteratively optimizes the bimodal perturbations in an alternating manner through greedy search, aiming to maximize the toxicity of the generated response. The toxicity level is quantified using a well-trained evaluation model. Experiments demonstrate that PBI-Attack outperforms previous state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, achieving an average attack success rate of 92.5% across three open-source LVLMs and around 67.3% on three closed-source LVLMs. Disclaimer: This paper contains potentially disturbing and offensive content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Abaskohi, Spandana Gella, Giuseppe Carenini, Issam H. Laradji</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal multihop question answering is a complex task that requires reasoning over multiple sources of information, such as images and text, to answer questions. While there has been significant progress in visual question answering, the multihop setting remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current methods focus on single-hop question answering or a single modality, which makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios such as analyzing multimodal educational materials, summarizing lengthy academic articles, or interpreting scientific studies that combine charts, images, and text. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology, introducing the first framework for creating a high-quality dataset that enables training models for multimodal multihop question answering. Our approach consists of a 5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from Wikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and validating them through rigorous criteria to ensure quality data. We evaluate our methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on two benchmarks, our results demonstrate that, with an equal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those trained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) on average. We believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for training and evaluating multimodal multihop question answering models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning enables decentralized model training without sharing raw data, preserving data privacy. However, its vulnerability towards critical security threats, such as gradient inversion and model poisoning by malicious clients, remain unresolved. Existing solutions often address these issues separately, sacrificing either system robustness or model accuracy. This work introduces Tazza, a secure and efficient federated learning framework that simultaneously addresses both challenges. By leveraging the permutation equivariance and invariance properties of neural networks via weight shuffling and shuffled model validation, Tazza enhances resilience against diverse poisoning attacks, while ensuring data confidentiality and high model accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations on various datasets and embedded platforms show that Tazza achieves robust defense with up to 6.7x improved computational efficiency compared to alternative schemes, without compromising performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Robbins</p>
<p>Abstract: We derive a general change of variables formula for score functions, showing that for a smooth, invertible transformation $\mathbf{y} = \phi(\mathbf{x})$, the transformed score function $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q(\mathbf{y})$ can be expressed directly in terms of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p(\mathbf{x})$. Using this result, we develop two applications: First, we establish a reverse-time It\^o lemma for score-based diffusion models, allowing the use of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ to reverse an SDE in the transformed space without directly learning $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q_t(\mathbf{y})$. This approach enables training diffusion models in one space but sampling in another, effectively decoupling the forward and reverse processes. Second, we introduce generalized sliced score matching, extending traditional sliced score matching from linear projections to arbitrary smooth transformations. This provides greater flexibility in high-dimensional density estimation. We demonstrate these theoretical advances through applications to diffusion on the probability simplex and empirically compare our generalized score matching approach against traditional sliced score matching methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocong Rao, Chunyan Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Person re-identification (re-ID) via 3D skeleton data is a challenging task with significant value in many scenarios. Existing skeleton-based methods typically assume virtual motion relations between all joints, and adopt average joint or sequence representations for learning. However, they rarely explore key body structure and motion such as gait to focus on more important body joints or limbs, while lacking the ability to fully mine valuable spatial-temporal sub-patterns of skeletons to enhance model learning. This paper presents a generic Motif guided graph transformer with Combinatorial skeleton prototype learning (MoCos) that exploits structure-specific and gait-related body relations as well as combinatorial features of skeleton graphs to learn effective skeleton representations for person re-ID. In particular, motivated by the locality within joints' structure and the body-component collaboration in gait, we first propose the motif guided graph transformer (MGT) that incorporates hierarchical structural motifs and gait collaborative motifs, which simultaneously focuses on multi-order local joint correlations and key cooperative body parts to enhance skeleton relation learning. Then, we devise the combinatorial skeleton prototype learning (CSP) that leverages random spatial-temporal combinations of joint nodes and skeleton graphs to generate diverse sub-skeleton and sub-tracklet representations, which are contrasted with the most representative features (prototypes) of each identity to learn class-related semantics and discriminative skeleton representations. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of MoCos over existing state-of-the-art models. We further show its generality under RGB-estimated skeletons, different graph modeling, and unsupervised scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqi Ge, Juncheng Li, Xinglei Pang, Minghe Gao, Kaihang Pan, Wang Lin, Hao Fei, Wenqiao Zhang, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital agents are increasingly employed to automate tasks in interactive digital environments such as web pages, software applications, and operating systems. While text-based agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often require frequent updates due to platform-specific APIs, visual agents leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer enhanced adaptability by interacting directly with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). However, these agents face significant challenges in visual perception, particularly when handling high-resolution, visually complex digital environments. This paper introduces Iris, a foundational visual agent that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: Information-Sensitive Cropping (ISC) and Self-Refining Dual Learning (SRDL). ISC dynamically identifies and prioritizes visually dense regions using a edge detection algorithm, enabling efficient processing by allocating more computational resources to areas with higher information density. SRDL enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks by leveraging a dual-learning loop, where improvements in referring (describing UI elements) reinforce grounding (locating elements) and vice versa, all without requiring additional annotated data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Iris achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with only 850K GUI annotations, outperforming methods using 10x more training data. These improvements further translate to significant gains in both web and OS agent downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional adversarial attacks typically produce adversarial examples under norm-constrained conditions, whereas unrestricted adversarial examples are free-form with semantically meaningful perturbations. Current unrestricted adversarial impersonation attacks exhibit limited control over adversarial face attributes and often suffer from low transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel Text Controlled Attribute Attack (TCA$^2$) to generate photorealistic adversarial impersonation faces guided by natural language. Specifically, the category-level personal softmax vector is employed to precisely guide the impersonation attacks. Additionally, we propose both data and model augmentation strategies to achieve transferable attacks on unknown target models. Finally, a generative model, \textit{i.e}, Style-GAN, is utilized to synthesize impersonated faces with desired attributes. Extensive experiments on two high-resolution face recognition datasets validate that our TCA$^2$ method can generate natural text-guided adversarial impersonation faces with high transferability. We also evaluate our method on real-world face recognition systems, \textit{i.e}, Face++ and Aliyun, further demonstrating the practical potential of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nobel Dhar, Bobin Deng, Md Romyull Islam, Kazi Fahim Ahmad Nasif, Liang Zhao, Kun Suo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying local AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to edge devices can substantially enhance devices' independent capabilities, alleviate the server's burden, and lower the response time. Owing to these tremendous potentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge motivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and enhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model compression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method is orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize the compression rate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network (FFN) components, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters (around 2/3), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of achieving effective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to general LLMs and are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work systematically investigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity and perplexity (accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that we can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing reductions for critical FFN components with negligible accuracy degradation. This extra 50% sparsity does not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which require tuning LLMs' activation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds. To obtain the benefits of activation sparsity, we provide a guideline for the system architect for LLM prediction and prefetching. The success prediction allows the system to prefetch the necessary weights while omitting the inactive ones and their successors, therefore lowering cache and memory pollution and reducing LLM execution time on resource-constrained edge devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kathrin Wardatzky, Oana Inel, Luca Rossetto, Abraham Bernstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Adding explanations to recommender systems is said to have multiple benefits, such as increasing user trust or system transparency. Previous work from other application areas suggests that specific user characteristics impact the users' perception of the explanation. However, we rarely find this type of evaluation for recommender systems explanations. This paper addresses this gap by surveying 124 papers in which recommender systems explanations were evaluated in user studies. We analyzed their participant descriptions and study results where the impact of user characteristics on the explanation effects was measured. Our findings suggest that the results from the surveyed studies predominantly cover specific users who do not necessarily represent the users of recommender systems in the evaluation domain. This may seriously hamper the generalizability of any insights we may gain from current studies on explanations in recommender systems. We further find inconsistencies in the data reporting, which impacts the reproducibility of the reported results. Hence, we recommend actions to move toward a more inclusive and reproducible evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Zhang, Liqiang Jing, Vibhav Gogate</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new task called Defeasible Visual Entailment (DVE), where the goal is to allow the modification of the entailment relationship between an image premise and a text hypothesis based on an additional update. While this concept is well-established in Natural Language Inference, it remains unexplored in visual entailment. At a high level, DVE enables models to refine their initial interpretations, leading to improved accuracy and reliability in various applications such as detecting misleading information in images, enhancing visual question answering, and refining decision-making processes in autonomous systems. Existing metrics do not adequately capture the change in the entailment relationship brought by updates. To address this, we propose a novel inference-aware evaluator designed to capture changes in entailment strength induced by updates, using pairwise contrastive learning and categorical information learning. Additionally, we introduce a reward-driven update optimization method to further enhance the quality of updates generated by multimodal models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluator and optimization method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahra Babaiee, Peyman M. Kiasari, Daniela Rus, Radu Grosu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper challenges the prevailing view that convolutional neural network (CNN) filters become increasingly specialized in deeper layers. Motivated by recent observations of clusterable repeating patterns in depthwise separable CNNs (DS-CNNs) trained on ImageNet, we extend this investigation across various domains and datasets. Our analysis of DS-CNNs reveals that deep filters maintain generality, contradicting the expected transition to class-specific filters. We demonstrate the generalizability of these filters through transfer learning experiments, showing that frozen filters from models trained on different datasets perform well and can be further improved when sourced from larger datasets. Our findings indicate that spatial features learned by depthwise separable convolutions remain generic across all layers, domains, and architectures. This research provides new insights into the nature of generalization in neural networks, particularly in DS-CNNs, and has significant implications for transfer learning and model design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaikang Lin, Sei Chang, Aaron Zweig, Minseo Kang, Elham Azizi, David A. Knowles</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengpeng Xie, Jiahang Cao, Qiang Zhang, Jianxiong Zhang, Changwei Wang, Renjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans rely on high-level understandings of things, i.e., meta-representations, to engage in abstract reasoning. In complex cognitive tasks, these meta-representations help individuals abstract general rules from experience. However, constructing such meta-representations from high-dimensional observations remains a longstanding challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. For instance, a well-trained agent often fails to generalize to even minor variations of the same task, such as changes in background color, while humans can easily handle. In this paper, we theoretically investigate how meta-representations contribute to the generalization ability of RL agents, demonstrating that learning meta-representations from high-dimensional observations enhance an agent's ability to generalize across varied environments. We further hypothesize that deep mutual learning (DML) among agents can help them learn the meta-representations that capture the underlying essence of the task. Empirical results provide strong support for both our theory and hypothesis. Overall, this work provides a new perspective on the generalization of deep reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yekun Ke, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Visual Autoregressive ($\mathsf{VAR}$) Models introduced a groundbreaking advancement in the field of image generation, offering a scalable approach through a coarse-to-fine ``next-scale prediction'' paradigm. Suppose that $n$ represents the height and width of the last VQ code map generated by $\mathsf{VAR}$ models, the state-of-the-art algorithm in [Tian, Jiang, Yuan, Peng and Wang, NeurIPS 2024] takes $O(n^{4+o(1)})$ time, which is computationally inefficient. In this work, we analyze the computational limits and efficiency criteria of $\mathsf{VAR}$ Models through a fine-grained complexity lens. Our key contribution is identifying the conditions under which $\mathsf{VAR}$ computations can achieve sub-quadratic time complexity. We have proved that assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ($\mathsf{SETH}$) from fine-grained complexity theory, a sub-quartic time algorithm for $\mathsf{VAR}$ models is impossible. To substantiate our theoretical findings, we present efficient constructions leveraging low-rank approximations that align with the derived criteria. This work initiates the study of the computational efficiency of the $\mathsf{VAR}$ model from a theoretical perspective. Our technique will shed light on advancing scalable and efficient image generation in $\mathsf{VAR}$ frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueyi Ke, Satoshi Tsutsui, Yayun Zhang, Bihan Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Infants develop complex visual understanding rapidly, even preceding of the acquisition of linguistic inputs. As computer vision seeks to replicate the human vision system, understanding infant visual development may offer valuable insights. In this paper, we present an interdisciplinary study exploring this question: can a computational model that imitates the infant learning process develop broader visual concepts that extend beyond the vocabulary it has heard, similar to how infants naturally learn? To investigate this, we analyze a recently published model in Science by Vong et al.,which is trained on longitudinal, egocentric images of a single child paired with transcribed parental speech. We introduce a training-free framework that can discover visual concept neurons hidden in the model's internal representations. Our findings show that these neurons can classify objects outside its original vocabulary. Furthermore, we compare the visual representations in infant-like models with those in moder computer vision models, such as CLIP or ImageNet pre-trained model, highlighting key similarities and differences. Ultimately, our work bridges cognitive science and computer vision by analyzing the internal representations of a computational model trained on an infant's visual and linguistic inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keita Kinjo</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, explainability in machine learning has gained importance. In this context, counterfactual explanation (CE), which is an explanation method that uses examples, has attracted attention. However, it has been pointed out that CE is not robust when there are multiple machine-learning models with similar accuracy. These problems are important when using machine learning to make safe decisions. In this paper, we propose robust CEs that introduce a new viewpoint -- Pareto improvement -- and a method that uses multi-objective optimization to generate it. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments using both simulated and real data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is both robust and practical. This study highlights the potential of ensuring robustness in decision-making by applying the concept of social welfare. We believe that this research can serve as a valuable foundation for various fields, including explainability in machine learning, decision-making, and action planning based on machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Dong Jiang, Chih-Yung Chang, Diptendu Sinha Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, violence detection systems developed using unified multimodal models have achieved significant success and attracted widespread attention. However, most of these systems face two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability as black-box models and limited functionality, offering only classification or retrieval capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel interpretable violence detection system, termed the Three-in-One (TIO) System. The TIO system integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and graph attention networks (GAT) to provide three core functionalities: detection, retrieval, and explanation. Specifically, the system processes each video frame along with text descriptions generated by a large language model (LLM) for videos containing potential violent behavior. It employs ImageBind to generate high-dimensional embeddings for constructing a knowledge graph, uses GAT for reasoning, and applies lightweight time series modules to extract video embedding features. The final step connects a classifier and retriever for multi-functional outputs. The interpretability of KG enables the system to verify the reasoning process behind each output. Additionally, the paper introduces several lightweight methods to reduce the resource consumption of the TIO system and enhance its efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. A case study further reveals an intriguing phenomenon: as the number of bystanders increases, the occurrence of violent behavior tends to decrease.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tzu-Heng Huang, Manjot Bilkhu, Frederic Sala, Javier Movellan</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are trained on large-scale web-crawled datasets, which often contain noise, biases, and irrelevant information. This motivates the use of data selection techniques, which can be divided into model-free variants -- relying on heuristic rules and downstream datasets -- and model-based, e.g., using influence functions. The former can be expensive to design and risk introducing unwanted dependencies, while the latter are often computationally prohibitive. Instead, we propose an efficient, model-based approach using the Mimic Score, a new data quality metric that leverages the weights of a reference model to assess the usefulness of individual samples for training a new model. It relies on the alignment between gradients and a target direction induced by the reference model. Using the derived Mimic Scores, we develop Grad-Mimic, a framework that prioritizes samples for learning, creates effective filters, and automates data selection. Empirically, using Mimic Scores to guide training improves data efficiency, results in consistent performance gains across six image datasets, and includes enhancements to CLIP models. Moreover, Mimic Score-based filters improve upon existing filtering methods, e.g., cutting 4.7 million samples to train better CLIP models while offering accurate estimation of training dataset quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current evaluations of defenses against prompt attacks in large language model (LLM) applications often overlook two critical factors: the dynamic nature of adversarial behavior and the usability penalties imposed on legitimate users by restrictive defenses. We propose D-SEC (Dynamic Security Utility Threat Model), which explicitly separates attackers from legitimate users, models multi-step interactions, and expresses the security-utility in an optimizable form. We further address the shortcomings in existing evaluations by introducing Gandalf, a crowd-sourced, gamified red-teaming platform designed to generate realistic, adaptive attack. Using Gandalf, we collect and release a dataset of 279k prompt attacks. Complemented by benign user data, our analysis reveals the interplay between security and utility, showing that defenses integrated in the LLM (e.g., system prompts) can degrade usability even without blocking requests. We demonstrate that restricted application domains, defense-in-depth, and adaptive defenses are effective strategies for building secure and useful LLM applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Exploration is a crucial skill for self-improvement and open-ended problem-solving. However, it remains unclear if large language models can effectively explore the state-space within an unknown environment. This work isolates exploration as the sole objective, tasking the agent with delivering information that enhances future returns. Within this framework, we argue that measuring agent returns is not sufficient for a fair evaluation and decompose missing rewards into exploration and exploitation components based on the optimal achievable return. Comprehensive experiments with various models reveal that most struggle to sufficiently explore the state-space and weak exploration is insufficient. We observe a positive correlation between parameter count and exploration performance, with larger models demonstrating superior capabilities. Furthermore, we show that our decomposition provides insights into differences in behaviors driven by prompt engineering, offering a valuable tool for refining performance in exploratory tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyun Li, Yushi Chen, Xinya Shu, Dong Chen, Xin He, Yi Yu, Xue Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The multimodal language models (MLMs) based on generative pre-trained Transformer are considered powerful candidates for unifying various domains and tasks. MLMs developed for remote sensing (RS) have demonstrated outstanding performance in multiple tasks, such as visual question answering and visual grounding. In addition to visual grounding that detects specific objects corresponded to given instruction, aerial detection, which detects all objects of multiple categories, is also a valuable and challenging task for RS foundation models. However, aerial detection has not been explored by existing RS MLMs because the autoregressive prediction mechanism of MLMs differs significantly from the detection outputs. In this paper, we present a simple baseline for applying MLMs to aerial detection for the first time, named LMMRotate. Specifically, we first introduce a normalization method to transform detection outputs into textual outputs to be compatible with the MLM framework. Then, we propose a evaluation method, which ensures a fair comparison between MLMs and conventional object detection models. We construct the baseline by fine-tuning open-source general-purpose MLMs and achieve impressive detection performance comparable to conventional detector. We hope that this baseline will serve as a reference for future MLM development, enabling more comprehensive capabilities for understanding RS images.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-video generation models have made impressive progress, but they still struggle with generating videos with complex features. This limitation often arises from the inability of the text encoder to produce accurate embeddings, which hinders the video generation model. In this work, we propose a novel approach to overcome this challenge by selecting the optimal text embedding through interpolation in the embedding space. We demonstrate that this method enables the video generation model to produce the desired videos. Additionally, we introduce a simple algorithm using perpendicular foot embeddings and cosine similarity to identify the optimal interpolation embedding. Our findings highlight the importance of accurate text embeddings and offer a pathway for improving text-to-video generation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xia Li, Hanghang Zheng, Xiao Chen, Hong Liu, Mao Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence has significantly enhanced credit scoring technologies. Despite the remarkable efficacy of advanced deep learning models, mainstream adoption continues to favor tree-structured models due to their robust predictive performance on tabular data. Although pretrained models have seen considerable development, their application within the financial realm predominantly revolves around question-answering tasks and the use of such models for tabular-structured credit scoring datasets remains largely unexplored. Tabular-oriented large models, such as TabPFN, has made the application of large models in credit scoring feasible, albeit can only processing with limited sample sizes. This paper provides a novel framework to combine tabular-tailored dataset distillation technique with the pretrained model, empowers the scalability for TabPFN. Furthermore, though class imbalance distribution is the common nature in financial datasets, its influence during dataset distillation has not been explored. We thus integrate the imbalance-aware techniques during dataset distillation, resulting in improved performance in financial datasets (e.g., a 2.5% enhancement in AUC). This study presents a novel framework for scaling up the application of large pretrained models on financial tabular datasets and offers a comparative analysis of the influence of class imbalance on the dataset distillation process. We believe this approach can broaden the applications and downstream tasks of large models in the financial domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Looped Transformers have shown exceptional neural algorithmic reasoning capability in simulating traditional graph algorithms, but their application to more complex structures like hypergraphs remains underexplored. Hypergraphs generalize graphs by modeling higher-order relationships among multiple entities, enabling richer representations but introducing significant computational challenges. In this work, we extend the Loop Transformer architecture's neural algorithmic reasoning capability to simulate hypergraph algorithms, addressing the gap between neural networks and combinatorial optimization over hypergraphs. Specifically, we propose a novel degradation mechanism for reducing hypergraphs to graph representations, enabling the simulation of graph-based algorithms, such as Dijkstra's shortest path. Furthermore, we introduce a hyperedge-aware encoding scheme to simulate hypergraph-specific algorithms, exemplified by Helly's algorithm. We establish theoretical guarantees for these simulations, demonstrating the feasibility of processing high-dimensional and combinatorial data using Loop Transformers. This work highlights the potential of Transformers as general-purpose algorithmic solvers for structured data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikos Kanakaris, Heng Ping, Xiongye Xiao, Nesreen K. Ahmed, Luca Luceri, Emilio Ferrara, Paul Bogdan</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting organized political campaigns is of paramount importance in fighting against disinformation on social media. Existing approaches for the identification of such organized actions employ techniques mostly from network science, graph machine learning and natural language processing. Their ultimate goal is to analyze the relationships and interactions (e.g. re-posting) among users and the textual similarities of their posts. Despite their effectiveness in recognizing astroturf campaigns, these methods face significant challenges, notably the class imbalance in available training datasets. To mitigate this issue, recent methods usually resort to data augmentation or increasing the number of positive samples, which may not always be feasible or sufficient in real-world settings. Following a different path, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for identifying astroturf campaigns based solely on large language models (LLMs), introducing a Balanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Balanced RAG) component. Our approach first gives both textual information concerning the posts (in our case tweets) and the user interactions of the social network as input to a language model. Then, through prompt engineering and the proposed Balanced RAG method, it effectively detects coordinated disinformation campaigns on X (Twitter). The proposed framework does not require any training or fine-tuning of the language model. Instead, by strategically harnessing the strengths of prompt engineering and Balanced RAG, it facilitates LLMs to overcome the effects of class imbalance and effectively identify coordinated political campaigns. The experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating the proposed prompt engineering and Balanced RAG methods, our framework outperforms the traditional graph-based baselines, achieving 2x-3x improvements in terms of precision, recall and F1 scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeounoh Chung, Gaurav T. Kakkar, Yu Gan, Brenton Milne, Fatma Ozcan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information.
  In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve strong performances on various benchmark datasets without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding social signals in multi-party conversations is important for human-robot interaction and artificial social intelligence. Social signals include body pose, head pose, speech, and context-specific activities like acquiring and taking bites of food when dining. Past work in multi-party interaction tends to build task-specific models for predicting social signals. In this work, we address the challenge of predicting multimodal social signals in multi-party settings in a single model. We introduce M3PT, a causal transformer architecture with modality and temporal blockwise attention masking to simultaneously process multiple social cues across multiple participants and their temporal interactions. We train and evaluate M3PT on the Human-Human Commensality Dataset (HHCD), and demonstrate that using multiple modalities improves bite timing and speaking status prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Kruspe</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the biases in their training data and, by extension, those of the people who created this training data. Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating such biases is becoming a focus of research. One type of bias that has been understudied so far are geocultural biases. Those can be caused by an imbalance in the representation of different geographic regions and cultures in the training data, but also by value judgments contained therein. In this paper, we make a first step towards analyzing musical biases in LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and Mixtral. We conduct two experiments. In the first, we prompt LLMs to provide lists of the "Top 100" musical contributors of various categories and analyze their countries of origin. In the second experiment, we ask the LLMs to numerically rate various aspects of the musical cultures of different countries. Our results indicate a strong preference of the LLMs for Western music cultures in both experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enhances the real world by integrating virtual content, yet ensuring the quality, usability, and safety of AR experiences presents significant challenges. Could Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a solution for the automated evaluation of AR-generated scenes? Could Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a solution for the automated evaluation of AR-generated scenes? In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of three state-of-the-art commercial VLMs -- GPT, Gemini, and Claude -- in identifying and describing AR scenes. For this purpose, we use DiverseAR, the first AR dataset specifically designed to assess VLMs' ability to analyze virtual content across a wide range of AR scene complexities. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs are generally capable of perceiving and describing AR scenes, achieving a True Positive Rate (TPR) of up to 93% for perception and 71% for description. While they excel at identifying obvious virtual objects, such as a glowing apple, they struggle when faced with seamlessly integrated content, such as a virtual pot with realistic shadows. Our results highlight both the strengths and the limitations of VLMs in understanding AR scenarios. We identify key factors affecting VLM performance, including virtual content placement, rendering quality, and physical plausibility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mojtaba Safari, Zach Eidex, Chih-Wei Chang, Richard L. J. Qiu, Xiaofeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality and provides comprehensive anatomical and functional insights into the human body. However, its long acquisition times can lead to patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and limiting real-time applications. To address these challenges, strategies such as parallel imaging have been applied, which utilize multiple receiver coils to speed up the data acquisition process. Additionally, compressed sensing (CS) is a method that facilitates image reconstruction from sparse data, significantly reducing image acquisition time by minimizing the amount of data collection needed. Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving MRI reconstruction. It has been integrated with parallel imaging and CS principles to achieve faster and more accurate MRI reconstructions. This review comprehensively examines DL-based techniques for MRI reconstruction. We categorize and discuss various DL-based methods, including end-to-end approaches, unrolled optimization, and federated learning, highlighting their potential benefits. Our systematic review highlights significant contributions and underscores the potential of DL in MRI reconstruction. Additionally, we summarize key results and trends in DL-based MRI reconstruction, including quantitative metrics, the dataset, acceleration factors, and the progress of and research interest in DL techniques over time. Finally, we discuss potential future directions and the importance of DL-based MRI reconstruction in advancing medical imaging. To facilitate further research in this area, we provide a GitHub repository that includes up-to-date DL-based MRI reconstruction publications and public datasets-https://github.com/mosaf/Awesome-DL-based-CS-MRI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suresh Babu Nettur, Shanthi Karpurapu, Unnati Nettur, Likhit Sagar Gajja, Sravanthy Myneni, Akhil Dusi, Lalithya Posham</p>
<p>Abstract: Lightweight deep learning approaches for malaria detection have gained attention for their potential to enhance diagnostics in resource constrained environments. For our study, we selected SqueezeNet1.1 as it is one of the most popular lightweight architectures. SqueezeNet1.1 is a later version of SqueezeNet1.0 and is 2.4 times more computationally efficient than the original model. We proposed and implemented three ultra-lightweight architecture variants to SqueezeNet1.1 architecture, namely Variant 1 (one fire module), Variant 2 (two fire modules), and Variant 3 (four fire modules), which are even more compact than SqueezeNetV1.1 (eight fire modules). These models were implemented to evaluate the best performing variant that achieves superior computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy in malaria blood cell classification. The models were trained and evaluated using the NIH Malaria dataset. We assessed each model's performance based on metrics including accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The results show that the SqueezeNet1.1 model achieves the highest performance across all metrics, with a classification accuracy of 97.12%. Variant 3 (four fire modules) offers a competitive alternative, delivering almost identical results (accuracy 96.55%) with a 6x reduction in computational overhead compared to SqueezeNet1.1. Variant 2 and Variant 1 perform slightly lower than Variant 3, with Variant 2 (two fire modules) reducing computational overhead by 28x, and Variant 1 (one fire module) achieving a 54x reduction in trainable parameters compared to SqueezeNet1.1. These findings demonstrate that our SqueezeNet1.1 architecture variants provide a flexible approach to malaria detection, enabling the selection of a variant that balances resource constraints and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhyeok Kang, Yooju Shin, Jae-Gil Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Variate tokenization, which independently embeds each variate as separate tokens, has achieved remarkable improvements in multivariate time series forecasting. However, employing self-attention with variate tokens incurs a quadratic computational cost with respect to the number of variates, thus limiting its training efficiency for large-scale applications. To address this issue, we propose VarDrop, a simple yet efficient strategy that reduces the token usage by omitting redundant variate tokens during training. VarDrop adaptively excludes redundant tokens within a given batch, thereby reducing the number of tokens used for dot-product attention while preserving essential information. Specifically, we introduce k-dominant frequency hashing (k-DFH), which utilizes the ranked dominant frequencies in the frequency domain as a hash value to efficiently group variate tokens exhibiting similar periodic behaviors. Then, only representative tokens in each group are sampled through stratified sampling. By performing sparse attention with these selected tokens, the computational cost of scaled dot-product attention is significantly alleviated. Experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that VarDrop outperforms existing efficient baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erica Coppolillo, Giuseppe Manco, Luca Maria Aiello</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting biases in the outputs produced by generative models is essential to reduce the potential risks associated with their application in critical settings. However, the majority of existing methodologies for identifying biases in generated text consider the models in isolation and neglect their contextual applications. Specifically, the biases that may arise in multi-agent systems involving generative models remain under-researched. To address this gap, we present a framework designed to quantify biases within multi-agent systems of conversational Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach involves simulating small echo chambers, where pairs of LLMs, initialized with aligned perspectives on a polarizing topic, engage in discussions. Contrary to expectations, we observe significant shifts in the stance expressed in the generated messages, particularly within echo chambers where all agents initially express conservative viewpoints, in line with the well-documented political bias of many LLMs toward liberal positions. Crucially, the bias observed in the echo-chamber experiment remains undetected by current state-of-the-art bias detection methods that rely on questionnaires. This highlights a critical need for the development of a more sophisticated toolkit for bias detection and mitigation for AI multi-agent systems. The code to perform the experiments is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLMsConversationalBias-7725.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youpeng Ma, Tao Chen, Ke Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As software systems become more complex and configurable, more performance problems tend to arise from the configuration designs. This has caused some configuration options to unexpectedly degrade performance which deviates from their original expectations designed by the developers. Such discrepancies, namely configuration performance bugs (CPBugs), are devastating and can be deeply hidden in the source code. Yet, efficiently testing CPBugs is difficult, not only due to the test oracle is hard to set, but also because the configuration measurement is expensive and there are simply too many possible configurations to test. As such, existing testing tools suffer from lengthy runtime or have been ineffective in detecting CPBugs when the budget is limited, compounded by inaccurate test oracle. In this paper, we seek to achieve significantly faster CPBug testing by neurally prioritizing the testing at both the configuration option and value range levels with automated oracle estimation. Our proposed tool, dubbed NDP, is a general framework that works with different heuristic generators. The idea is to leverage two neural language models: one to estimate the CPBug types that serve as the oracle while, more vitally, the other to infer the probabilities of an option being CPBug-related, based on which the options and the value ranges to be searched can be prioritized. Experiments on several widely-used systems of different versions reveal that NDP can, in general, better predict CPBug type in 87% cases and find more CPBugs with up to 88.88x testing efficiency speedup over the state-of-the-art tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hakaze Cho, Naoya Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: Classification tasks are widely investigated in the In-Context Learning (ICL) paradigm. However, current efforts are evaluated on disjoint benchmarks and settings, while their performances are significantly influenced by some trivial variables, such as prompt templates, data sampling, instructions, etc., which leads to significant inconsistencies in the results reported across various literature, preventing fair comparison or meta-analysis across different papers. Therefore, this paper proposes a standardized and easy-to-use evaluation toolkit (StaICC) for in-context classification. Including, for the normal classification task, we provide StaICC-Normal, selecting 10 widely used datasets, and generating prompts with a fixed form, to mitigate the variance among the experiment implementations. To enrich the usage of our benchmark, we also provide a sub-benchmark StaICC-Diag for diagnosing ICL from several aspects, aiming for a more robust inference processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pneumonia is a leading cause of illness and death in children, underscoring the need for early and accurate detection. In this study, we propose a novel lightweight ensemble model for detecting pneumonia in children using chest X-ray images. This ensemble model integrates two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), MobileNetV2 and NASNetMobile, selected for their balance of computational efficiency and accuracy. These models were fine-tuned on a pediatric chest X-ray dataset and combined to enhance classification performance. Our proposed ensemble model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.63%, significantly outperforming individual models such as MobileNetV2 (97.10%) and NASNetMobile(96.25%) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, the ensemble model outperformed state-of-the-art architectures, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201, while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed lightweight ensemble model presents a highly effective and resource-efficient solution for pneumonia detection, making it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zunhai Su, Zhe Chen, Wang Shen, Hanyu Wei, Linge Li, Huangqi Yu, Kehong Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache facilitates efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by avoiding recomputation of past KVs. As the batch size and context length increase, the oversized KV caches become a significant memory bottleneck, highlighting the need for efficient compression. Existing KV quantization rely on fine-grained quantization or the retention of a significant portion of high bit-widths caches, both of which compromise compression ratio and often fail to maintain robustness at extremely low average bit-widths. In this work, we explore the potential of rotation technique for 2-bit KV quantization and propose RotateKV, which achieves accurate and robust performance through the following innovations: (i) Outlier-Aware Rotation, which utilizes channel-reordering to adapt the rotations to varying channel-wise outlier distributions without sacrificing the computational efficiency of the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT); (ii) Pre-RoPE Grouped-Head Rotation, which mitigates the impact of rotary position embedding (RoPE) on proposed outlier-aware rotation and further smooths outliers across heads; (iii) Attention-Sink-Aware Quantization, which leverages the massive activations to precisely identify and protect attention sinks. RotateKV achieves less than 0.3 perplexity (PPL) degradation with 2-bit quantization on WikiText-2 using LLaMA-2-13B, maintains strong CoT reasoning and long-context capabilities, with less than 1.7\% degradation on GSM8K, outperforming existing methods even at lower average bit-widths. RotateKV also showcases a 3.97x reduction in peak memory usage, supports 5.75x larger batch sizes, and achieves a 2.32x speedup in decoding stage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ranking and recommendation systems are the foundation for numerous online experiences, ranging from search results to personalized content delivery. These systems have evolved into complex, multilayered architectures that leverage vast datasets and often incorporate thousands of predictive models. The maintenance and enhancement of these models is a labor intensive process that requires extensive feature engineering. This approach not only exacerbates technical debt but also hampers innovation in extending these systems to emerging problem domains. In this report, we present our research to address these challenges by utilizing a large foundation model with a textual interface for ranking and recommendation tasks. We illustrate several key advantages of our approach: (1) a single model can manage multiple predictive tasks involved in ranking and recommendation, (2) decoder models with textual interface due to their comprehension of reasoning capabilities, can generalize to new recommendation surfaces and out-of-domain problems, and (3) by employing natural language interfaces for task definitions and verbalizing member behaviors and their social connections, we eliminate the need for feature engineering and the maintenance of complex directed acyclic graphs of model dependencies. We introduce our research pre-production model, 360Brew V1.0, a 150B parameter, decoder-only model that has been trained and fine-tuned on LinkedIn's data and tasks. This model is capable of solving over 30 predictive tasks across various segments of the LinkedIn platform, achieving performance levels comparable to or exceeding those of current production systems based on offline metrics, without task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, each of these tasks is conventionally addressed by dedicated models that have been developed and maintained over multiple years by teams of a similar or larger size than our own.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lishuang Wang, Zhihong Wu, Kebin Sun, Zhuozhao Li, Ran Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a key evolutionary algorithm widely used in symbolic regression, feature engineering, and scientific modeling. Its high computational demands make GPU acceleration essential for scalable and high-performance evolutionary computation. However, GPU acceleration of TGP faces three key challenges: inefficient tree encoding, highly heterogeneous genetic operations, and limited parallelism in fitness evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce EvoGP, a comprehensive GPU-accelerated TGP framework. First, we design a tensorized encoding scheme to represent tree with different structures as tensors with the same shape, optimizing memory access and enabling efficient parallel execution. Second, we propose a unified parallel framework for genetic operations by leveraging shared computational primitives and implementing dedicated CUDA kernels for scalable performance. Third, we present a fully parallel fitness evaluation strategy for symbolic regression, exploiting both population-level and data-level parallelism to maximize GPU utilization. Moreover, we implement a comprehensive library to provide rich algorithm operators and benchmark problems. EvoGP is extensively tested on various tasks, including symbolic regression, classification, and robotics control, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse application scenarios. Experimental results show that EvoGP achieves up to a 140.89x speedup over the state-of-the-art GPU-based TGP implementation, while maintaining or exceeding the accuracy of baseline methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beiming Liu, Zhizhuo Cui, Siteng Hu, Xiaohua Li, Haifeng Lin, Zhengxin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerospace manufacturing demands exceptionally high precision in technical parameters. The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and QWen, in Natural Language Processing has sparked industry interest in their application to tasks including process design, material selection, and tool information retrieval. However, LLMs are prone to generating "hallucinations" in specialized domains, producing inaccurate or false information that poses significant risks to the quality of aerospace products and flight safety. This paper introduces a set of evaluation metrics tailored for LLMs in aerospace manufacturing, aiming to assess their accuracy by analyzing their performance in answering questions grounded in professional knowledge. Firstly, key information is extracted through in-depth textual analysis of classic aerospace manufacturing textbooks and guidelines. Subsequently, utilizing LLM generation techniques, we meticulously construct multiple-choice questions with multiple correct answers of varying difficulty. Following this, different LLM models are employed to answer these questions, and their accuracy is recorded. Experimental results demonstrate that the capabilities of LLMs in aerospace professional knowledge are in urgent need of improvement. This study provides a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for the application of LLMs in aerospace manufacturing, addressing a critical gap in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eshta Bhardwaj, Rohan Alexander, Christoph Becker</p>
<p>Abstract: The accelerating development and deployment of AI technologies depend on the continued ability to scale their infrastructure. This has implied increasing amounts of monetary investment and natural resources. Frontier AI applications have thus resulted in rising financial, environmental, and social costs. While the factors that AI scaling depends on reach its limits, the push for its accelerated advancement and entrenchment continues. In this paper, we provide a holistic review of AI scaling using four lenses (technical, economic, ecological, and social) and review the relationships between these lenses to explore the dynamics of AI growth. We do so by drawing on system dynamics concepts including archetypes such as "limits to growth" to model the dynamic complexity of AI scaling and synthesize several perspectives. Our work maps out the entangled relationships between the technical, economic, ecological and social perspectives and the apparent limits to growth. The analysis explains how industry's responses to external limits enables continued (but temporary) scaling and how this benefits Big Tech while externalizing social and environmental damages. To avoid an "overshoot and collapse" trajectory, we advocate for realigning priorities and norms around scaling to prioritize sustainable and mindful advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edwin D. de Jong, Eric Marcus, Jonas Teuwen</p>
<p>Abstract: Pathology Foundation Models (FMs) hold great promise for healthcare. Before they can be used in clinical practice, it is essential to ensure they are robust to variations between medical centers. We measure whether pathology FMs focus on biological features like tissue and cancer type, or on the well known confounding medical center signatures introduced by staining procedure and other differences. We introduce the Robustness Index. This novel robustness metric reflects to what degree biological features dominate confounding features. Ten current publicly available pathology FMs are evaluated. We find that all current pathology foundation models evaluated represent the medical center to a strong degree. Significant differences in the robustness index are observed. Only one model so far has a robustness index greater than one, meaning biological features dominate confounding features, but only slightly. A quantitative approach to measure the influence of medical center differences on FM-based prediction performance is described. We analyze the impact of unrobustness on classification performance of downstream models, and find that cancer-type classification errors are not random, but specifically attributable to same-center confounders: images of other classes from the same medical center. We visualize FM embedding spaces, and find these are more strongly organized by medical centers than by biological factors. As a consequence, the medical center of origin is predicted more accurately than the tissue source and cancer type. The robustness index introduced here is provided with the aim of advancing progress towards clinical adoption of robust and reliable pathology FMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangjing Shao, Benshuang Chen, Shuting Zhao, Xinrong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope is a significant task for efficient navigation and robotic automation of endoscopy. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to perform real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope. Firstly, a multi-modal visual feature learning network is proposed to perform relative pose prediction, in which the motion feature from the optical flow, the scene features and the joint feature from two adjacent observations are all extracted for prediction. Due to more correlation information in the channel dimension of the concatenated image, a novel feature extractor is designed based on an attention mechanism to integrate multi-dimensional information from the concatenation of two continuous frames. To extract more complete feature representation from the fused features, a novel pose decoder is proposed to predict the pose transformation from the concatenated feature map at the end of the framework. At last, the absolute pose of endoscope is calculated based on relative poses. The experiment is conducted on three datasets of various endoscopic scenes and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the inference speed of the proposed method is over 30 frames per second, which meets the real-time requirement. The project page is here: remote-bmxs.netlify.app</p>

<p>Abstract: In real-world scenarios, achieving domain adaptation and generalization poses significant challenges, as models must adapt to or generalize across unknown target distributions. Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models. For each topic, we formally define the problem and thoroughly review existing methods. Additionally, we analyze relevant datasets and applications, highlighting open challenges and potential future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Su, Qiusong Yang, Yiwei Ci, Yingcheng Li, Tianjun Bu, Ziyu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The IC3 algorithm, also known as PDR, is a SAT-based model checking algorithm that has significantly influenced the field in recent years due to its efficiency, scalability, and completeness. It utilizes SAT solvers to solve a series of SAT queries associated with relative induction. In this paper, we introduce several optimizations for the SAT solver in IC3 based on our observations of the unique characteristics of these SAT queries. By observing that SAT queries do not necessarily require decisions on all variables, we compute a subset of variables that need to be decided before each solving process while ensuring that the result remains unaffected. Additionally, noting that the overhead of binary heap operations in VSIDS is non-negligible, we replace the binary heap with buckets to achieve constant-time operations. Furthermore, we support temporary clauses without the need to allocate a new activation variable for each solving process, thereby eliminating the need to reset solvers. We developed a novel lightweight CDCL SAT solver, GipSAT, which integrates these optimizations. A comprehensive evaluation highlights the performance improvements achieved by GipSAT. Specifically, the GipSAT-based IC3 demonstrates an average speedup of 3.61 times in solving time compared to the IC3 implementation based on MiniSat.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergey Berezin, Reza Farahbakhsh, Noel Crespi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel class of jailbreak adversarial attacks on LLMs, termed Task-in-Prompt (TIP) attacks. Our approach embeds sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., cipher decoding, riddles, code execution) into the model's prompt to indirectly generate prohibited inputs. To systematically assess the effectiveness of these attacks, we introduce the PHRYGE benchmark. We demonstrate that our techniques successfully circumvent safeguards in six state-of-the-art language models, including GPT-4o and LLaMA 3.2. Our findings highlight critical weaknesses in current LLM safety alignments and underscore the urgent need for more sophisticated defence strategies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianke Zhang, Yanjiang Guo, Yucheng Hu, Xiaoyu Chen, Xiang Zhu, Jianyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the generalization capabilities. VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maja Pavlovic</p>
<p>Abstract: To be considered reliable, a model must be calibrated so that its confidence in each decision closely reflects its true outcome. In this blogpost we'll take a look at the most commonly used definition for calibration and then dive into a frequently used evaluation measure for model calibration. We'll then cover some of the drawbacks of this measure and how these surfaced the need for additional notions of calibration, which require their own new evaluation measures. This post is not intended to be an in-depth dissection of all works on calibration, nor does it focus on how to calibrate models. Instead, it is meant to provide a gentle introduction to the different notions and their evaluation measures as well as to re-highlight some issues with a measure that is still widely used to evaluate calibration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengqin Lai, Xiaopeng Hong, Yabin Wang, Xiaobai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Micro-expression recognition plays a pivotal role in understanding hidden emotions and has applications across various fields. Traditional recognition methods assume access to all training data at once, but real-world scenarios involve continuously evolving data streams. To respond to the requirement of adapting to new data while retaining previously learned knowledge, we introduce the first benchmark specifically designed for incremental micro-expression recognition. Our contributions include: Firstly, we formulate the incremental learning setting tailored for micro-expression recognition. Secondly, we organize sequential datasets with carefully curated learning orders to reflect real-world scenarios. Thirdly, we define two cross-evaluation-based testing protocols, each targeting distinct evaluation objectives. Finally, we provide six baseline methods and their corresponding evaluation results. This benchmark lays the groundwork for advancing incremental micro-expression recognition research. All source code used in this study will be publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengQinLai/IMER-benchmark.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19335">What is causal about causal models and representations?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederik Hytting J{\o}rgensen, Luigi Gresele, Sebastian Weichwald</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal Bayesian networks are 'causal' models since they make predictions about interventional distributions. To connect such causal model predictions to real-world outcomes, we must determine which actions in the world correspond to which interventions in the model. For example, to interpret an action as an intervention on a treatment variable, the action will presumably have to a) change the distribution of treatment in a way that corresponds to the intervention, and b) not change other aspects, such as how the outcome depends on the treatment; while the marginal distributions of some variables may change as an effect. We introduce a formal framework to make such requirements for different interpretations of actions as interventions precise. We prove that the seemingly natural interpretation of actions as interventions is circular: Under this interpretation, every causal Bayesian network that correctly models the observational distribution is trivially also interventionally valid, and no action yields empirical data that could possibly falsify such a model. We prove an impossibility result: No interpretation exists that is non-circular and simultaneously satisfies a set of natural desiderata. Instead, we examine non-circular interpretations that may violate some desiderata and show how this may in turn enable the falsification of causal models. By rigorously examining how a causal Bayesian network could be a 'causal' model of the world instead of merely a mathematical object, our formal framework contributes to the conceptual foundations of causal representation learning, causal discovery, and causal abstraction, while also highlighting some limitations of existing approaches.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393">s1: Simple test-time scaling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Niklas Muennighoff, Zitong Yang, Weijia Shi, Xiang Lisa Li, Li Fei-Fei, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Luke Zettlemoyer, Percy Liang, Emmanuel Cand\`es, Tatsunori Hashimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance. Recently, OpenAI's o1 model showed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to many replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance. First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After supervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and equipping it with budget forcing, our model s1-32B exceeds o1-preview on competition math questions by up to 27% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling s1-32B with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time intervention: from 50% to 57% on AIME24.
