<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Xian, Tao Wang, Sai Zhang, Fei Xu, Zhegang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying and classifying shutdown initiating events (SDIEs) is critical for developing low power shutdown probabilistic risk assessment for nuclear power plants. Existing computational approaches cannot achieve satisfactory performance due to the challenges of unavailable large, labeled datasets, imbalanced event types, and label noise. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid pipeline that integrates a knowledge-informed machine learning mode to prescreen non-SDIEs and a large language model (LLM) to classify SDIEs into four types. In the prescreening stage, we proposed a set of 44 SDIE text patterns that consist of the most salient keywords and phrases from six SDIE types. Text vectorization based on the SDIE patterns generates feature vectors that are highly separable by using a simple binary classifier. The second stage builds Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based LLM, which learns generic English language representations from self-supervised pretraining on a large dataset and adapts to SDIE classification by fine-tuning it on an SDIE dataset. The proposed approaches are evaluated on a dataset with 10,928 events using precision, recall ratio, F1 score, and average accuracy. The results demonstrate that the prescreening stage can exclude more than 97% non-SDIEs, and the LLM achieves an average accuracy of 93.4% for SDIE classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwei Jiang, Guoxuan Wang, Yining Lu, Andrew Wang, Jingyu Zhang, Chuyu Liu, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi</p>
<p>Abstract: The reasoning steps generated by LLMs might be incomplete, as they mimic logical leaps common in everyday communication found in their pre-training data: underlying rationales are frequently left implicit (unstated). To address this challenge, we introduce RATIONALYST, a model for process-supervision of reasoning based on pre-training on a vast collection of rationale annotations extracted from unlabeled data. We extract 79k rationales from web-scale unlabelled dataset (the Pile) and a combination of reasoning datasets with minimal human intervention. This web-scale pre-training for reasoning allows RATIONALYST to consistently generalize across diverse reasoning tasks, including mathematical, commonsense, scientific, and logical reasoning. Fine-tuned from LLaMa-3-8B, RATIONALYST improves the accuracy of reasoning by an average of 3.9% on 7 representative reasoning benchmarks. It also demonstrates superior performance compared to significantly larger verifiers like GPT-4 and similarly sized models fine-tuned on matching training sets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01064">Truth or Deceit? A Bayesian Decoding Game Enhances Consistency and Reliability</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weitong Zhang, Chengqi Zang, Bernhard Kainz</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce outputs that -- though plausible -- can lack consistency and reliability, particularly in ambiguous or complex scenarios. Challenges arise from ensuring that outputs align with both factual correctness and human intent. This is problematic in existing approaches that trade improved consistency for lower accuracy. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel game-theoretic approach to enhance consistency and reliability during the decoding stage of LLM output generation. Our method models the decoding process as a multistage Bayesian decoding game. This ensures consistency through Correctness Alignment and enhances reliability via Ambiguity Calibration. The model dynamically converges to a consensus on the most reliable outputs and distinguishes {Valid, Specious} outputs without human feedback or additional training. Our game design allows smaller models to outperform much larger models through game mechanisms (e.g., 78.1 LLaMA13B vs 76.6 PaLM540B), as well as integrating various LL strategies and models, demonstrating the potential of game-theoretic tools to improve the truthfulness and reliability of LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01109">Mixing It Up: The Cocktail Effect of Multi-Task Fine-Tuning on LLM Performance -- A Case Study in Finance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Meni Brief, Oded Ovadia, Gil Shenderovitz, Noga Ben Yoash, Rachel Lemberg, Eitam Sheetrit</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific contexts, including finance, has expanded rapidly. Domain-specific LLMs are typically evaluated based on their performance in various downstream tasks relevant to the domain. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of fine-tuning LLMs for such tasks. Somewhat counterintuitively, we find that in domain-specific cases, fine-tuning exclusively on the target task is not always the most effective strategy. Instead, multi-task fine-tuning - where models are trained on a cocktail of related tasks - can significantly enhance performance. We demonstrate how this approach enables a small model, such as Phi-3-Mini, to achieve state-of-the-art results, even surpassing the much larger GPT-4-o model on financial benchmarks. Our study involves a large-scale experiment, training over 200 models using several widely adopted LLMs as baselines, and empirically confirms the benefits of multi-task fine-tuning. Additionally, we explore the use of general instruction data as a form of regularization, suggesting that it helps minimize performance degradation. We also investigate the inclusion of mathematical data, finding improvements in numerical reasoning that transfer effectively to financial tasks. Finally, we note that while fine-tuning for downstream tasks leads to targeted improvements in task performance, it does not necessarily result in broader gains in domain knowledge or complex domain reasoning abilities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01111">Learning to Build by Building Your Own Instructions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Walsman, Muru Zhang, Adam Fishman, Ali Farhadi, Dieter Fox</p>
<p>Abstract: Structural understanding of complex visual objects is an important unsolved component of artificial intelligence. To study this, we develop a new technique for the recently proposed Break-and-Make problem in LTRON where an agent must learn to build a previously unseen LEGO assembly using a single interactive session to gather information about its components and their structure. We attack this problem by building an agent that we call \textbf{\ours} that is able to make its own visual instruction book. By disassembling an unseen assembly and periodically saving images of it, the agent is able to create a set of instructions so that it has the information necessary to rebuild it. These instructions form an explicit memory that allows the model to reason about the assembly process one step at a time, avoiding the need for long-term implicit memory. This in turn allows us to train on much larger LEGO assemblies than has been possible in the past. To demonstrate the power of this model, we release a new dataset of procedurally built LEGO vehicles that contain an average of 31 bricks each and require over one hundred steps to disassemble and reassemble. We train these models using online imitation learning which allows the model to learn from its own mistakes. Finally, we also provide some small improvements to LTRON and the Break-and-Make problem that simplify the learning environment and improve usability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01176">Generative Diffusion-based Contract Design for Efficient AI Twins Migration in Vehicular Embodied AI Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Zhong, Jiawen Kang, Jinbo Wen, Dongdong Ye, Jiangtian Nie, Dusit Niyato, Xiaozheng Gao, Shengli Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied AI is a rapidly advancing field that bridges the gap between cyberspace and physical space, enabling a wide range of applications. This evolution has led to the development of the Vehicular Embodied AI NETwork (VEANET), where advanced AI capabilities are integrated into vehicular systems to enhance autonomous operations and decision-making. Embodied agents, such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals, actively interacting with the physical world. Embodied twins are digital models of these embodied agents, with various embodied AI twins for intelligent applications in cyberspace. In VEANET, embodied AI twins act as in-vehicle AI assistants to perform diverse tasks supporting autonomous driving using generative AI models. Due to limited computational resources of AVs, these AVs often offload computationally intensive tasks, such as constructing and updating embodied AI twins, to nearby RSUs. However, since the rapid mobility of AVs and the limited provision coverage of a single RSU, embodied AI twins require dynamic migrations from current RSU to other RSUs in real-time, resulting in the challenge of selecting suitable RSUs for efficient embodied AI twins migrations. Given information asymmetry, AVs cannot know the detailed information of RSUs. To this end, in this paper, we construct a multi-dimensional contract theoretical model between AVs and alternative RSUs. Considering that AVs may exhibit irrational behavior, we utilize prospect theory instead of expected utility theory to model the actual utilities of AVs. Finally, we employ a generative diffusion model-based algorithm to identify the optimal contract designs. Compared with traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01281">Uncertainty-aware Human Mobility Modeling and Anomaly Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haomin Wen, Shurui Cao, Leman Akoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the GPS coordinates of a large collection of human agents over time, how can we model their mobility behavior toward effective anomaly detection (e.g. for bad-actor or malicious behavior detection) without any labeled data? Human mobility and trajectory modeling have been studied extensively with varying capacity to handle complex input, and performance-efficiency trade-offs. With the arrival of more expressive models in machine learning, we attempt to model GPS data as a sequence of stay-point events, each with a set of characterizing spatiotemporal features, and leverage modern sequence models such as Transformers for un/self-supervised training and inference. Notably, driven by the inherent stochasticity of certain individuals' behavior, we equip our model with aleatoric/data uncertainty estimation. In addition, to handle data sparsity of a large variety of behaviors, we incorporate epistemic/model uncertainty into our model. Together, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty enable a robust loss and training dynamics, as well as uncertainty-aware decision making in anomaly scoring. Experiments on large expert-simulated datasets with tens of thousands of agents demonstrate the effectiveness of our model against both forecasting and anomaly detection baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01290">Towards a Law of Iterated Expectations for Heuristic Estimators</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Christiano, Jacob Hilton, Andrea Lincoln, Eric Neyman, Mark Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Christiano et al. (2022) define a *heuristic estimator* to be a hypothetical algorithm that estimates the values of mathematical expressions from arguments. In brief, a heuristic estimator $\mathbb{G}$ takes as input a mathematical expression $Y$ and a formal "heuristic argument" $\pi$, and outputs an estimate $\mathbb{G}(Y \mid \pi)$ of $Y$. In this work, we argue for the informal principle that a heuristic estimator ought not to be able to predict its own errors, and we explore approaches to formalizing this principle. Most simply, the principle suggests that $\mathbb{G}(Y - \mathbb{G}(Y \mid \pi) \mid \pi)$ ought to equal zero for all $Y$ and $\pi$. We argue that an ideal heuristic estimator ought to satisfy two stronger properties in this vein, which we term *iterated estimation* (by analogy to the law of iterated expectations) and *error orthogonality*.
  Although iterated estimation and error orthogonality are intuitively appealing, it can be difficult to determine whether a given heuristic estimator satisfies the properties. As an alternative approach, we explore *accuracy*: a property that (roughly) states that $\mathbb{G}$ has zero average error over a distribution of mathematical expressions. However, in the context of two estimation problems, we demonstrate barriers to creating an accurate heuristic estimator. We finish by discussing challenges and potential paths forward for finding a heuristic estimator that accords with our intuitive understanding of how such an estimator ought to behave, as well as the potential applications of heuristic estimators to understanding the behavior of neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Bhatnagar</p>
<p>Abstract: Cricket, with its intricate strategies and deep history, increasingly captivates a global audience. The Indian Premier League (IPL), epitomizing Twenty20 cricket, showcases talent in a format that lasts just a few hours as opposed to the longer forms of the game. Renowned for its fusion of technology and fan engagement, the IPL stands as the world's most popular cricket league. This study concentrates on Dream11, India's leading fantasy cricket league for IPL, where participants craft virtual teams based on real player performances to compete internationally. Building a winning fantasy team requires navigating various complex factors including player form and match conditions. Traditionally, this has been approached through operations research and machine learning. This research introduces the FanCric framework, an advanced multi-agent system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a robust orchestration framework to enhance fantasy team selection in cricket. FanCric employs both structured and unstructured data to surpass traditional methods by incorporating sophisticated AI technologies. The analysis involved scrutinizing approximately 12.7 million unique entries from a Dream11 contest, evaluating FanCric's efficacy against the collective wisdom of crowds and a simpler Prompt Engineering approach. Ablation studies further assessed the impact of generating varying numbers of teams. The exploratory findings are promising, indicating that further investigation into FanCric's capabilities is warranted to fully realize its potential in enhancing strategic decision-making using LLMs in fantasy sports and business in general.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01349">Life, uh, Finds a Way: Systematic Neural Search</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Baranski, Jun Tani</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the challenge of rapidly adapting an agent's behavior to solve spatiotemporally continuous problems in novel settings. Animals exhibit extraordinary abilities to adapt to new contexts, a capacity unmatched by artificial systems. Instead of focusing on generalization through deep reinforcement learning, we propose viewing behavior as the physical manifestation of a search procedure, where robust problem-solving emerges from an exhaustive search across all possible behaviors. Surprisingly, this can be done efficiently using online modification of a cognitive graph that guides action, challenging the predominant view that exhaustive search in continuous spaces is impractical. We describe an algorithm that implicitly enumerates behaviors by regulating the tight feedback loop between execution of behaviors and mutation of the graph, and provide a neural implementation based on Hebbian learning and a novel high-dimensional harmonic representation inspired by entorhinal cortex. By framing behavior as search, we provide a mathematically simple and biologically plausible model for real-time behavioral adaptation, successfully solving a variety of continuous state-space navigation problems. This framework not only offers a flexible neural substrate for other applications but also presents a powerful paradigm for understanding adaptive behavior. Our results suggest potential advancements in developmental learning and unsupervised skill acquisition, paving the way for autonomous robots to master complex skills in data-sparse environments demanding flexibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesca Da Ros, Marie-Louise Lackner, Nysret Musliu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Oven Scheduling Problem (OSP) is an NP-hard real-world parallel batch scheduling problem arising in the semiconductor industry. The objective of the problem is to schedule a set of jobs on ovens while minimizing several factors, namely total oven runtime, job tardiness, and setup costs. At the same time, it must adhere to various constraints such as oven eligibility and availability, job release dates, setup times between batches, and oven capacity limitations. The key to obtaining efficient schedules is to process compatible jobs simultaneously in batches. In this paper, we develop theoretical, problem-specific lower bounds for the OSP that can be computed very quickly. We thoroughly examine these lower bounds, evaluating their quality and exploring their integration into existing solution methods. Specifically, we investigate their contribution to exact methods and a metaheuristic local search approach using simulated annealing. Moreover, these problem-specific lower bounds enable us to assess the solution quality for large instances for which exact methods often fail to provide tight lower bounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Q-shaping is an extension of Q-value initialization and serves as an alternative to reward shaping for incorporating domain knowledge to accelerate agent training, thereby improving sample efficiency by directly shaping Q-values. This approach is both general and robust across diverse tasks, allowing for immediate impact assessment while guaranteeing optimality. We evaluated Q-shaping across 20 different environments using a large language model (LLM) as the heuristic provider. The results demonstrate that Q-shaping significantly enhances sample efficiency, achieving a \textbf{16.87\%} improvement over the best baseline in each environment and a \textbf{253.80\%} improvement compared to LLM-based reward shaping methods. These findings establish Q-shaping as a superior and unbiased alternative to conventional reward shaping in reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) in healthcare require advanced clinical skills (CS), yet current benchmarks fail to evaluate these comprehensively. We introduce MedQA-CS, an AI-SCE framework inspired by medical education's Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), to address this gap. MedQA-CS evaluates LLMs through two instruction-following tasks, LLM-as-medical-student and LLM-as-CS-examiner, designed to reflect real clinical scenarios. Our contributions include developing MedQA-CS, a comprehensive evaluation framework with publicly available data and expert annotations, and providing the quantitative and qualitative assessment of LLMs as reliable judges in CS evaluation. Our experiments show that MedQA-CS is a more challenging benchmark for evaluating clinical skills than traditional multiple-choice QA benchmarks (e.g., MedQA). Combined with existing benchmarks, MedQA-CS enables a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' clinical capabilities for both open- and closed-source LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renato Tin\'os, Michal W. Przewozniczek, Darrell Whitley, Francisco Chicano</p>
<p>Abstract: In pseudo-Boolean optimization, a variable interaction graph represents variables as vertices, and interactions between pairs of variables as edges. In black-box optimization, the variable interaction graph may be at least partially discovered by using empirical linkage learning techniques. These methods never report false variable interactions, but they are computationally expensive. The recently proposed local search with linkage learning discovers the partial variable interaction graph as a side-effect of iterated local search. However, information about the strength of the interactions is not learned by the algorithm. We propose local search with linkage learning 2, which builds a weighted variable interaction graph that stores information about the strength of the interaction between variables. The weighted variable interaction graph can provide new insights about the optimization problem and behavior of optimizers. Experiments with NK landscapes, knapsack problem, and feature selection show that local search with linkage learning 2 is able to efficiently build weighted variable interaction graphs. In particular, experiments with feature selection show that the weighted variable interaction graphs can be used for visualizing the feature interactions in machine learning. Additionally, new transformation operators that exploit the interactions between variables can be designed. We illustrate this ability by proposing a new perturbation operator for iterated local search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Yu, Junyuan Mao, Guibin Zhang, Jingheng Ye, Junfeng Fang, Aoxiao Zhong, Yang Liu, Yuxuan Liang, Kun Wang, Qingsong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Research into the external behaviors and internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in addressing complex tasks in the physical world. Studies suggest that powerful LLMs, like GPT-4, are beginning to exhibit human-like cognitive abilities, including planning, reasoning, and reflection. In this paper, we introduce a research line and methodology called LLM Psychology, leveraging human psychology experiments to investigate the cognitive behaviors and mechanisms of LLMs. We migrate the Typoglycemia phenomenon from psychology to explore the "mind" of LLMs. Unlike human brains, which rely on context and word patterns to comprehend scrambled text, LLMs use distinct encoding and decoding processes. Through Typoglycemia experiments at the character, word, and sentence levels, we observe: (I) LLMs demonstrate human-like behaviors on a macro scale, such as lower task accuracy and higher token/time consumption; (II) LLMs exhibit varying robustness to scrambled input, making Typoglycemia a benchmark for model evaluation without new datasets; (III) Different task types have varying impacts, with complex logical tasks (e.g., math) being more challenging in scrambled form; (IV) Each LLM has a unique and consistent "cognitive pattern" across tasks, revealing general mechanisms in its psychology process. We provide an in-depth analysis of hidden layers to explain these phenomena, paving the way for future research in LLM Psychology and deeper interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenza Amara, Lukas Klein, Carsten L\"uth, Paul J\"ager, Hendrik Strobelt, Mennatallah El-Assady</p>
<p>Abstract: The various limitations of Generative AI, such as hallucinations and model failures, have made it crucial to understand the role of different modalities in Visual Language Model (VLM) predictions. Our work investigates how the integration of information from image and text modalities influences the performance and behavior of VLMs in visual question answering (VQA) and reasoning tasks. We measure this effect through answer accuracy, reasoning quality, model uncertainty, and modality relevance. We study the interplay between text and image modalities in different configurations where visual content is essential for solving the VQA task. Our contributions include (1) the Semantic Interventions (SI)-VQA dataset, (2) a benchmark study of various VLM architectures under different modality configurations, and (3) the Interactive Semantic Interventions (ISI) tool. The SI-VQA dataset serves as the foundation for the benchmark, while the ISI tool provides an interface to test and apply semantic interventions in image and text inputs, enabling more fine-grained analysis. Our results show that complementary information between modalities improves answer and reasoning quality, while contradictory information harms model performance and confidence. Image text annotations have minimal impact on accuracy and uncertainty, slightly increasing image relevance. Attention analysis confirms the dominant role of image inputs over text in VQA tasks. In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs that allow us to extract attention coefficients for each modality. A key finding is PaliGemma's harmful overconfidence, which poses a higher risk of silent failures compared to the LLaVA models. This work sets the foundation for rigorous analysis of modality integration, supported by datasets specifically designed for this purpose.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tung-Yu Wu, Pei-Yu Lo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit emergent abilities in some downstream tasks, where performance seems to stagnate at first and then improve sharply and unpredictably with scale beyond a threshold. By dividing questions in the datasets according to difficulty level by average performance, we observe U-shaped scaling for hard questions, and inverted-U scaling followed by steady improvement for easy questions. Moreover, the emergence threshold roughly coincides with the point at which performance on easy questions reverts from inverse scaling to standard scaling. Capitalizing on the observable though opposing scaling trend on easy and hard questions, we propose a simple yet effective pipeline, called Slice-and-Sandwich, to predict both the emergence threshold and model performance beyond the threshold.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangsheng Wang, Xiao Zhang, Hao Liu, Songde Han, Huimin Ma, Tianyu Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated limitations in handling combinatorial optimization problems involving long-range reasoning, partially due to causal hallucinations and huge search space. As for causal hallucinations, i.e., the inconsistency between reasoning and corresponding state transition, this paper introduces the Causal Relationship Enhancement (CRE) mechanism combining cause-effect interventions and the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) to guarantee the solid causal rightness between each step of reasoning and state transition. As for the long causal range and huge search space limiting the performances of existing models featuring single-direction search, a Dual-End Searching (DES) approach is proposed to seek solutions by simultaneously starting from both the initial and goal states on the causal probability tree. By integrating CRE and DES (CreDes), our model has realized simultaneous multi-step reasoning, circumventing the inefficiencies from cascading multiple one-step reasoning like the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Experiments demonstrate that CreDes significantly outperforms existing State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) solutions in long-range reasoning tasks in terms of both accuracy and time efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Gan, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data has become a pivotal resource in post-training tasks for large language models (LLMs) due to the scarcity of high-quality, specific data. While various methods have been developed to generate synthetic data, there remains a discernible gap between the practical effects of synthetic data and our theoretical comprehension. To address this challenge, we commence by presenting a detailed modeling of the prevalent synthetic data generation process. Building upon this modeling, we demonstrate that the generalization capability of the post-trained model is critically determined by the information gain derived from the generative model, as analyzed from a novel reverse-bottleneck perspective. Moreover, we introduce the concept of Generalization Gain via Mutual Information (GGMI) and elucidate the relationship between generalization gain and information gain. This analysis serves as a theoretical foundation for synthetic data generation and further highlights its connection with the generalization capability of post-trained models, offering an understanding about the design of synthetic data generation techniques and the optimization of the post-training process. We open source our code through an anonymous GitHub repository at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Understanding-Synthetic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingrui Gu, Guanren Qiao, Chuyi Jiang, Tianqing Xia, Hangyu Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning encounters challenges in various environments related to robustness and explainability. Traditional Q-learning algorithms cannot effectively make decisions and utilize the historical learning experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cognitive Belief-Driven Q-Learning (CBDQ), which integrates subjective belief modeling into the Q-learning framework, enhancing decision-making accuracy by endowing agents with human-like learning and reasoning capabilities. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, our method maintains a subjective belief distribution over the expectation of actions, leveraging a cluster-based subjective belief model that enables agents to reason about the potential probability associated with each decision. CBDQ effectively mitigates overestimated phenomena and optimizes decision-making policies by integrating historical experiences with current contextual information, mimicking the dynamics of human decision-making. We evaluate the proposed method on discrete control benchmark tasks in various complicate environments. The results demonstrate that CBDQ exhibits stronger adaptability, robustness, and human-like characteristics in handling these environments, outperforming other baselines. We hope this work will give researchers a fresh perspective on understanding and explaining Q-learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melis Ilayda Bal, Pier Giuseppe Sessa, Mojmir Mutny, Andreas Krause</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework to optimize black-box expensive-to-evaluate functions via sequential interactions. In several important problems (e.g. drug discovery, circuit design, neural architecture search, etc.), though, such functions are defined over large $\textit{combinatorial and unstructured}$ spaces. This makes existing BO algorithms not feasible due to the intractable maximization of the acquisition function over these domains. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{GameOpt}$, a novel game-theoretical approach to combinatorial BO. $\textbf{GameOpt}$ establishes a cooperative game between the different optimization variables, and selects points that are game $\textit{equilibria}$ of an upper confidence bound acquisition function. These are stable configurations from which no variable has an incentive to deviate$-$ analog to local optima in continuous domains. Crucially, this allows us to efficiently break down the complexity of the combinatorial domain into individual decision sets, making $\textbf{GameOpt}$ scalable to large combinatorial spaces. We demonstrate the application of $\textbf{GameOpt}$ to the challenging $\textit{protein design}$ problem and validate its performance on four real-world protein datasets. Each protein can take up to $20^{X}$ possible configurations, where $X$ is the length of a protein, making standard BO methods infeasible. Instead, our approach iteratively selects informative protein configurations and very quickly discovers highly active protein variants compared to other baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhadip Boral, Rikathi Pal, Ashish Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Intersecting manifold segmentation has been a focus of research, where individual manifolds, that intersect with other manifolds, are separated to discover their distinct properties. The proposed method is based on the intuition that when a manifold in $D$ dimensional space with an intrinsic dimension of $d$ intersects with another manifold, the data variance grows in more than $d$ directions. The proposed method measures local data variances and determines their vector directions. It counts the number of vectors with non-zero variance, which determines the manifold's intrinsic dimension. For detection of the intersection region, the method adapts to the changes in the angular gaps between the corresponding direction vectors of the child and parent using exponential moving averages using a tree structure construction. Accordingly, it includes those data points in the same manifold whose neighborhood is within the adaptive angular difference and eventually identifies the data points in the intersection area of manifolds. Data points whose inclusion in the neighborhood-identified data points increases their intrinsic dimensionality are removed based on data variance and distance. The proposed method performs better than 18 SOTA manifold segmentation methods in ARI and NMI scores over 14 real-world datasets with lesser time complexity and better stability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anderson Chaves, Eduardo Ogasawara, Patrick Valduriez, Fabio Porto</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive queries over spatiotemporal (ST) stream data pose significant data processing and analysis challenges. ST data streams involve a set of time series whose data distributions may vary in space and time, exhibiting multiple distinct patterns. In this context, assuming a single machine learning model would adequately handle such variations is likely to lead to failure. To address this challenge, we propose StreamEnsemble, a novel approach to predictive queries over ST data that dynamically selects and allocates Machine Learning models according to the underlying time series distributions and model characteristics. Our experimental evaluation reveals that this method markedly outperforms traditional ensemble methods and single model approaches in terms of accuracy and time, demonstrating a significant reduction in prediction error of more than 10 times compared to traditional approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of medical technology has led to an exponential increase in multi-modal medical data, including imaging, genomics, and electronic health records (EHRs). Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to represent this data due to their prominent performance in capturing pairwise relationships. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of multi-modal medical data still pose significant challenges for standard GNNs, which struggle with learning higher-order, non-pairwise relationships. This paper proposes GAMMA-PD (Graph-based Analysis of Multi-modal Motor Impairment Assessments in Parkinson's Disease), a novel heterogeneous hypergraph fusion framework for multi-modal clinical data analysis. GAMMA-PD integrates imaging and non-imaging data into a "hypernetwork" (patient population graph) by preserving higher-order information and similarity between patient profiles and symptom subtypes. We also design a feature-based attention-weighted mechanism to interpret feature-level contributions towards downstream decision tasks. We evaluate our approach with clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and a private dataset. We demonstrate gains in predicting motor impairment symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Our end-to-end framework also learns associations between subsets of patient characteristics to generate clinically relevant explanations for disease and symptom profiles.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuting Zhao, Chenkang Du, Kristin Qi, Xinrong Chen, Xinhan Di</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptation methods are developed to adapt depth foundation models to endoscopic depth estimation recently. However, such approaches typically under-perform training since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics. Therefore, we propose a full-parameter and parameter-efficient learning framework for endoscopic depth estimation. At the first stage, the subspace of attention, convolution and multi-layer perception are adapted simultaneously within different sub-spaces. At the second stage, a memory-efficient optimization is proposed for subspace composition and the performance is further improved in the united sub-space. Initial experiments on the SCARED dataset demonstrate that results at the first stage improves the performance from 10.2% to 4.1% for Sq Rel, Abs Rel, RMSE and RMSE log in the comparison with the state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic sound classification has a wide range of applications in machine listening, enabling context-aware sound processing and understanding. This paper explores methodologies for automatically classifying heterogeneous sounds characterized by high intra-class variability. Our study evaluates the classification task using the Broad Sound Taxonomy, a two-level taxonomy comprising 28 classes designed to cover a heterogeneous range of sounds with semantic distinctions tailored for practical user applications. We construct a dataset through manual annotation to ensure accuracy, diverse representation within each class and relevance in real-world scenarios. We compare a variety of both traditional and modern machine learning approaches to establish a baseline for the task of heterogeneous sound classification. We investigate the role of input features, specifically examining how acoustically derived sound representations compare to embeddings extracted with pre-trained deep neural networks that capture both acoustic and semantic information about sounds. Experimental results illustrate that audio embeddings encoding acoustic and semantic information achieve higher accuracy in the classification task. After careful analysis of classification errors, we identify some underlying reasons for failure and propose actions to mitigate them. The paper highlights the need for deeper exploration of all stages of classification, understanding the data and adopting methodologies capable of effectively handling data complexity and generalizing in real-world sound environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Can (Sam),  Chen, Christopher Beckham, Zixuan Liu, Xue Liu, Christopher Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline black-box optimization aims to maximize a black-box function using an offline dataset of designs and their measured properties. Two main approaches have emerged: the forward approach, which learns a mapping from input to its value, thereby acting as a proxy to guide optimization, and the inverse approach, which learns a mapping from value to input for conditional generation. (a) Although proxy-free~(classifier-free) diffusion shows promise in robustly modeling the inverse mapping, it lacks explicit guidance from proxies, essential for generating high-performance samples beyond the training distribution. Therefore, we propose \textit{proxy-enhanced sampling} which utilizes the explicit guidance from a trained proxy to bolster proxy-free diffusion with enhanced sampling control. (b) Yet, the trained proxy is susceptible to out-of-distribution issues. To address this, we devise the module \textit{diffusion-based proxy refinement}, which seamlessly integrates insights from proxy-free diffusion back into the proxy for refinement. To sum up, we propose \textit{\textbf{R}obust \textbf{G}uided \textbf{D}iffusion for Offline Black-box Optimization}~(\textbf{RGD}), combining the advantages of proxy~(explicit guidance) and proxy-free diffusion~(robustness) for effective conditional generation. RGD achieves state-of-the-art results on various design-bench tasks, underscoring its efficacy. Our code is at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RGD-27A5/README.md.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humans possess multimodal literacy, allowing them to actively integrate information from various modalities to form reasoning. Faced with challenges like lexical ambiguity in text, we supplement this with other modalities, such as thumbnail images or textbook illustrations. Is it possible for machines to achieve a similar multimodal understanding capability? In response, we present Understanding Pun with Image Explanations (UNPIE), a novel benchmark designed to assess the impact of multimodal inputs in resolving lexical ambiguities. Puns serve as the ideal subject for this evaluation due to their intrinsic ambiguity. Our dataset includes 1,000 puns, each accompanied by an image that explains both meanings. We pose three multimodal challenges with the annotations to assess different aspects of multimodal literacy; Pun Grounding, Disambiguation, and Reconstruction. The results indicate that various Socratic Models and Visual-Language Models improve over the text-only models when given visual context, particularly as the complexity of the tasks increases.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs), coupled with regulatory efforts addressing their risks and impacts, has sparked significant interest in open-source models. However, existing speech FMs (SFMs) fall short of full compliance with the open-source principles, even if claimed otherwise, as no existing SFM has model weights, code, and training data publicly available under open-source terms. In this work, we take the first step toward filling this gap by focusing on the 24 official languages of the European Union (EU). We collect suitable training data by surveying automatic speech recognition datasets and unlabeled speech corpora under open-source compliant licenses, for a total of 950k hours. Additionally, we release automatic transcripts for 441k hours of unlabeled data under the permissive CC-BY license, thereby facilitating the creation of open-source SFMs for the EU languages.</p>

We discuss benchmarks, evaluation methods and evaluation metrics. Also, we uniquely study the role of integration of knowledge graphs for better contextual accuracy and schema linking in these systems. The current techniques fall into two categories: in-context learning of corpus and fine-tuning, which then leads to approaches such as zero-shot, few-shot learning from the end, and data augmentation. Finally, we highlight key challenges such as computational efficiency, model robustness, and data privacy with perspectives toward their development and improvements in potential areas for future of LLM-based text-to-SQL system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brett Mullins, Miguel Fuentes, Yingtai Xiao, Daniel Kifer, Cameron Musco, Daniel Sheldon</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential privacy is the dominant standard for formal and quantifiable privacy and has been used in major deployments that impact millions of people. Many differentially private algorithms for query release and synthetic data contain steps that reconstruct answers to queries from answers to other queries measured by the mechanism. Reconstruction is an important subproblem for such mechanisms to economize the privacy budget, minimize error on reconstructed answers, and allow for scalability to high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we introduce a principled and efficient postprocessing method ReM (Residuals-to-Marginals) for reconstructing answers to marginal queries. Our method builds on recent work on efficient mechanisms for marginal query release, based on making measurements using a residual query basis that admits efficient pseudoinversion, which is an important primitive used in reconstruction. An extension GReM-LNN (Gaussian Residuals-to-Marginals with Local Non-negativity) reconstructs marginals under Gaussian noise satisfying consistency and non-negativity, which often reduces error on reconstructed answers. We demonstrate the utility of ReM and GReM-LNN by applying them to improve existing private query answering mechanisms: ResidualPlanner and MWEM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Megan Sumner, Vardan Saini, Matthew Guzdial</p>
<p>Abstract: Game development is a highly technical practice that traditionally requires programming skills. This serves as a barrier to entry for would-be developers or those hoping to use games as part of their creative expression. While there have been prior game development tools focused on accessibility, they generally still require programming, or have major limitations in terms of the kinds of games they can make. In this paper we introduce Mechanic Maker, a tool for creating a wide-range of game mechanics without programming. It instead relies on a backend symbolic learning system to synthesize game mechanics from examples. We conducted a user study to evaluate the benefits of the tool for participants with a variety of programming and game development experience. Our results demonstrated that participants' ability to use the tool was unrelated to programming ability. We conclude that tools like ours could help democratize game development, making the practice accessible regardless of programming skills.</p>

<p>Abstract: A key property of reasoning systems is the ability to make sharp decisions on their input data. For contemporary AI systems, a key carrier of sharp behaviour is the softmax function, with its capability to perform differentiable query-key lookups. It is a common belief that the predictive power of networks leveraging softmax arises from "circuits" which sharply perform certain kinds of computations consistently across many diverse inputs. However, for these circuits to be robust, they would need to generalise well to arbitrary valid inputs. In this paper, we dispel this myth: even for tasks as simple as finding the maximum key, any learned circuitry must disperse as the number of items grows at test time. We attribute this to a fundamental limitation of the softmax function to robustly approximate sharp functions, prove this phenomenon theoretically, and propose adaptive temperature as an ad-hoc technique for improving the sharpness of softmax at inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hashim Ali, Surya Subramani, Hafiz Malik</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-speech (TTS) developments have made voice cloning (VC) more realistic, affordable, and easily accessible. This has given rise to many potential abuses of this technology, including Joe Biden's New Hampshire deepfake robocall. Several methodologies have been proposed to detect such clones. However, these methodologies have been trained and evaluated on relatively clean databases. Recently, ASVspoof 5 Challenge introduced a new crowd-sourced database of diverse acoustic conditions including various spoofing attacks and codec conditions. This paper is our submission to the ASVspoof 5 Challenge and aims to investigate the performance of Audio Spoof Detection, trained using data augmentation through laundering attacks, on the ASVSpoof 5 database. The results demonstrate that our system performs worst on A18, A19, A20, A26, and A30 spoofing attacks and in the codec and compression conditions of C08, C09, and C10.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilya Loshchilov, Cheng-Ping Hsieh, Simeng Sun, Boris Ginsburg</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, the normalized Transformer (nGPT) with representation learning on the hypersphere. In nGPT, all vectors forming the embeddings, MLP, attention matrices and hidden states are unit norm normalized. The input stream of tokens travels on the surface of a hypersphere, with each layer contributing a displacement towards the target output predictions. These displacements are defined by the MLP and attention blocks, whose vector components also reside on the same hypersphere. Experiments show that nGPT learns much faster, reducing the number of training steps required to achieve the same accuracy by a factor of 4 to 20, depending on the sequence length.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many bias mitigation methods have been developed for addressing fairness issues in machine learning. We found that using linear mixup alone, a data augmentation technique, for bias mitigation, can still retain biases present in dataset labels. Research presented in this paper aims to address this issue by proposing a novel pre-processing strategy in which both an existing mixup method and our new bias mitigation algorithm can be utilized to improve the generation of labels of augmented samples, which are proximity aware. Specifically, we proposed ProxiMix which keeps both pairwise and proximity relationships for fairer data augmentation. We conducted thorough experiments with three datasets, three ML models, and different hyperparameters settings. Our experimental results showed the effectiveness of ProxiMix from both fairness of predictions and fairness of recourse perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tristan Luca Saidi, Abigail Hickok, Andrew J. Blumberg</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce ORC-ManL, a new algorithm to prune spurious edges from nearest neighbor graphs using a criterion based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature and estimated metric distortion. Our motivation comes from manifold learning: we show that when the data generating the nearest-neighbor graph consists of noisy samples from a low-dimensional manifold, edges that shortcut through the ambient space have more negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature than edges that lie along the data manifold. We demonstrate that our method outperforms alternative pruning methods and that it significantly improves performance on many downstream geometric data analysis tasks that use nearest neighbor graphs as input. Specifically, we evaluate on manifold learning, persistent homology, dimension estimation, and others. We also show that ORC-ManL can be used to improve clustering and manifold learning of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Finally, we provide empirical convergence experiments that support our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amrita Bhattacharjee, Shaona Ghosh, Traian Rebedea, Christopher Parisien</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have seen unprecedented advancements in capabilities and applications across a variety of use-cases, safety alignment of these models is still an area of active research. The fragile nature of LLMs, even models that have undergone extensive alignment and safety training regimes, warrants additional safety steering steps via training-free, inference-time methods. While recent work in the area of mechanistic interpretability has investigated how activations in latent representation spaces may encode concepts, and thereafter performed representation engineering to induce such concepts in LLM outputs, the applicability of such for safety is relatively under-explored. Unlike recent inference-time safety steering works, in this paper we explore safety steering of LLM outputs using: (i) category-specific steering vectors, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the steering, and (ii) sophisticated methods for extracting informative steering vectors for more effective safety steering while retaining quality of the generated text. We demonstrate our exploration on multiple LLMs and datasets, and showcase the effectiveness of the proposed steering method, along with a discussion on the implications and best practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leo Feng, Frederick Tung, Mohamed Osama Ahmed, Yoshua Bengio, Hossein Hajimirsadegh</p>
<p>Abstract: The scalability limitations of Transformers regarding sequence length have renewed interest in recurrent sequence models that are parallelizable during training. As a result, many novel recurrent architectures, such as S4, Mamba, and Aaren, have been proposed that achieve comparable performance. In this work, we revisit traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) from over a decade ago: LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). While these models were slow due to requiring to backpropagate through time (BPTT), we show that by removing their hidden state dependencies from their input, forget, and update gates, LSTMs and GRUs no longer need to BPTT and can be efficiently trained in parallel. Building on this, we introduce minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use significantly fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts and (2) are fully parallelizable during training (175x faster for a sequence of length 512). Lastly, we show that these stripped-down versions of decade-old RNNs match the empirical performance of recent sequence models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quang Vinh Nguyen, Thanh Hoang Son Vo, Sae-Ryung Kang, Soo-Hyung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic polyp segmentation is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment in colonoscopy images. Traditional methods encounter significant challenges in accurately delineating polyps due to limitations in feature representation and the handling of variability in polyp appearance. Deep learning techniques, including CNN and Transformer-based methods, have been explored to improve polyp segmentation accuracy. However, existing approaches often neglect additional semantics, restricting their ability to acquire adequate contexts of polyps in colonoscopy images. In this paper, we propose an innovative method named ``Automatic Polyp Segmentation with Self-Enriched Semantic Model'' to address these limitations. First, we extract a sequence of features from an input image and decode high-level features to generate an initial segmentation mask. Using the proposed self-enriched semantic module, we query potential semantics and augment deep features with additional semantics, thereby aiding the model in understanding context more effectively. Extensive experiments show superior segmentation performance of the proposed method against state-of-the-art polyp segmentation baselines across five polyp benchmarks in both superior learning and generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arda Genc, Justin Marlowe, Anika Jalil, Libor Kovarik, Phillip Christopher</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticles (NPs), particularly regarding particle size distribution, is essential for advancing our understanding of their structure-property relationships and facilitating their design for various applications. In this study, we introduce a novel two-stage artificial intelligence (AI)-driven workflow for NP analysis that leverages prompt engineering techniques from state-of-the-art single-stage object detection and large-scale vision transformer (ViT) architectures. This methodology was applied to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM (STEM) images of heterogeneous catalysts, enabling high-resolution, high-throughput analysis of particle size distributions for supported metal catalysts. The model's performance in detecting and segmenting NPs was validated across diverse heterogeneous catalyst systems, including various metals (Cu, Ru, Pt, and PtCo), supports (silica ($\text{SiO}_2$), $\gamma$-alumina ($\gamma$-$\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$), and carbon black), and particle diameter size distributions with means and standard deviations of 2.9 $\pm$ 1.1 nm, 1.6 $\pm$ 0.2 nm, 9.7 $\pm$ 4.6 nm, and 4 $\pm$ 1.0 nm. Additionally, the proposed machine learning (ML) approach successfully detects and segments overlapping NPs anchored on non-uniform catalytic support materials, providing critical insights into their spatial arrangements and interactions. Our AI-assisted NP analysis workflow demonstrates robust generalization across diverse datasets and can be readily applied to similar NP segmentation tasks without requiring costly model retraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuling Shi, Songsong Wang, Chengcheng Wan, Xiaodong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models have made significant strides in code generation, the pass rate of the generated code is bottlenecked on subtle errors, often requiring human intervention to pass tests, especially for complex problems. Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saddam Hussain Khan (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering,Applied Sciences), Rashid Iqbal (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering,Applied Sciences)</p>
<p>Abstract: Monkeypox (MPox) has emerged as a significant global concern, with cases steadily increasing daily. Conventional detection methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and manual examination, exhibit challenges of low sensitivity, high cost, and substantial workload. Therefore, deep learning offers an automated solution; however, the datasets include data scarcity, texture, contrast, inter-intra class variability, and similarities with other skin infectious diseases. In this regard, a novel hybrid approach is proposed that integrates the learning capacity of Residual Learning and Spatial Exploitation Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a customized Swin Transformer (RS-FME-SwinT) to capture multi-scale global and local correlated features for MPox diagnosis. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT technique employs a transfer learning-based feature map enhancement (FME) technique, integrating the customized SwinT for global information capture, residual blocks for texture extraction, and spatial blocks for local contrast variations. Moreover, incorporating new inverse residual blocks within the proposed SwinT effectively captures local patterns and mitigates vanishing gradients. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT has strong learning potential of diverse features that systematically reduce intra-class MPox variation and enable precise discrimination from other skin diseases. Finally, the proposed RS-FME-SwinT is a holdout cross-validated on a diverse MPox dataset and achieved outperformance on state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT demonstrates commendable results of an accuracy of 97.80%, sensitivity of 96.82%, precision of 98.06%, and an F-score of 97.44% in MPox detection. The RS-FME-SwinT could be a valuable tool for healthcare practitioners, enabling prompt and accurate MPox diagnosis and contributing significantly to mitigation efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenya S. Andrews, Mesrob I. Ohannessian, Elena Zheleva</p>
<p>Abstract: In medical settings, it is critical that all who are in need of care are correctly heard and understood. When this is not the case due to prejudices a listener has, the speaker is experiencing \emph{testimonial injustice}, which, building upon recent work, we quantify by the presence of several categories of unjust vocabulary in medical notes. In this paper, we use FCI, a causal discovery method, to study the degree to which certain demographic features could lead to marginalization (e.g., age, gender, and race) by way of contributing to testimonial injustice. To achieve this, we review physicians' notes for each patient, where we identify occurrences of unjust vocabulary, along with the demographic features present, and use causal discovery to build a Structural Causal Model (SCM) relating those demographic features to testimonial injustice. We analyze and discuss the resulting SCMs to show the interaction of these factors and how they influence the experience of injustice. Despite the potential presence of some confounding variables, we observe how one contributing feature can make a person more prone to experiencing another contributor of testimonial injustice. There is no single root of injustice and thus intersectionality cannot be ignored. These results call for considering more than singular or equalized attributes of who a person is when analyzing and improving their experiences of bias and injustice. This work is thus a first foray at using causal discovery to understand the nuanced experiences of patients in medical settings, and its insights could be used to guide design principles throughout healthcare, to build trust and promote better patient care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolin Jin, Zechao Sun, Yiheng Yang, Huaming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown incredible potential in code generation tasks, and recent research in prompt engineering have enhanced LLMs' understanding of textual information. However, ensuring the accuracy of generated code often requires extensive testing and validation by programmers. While LLMs can typically generate code based on task descriptions, their accuracy remains limited, especially for complex tasks that require a deeper understanding of both the problem statement and the code generation process. This limitation is primarily due to the LLMs' need to simultaneously comprehend text and generate syntactically and semantically correct code, without having the capability to automatically refine the code. In real-world software development, programmers rarely produce flawless code in a single attempt based on the task description alone, they rely on iterative feedback and debugging to refine their programs. Inspired by this process, we introduce a novel architecture of LLM-based agents for code generation and automatic debugging: Refinement and Guidance Debugging (RGD). The RGD framework is a multi-LLM-based agent debugger that leverages three distinct LLM agents-Guide Agent, Debug Agent, and Feedback Agent. RGD decomposes the code generation task into multiple steps, ensuring a clearer workflow and enabling iterative code refinement based on self-reflection and feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that RGD exhibits remarkable code generation capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 9.8% improvement on the HumanEval dataset and a 16.2% improvement on the MBPP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art approaches and traditional direct prompting approaches. We highlight the effectiveness of the RGD framework in enhancing LLMs' ability to generate and refine code autonomously.</p>

<p>Abstract: Question answering (QA) tasks have been extensively studied in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Answers to open-ended questions are highly diverse and difficult to quantify, and cannot be simply evaluated as correct or incorrect, unlike close-ended questions with definitive answers. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various tasks, they exhibit relatively weaker performance in evaluating answers to open-ended questions. In this study, we propose a method that leverages LLMs and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to assess answers to open-ended questions. We utilized LLMs to generate multiple evaluation criteria for a question. Subsequently, answers were subjected to pairwise comparisons under each criterion with LLMs, and scores for each answer were calculated in the AHP. We conducted experiments on four datasets using both ChatGPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. Our results indicate that our approach more closely aligns with human judgment compared to the four baselines. Additionally, we explored the impact of the number of criteria, variations in models, and differences in datasets on the results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reward models are critical for aligning models to follow instructions, and are typically trained following one of two popular paradigms: Bradley-Terry style or Regression style. However, there is a lack of evidence that either approach is better than the other, when adequately matched for data. This is primarily because these approaches require data collected in different (but incompatible) formats, meaning that adequately matched data is not available in existing public datasets. To tackle this problem, we release preference annotations (designed for Bradley-Terry training) to complement existing ratings (designed for Regression style training) in the HelpSteer2 dataset. To improve data interpretability, preference annotations are accompanied with human-written justifications. Using this data, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of Bradley-Terry and Regression models when adequately matched for data. Based on insights derived from such a comparison, we propose a novel approach to combine Bradley-Terry and Regression reward modeling. A Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model tuned with this approach scores 94.1 on RewardBench, emerging top of more than 140 reward models as of 1 Oct 2024. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of this reward model at aligning models to follow instructions in RLHF.

<p>Abstract: We explore the capability of transformers to address endogeneity in in-context linear regression. Our main finding is that transformers inherently possess a mechanism to handle endogeneity effectively using instrumental variables (IV). First, we demonstrate that the transformer architecture can emulate a gradient-based bi-level optimization procedure that converges to the widely used two-stage least squares $(\textsf{2SLS})$ solution at an exponential rate. Next, we propose an in-context pretraining scheme and provide theoretical guarantees showing that the global minimizer of the pre-training loss achieves a small excess loss. Our extensive experiments validate these theoretical findings, showing that the trained transformer provides more robust and reliable in-context predictions and coefficient estimates than the $\textsf{2SLS}$ method, in the presence of endogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xavier F. Cadet, Anastasia Borovykh, Mohammad Malekzadeh, Sara Ahmadi-Abhari, Hamed Haddadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of particular data points from the learnable parameters of a trained machine learning model. This is a crucial capability in light of data privacy requirements, trustworthiness, and safety in deployed models. MU is particularly challenging for deep neural networks (DNNs), such as convolutional nets or vision transformers, as such DNNs tend to memorize a notable portion of their training dataset. Nevertheless, the community lacks a rigorous and multifaceted study that looks into the success of MU methods for DNNs. In this paper, we investigate 18 state-of-the-art MU methods across various benchmark datasets and models, with each evaluation conducted over 10 different initializations, a comprehensive evaluation involving MU over 100K models. We show that, with the proper hyperparameters, Masked Small Gradients (MSG) and Convolution Transpose (CT), consistently perform better in terms of model accuracy and run-time efficiency across different models, datasets, and initializations, assessed by population-based membership inference attacks (MIA) and per-sample unlearning likelihood ratio attacks (U-LiRA). Furthermore, our benchmark highlights the fact that comparing a MU method only with commonly used baselines, such as Gradient Ascent (GA) or Successive Random Relabeling (SRL), is inadequate, and we need better baselines like Negative Gradient Plus (NG+) with proper hyperparameter selection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Task-specific fine-tuning is essential for the deployment of large language models (LLMs), but it requires significant computational resources and time. Existing solutions have proposed coreset selection methods to improve data efficiency and reduce model training overhead, but they still have limitations: 1) Overlooking valuable samples at high pruning rates, which degrades the coreset's performance. 2) Requiring high time overhead during coreset selection to fine-tune and evaluate the target LLM. In this paper, we introduce STAFF, a speculative coreset selection method. STAFF leverages a small model from the same family as the target LLM to efficiently estimate data scores and then verifies the scores on the target LLM to accurately identify and allocate more selection budget to important regions while maintaining coverage of easy regions. We evaluate STAFF on three LLMs and three downstream tasks and show that STAFF improves the performance of SOTA methods by up to 54.3% and reduces selection overhead by up to 70.5% at different pruning rates. Furthermore, we observe that the coreset selected by STAFF at low pruning rates (i.e., 20%) can even obtain better fine-tuning performance than the full dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdur Rasool, Muhammad Irfan Shahzad, Hafsa Aslam, Vincent Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a need for empathetic and coherent responses in automated chatbot-facilitated psychotherapy sessions. This study addresses the challenge of enhancing the emotional and contextual understanding of large language models (LLMs) in psychiatric applications. We introduce a novel framework that integrates multiple emotion lexicons, including NRC Emotion Lexicon, VADER, WordNet, and SentiWordNet, with state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLAMA 2, Flan-T5, ChatGPT 3.0, and ChatGPT 4.0. The primary dataset comprises over 2,000 therapy session transcripts from the Counseling and Psychotherapy database, covering discussions on anxiety, depression, trauma, and addiction. We segment the transcripts into smaller chunks, enhancing them with lexical features and computing embeddings using BERT, GPT-3, and RoBERTa to capture semantic and emotional nuances. These embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database, enabling efficient similarity search and clustering based on cosine similarity. Upon user query, the most relevant segments are retrieved and provided as context to the LLMs, significantly improving the models' ability to generate empathetic and contextually appropriate responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that in-corporating emotion lexicons enhances empathy, coherence, informativeness, and fluency scores. Our findings highlight the critical role of emotional embeddings in improving LLM performance for psychotherapy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanyu Cui, Zhewei Wei, Hsin-Hao Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are extensively employed in graph machine learning, with considerable research focusing on their expressiveness. Current studies often assess GNN expressiveness by comparing them to the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) tests or classical graph algorithms. However, we identify three key issues in existing analyses: (1) some studies use preprocessing to enhance expressiveness but overlook its computational costs; (2) some claim the anonymous WL test's limited power while enhancing expressiveness using non-anonymous features, creating a mismatch; and (3) some characterize message-passing GNNs (MPGNNs) with the CONGEST model but make unrealistic assumptions about computational resources, allowing $\textsf{NP-Complete}$ problems to be solved in $O(m)$ depth. We contend that a well-defined computational model is urgently needed to serve as the foundation for discussions on GNN expressiveness. To address these issues, we introduce the Resource-Limited CONGEST (RL-CONGEST) model, incorporating optional preprocessing and postprocessing to form a framework for analyzing GNN expressiveness. Our framework sheds light on computational aspects, including the computational hardness of hash functions in the WL test and the role of virtual nodes in reducing network capacity. Additionally, we suggest that high-order GNNs correspond to first-order model-checking problems, offering new insights into their expressiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyun Jang, Mincheol Chang, Jongwon Park, Jinkyu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors have been largely utilized in various applications, including autonomous vehicles or mobile robots. However, LiDAR-based detectors often fail to adapt well to target domains with different sensor configurations (e.g., types of sensors, spatial resolution, or FOVs) and location shifts. Collecting and annotating datasets in a new setup is commonly required to reduce such gaps, but it is often expensive and time-consuming. Recent studies suggest that pre-trained backbones can be learned in a self-supervised manner with large-scale unlabeled LiDAR frames. However, despite their expressive representations, they remain challenging to generalize well without substantial amounts of data from the target domain. Thus, we propose a novel method, called Domain Adaptive Distill-Tuning (DADT), to adapt a pre-trained model with limited target data (approximately 100 LiDAR frames), retaining its representation power and preventing it from overfitting. Specifically, we use regularizers to align object-level and context-level representations between the pre-trained and finetuned models in a teacher-student architecture. Our experiments with driving benchmarks, i.e., Waymo Open dataset and KITTI, confirm that our method effectively finetunes a pre-trained model, achieving significant gains in accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debargha Ganguly, Warren Morningstar, Andrew Yu, Vipin Chaudhary</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models can now produce photorealistic synthetic data which is virtually indistinguishable from the real data used to train it. This is a significant evolution over previous models which could produce reasonable facsimiles of the training data, but ones which could be visually distinguished from the training data by human evaluation. Recent work on OOD detection has raised doubts that generative model likelihoods are optimal OOD detectors due to issues involving likelihood misestimation, entropy in the generative process, and typicality. We speculate that generative OOD detectors also failed because their models focused on the pixels rather than the semantic content of the data, leading to failures in near-OOD cases where the pixels may be similar but the information content is significantly different. We hypothesize that estimating typical sets using self-supervised learners leads to better OOD detectors. We introduce a novel approach that leverages representation learning, and informative summary statistics based on manifold estimation, to address all of the aforementioned issues. Our method outperforms other unsupervised approaches and achieves state-of-the art performance on well-established challenging benchmarks, and new synthetic data detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeyoung Park, Minsu Kim, Steven Euijong Whang</p>
<p>Abstract: Model fairness is becoming important in class-incremental learning for Trustworthy AI. While accuracy has been a central focus in class-incremental learning, fairness has been relatively understudied. However, naively using all the samples of the current task for training results in unfair catastrophic forgetting for certain sensitive groups including classes. We theoretically analyze that forgetting occurs if the average gradient vector of the current task data is in an "opposite direction" compared to the average gradient vector of a sensitive group, which means their inner products are negative. We then propose a fair class-incremental learning framework that adjusts the training weights of current task samples to change the direction of the average gradient vector and thus reduce the forgetting of underperforming groups and achieve fairness. For various group fairness measures, we formulate optimization problems to minimize the overall losses of sensitive groups while minimizing the disparities among them. We also show the problems can be solved with linear programming and propose an efficient Fairness-aware Sample Weighting (FSW) algorithm. Experiments show that FSW achieves better accuracy-fairness tradeoff results than state-of-the-art approaches on real datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Chen, Jiaying Zhu, Xinyu Yang, Wenya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The exploration of language skills in language models (LMs) has always been one of the central goals in mechanistic interpretability. However, existing circuit analyses often fall short in representing the full functional scope of these models, primarily due to the exclusion of Feed-Forward layers. Additionally, isolating the effect of a single language skill from a text, which inherently involves multiple entangled skills, poses a significant challenge. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel concept, Memory Circuit, a minimum unit that fully and independently manipulates the memory-reading functionality of a language model, and disentangle the transformer model precisely into a circuit graph which is an ensemble of paths connecting different memory circuits. Based on this disentanglement, we identify salient circuit paths, named as skill paths, responsible for three crucial language skills, i.e., the Previous Token Skill, Induction Skill and In-Context Learning (ICL) Skill, leveraging causal effect estimation through interventions and counterfactuals. Our experiments on various datasets confirm the correspondence between our identified skill paths and language skills, and validate three longstanding hypotheses: 1) Language skills are identifiable through circuit dissection; 2) Simple language skills reside in shallow layers, whereas complex language skills are found in deeper layers; 3) Complex language skills are formed on top of simpler language skills.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Bandarkar, Benjamin Muller, Pritish Yuvraj, Rui Hou, Nayan Singhal, Hongjiang Lv, Bing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging, such as model souping, is the practice of combining different models with the same architecture together without further training. In this work, we present a model merging methodology that addresses the difficulty of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for target tasks in non-English languages, where task-specific data is often unavailable. We focus on mathematical reasoning and without in-language math data, facilitate cross-lingual transfer by composing language and math capabilities. Starting from the same pretrained model, we fine-tune separate "experts" on math instruction data in English and on generic instruction data in the target language. We then replace the top and bottom transformer layers of the math expert directly with layers from the language expert, which consequently enhances math performance in the target language. The resulting merged models outperform the individual experts and other merging methods on the math benchmark, MGSM, by 10% across four major languages where math instruction data is scarce. In addition, this layer swapping is simple, inexpensive, and intuitive, as it is based on an interpretative analysis of the most important parameter changes during the fine-tuning of each expert. The ability to successfully re-compose LLMs for cross-lingual transfer in this manner opens up future possibilities to combine model expertise, create modular solutions, and transfer reasoning capabilities across languages all post hoc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bocheng Zeng, Qi Wang, Mengtao Yan, Yang Liu, Ruizhi Chengze, Yi Zhang, Hongsheng Liu, Zidong Wang, Hao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) serves as a cornerstone for modeling complex dynamical systems. Recent progresses have demonstrated grand benefits of data-driven neural-based models for predicting spatiotemporal dynamics (e.g., tremendous speedup gain compared with classical numerical methods). However, most existing neural models rely on rich training data, have limited extrapolation and generalization abilities, and suffer to produce precise or reliable physical prediction under intricate conditions (e.g., irregular mesh or geometry, complex boundary conditions, diverse PDE parameters, etc.). To this end, we propose a new graph learning approach, namely, Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network (PhyMPGN), to model spatiotemporal PDE systems on irregular meshes given small training datasets. Specifically, we incorporate a GNN into a numerical integrator to approximate the temporal marching of spatiotemporal dynamics for a given PDE system. Considering that many physical phenomena are governed by diffusion processes, we further design a learnable Laplace block, which encodes the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator, to aid and guide the GNN learning in a physically feasible solution space. A boundary condition padding strategy is also designed to improve the model convergence and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhyMPGN is capable of accurately predicting various types of spatiotemporal dynamics on coarse unstructured meshes, consistently achieves the state-of-the-art results, and outperforms other baselines with considerable gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuguang Yang, Yu Pan, Jixun Yao, Xiang Zhang, Jianhao Ye, Hongbin Zhou, Lei Xie, Lei Ma, Jianjun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transform the source speaker timbre into an arbitrary unseen one without altering the original speech content.While recent advancements in zero-shot VC methods have shown remarkable progress, there still remains considerable potential for improvement in terms of improving speaker similarity and speech naturalness.In this paper, we propose Takin-VC, a novel zero-shot VC framework based on jointly hybrid content and memory-augmented context-aware timbre modeling to tackle this challenge. Specifically, an effective hybrid content encoder, guided by neural codec training, that leverages quantized features from pre-trained WavLM and HybridFormer is first presented to extract the linguistic content of the source speech. Subsequently, we introduce an advanced cross-attention-based context-aware timbre modeling approach that learns the fine-grained, semantically associated target timbre features. To further enhance both speaker similarity and real-time performance, we utilize a conditional flow matching model to reconstruct the Mel-spectrogram of the source speech. Additionally, we advocate an efficient memory-augmented module designed to generate high-quality conditional target inputs for the flow matching process, thereby improving the overall performance of the proposed system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Takin-VC method surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot VC systems, delivering superior performance in terms of both speech naturalness and speaker similarity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Pan, Rongyu Cao, Yongchang Cao, Yingwei Ma, Binhua Li, Fei Huang, Han Liu, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Code completion, a key downstream task in code generation, is one of the most frequent and impactful methods for enhancing developer productivity in software development. As intelligent completion tools evolve, we need a robust evaluation benchmark that enables meaningful comparisons between products and guides future advancements. However, existing benchmarks focus more on coarse-grained tasks without industrial analysis resembling general code generation rather than the real-world scenarios developers encounter. Moreover, these benchmarks often rely on costly and time-consuming human annotation, and the standalone test cases fail to leverage minimal tests for maximum repository-level understanding and code coverage. To address these limitations, we first analyze business data from an industrial code completion tool and redefine the evaluation criteria to better align with the developer's intent and desired completion behavior throughout the coding process. Based on these insights, we introduce Codev-Agent, an agent-based system that automates repository crawling, constructs execution environments, extracts dynamic calling chains from existing unit tests, and generates new test samples to avoid data leakage, ensuring fair and effective comparisons. Using Codev-Agent, we present the Code-Development Benchmark (Codev-Bench), a fine-grained, real-world, repository-level, and developer-centric evaluation framework. Codev-Bench assesses whether a code completion tool can capture a developer's immediate intent and suggest appropriate code across diverse contexts, providing a more realistic benchmark for code completion in modern software development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shasha Guo, Lizi Liao, Jing Zhang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational Question Generation (CQG) enhances the interactivity of conversational question-answering systems in fields such as education, customer service, and entertainment. However, traditional CQG, focusing primarily on the immediate context, lacks the conversational foresight necessary to guide conversations toward specified conclusions. This limitation significantly restricts their ability to achieve conclusion-oriented conversational outcomes. In this work, we redefine the CQG task as Conclusion-driven Conversational Question Generation (CCQG) by focusing on proactivity, not merely reacting to the unfolding conversation but actively steering it towards a conclusion-oriented question-answer pair. To address this, we propose a novel approach, called Proactive Conversational Question Planning with self-Refining (PCQPR). Concretely, by integrating a planning algorithm inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the analytical capabilities of large language models (LLMs), PCQPR predicts future conversation turns and continuously refines its questioning strategies. This iterative self-refining mechanism ensures the generation of contextually relevant questions strategically devised to reach a specified outcome. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that PCQPR significantly surpasses existing CQG methods, marking a paradigm shift towards conclusion-oriented conversational question-answering systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyeon Kim, Hyunji Lee, Hyowon Cho, Joel Jang, Hyeonbin Hwang, Seungpil Won, Youbin Ahn, Dohaeng Lee, Minjoon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate how a model's tendency to broadly integrate its parametric knowledge evolves throughout pretraining, and how this behavior affects overall performance, particularly in terms of knowledge acquisition and forgetting. We introduce the concept of knowledge entropy, which quantifies the range of memory sources the model engages with; high knowledge entropy indicates that the model utilizes a wide range of memory sources, while low knowledge entropy suggests reliance on specific sources with greater certainty. Our analysis reveals a consistent decline in knowledge entropy as pretraining advances. We also find that the decline is closely associated with a reduction in the model's ability to acquire and retain knowledge, leading us to conclude that diminishing knowledge entropy (smaller number of active memory sources) impairs the model's knowledge acquisition and retention capabilities. We find further support for this by demonstrating that increasing the activity of inactive memory sources enhances the model's capacity for knowledge acquisition and retention.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning is a key motivator behind information search behavior. With the emergence of LLM-based chatbots, students are increasingly turning to these tools as their primary resource for acquiring knowledge. However, the transition from traditional resources like textbooks and web searches raises concerns among educators. They worry that these fully-automated LLMs might lead students to delegate critical steps of search as learning. In this paper, we systematically uncover three main concerns from educators' perspectives. In response to these concerns, we conducted a mixed-methods study with 92 university students to compare three learning sources with different automation levels. Our results show that LLMs support comprehensive understanding of key concepts without promoting passive learning, though their effectiveness in knowledge retention was limited. Additionally, we found that academic performance impacted both learning outcomes and search patterns. Notably, higher-competence learners engaged more deeply with content through reading-intensive behaviors rather than relying on search activities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Enhancing the FedProx federated learning algorithm (Li et al., 2020) with server-side extrapolation, Li et al. (2024a) recently introduced the FedExProx method. Their theoretical analysis, however, relies on the assumption that each client computes a certain proximal operator exactly, which is impractical since this is virtually never possible to do in real settings. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of FedExProx without this exactness assumption in the smooth and globally strongly convex setting. We establish a general convergence result, showing that inexactness leads to convergence to a neighborhood of the solution. Additionally, we demonstrate that, with careful control, the adverse effects of this inexactness can be mitigated. By linking inexactness to biased compression (Beznosikov et al., 2023), we refine our analysis, highlighting robustness of extrapolation to inexact proximal updates. We also examine the local iteration complexity required by each client to achieved the required level of inexactness using various local optimizers. Our theoretical insights are validated through comprehensive numerical experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive capability. However, recently many deficiencies of MLLMs have been found compared to human intelligence, $\textit{e.g.}$, hallucination. To drive the MLLMs study, the community dedicated efforts to building larger benchmarks with complex tasks. In this paper, we propose benchmarking an essential but usually overlooked intelligence: $\textbf{association}$, a human's basic capability to link observation and prior practice memory. To comprehensively investigate MLLM's performance on the association, we formulate the association task and devise a standard benchmark based on adjective and verb semantic concepts. Instead of costly data annotation and curation, we propose a convenient $\textbf{annotation-free}$ construction method transforming the general dataset for our association tasks. Simultaneously, we devise a rigorous data refinement process to eliminate confusion in the raw dataset. Building on this database, we establish three levels of association tasks: single-step, synchronous, and asynchronous associations. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the MLLMs' zero-shot association capabilities, addressing multiple dimensions, including three distinct memory strategies, both open-source and closed-source MLLMs, cutting-edge Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, and the involvement of human experts. Our systematic investigation shows that current open-source MLLMs consistently exhibit poor capability in our association tasks, even the currently state-of-the-art GPT-4V(vision) also has a significant gap compared to humans. We believe our benchmark would pave the way for future MLLM studies. $\textit{Our data and code are available at:}$ https://mvig-rhos.com/llm_inception.</p>

Fair4Free can work on the situation when the data is private or inaccessible. In our approach, we first train a teacher model to create fair representation and then distil the knowledge to a student model (using a smaller architecture). The process of distilling the student model is data-free, i.e. the student model does not have access to the training dataset while distilling. After the distillation, we use the distilled model to generate fair synthetic samples. Our extensive experiments show that our synthetic samples outperform state-of-the-art models in all three criteria (fairness, utility and synthetic quality) with a performance increase of 5% for fairness, 8% for utility and 12% in synthetic quality for both tabular and image datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compositionality, the notion that the meaning of an expression is constructed from the meaning of its parts and syntactic rules, permits the infinite productivity of human language. For the first time, artificial language models (LMs) are able to match human performance in a number of compositional generalization tasks. However, much remains to be understood about the representational mechanisms underlying these abilities. We take a high-level geometric approach to this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimensionality of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' intrinsic dimensionality, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between linear and nonlinear dimensionality, showing that they respectively encode formal and semantic aspects of linguistic composition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong-Hsiang Liu, Yi-Wen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Large Language Models have shown impressive in-context learning abilities, performing well across various tasks with just a prompt. Previous melody-to-lyric research has been limited by scarce high-quality aligned data and unclear standard for creativeness. Most efforts focused on general themes or emotions, which are less valuable given current language model capabilities. In tonal contour languages like Mandarin, pitch contours are influenced by both melody and tone, leading to variations in lyric-melody fit. Our study, validated by the Mpop600 dataset, confirms that lyricists and melody writers consider this fit during their composition process. In this research, we developed a multi-agent system that decomposes the melody-to-lyric task into sub-tasks, with each agent controlling rhyme, syllable count, lyric-melody alignment, and consistency. Listening tests were conducted via a diffusion-based singing voice synthesizer to evaluate the quality of lyrics generated by different agent groups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohan Xu, Kai Li, Guo Chen, Xiaolin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, much speech separation research has focused primarily on improving model performance. However, for low-latency speech processing systems, high efficiency is equally important. Therefore, we propose a speech separation model with significantly reduced parameters and computational costs: Time-frequency Interleaved Gain Extraction and Reconstruction network (TIGER). TIGER leverages prior knowledge to divide frequency bands and compresses frequency information. We employ a multi-scale selective attention module to extract contextual features, while introducing a full-frequency-frame attention module to capture both temporal and frequency contextual information. Additionally, to more realistically evaluate the performance of speech separation models in complex acoustic environments, we introduce a dataset called EchoSet. This dataset includes noise and more realistic reverberation (e.g., considering object occlusions and material properties), with speech from two speakers overlapping at random proportions. Experimental results showed that models trained on EchoSet had better generalization ability than those trained on other datasets to the data collected in the physical world, which validated the practical value of the EchoSet. On EchoSet and real-world data, TIGER significantly reduces the number of parameters by 94.3% and the MACs by 95.3% while achieving performance surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) model TF-GridNet. This is the first speech separation model with fewer than 1 million parameters that achieves performance comparable to the SOTA model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreea Iana, Goran Glava\v{s}, Heiko Paulheim</p>
<p>Abstract: Encoder architectures play a pivotal role in neural news recommenders by embedding the semantic and contextual information of news and users. Thus, research has heavily focused on enhancing the representational capabilities of news and user encoders to improve recommender performance. Despite the significant impact of encoder architectures on the quality of news and user representations, existing analyses of encoder designs focus only on the overall downstream recommendation performance. This offers a one-sided assessment of the encoders' similarity, ignoring more nuanced differences in their behavior, and potentially resulting in sub-optimal model selection. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis of encoder architectures in neural news recommender systems. We systematically evaluate the most prominent news and user encoder architectures, focusing on their (i) representational similarity, measured with the Central Kernel Alignment, (ii) overlap of generated recommendation lists, quantified with the Jaccard similarity, and (iii) the overall recommendation performance. Our analysis reveals that the complexity of certain encoding techniques is often empirically unjustified, highlighting the potential for simpler, more efficient architectures. By isolating the effects of individual components, we provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners to make better informed decisions about encoder selection and avoid unnecessary complexity in the design of news recommenders.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01481">SonicSim: A customizable simulation platform for speech processing in moving sound source scenarios</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Li, Wendi Sang, Chang Zeng, Runxuan Yang, Guo Chen, Xiaolin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The systematic evaluation of speech separation and enhancement models under moving sound source conditions typically requires extensive data comprising diverse scenarios. However, real-world datasets often contain insufficient data to meet the training and evaluation requirements of models. Although synthetic datasets offer a larger volume of data, their acoustic simulations lack realism. Consequently, neither real-world nor synthetic datasets effectively fulfill practical needs. To address these issues, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit de-designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim is developed based on the embodied AI simulation platform, Habitat-sim, supporting multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level, thereby generating more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a moving sound source benchmark dataset, SonicSet, using the Librispeech, the Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K) and Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from the Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to validate the differences between synthetic data and real-world data, we randomly selected 5 hours of raw data without reverberation from the SonicSet validation set to record a real-world speech separation dataset, which was then compared with the corresponding synthetic datasets. Similarly, we utilized the real-world speech enhancement dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between other synthetic datasets and the SonicSet dataset for speech enhancement. The results indicate that the synthetic data generated by SonicSim can effectively generalize to real-world scenarios. Demo and code are publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Kasmi, Amandine Brunetto, Thomas Fel, Jayneel Parekh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the growing use of deep neural networks in safety-critical decision-making, their inherent black-box nature hinders transparency and interpretability. Explainable AI (XAI) methods have thus emerged to understand a model's internal workings, and notably attribution methods also called saliency maps. Conventional attribution methods typically identify the locations -- the where -- of significant regions within an input. However, because they overlook the inherent structure of the input data, these methods often fail to interpret what these regions represent in terms of structural components (e.g., textures in images or transients in sounds). Furthermore, existing methods are usually tailored to a single data modality, limiting their generalizability. In this paper, we propose leveraging the wavelet domain as a robust mathematical foundation for attribution. Our approach, the Wavelet Attribution Method (WAM) extends the existing gradient-based feature attributions into the wavelet domain, providing a unified framework for explaining classifiers across images, audio, and 3D shapes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that WAM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods across faithfulness metrics and models in image, audio, and 3D explainability. Finally, we show how our method explains not only the where -- the important parts of the input -- but also the what -- the relevant patterns in terms of structural components.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhang, Ruizhe Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved robust performance across diverse tasks, but fine-tuning these models for specific domains remains resource-intensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) address this challenge by fine-tuning a small subset of parameters. However, existing methods for fusing multiple LoRAs lack dynamic fusion based on contextual inputs and often increase inference time due to token-level operations. We propose DLP-LoRA, a Dynamic Lightweight Plugin that employs a mini-MLP module with only 5M parameters to dynamically fuse multiple LoRAs at the sentence level using top-p sampling strategies. This approach reduces inference time to less than twice that of single LoRA inference by leveraging parallel computation. Evaluations across 26 tasks-including multiple-choice questions and question answering-demonstrate that DLP-LoRA achieves an average accuracy of 92.34% on multiple-choice datasets and significant improvements in BLEU and ROUGE scores on QA datasets, outperforming different LLMs backbones under composite task settings. DLP-LoRA effectively balances performance and efficiency, making it a practical solution for dynamic multi-task adaptation in LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/MeCuping/DLP-LoRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Hyeong Kim, Seonghwan Kim, Seokhyun Moon, Hyeongwoo Kim, Jeheon Woo, Woo Youn Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Transporting between arbitrary distributions is a fundamental goal in generative modeling. Recently proposed diffusion bridge models provide a potential solution, but they rely on a joint distribution that is difficult to obtain in practice. Furthermore, formulations based on continuous domains limit their applicability to discrete domains such as graphs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Discrete Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (DDSBM), a novel framework that utilizes continuous-time Markov chains to solve the SB problem in a high-dimensional discrete state space. Our approach extends Iterative Markovian Fitting to discrete domains, and we have proved its convergence to the SB. Furthermore, we adapt our framework for the graph transformation and show that our design choice of underlying dynamics characterized by independent modifications of nodes and edges can be interpreted as the entropy-regularized version of optimal transport with a cost function described by the graph edit distance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we have applied DDSBM to molecular optimization in the field of chemistry. Experimental results demonstrate that DDSBM effectively optimizes molecules' property-of-interest with minimal graph transformation, successfully retaining other features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dexuan Ding, Lei Wang, Liyun Zhu, Tom Gedeon, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains, and modalities, such as text, images, and videos. Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing similarity graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we use graph power expansions and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to combine these graph powers for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise similarity score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: It is challenging to generate high-quality instruction datasets for non-English languages due to tail phenomena, which limit performance on less frequently observed data. To mitigate this issue, we propose translating existing high-quality English instruction datasets as a solution, emphasizing the need for complete and instruction-aware translations to maintain the inherent attributes of these datasets. We claim that fine-tuning LLMs with datasets translated in this way can improve their performance in the target language. To this end, we introduces a new translation framework tailored for instruction datasets, named InstaTrans (INSTruction-Aware TRANSlation). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of InstaTrans over other competitors in terms of completeness and instruction-awareness of translation, highlighting its potential to broaden the accessibility of LLMs across diverse languages at a relatively low cost. Furthermore, we have validated that fine-tuning LLMs with datasets translated by InstaTrans can effectively improve their performance in the target language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwoo Ha, Hyukjae Kwon, Sungsoo Kim, Kisu Lee, Ha Young Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, yet simultaneously capturing both temporal and inter-variable dependencies remains a challenge. Conventional Channel-Dependent (CD) models handle these dependencies separately, limiting their ability to model complex interactions such as lead-lag dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose TiVaT (Time-Variable Transformer), a novel architecture that integrates temporal and variate dependencies through its Joint-Axis (JA) attention mechanism. TiVaT's ability to capture intricate variate-temporal dependencies, including asynchronous interactions, is further enhanced by the incorporation of Distance-aware Time-Variable (DTV) Sampling, which reduces noise and improves accuracy through a learned 2D map that focuses on key interactions. TiVaT effectively models both temporal and variate dependencies, consistently delivering strong performance across diverse datasets. Notably, it excels in capturing complex patterns within multivariate time series, enabling it to surpass or remain competitive with state-of-the-art methods. This positions TiVaT as a new benchmark in MTS forecasting, particularly in handling datasets characterized by intricate and challenging dependencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angela Lopez-Cardona, Carlos Segura, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Sergi Abadal, Ioannis Arapakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have led to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, Llama, Claude, and Gemini, which excel across a range of tasks but require extensive fine-tuning to align their outputs with human expectations. A widely used method for achieving this alignment is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which, despite its success, faces challenges in accurately modelling human preferences. In this paper, we introduce GazeReward, a novel framework that integrates implicit feedback -- and specifically eye-tracking (ET) data -- into the Reward Model (RM). In addition, we explore how ET-based features can provide insights into user preferences. Through ablation studies we test our framework with different integration methods, LLMs, and ET generator models, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of the RM on established human preference datasets. This work advances the ongoing discussion on optimizing AI alignment with human values, exploring the potential of cognitive data for shaping future NLP research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jente Vandersanden, Sascha Holl, Xingchang Huang, Gurprit Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical generative diffusion models learn an isotropic Gaussian denoising process, treating all spatial regions uniformly, thus neglecting potentially valuable structural information in the data. Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that is a generalization of denoising diffusion probablistic models (DDPM). In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution. We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information. Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation. It is also more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation. We present qualitative and quantitative results showing consistent improvements (FID score) of up to 30% for both tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-consistency-based approaches, which involve repeatedly sampling multiple outputs and selecting the most consistent one as the final response, prove to be remarkably effective in improving the factual accuracy of large language models. Nonetheless, existing methods usually have strict constraints on the task format, largely limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present Integrative Decoding (ID), to unlock the potential of self-consistency in open-ended generation tasks. ID operates by constructing a set of inputs, each prepended with a previously sampled response, and then processes them concurrently, with the next token being selected by aggregating of all their corresponding predictions at each decoding step. In essence, this simple approach implicitly incorporates self-consistency in the decoding objective. Extensive evaluation shows that ID consistently enhances factuality over a wide range of language models, with substantial improvements on the TruthfulQA (+11.2%), Biographies (+15.4%) and LongFact (+8.5%) benchmarks. The performance gains amplify progressively as the number of sampled responses increases, indicating the potential of ID to scale up with repeated sampling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mathematical reasoning continues to be a critical challenge in large language model (LLM) development with significant interest. However, most of the cutting-edge progress in mathematical reasoning with LLMs has become \emph{closed-source} due to lack of access to training data. This lack of data access limits researchers from understanding the impact of different choices for synthesizing and utilizing the data. With the goal of creating a high-quality finetuning (SFT) dataset for math reasoning, we conduct careful ablation experiments on data synthesis using the recently released \texttt{Llama3.1} family of models. Our experiments show that: (a) solution format matters, with excessively verbose solutions proving detrimental to SFT performance, (b) data generated by a strong teacher outperforms \emph{on-policy} data generated by a weak student model, (c) SFT is robust to low-quality solutions, allowing for imprecise data filtering, and (d) question diversity is crucial for achieving data scaling gains. Based on these insights, we create the OpenMathInstruct-2 dataset, which consists of 14M question-solution pairs ($\approx$ 600K unique questions), making it nearly eight times larger than the previous largest open-source math reasoning dataset. Finetuning the \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Base} using OpenMathInstruct-2 outperforms \texttt{Llama3.1-8B-Instruct} on MATH by an absolute 15.9\% (51.9\% $\rightarrow$ 67.8\%). Finally, to accelerate the open-source efforts, we release the code, the finetuned models, and the OpenMathInstruct-2 dataset under a commercially permissive license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naming Liu, Mingzhi Wang, Xihuai Wang, Weinan Zhang, Yaodong Yang, Youzhi Zhang, Bo An, Ying Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: The ex ante equilibrium for two-team zero-sum games, where agents within each team collaborate to compete against the opposing team, is known to be the best a team can do for coordination. Many existing works on ex ante equilibrium solutions are aiming to extend the scope of ex ante equilibrium solving to large-scale team games based on Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO). However, the joint team policy space constructed by the most prominent method, Team PSRO, cannot cover the entire team policy space in heterogeneous team games where teammates play distinct roles. Such insufficient policy expressiveness causes Team PSRO to be trapped into a sub-optimal ex ante equilibrium with significantly higher exploitability and never converges to the global ex ante equilibrium. To find the global ex ante equilibrium without introducing additional computational complexity, we first parameterize heterogeneous policies for teammates, and we prove that optimizing the heterogeneous teammates' policies sequentially can guarantee a monotonic improvement in team rewards. We further propose Heterogeneous-PSRO (H-PSRO), a novel framework for heterogeneous team games, which integrates the sequential correlation mechanism into the PSRO framework and serves as the first PSRO framework for heterogeneous team games. We prove that H-PSRO achieves lower exploitability than Team PSRO in heterogeneous team games. Empirically, H-PSRO achieves convergence in matrix heterogeneous games that are unsolvable by non-heterogeneous baselines. Further experiments reveal that H-PSRO outperforms non-heterogeneous baselines in both heterogeneous team games and homogeneous settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spoken language assessment (SLA) systems restrict themselves to evaluating the pronunciation and oral fluency of a speaker by analysing the read and spontaneous spoken utterances respectively. The assessment of language grammar or vocabulary is relegated to written language assessment (WLA) systems. Most WLA systems present a set of sentences from a curated finite-size database of sentences thereby making it possible to anticipate the test questions and train oneself. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end SLA system to assess language grammar from spoken utterances thus making WLA systems redundant; additionally, we make the assessment largely unteachable by employing a large language model (LLM) to bring in variations in the test. We further demonstrate that a hybrid automatic speech recognition (ASR) with a custom-built language model outperforms the state-of-the-art ASR engine for spoken grammar assessment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Non-ideal measurement computed tomography (NICT), which sacrifices optimal imaging standards for new advantages in CT imaging, is expanding the clinical application scope of CT images. However, with the reduction of imaging standards, the image quality has also been reduced, extremely limiting the clinical acceptability. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of deep learning for the NICT enhancement in specific scenarios, their high data cost and limited generalizability have become large obstacles. The recent research on the foundation model has brought new opportunities for building a universal NICT enhancement model - bridging the image quality degradation with minimal data cost. However, owing to the challenges in the collection of large pre-training datasets and the compatibility of data variation, no success has been reported. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale integrated Transformer AMPlifier (TAMP), the first imaging foundation model for universal NICT enhancement. It has been pre-trained on a large-scale physical-driven simulation dataset with 3.6 million NICT-ICT image pairs, and is able to directly generalize to the NICT enhancement tasks with various non-ideal settings and body regions. Via the adaptation with few data, it can further achieve professional performance in real-world specific scenarios. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed TAMP has significant potential for promoting the exploration and application of NICT and serving a wider range of medical scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved text-to-image (T2I) generation, but they often struggle to balance fine-grained precision with high-level control. Methods like ControlNet and T2I-Adapter excel at following sketches by seasoned artists but tend to be overly rigid, replicating unintentional flaws in sketches from novice users. Meanwhile, coarse-grained methods, such as sketch-based abstraction frameworks, offer more accessible input handling but lack the precise control needed for detailed, professional use. To address these limitations, we propose KnobGen, a dual-pathway framework that democratizes sketch-based image generation by seamlessly adapting to varying levels of sketch complexity and user skill. KnobGen uses a Coarse-Grained Controller (CGC) module for high-level semantics and a Fine-Grained Controller (FGC) module for detailed refinement. The relative strength of these two modules can be adjusted through our knob inference mechanism to align with the user's specific needs. These mechanisms ensure that KnobGen can flexibly generate images from both novice sketches and those drawn by seasoned artists. This maintains control over the final output while preserving the natural appearance of the image, as evidenced on the MultiGen-20M dataset and a newly collected sketch dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: In Query-driven Travel Recommender Systems (RSs), it is crucial to understand the user intent behind challenging natural language(NL) destination queries such as the broadly worded "youth-friendly activities" or the indirect description "a high school graduation trip". Such queries are challenging due to the wide scope and subtlety of potential user intents that confound the ability of retrieval methods to infer relevant destinations from available textual descriptions such as WikiVoyage. While query reformulation (QR) has proven effective in enhancing retrieval by addressing user intent, existing QR methods tend to focus only on expanding the range of potentially matching query subtopics (breadth) or elaborating on the potential meaning of a query (depth), but not both. In this paper, we introduce Elaborative Subtopic Query Reformulation (EQR), a large language model-based QR method that combines both breadth and depth by generating potential query subtopics with information-rich elaborations. We also release TravelDest, a novel dataset for query-driven travel destination RSs. Experiments on TravelDest show that EQR achieves significant improvements in recall and precision over existing state-of-the-art QR methods.</p>

Common users of AI models may not have advanced knowledge of adversarial machine learning methods or access to model internals, and they do not spend a lot of time crafting a single highly effective adversarial prompt. Instead, they are likely to make use of techniques commonly shared online and exploit the multiturn conversational nature of LLMs. While manual testing addresses this gap, it is an inefficient and often expensive process. To address these limitations, we introduce the Generative Offensive Agent Tester (GOAT), an automated agentic red teaming system that simulates plain language adversarial conversations while leveraging multiple adversarial prompting techniques to identify vulnerabilities in LLMs. We instantiate GOAT with 7 red teaming attacks by prompting a general-purpose model in a way that encourages reasoning through the choices of methods available, the current target model's response, and the next steps. Our approach is designed to be extensible and efficient, allowing human testers to focus on exploring new areas of risk while automation covers the scaled adversarial stress-testing of known risk territory. We present the design and evaluation of GOAT, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with an ASR@10 of 97% against Llama 3.1 and 88% against GPT-4 on the JailbreakBench dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingfeng Hui, Zhenyu Zhang, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Hua Wu, Sen Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) shines brightly in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrates outstanding performance in plentiful natural language processing tasks. However, existing methods transforming LLMs from dense to MoE face significant data requirements and typically rely on large-scale post-training. In this paper, we propose Upcycling Instruction Tuning (UpIT), a data-efficient approach for tuning a dense pre-trained model into a MoE instruction model. Specifically, we first point out that intermediate checkpoints during instruction tuning of the dense model are naturally suitable for specialized experts, and then propose an expert expansion stage to flexibly achieve models with flexible numbers of experts, where genetic algorithm and parameter merging are introduced to ensure sufficient diversity of new extended experts. To ensure that each specialized expert in the MoE model works as expected, we select a small amount of seed data that each expert excels to pre-optimize the router. Extensive experiments with various data scales and upcycling settings demonstrate the outstanding performance and data efficiency of UpIT, as well as stable improvement in expert or data scaling. Further analysis reveals the importance of ensuring expert diversity in upcycling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaobo Wang, Yantai Yang, Shuaiyu Zhang, Chenghao Sun, Weiya Li, Xuming Hu, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset reduction (DR) seeks to select or distill samples from large datasets into smaller subsets while preserving performance on target tasks. Existing methods primarily focus on pruning or synthesizing data in the same format as the original dataset, typically the input data and corresponding labels. However, in DR settings, we find it is possible to synthesize more information beyond the data-label pair as an additional learning target to facilitate model training. In this paper, we introduce Dataset Reduction Using Privileged Information (DRUPI), which enriches DR by synthesizing privileged information alongside the reduced dataset. This privileged information can take the form of feature labels or attention labels, providing auxiliary supervision to improve model learning. Our findings reveal that effective feature labels must balance between being overly discriminative and excessively diverse, with a moderate level proving optimal for improving the reduced dataset's efficacy. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that DRUPI integrates seamlessly with existing dataset reduction methods, offering significant performance gains.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01623">Fira: Can We Achieve Full-rank Training of LLMs Under Low-rank Constraint?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Chen, Kaituo Feng, Changsheng Li, Xunhao Lai, Xiangyu Yue, Ye Yuan, Guoren Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank training has emerged as a promising approach for reducing memory usage in training Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous methods either rely on decomposing weight matrices (e.g., LoRA), or seek to decompose gradient matrices (e.g., GaLore) to ensure reduced memory consumption. However, both of them constrain the training in a low-rank subspace, thus inevitably leading to sub-optimal performance. This raises a question: whether it is possible to consistently preserve the low-rank constraint for memory efficiency, while achieving full-rank training (i.e., training with full-rank gradients of full-rank weights) to avoid inferior outcomes? In this paper, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework for LLMs called Fira, as the first attempt to achieve this goal. First, we observe an interesting phenomenon during LLM training: the scaling impact of adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam) on the gradient norm remains similar from low-rank to full-rank training. Based on this observation, we propose a norm-based scaling method, which utilizes the scaling impact of low-rank optimizers as substitutes for that of original full-rank optimizers to enable full-rank training. In this way, we can preserve the low-rank constraint in the optimizer while achieving full-rank training for better performance. Moreover, we find that there are sudden gradient rises during the optimization process, potentially causing loss spikes. To address this, we further put forward a norm-growth limiter to smooth the gradient via regulating the relative increase of gradient norms. Extensive experiments on the pre-training and fine-tuning of LLMs show that Fira outperforms both LoRA and GaLore, achieving performance that is comparable to or even better than full-rank training.</p>

<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, accurate motion prediction is essential for safe and efficient motion planning. To ensure safety, planners must rely on reliable uncertainty information about the predicted future behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. This paper addresses the so-far neglected problem of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction. We adopt a holistic approach that focuses on uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the influence of model composition. Our method is based on a theoretically grounded information-theoretic approach to measure uncertainty, allowing us to decompose total uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset to assess how different model architectures and configurations affect uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qunzhong Wang, Xiangguo Sun, Hong Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, graph prompting has emerged as a promising research direction, enabling the learning of additional tokens or subgraphs appended to the original graphs without requiring retraining of pre-trained graph models across various applications. This novel paradigm, shifting from the traditional pretraining and finetuning to pretraining and prompting has shown significant empirical success in simulating graph data operations, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to biological networks and graph transferring. However, despite its potential, the theoretical underpinnings of graph prompting remain underexplored, raising critical questions about its fundamental effectiveness. The lack of rigorous theoretical proof of why and how much it works is more like a dark cloud over the graph prompt area to go further. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that rigorously analyzes graph prompting from a data operation perspective. Our contributions are threefold: First, we provide a formal guarantee theorem, demonstrating graph prompts capacity to approximate graph transformation operators, effectively linking upstream and downstream tasks. Second, we derive upper bounds on the error of these data operations by graph prompts for a single graph and extend this discussion to batches of graphs, which are common in graph model training. Third, we analyze the distribution of data operation errors, extending our theoretical findings from linear graph models (e.g., GCN) to non-linear graph models (e.g., GAT). Extensive experiments support our theoretical results and confirm the practical implications of these guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senmao Ye, Fei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation requires large amount of training data to synthesizing high-quality images. For augmenting training data, previous methods rely on data interpolations like cropping, flipping, and mixing up, which fail to introduce new information and yield only marginal improvements. In this paper, we propose a new data augmentation method for text-to-image generation using linear extrapolation. Specifically, we apply linear extrapolation only on text feature, and new image data are retrieved from the internet by search engines. For the reliability of new text-image pairs, we design two outlier detectors to purify retrieved images. Based on extrapolation, we construct training samples dozens of times larger than the original dataset, resulting in a significant improvement in text-to-image performance. Moreover, we propose a NULL-guidance to refine score estimation, and apply recurrent affine transformation to fuse text information. Our model achieves FID scores of 7.91, 9.52 and 5.00 on the CUB, Oxford and COCO datasets. The code and data will be available on GitHub (https://github.com/senmaoy/RAT-Diffusion).</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01639">Moral Alignment for LLM Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizaveta Tennant, Stephen Hailes, Mirco Musolesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are under way to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and the transparency of this will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital.
  The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents.
  We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brahma S. Pavse, Yudong Chen, Qiaomin Xie, Josiah P. Hanna</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning, offline value function learning is the procedure of using an offline dataset to estimate the expected discounted return from each state when taking actions according to a fixed target policy. The stability of this procedure, i.e., whether it converges to its fixed-point, critically depends on the representations of the state-action pairs. Poorly learned representations can make value function learning unstable, or even divergent. Therefore, it is critical to stabilize value function learning by explicitly shaping the state-action representations. Recently, the class of bisimulation-based algorithms have shown promise in shaping representations for control. However, it is still unclear if this class of methods can stabilize value function learning. In this work, we investigate this question and answer it affirmatively. We introduce a bisimulation-based algorithm called kernel representations for offline policy evaluation (KROPE). KROPE uses a kernel to shape state-action representations such that state-action pairs that have similar immediate rewards and lead to similar next state-action pairs under the target policy also have similar representations. We show that KROPE: 1) learns stable representations and 2) leads to lower value error than baselines. Our analysis provides new theoretical insight into the stability properties of bisimulation-based methods and suggests that practitioners can use these methods for stable and accurate evaluation of offline reinforcement learning agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Muschalik, Hubert Baniecki, Fabian Fumagalli, Patrick Kolpaczki, Barbara Hammer, Eyke H\"ullermeier</p>
<p>Abstract: Originally rooted in game theory, the Shapley Value (SV) has recently become an important tool in machine learning research. Perhaps most notably, it is used for feature attribution and data valuation in explainable artificial intelligence. Shapley Interactions (SIs) naturally extend the SV and address its limitations by assigning joint contributions to groups of entities, which enhance understanding of black box machine learning models. Due to the exponential complexity of computing SVs and SIs, various methods have been proposed that exploit structural assumptions or yield probabilistic estimates given limited resources. In this work, we introduce shapiq, an open-source Python package that unifies state-of-the-art algorithms to efficiently compute SVs and any-order SIs in an application-agnostic framework. Moreover, it includes a benchmarking suite containing 11 machine learning applications of SIs with pre-computed games and ground-truth values to systematically assess computational performance across domains. For practitioners, shapiq is able to explain and visualize any-order feature interactions in predictions of models, including vision transformers, language models, as well as XGBoost and LightGBM with TreeSHAP-IQ. With shapiq, we extend shap beyond feature attributions and consolidate the application of SVs and SIs in machine learning that facilitates future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Hu, Zhihao Teng, Wei Wu, Kewei Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, retrieval-based language models (RLMs) have received much attention. However, most of them leverage a pre-trained retriever with fixed parameters, which may not adapt well to causal language models. In this work, we propose Grouped Cross-Attention, a novel module enabling joint pre-training of the retriever and causal LM, and apply it to long-context modeling. For a given input sequence, we split it into chunks and use the current chunk to retrieve past chunks for subsequent text generation. Our innovation allows the retriever to learn how to retrieve past chunks that better minimize the auto-regressive loss of subsequent tokens in an end-to-end manner. By integrating top-$k$ retrieval, our model can be pre-trained efficiently from scratch with context lengths up to 64K tokens. Our experiments show our model, compared with long-range LM baselines, can achieve lower perplexity with comparable or lower pre-training and inference costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Klaus-Rudolf Kladny, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Michael Muehlebach</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models lack rigorous statistical guarantees for their outputs and are therefore unreliable in safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Sequential Conformal Prediction for Generative Models (SCOPE-Gen), a sequential conformal prediction method producing prediction sets that satisfy a rigorous statistical guarantee called conformal admissibility control. This guarantee states that with high probability, the prediction sets contain at least one admissible (or valid) example. To this end, our method first samples an initial set of i.i.d. examples from a black box generative model. Then, this set is iteratively pruned via so-called greedy filters. As a consequence of the iterative generation procedure, admissibility of the final prediction set factorizes as a Markov chain. This factorization is crucial, because it allows to control each factor separately, using conformal prediction. In comparison to prior work, our method demonstrates a large reduction in the number of admissibility evaluations during calibration. This reduction is important in safety-critical applications, where these evaluations must be conducted manually by domain experts and are therefore costly and time consuming. We highlight the advantages of our method in terms of admissibility evaluations and cardinality of the prediction sets through experiments in natural language generation and molecular graph extension tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Athira J Jacob, Indraneel Borgohain, Teodora Chitiboi, Puneet Sharma, Dorin Comaniciu, Daniel Rueckert</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), considered the gold standard for noninvasive cardiac assessment, is a diverse and complex modality requiring a wide variety of image processing tasks for comprehensive assessment of cardiac morphology and function. Advances in deep learning have enabled the development of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models for these tasks. However, model training is challenging due to data and label scarcity, especially in the less common imaging sequences. Moreover, each model is often trained for a specific task, with no connection between related tasks. In this work, we introduce a vision foundation model trained for CMR assessment, that is trained in a self-supervised fashion on 36 million CMR images. We then finetune the model in supervised way for 9 clinical tasks typical to a CMR workflow, across classification, segmentation, landmark localization, and pathology detection. We demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness across all tasks, over a range of available labeled dataset sizes. We also demonstrate improved few-shot learning with fewer labeled samples, a common challenge in medical image analyses. We achieve an out-of-box performance comparable to SoTA for most clinical tasks. The proposed method thus presents a resource-efficient, unified framework for CMR assessment, with the potential to accelerate the development of deep learning-based solutions for image analysis tasks, even with few annotated data available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing; however, they still face difficulties when tasked with understanding lengthy contexts and executing effective question answering. These challenges often arise due to the complexity and ambiguity present in longer texts. To enhance the performance of LLMs in such scenarios, we introduce the Long Question Coreference Adaptation (LQCA) method. This innovative framework focuses on coreference resolution tailored to long contexts, allowing the model to identify and manage references effectively. The LQCA method encompasses four key steps: resolving coreferences within sub-documents, computing the distances between mentions, defining a representative mention for coreference, and answering questions through mention replacement. By processing information systematically, the framework provides easier-to-handle partitions for LLMs, promoting better understanding. Experimental evaluations on a range of LLMs and datasets have yielded positive results, with a notable improvements on OpenAI-o1-mini and GPT-4o models, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging coreference resolution to bridge context gaps in question answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bennett Kleinberg, Jari Zegers, Jonas Festor, Stefana Vida, Julian Pr\"asent, Riccardo Loconte, Sanne Peereboom</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentiating between generated and human-written content is important for navigating the modern world. Large language models (LLMs) are crucial drivers behind the increased quality of computer-generated content. Reportedly, humans find it increasingly difficult to identify whether an AI model generated a piece of text. Our work tests how two important factors contribute to the human vs AI race: empathy and an incentive to appear human. We address both aspects in two experiments: human participants and a state-of-the-art LLM wrote relationship advice (Study 1, n=530) or mere descriptions (Study 2, n=610), either instructed to be as human as possible or not. New samples of humans (n=428 and n=408) then judged the texts' source. Our findings show that when empathy is required, humans excel. Contrary to expectations, instructions to appear human were only effective for the LLM, so the human advantage diminished. Computational text analysis revealed that LLMs become more human because they may have an implicit representation of what makes a text human and effortlessly apply these heuristics. The model resorts to a conversational, self-referential, informal tone with a simpler vocabulary to mimic stochastic empathy. We discuss these findings in light of recent claims on the on-par performance of LLMs.</p>

We build upon this body of work by studying the effect of the teachers' activation statistics, particularly the impact of the loss function on the resulting student model quality. We explore a standard toolkit of statistical normalization techniques to better align the different distributions and assess their effects. Further, we examine the impact on downstream teacher-matching metrics, which motivates the use of Hadamard matrices. With these matrices, we demonstrate useful properties, showing how they can be used for isotropic standardization, where each dimension of a multivariate distribution is standardized using the same scale. We call this technique "PHI Standardization" (PHI-S) and empirically demonstrate that it produces the best student model across the suite of methods studied.</p>

<p>Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the ability of neural networks to solve algorithmic tasks, such as arithmetic, summary statistics, and sorting. While state-of-the-art models like Transformers have demonstrated good generalization performance on in-distribution tasks, their out-of-distribution (OOD) performance is poor when trained end-to-end. In this paper, we focus on value generalization, a common instance of OOD generalization where the test distribution has the same input sequence length as the training distribution, but the value ranges in the training and test distributions do not necessarily overlap. To address this issue, we propose that using fixed positional encodings to determine attention weights-referred to as positional attention-enhances empirical OOD performance while maintaining expressivity. We support our claim about expressivity by proving that Transformers with positional attention can effectively simulate parallel algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated significant potential as the next-generation information access engines. However, their reliability is hindered by issues of hallucination and generating non-factual content. This is particularly problematic in long-form responses, where assessing and ensuring factual accuracy is complex. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing FactAlign, a novel alignment framework designed to enhance the factuality of LLMs' long-form responses while maintaining their helpfulness. We introduce fKTO, a fine-grained, sentence-level alignment algorithm that extends the Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) alignment method. Leveraging recent advances in automatic factuality evaluation, FactAlign utilizes fine-grained factuality assessments to guide the alignment process. Our experiments on open-domain prompts and information-seeking questions demonstrate that FactAlign significantly improves the factual accuracy of LLM responses while also improving their helpfulness. Further analyses identify that FactAlign is capable of training LLMs to provide more information without losing factual precision, thus improving the factual F1 score.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omayma Mahjoub, Sasha Abramowitz, Ruan de Kock, Wiem Khlifi, Simon du Toit, Jemma Daniel, Louay Ben Nessir, Louise Beyers, Claude Formanek, Liam Clark, Arnu Pretorius</p>
<p>Abstract: As the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) progresses towards larger and more complex environments, achieving strong performance while maintaining memory efficiency and scalability to many agents becomes increasingly important. Although recent research has led to several advanced algorithms, to date, none fully address all of these key properties simultaneously. In this work, we introduce Sable, a novel and theoretically sound algorithm that adapts the retention mechanism from Retentive Networks to MARL. Sable's retention-based sequence modelling architecture allows for computationally efficient scaling to a large number of agents, as well as maintaining a long temporal context, making it well-suited for large-scale partially observable environments. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in the majority of tasks (34 out of 45, roughly 75\%). Furthermore, Sable demonstrates stable performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage. Our results highlight Sable's performance and efficiency, positioning it as a leading approach to MARL at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longyu Feng, Mengze Hong, Chen Jason Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Batch prompting is a common technique in large language models (LLMs) used to process multiple inputs simultaneously, aiming to improve computational efficiency. However, as batch sizes increase, performance degradation often occurs due to the model's difficulty in handling lengthy context inputs. Existing methods that attempt to mitigate these issues rely solely on batch data arrangement and majority voting rather than improving the design of the batch prompt itself. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing "Auto-Demo Prompting," a novel approach that leverages the question-output pairs from earlier questions within a batch as demonstrations for subsequent answer inference. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of how Auto-Demo Prompting functions within the autoregressive generation process of LLMs, illustrating how it utilizes prior outputs to optimize the model's internal representations. Our method effectively bridges the gap between batch prompting and few-shot prompting, enhancing performance with only a slight compromise in token usage. Experimental results across five NLP tasks demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating performance degradation and occasionally outperforming single prompts. Furthermore, it opens new avenues for applying few-shot learning techniques, such as demonstration selection, within batch prompting, making it a robust solution for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunghwan Kim, Dongjin Kang, Taeyoon Kwon, Hyungjoo Chae, Jungsoo Won, Dongha Lee, Jinyoung Yeo</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models are key in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) systems, aligning the model behavior with human preferences. Particularly in the math domain, there have been plenty of studies using reward models to align policies for improving reasoning capabilities. Recently, as the importance of reward models has been emphasized, RewardBench is proposed to understand their behavior. However, we figure out that the math subset of RewardBench has different representations between chosen and rejected completions, and relies on a single comparison, which may lead to unreliable results as it only see an isolated case. Therefore, it fails to accurately present the robustness of reward models, leading to a misunderstanding of its performance and potentially resulting in reward hacking. In this work, we introduce a new design for reliable evaluation of reward models, and to validate this, we construct RewardMATH, a benchmark that effectively represents the robustness of reward models in mathematical reasoning tasks. We demonstrate that the scores on RewardMATH strongly correlate with the results of optimized policy and effectively estimate reward overoptimization, whereas the existing benchmark shows almost no correlation. The results underscore the potential of our design to enhance the reliability of evaluation, and represent the robustness of reward model. We make our code and data publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kailai Feng, Yabo Zhang, Haodong Yu, Zhilong Ji, Jinfeng Bai, Hongzhi Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Artistic typography is a technique to visualize the meaning of input character in an imaginable and readable manner. With powerful text-to-image diffusion models, existing methods directly design the overall geometry and texture of input character, making it challenging to ensure both creativity and legibility. In this paper, we introduce a dual-branch and training-free method, namely VitaGlyph, enabling flexible artistic typography along with controllable geometry change to maintain the readability. The key insight of VitaGlyph is to treat input character as a scene composed of Subject and Surrounding, followed by rendering them under varying degrees of geometry transformation. The subject flexibly expresses the essential concept of input character, while the surrounding enriches relevant background without altering the shape. Specifically, we implement VitaGlyph through a three-phase framework: (i) Knowledge Acquisition leverages large language models to design text descriptions of subject and surrounding. (ii) Regional decomposition detects the part that most matches the subject description and divides input glyph image into subject and surrounding regions. (iii) Typography Stylization firstly refines the structure of subject region via Semantic Typography, and then separately renders the textures of Subject and Surrounding regions through Controllable Compositional Generation. Experimental results demonstrate that VitaGlyph not only achieves better artistry and readability, but also manages to depict multiple customize concepts, facilitating more creative and pleasing artistic typography generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yebowen Hu, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenlin Yao, Yiming Lu, Daoan Zhang, Hassan Foroosh, Dong Yu, Fei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are ideal for decision-making due to their ability to reason over long contexts and identify critical factors. However, challenges arise when processing transcripts of spoken speech describing complex scenarios. These transcripts often contain ungrammatical or incomplete sentences, repetitions, hedging, and vagueness. For example, during a company's earnings call, an executive might project a positive revenue outlook to reassure investors, despite significant uncertainty regarding future earnings. It is crucial for LLMs to incorporate this uncertainty systematically when making decisions. In this paper, we introduce DeFine, a new framework that constructs probabilistic factor profiles from complex scenarios. DeFine then integrates these profiles with analogical reasoning, leveraging insights from similar past experiences to guide LLMs in making critical decisions in novel situations. Our framework separates the tasks of quantifying uncertainty in complex scenarios and incorporating it into LLM decision-making. This approach is particularly useful in fields such as medical consultations, negotiations, and political debates, where making decisions under uncertainty is vital.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuandong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables analytical construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGO (Composing Global Optimizers). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of monomial potentials, which are ring homomorphism, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global optimizers constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that over-parameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global optimizers such as perfect memorization are unfavorable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayekh Bin Islam, Md Asib Rahman, K S M Tozammel Hossain, Enamul Hoque, Shafiq Joty, Md Rizwan Parvez</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been shown to enhance the factual accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs), but existing methods often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities in effectively using the retrieved evidence, particularly when using open-source LLMs. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a novel framework, Open-RAG, designed to enhance reasoning capabilities in RAG with open-source LLMs. Our framework transforms an arbitrary dense LLM into a parameter-efficient sparse mixture of experts (MoE) model capable of handling complex reasoning tasks, including both single- and multi-hop queries. Open-RAG uniquely trains the model to navigate challenging distractors that appear relevant but are misleading. As a result, Open-RAG leverages latent learning, dynamically selecting relevant experts and integrating external knowledge effectively for more accurate and contextually relevant responses. In addition, we propose a hybrid adaptive retrieval method to determine retrieval necessity and balance the trade-off between performance gain and inference speed. Experimental results show that the Llama2-7B-based Open-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and RAG models such as ChatGPT, Self-RAG, and Command R+ in various knowledge-intensive tasks.

<p>Abstract: Coding assistants are increasingly leveraged in game design, both generating code and making high-level plans. To what degree can these tools align with developer workflows, and what new modes of human-computer interaction can emerge from their use? We present DreamGarden, an AI system capable of assisting with the development of diverse game environments in Unreal Engine. At the core of our method is an LLM-driven planner, capable of breaking down a single, high-level prompt -- a dream, memory, or imagined scenario provided by a human user -- into a hierarchical action plan, which is then distributed across specialized submodules facilitating concrete implementation. This system is presented to the user as a garden of plans and actions, both growing independently and responding to user intervention via seed prompts, pruning, and feedback. Through a user study, we explore design implications of this system, charting courses for future work in semi-autonomous assistants and open-ended simulation design.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01792">When a language model is optimized for reasoning, does it still show embers of autoregression? An analysis of OpenAI o1</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> R. Thomas McCoy, Shunyu Yao, Dan Friedman, Mathew D. Hardy, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>
<p>Abstract: In "Embers of Autoregression" (McCoy et al., 2023), we showed that several large language models (LLMs) have some important limitations that are attributable to their origins in next-word prediction. Here we investigate whether these issues persist with o1, a new system from OpenAI that differs from previous LLMs in that it is optimized for reasoning. We find that o1 substantially outperforms previous LLMs in many cases, with particularly large improvements on rare variants of common tasks (e.g., forming acronyms from the second letter of each word in a list, rather than the first letter). Despite these quantitative improvements, however, o1 still displays the same qualitative trends that we observed in previous systems. Specifically, o1 - like previous LLMs - is sensitive to the probability of examples and tasks, performing better and requiring fewer "thinking tokens" in high-probability settings than in low-probability ones. These results show that optimizing a language model for reasoning can mitigate but might not fully overcome the language model's probability sensitivity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishi Veerapaneni, Muhammad Suhail Saleem, Jiaoyang Li, Maxim Likhachev</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods try to compute entire start-goal paths which are collision free. However, computing an entire path can take too long for MAPF systems where agents need to replan fast. Methods that address this typically employ a "windowed" approach and only try to find collision free paths for a small windowed timestep horizon. This adaptation comes at the cost of incompleteness; all current windowed approaches can become stuck in deadlock or livelock. Our main contribution is to introduce our framework, WinC-MAPF, for Windowed MAPF that enables completeness. Our framework uses heuristic update insights from single-agent real-time heuristic search algorithms as well as agent independence ideas from MAPF algorithms. We also develop Single-Step CBS (SS-CBS), an instantiation of this framework using a novel modification to CBS. We show how SS-CBS, which only plans a single step and updates heuristics, can effectively solve tough scenarios where existing windowed approaches fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Zhang, Yuanhao Wang, Francisco Vicente Carrasco, Chenglei Wu, Jinlong Yang, Thabo Beeler, Fernando De la Torre</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce FabricDiffusion, a method for transferring fabric textures from a single clothing image to 3D garments of arbitrary shapes. Existing approaches typically synthesize textures on the garment surface through 2D-to-3D texture mapping or depth-aware inpainting via generative models. Unfortunately, these methods often struggle to capture and preserve texture details, particularly due to challenging occlusions, distortions, or poses in the input image. Inspired by the observation that in the fashion industry, most garments are constructed by stitching sewing patterns with flat, repeatable textures, we cast the task of clothing texture transfer as extracting distortion-free, tileable texture materials that are subsequently mapped onto the UV space of the garment. Building upon this insight, we train a denoising diffusion model with a large-scale synthetic dataset to rectify distortions in the input texture image. This process yields a flat texture map that enables a tight coupling with existing Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) material generation pipelines, allowing for realistic relighting of the garment under various lighting conditions. We show that FabricDiffusion can transfer various features from a single clothing image including texture patterns, material properties, and detailed prints and logos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-to-the-art methods on both synthetic data and real-world, in-the-wild clothing images while generalizing to unseen textures and garment shapes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mattia Segu, Luigi Piccinelli, Siyuan Li, Yung-Hsu Yang, Bernt Schiele, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple object tracking in complex scenarios - such as coordinated dance performances, team sports, or dynamic animal groups - presents unique challenges. In these settings, objects frequently move in coordinated patterns, occlude each other, and exhibit long-term dependencies in their trajectories. However, it remains a key open research question on how to model long-range dependencies within tracklets, interdependencies among tracklets, and the associated temporal occlusions. To this end, we introduce Samba, a novel linear-time set-of-sequences model designed to jointly process multiple tracklets by synchronizing the multiple selective state-spaces used to model each tracklet. Samba autoregressively predicts the future track query for each sequence while maintaining synchronized long-term memory representations across tracklets. By integrating Samba into a tracking-by-propagation framework, we propose SambaMOTR, the first tracker effectively addressing the aforementioned issues, including long-range dependencies, tracklet interdependencies, and temporal occlusions. Additionally, we introduce an effective technique for dealing with uncertain observations (MaskObs) and an efficient training recipe to scale SambaMOTR to longer sequences. By modeling long-range dependencies and interactions among tracked objects, SambaMOTR implicitly learns to track objects accurately through occlusions without any hand-crafted heuristics. Our approach significantly surpasses prior state-of-the-art on the DanceTrack, BFT, and SportsMOT datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Strategies for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) typically require memory. One way to represent this memory is via automata. We present a method to learn an automaton representation of a strategy using a modification of the L*-algorithm. Compared to the tabular representation of a strategy, the resulting automaton is dramatically smaller and thus also more explainable. Moreover, in the learning process, our heuristics may even improve the strategy's performance. In contrast to approaches that synthesize an automaton directly from the POMDP thereby solving it, our approach is incomparably more scalable.</p>

<p>Abstract: General virtual agents need to handle multimodal observations, master complex action spaces, and self-improve in dynamic, open-domain environments. However, existing environments are often domain-specific and require complex setups, which limits agent development and evaluation in real-world settings. As a result, current evaluations lack in-depth analyses that decompose fundamental agent capabilities. We introduce AgentStudio, a trinity of environments, tools, and benchmarks to address these issues. AgentStudio provides a lightweight, interactive environment with highly generic observation and action spaces, e.g., video observations and GUI/API actions. It integrates tools for creating online benchmark tasks, annotating GUI elements, and labeling actions in videos. Based on our environment and tools, we curate an online task suite that benchmarks both GUI interactions and function calling with efficient auto-evaluation. We also reorganize existing datasets and collect new ones using our tools to establish three datasets: GroundUI, IDMBench, and CriticBench. These datasets evaluate fundamental agent abilities, including GUI grounding, learning from videos, and success detection, pointing to the desiderata for robust, general, and open-ended virtual agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning high-quality multi-modal entity representations is an important goal of multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) representation learning, which can enhance reasoning tasks within the MMKGs, such as MMKG completion (MMKGC). The main challenge is to collaboratively model the structural information concealed in massive triples and the multi-modal features of the entities. Existing methods focus on crafting elegant entity-wise multi-modal fusion strategies, yet they overlook the utilization of multi-perspective features concealed within the modalities under diverse relational contexts. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework with Mixture of Modality Knowledge experts (MoMoK for short) to learn adaptive multi-modal entity representations for better MMKGC. We design relation-guided modality knowledge experts to acquire relation-aware modality embeddings and integrate the predictions from multi-modalities to achieve joint decisions. Additionally, we disentangle the experts by minimizing their mutual information. Experiments on four public MMKG benchmarks demonstrate the outstanding performance of MoMoK under complex scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, enabling them to solve various complex problems. Recently, this ability has been applied to the paradigm of tool learning. Tool learning involves providing examples of tool usage and their corresponding functions, allowing LLMs to formulate plans and demonstrate the process of invoking and executing each tool. LLMs can address tasks that they cannot complete independently, thereby enhancing their potential across different tasks. However, this approach faces two key challenges. First, redundant error correction leads to unstable planning and long execution time. Additionally, designing a correct plan among multiple tools is also a challenge in tool learning. To address these issues, we propose Tool-Planner, a task-processing framework based on toolkits. Tool-Planner groups tools based on the API functions with the same function into a toolkit and allows LLMs to implement planning across the various toolkits. When a tool error occurs, the language model can reselect and adjust tools based on the toolkit. Experiments show that our approach demonstrates a high pass and win rate across different datasets and optimizes the planning scheme for tool learning in models such as GPT-4 and Claude 3, showcasing the potential of our method.

<p>Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence techniques, transportation system optimization is evolving from traditional methods relying on expert experience to simulation and learning-based decision and optimization methods. Learning-based optimization methods require extensive interactions with highly realistic microscopic traffic simulators. However, existing microscopic traffic simulators are inefficient in large-scale scenarios and thus fail to support the adoption of these methods in large-scale transportation system optimization scenarios. In addition, the optimization scenarios supported by existing simulators are limited, mainly focusing on the traffic signal control. To address these challenges, we propose the first open-source GPU-accelerated large-scale microscopic simulator for transportation system simulation and optimization. The simulator can iterate at 84.09Hz, which achieves 88.92 times computational acceleration in the large-scale scenario with 2,464,950 vehicles compared to the best baseline CityFlow. Besides, it achieves a more realistic average road speeds simulated on real datasets by adopting the IDM model as the car-following model and the randomized MOBIL model as the lane-changing model. Based on it, we implement a set of microscopic and macroscopic controllable objects and metrics provided by Python API to support typical transportation system optimization scenarios. We choose five representative scenarios and benchmark classical rule-based algorithms, reinforcement learning algorithms, and black-box optimization algorithms in four cities. These experiments effectively demonstrate the usability of the simulator for large-scale traffic system optimization.

We prove that although LLMs can faithfully follow such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can mislead even idealized, theoretically constructed models. Empirically, we find that the reasoning behavior of LLMs aligns with that of our theoretical constructions, and popular attack algorithms find adversarial prompts with characteristics predicted by our theory. Our logic-based framework provides a novel perspective for mechanistically understanding the behavior of LLMs in rule-based settings such as jailbreak attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyu He, Mian Zhang, Shuo Yan, Peilin Wu, Zhiyu Zoey Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have been thoroughly evaluated for deductive and inductive reasoning, their proficiency in abductive reasoning and holistic rule learning in interactive environments remains less explored. We introduce RULEARN, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess the rule-learning abilities of LLM agents in interactive settings. In RULEARN, agents strategically interact with simulated environments to gather observations, discern patterns, and solve complex problems. To enhance the rule-learning capabilities for LLM agents, we propose IDEA, a novel reasoning framework that integrates the process of Induction, Deduction, and Abduction. The IDEA agent generates initial hypotheses from limited observations through abduction, devises plans to validate these hypotheses or leverages them to solve problems via deduction, and refines previous hypotheses using patterns identified from new observations through induction, dynamically establishing and applying rules that mimic human rule-learning behaviors. Our evaluation of the IDEA framework, which involves five representative LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline. Furthermore, within this framework, our comparison with 50 human participants reveals notable discrepancies in rule-learning behaviors. LLM agents tend to generate plausible initial hypotheses but struggle to refine them through interaction. Conversely, humans, despite sometimes overlooking initial details, excel at incorporating feedback and continuously improving their hypotheses. We believe our benchmark, RULEARN, will serve as a valuable and challenging resource, and that the IDEA framework will provide crucial insights for the development of LLM agents capable of human-like rule learning in real-world scenarios. We will release our code and data upon acceptance of the paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malte Luttermann, Ralf M\"oller, Mattis Hartwig</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic relational models provide a well-established formalism to combine first-order logic and probabilistic models, thereby allowing to represent relationships between objects in a relational domain. At the same time, the field of artificial intelligence requires increasingly large amounts of relational training data for various machine learning tasks. Collecting real-world data, however, is often challenging due to privacy concerns, data protection regulations, high costs, and so on. To mitigate these challenges, the generation of synthetic data is a promising approach. In this paper, we solve the problem of generating synthetic relational data via probabilistic relational models. In particular, we propose a fully-fledged pipeline to go from relational database to probabilistic relational model, which can then be used to sample new synthetic relational data points from its underlying probability distribution. As part of our proposed pipeline, we introduce a learning algorithm to construct a probabilistic relational model from a given relational database.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter David Fagan, Subramanian Ramamoorthy</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a useful paradigm for training policies that solve tasks involving complex motions, such as those encountered in robotic manipulation. In practice, the successful application of LfD requires overcoming error accumulation during policy execution, i.e. the problem of drift due to errors compounding over time and the consequent out-of-distribution behaviours. Existing works seek to address this problem through scaling data collection, correcting policy errors with a human-in-the-loop, temporally ensembling policy predictions or through learning a dynamical system model with convergence guarantees. In this work, we propose and validate an alternative approach to overcoming this issue. Inspired by reservoir computing, we develop a recurrent neural network layer that includes a fixed nonlinear dynamical system with tunable dynamical properties for modelling temporal dynamics. We validate the efficacy of our neural network layer on the task of reproducing human handwriting motions using the LASA Human Handwriting Dataset. Through empirical experiments we demonstrate that incorporating our layer into existing neural network architectures addresses the issue of compounding errors in LfD. Furthermore, we perform a comparative evaluation against existing approaches including a temporal ensemble of policy predictions and an Echo State Network (ESN) implementation. We find that our approach yields greater policy precision and robustness on the handwriting task while also generalising to multiple dynamics regimes and maintaining competitive latency scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Said Donmez, Onur Unlu, Muhammed O. Sayin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a new family of logit-Q dynamics for efficient learning in stochastic games by combining the log-linear learning (also known as logit dynamics) for the repeated play of normal-form games with Q-learning for unknown Markov decision processes within the auxiliary stage-game framework. In this framework, we view stochastic games as agents repeatedly playing some stage game associated with the current state of the underlying game while the agents' Q-functions determine the payoffs of these stage games. We show that the logit-Q dynamics presented reach (near) efficient equilibrium in stochastic teams with unknown dynamics and quantify the approximation error. We also show the rationality of the logit-Q dynamics against agents following pure stationary strategies and the convergence of the dynamics in stochastic games where the stage-payoffs induce potential games, yet only a single agent controls the state transitions beyond stochastic teams. The key idea is to approximate the dynamics with a fictional scenario where the Q-function estimates are stationary over epochs whose lengths grow at a sufficiently slow rate. We then couple the dynamics in the main and fictional scenarios to show that these two scenarios become more and more similar across epochs due to the vanishing step size and growing epoch lengths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanting Xie, Tianyi Zhang, Kedi Xu, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Yonatan Bisk</p>
<p>Abstract: Robots should exist anywhere humans do: indoors, outdoors, and even unmapped environments. In contrast, the focus of recent advancements in Object Goal Navigation(OGN) has targeted navigating in indoor environments by leveraging spatial and semantic cues that do not generalize outdoors. While these contributions provide valuable insights into indoor scenarios, the broader spectrum of real-world robotic applications often extends to outdoor settings. As we transition to the vast and complex terrains of outdoor environments, new challenges emerge. Unlike the structured layouts found indoors, outdoor environments lack clear spatial delineations and are riddled with inherent semantic ambiguities. Despite this, humans navigate with ease because we can reason about the unseen. We introduce a new task OUTDOOR, a new mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately hallucinate possible futures, and a new computationally aware success metric for pushing research forward in this more complex domain. Additionally, we show impressive results on both a simulated drone and physical quadruped in outdoor environments. Our agent has no premapping and our formalism outperforms naive LLM-based approaches</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilmazcan Ozyurt, Stefan Feuerriegel, Ce Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Document-level relation extraction aims at inferring structured human knowledge from textual documents. State-of-the-art methods for this task use pre-trained language models (LMs) via fine-tuning, yet fine-tuning is computationally expensive and cannot adapt to new relation types or new LMs. As a remedy, we leverage the generalization capabilities of pre-trained LMs and present a novel framework for document-level in-context few-shot relation extraction. Our framework has three strengths: it eliminates the need (1) for named entity recognition and (2) for human annotations of documents, and (3) it can be updated to new LMs without re-training. We evaluate our framework using DocRED, the largest publicly available dataset for document-level relation extraction, and demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further show that our framework actually performs much better than the original labels from the development set of DocRED. Finally, we conduct an extensive benchmark demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework, achieving state-of-the-art results across six relation extraction datasets and outperforming more than 30 baseline methods. Unlike our framework, the baseline methods have large computational overhead (e.g., from fine-tuning). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to reformulate the document-level relation extraction task as a tailored in-context few-shot learning paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizhou Wang, Guansong Pang, Mahsa Salehi, Xiaokun Xia, Christopher Leckie</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper considers an important Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) task, namely open-set GAD, which aims to train a detection model using a small number of normal and anomaly nodes (referred to as seen anomalies) to detect both seen anomalies and unseen anomalies (i.e., anomalies that cannot be illustrated the training anomalies). Those labelled training data provide crucial prior knowledge about abnormalities for GAD models, enabling substantially reduced detection errors. However, current supervised GAD methods tend to over-emphasise fitting the seen anomalies, leading to many errors of detecting the unseen anomalies as normal nodes. Further, existing open-set AD models were introduced to handle Euclidean data, failing to effectively capture discriminative features from graph structure and node attributes for GAD. In this work, we propose a novel open-set GAD approach, namely normal structure regularisation (NSReg), to achieve generalised detection ability to unseen anomalies, while maintaining its effectiveness on detecting seen anomalies. The key idea in NSReg is to introduce a regularisation term that enforces the learning of compact, semantically-rich representations of normal nodes based on their structural relations to other nodes. When being optimised with supervised anomaly detection losses, the regularisation term helps incorporate strong normality into the modelling, and thus, it effectively avoids over-fitting the seen anomalies and learns a better normality decision boundary, largely reducing the false negatives of detecting unseen anomalies as normal. Extensive empirical results on seven real-world datasets show that NSReg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 14% AUC-ROC on the unseen anomaly classes and by 10% AUC-ROC on all anomaly classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonghai Yao, Nandyala Siddharth Kantu, Guanghao Wei, Hieu Tran, Zhangqi Duan, Sunjae Kwon, Zhichao Yang, README annotation team, Hong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement in healthcare has shifted focus toward patient-centric approaches, particularly in self-care and patient education, facilitated by access to Electronic Health Records (EHR). However, medical jargon in EHRs poses significant challenges in patient comprehension. To address this, we introduce a new task of automatically generating lay definitions, aiming to simplify complex medical terms into patient-friendly lay language. We first created the README dataset, an extensive collection of over 50,000 unique (medical term, lay definition) pairs and 300,000 mentions, each offering context-aware lay definitions manually annotated by domain experts. We have also engineered a data-centric Human-AI pipeline that synergizes data filtering, augmentation, and selection to improve data quality. We then used README as the training data for models and leveraged a Retrieval-Augmented Generation method to reduce hallucinations and improve the quality of model outputs. Our extensive automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that open-source mobile-friendly models, when fine-tuned with high-quality data, are capable of matching or even surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art closed-source large language models like ChatGPT. This research represents a significant stride in closing the knowledge gap in patient education and advancing patient-centric healthcare solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Wan, Wenxuan Wang, Yiliu Yang, Youliang Yuan, Jen-tse Huang, Pinjia He, Wenxiang Jiao, Michael R. Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce LogicAsker, a novel approach for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. Despite LLMs' prowess in tasks like writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation, assessing their ability to reason has been challenging. Traditional evaluations often prioritize accuracy on downstream tasks over direct assessments of reasoning processes. LogicAsker addresses this gap by employing a set of atomic reasoning skills grounded in propositional and predicate logic to systematically examine and improve the reasoning prowess of LLMs. Our methodology reveals significant gaps in LLMs' learning of logical rules, with identified reasoning failures ranging from 29\% to 90\% across different models. Moreover, we leverage these findings to construct targeted demonstration examples and fine-tune data, notably enhancing logical reasoning in models like GPT-4o by up to 5\%. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to utilize test case outcomes to effectively refine LLMs' formal reasoning capabilities. We make our code, data, and results publicly available (https://github.com/yxwan123/LogicAsker) to facilitate further research and replication of our findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the first mini-batch algorithm for maximizing a non-negative monotone decomposable submodular function, $F=\sum_{i=1}^N f^i$, under a set of constraints. We consider two sampling approaches: uniform and weighted. We first show that mini-batch with weighted sampling improves over the state of the art sparsifier based approach both in theory and in practice.
  Surprisingly, our experimental results show that uniform sampling is superior to weighted sampling. However, it is impossible to explain this using worst-case analysis. Our main contribution is using smoothed analysis to provide a theoretical foundation for our experimental results. We show that, under very mild assumptions, uniform sampling is superior for both the mini-batch and the sparsifier approaches. We empirically verify that these assumptions hold for our datasets. Uniform sampling is simple to implement and has complexity independent of $N$, making it the perfect candidate to tackle massive real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Mohammadshahi, Arshad Rafiq Shaikh, Majid Yazdani</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs with superior response quality--particularly larger or closed-source models--often come with higher inference costs, making their deployment inefficient and costly. Meanwhile, developing foundational LLMs from scratch is becoming increasingly resource-intensive and impractical for many applications. To address the challenge of balancing quality and cost, we introduce Routoo, an architecture designed to optimize the selection of LLMs for specific prompts based on performance, cost, and efficiency. Routoo provides controllability over the trade-off between inference cost and quality, enabling significant reductions in inference costs for a given quality requirement. Routoo comprises two key components: a performance predictor and cost-aware selector. The performance predictor is a lightweight LLM that estimates the expected performance of various underlying LLMs on a given prompt without executing them. The cost-aware selector module then selects the most suitable model based on these predictions and constraints such as cost and latency, significantly reducing inference costs for the same quality. We evaluated Routoo using the MMLU benchmark across 57 domains employing open-source models. Our results show that Routoo matches the performance of the Mixtral 8x7b model while reducing inference costs by one-third. Additionally, by allowing increased costs, Routoo surpasses Mixtral's accuracy by over 5% at equivalent costs, achieving an accuracy of 75.9%. When integrating GPT4 into our model pool, Routoo nearly matches GPT4's performance at half the cost and exceeds it with a 25% cost reduction. These outcomes highlight Routoo's potential to significantly reduce inference costs without compromising quality, and even to establish new state-of-the-art results by leveraging the collective capabilities of multiple LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The execution of graph algorithms using neural networks has recently attracted significant interest due to promising empirical progress. This motivates further understanding of how neural networks can replicate reasoning steps with relational data. In this work, we study the ability of transformer networks to simulate algorithms on graphs from a theoretical perspective. The architecture we use is a looped transformer with extra attention heads that interact with the graph. We prove by construction that this architecture can simulate individual algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path, Breadth- and Depth-First Search, and Kosaraju's strongly connected components, as well as multiple algorithms simultaneously. The number of parameters in the networks does not increase with the input graph size, which implies that the networks can simulate the above algorithms for any graph. Despite this property, we show a limit to simulation in our solution due to finite precision. Finally, we show a Turing Completeness result with constant width when the extra attention heads are utilized.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohan Tang, Zexi Liu, Keyue Jiang, Siheng Chen, Xiaowen Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypergraphs are crucial for modelling higher-order interactions in real-world data. Hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively utilise these structures by message passing to generate informative node features for various downstream tasks like node classification. However, the message passing module in existing HNNs typically requires a computationally intensive training process, which limits their practical use. To tackle this challenge, we propose an alternative approach by decoupling the usage of hypergraph structural information from the model learning stage. This leads to a novel training-free message passing module, named TF-MP-Module, which can be precomputed in the data preprocessing stage, thereby reducing the computational burden. We refer to the hypergraph neural network equipped with our TF-MP-Module as TF-HNN. We theoretically support the efficiency and effectiveness of TF-HNN by showing that: 1) It is more training-efficient compared to existing HNNs; 2) It utilises as much information as existing HNNs for node feature generation; and 3) It is robust against the oversmoothing issue while using long-range interactions. Experiments based on seven real-world hypergraph benchmarks in node classification and hyperlink prediction show that, compared to state-of-the-art HNNs, TF-HNN exhibits both competitive performance and superior training efficiency. Specifically, on the large-scale benchmark, Trivago, TF-HNN outperforms the node classification accuracy of the best baseline by 10% with just 1% of the training time of that baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Cheng, Markos Georgopoulos, Volkan Cevher, Grigorios G. Chrysos</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to Jailbreaking attacks, which aim to extract harmful information by subtly modifying the attack query. As defense mechanisms evolve, directly obtaining harmful information becomes increasingly challenging for Jailbreaking attacks. In this work, inspired from Chomsky's transformational-generative grammar theory and human practices of indirect context to elicit harmful information, we focus on a new attack form, called Contextual Interaction Attack. We contend that the prior context\u2014the information preceding the attack query\u2014plays a pivotal role in enabling strong Jailbreaking attacks. Specifically, we propose a first multi-turn approach that leverages benign preliminary questions to interact with the LLM. Due to the autoregressive nature of LLMs, which use previous conversation rounds as context during generation, we guide the model's question-response pair to construct a context that is semantically aligned with the attack query to execute the attack. We conduct experiments on seven different LLMs and demonstrate the efficacy of this attack, which is black-box and can also transfer across LLMs. We believe this can lead to further developments and understanding of security in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Doostmohammadi, Oskar Holmstr\"om, Marco Kuhlmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Work on instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has used automatic methods based on text overlap and LLM judgments as cost-effective alternatives to human evaluation. In this paper, we perform a meta-evaluation of such methods and assess their reliability across a broad range of tasks. In evaluating how well automatic methods align with human evaluations, correlation metrics are the most commonly employed method despite their inherent limitations when dealing with ties and different scales. To address these shortcomings, we use Pairwise Accuracy as an alternative to standard correlation measures. We observe that while automatic evaluation methods can approximate human ratings under specific conditions, their validity is highly context-dependent. Specifically, the simple ROUGE-L metric correlates very well with human ratings for short-answer English tasks but is unreliable in free-form generation tasks and cross-lingual scenarios. The effectiveness of the more advanced method of using GPT-4 as a judge diminishes significantly if reference answers are not included in the prompt, which is the scenario where this method has the potential to provide the most value compared to other metrics. Our findings enhance the understanding of how automatic methods should be applied and interpreted when developing and evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite their success at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, large language models still struggle to effectively leverage knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks, manifesting limitations such as generating incomplete, non-factual, or illogical answers. These limitations stem from inadequate knowledge awareness of LLMs during vanilla fine-tuning. To address these problems, we propose a knowledge-aware fine-tuning (KnowTuning) method to improve fine-grained and coarse-grained knowledge awareness of LLMs. We devise a fine-grained knowledge augmentation stage to train LLMs to identify difficult fine-grained knowledge in answers. We also propose a coarse-grained knowledge comparison stage to train LLMs to distinguish between reliable and unreliable knowledge, in three aspects: completeness, factuality, and logicality. Extensive experiments on both generic and medical question answering (QA) datasets confirm the effectiveness of KnowTuning, through automatic and human evaluations, across various sizes of LLMs. We further verify that KnowTuning generates more facts with less factual error rate under fine-grained facts evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: A successful negotiation requires a range of capabilities, including comprehension of the conversation context, Theory-of-Mind (ToM) skills to infer the partner's motives, strategic reasoning, and effective communication, making it challenging for automated systems. Despite the remarkable performance of LLMs in various NLP tasks, there is no systematic evaluation of their capabilities in negotiation. Such an evaluation is critical for advancing AI negotiation agents and negotiation research, ranging from designing dialogue systems to providing pedagogical feedback and scaling up data collection practices. This work aims to systematically analyze the multifaceted capabilities of LLMs across diverse dialogue scenarios throughout the stages of a typical negotiation interaction. Our analysis highlights GPT-4's superior performance in many tasks while identifying specific challenges, such as making subjective assessments and generating contextually appropriate, strategically advantageous responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Kundu</p>
<p>Abstract: A significant hurdle in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is identifying functional quantum circuits. These circuits must also adhere to the constraints imposed by current quantum hardware limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), a class of quantum-classical optimization algorithms, were developed to address these challenges in the currently available quantum devices. However, the overall performance of VQAs depends on the initialization strategy of the variational circuit, the structure of the circuit (also known as ansatz), and the configuration of the cost function. Focusing on the structure of the circuit, in this thesis, we improve the performance of VQAs by automating the search for an optimal structure for the variational circuits using reinforcement learning (RL). Within the thesis, the optimality of a circuit is determined by evaluating its depth, the overall count of gates and parameters, and its accuracy in solving the given problem. The task of automating the search for optimal quantum circuits is known as quantum architecture search (QAS). The majority of research in QAS is primarily focused on a noiseless scenario. Yet, the impact of noise on the QAS remains inadequately explored. In this thesis, we tackle the issue by introducing a tensor-based quantum circuit encoding, restrictions on environment dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, an episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, a double deep Q-network (DDQN) with an $\epsilon$-greedy policy for better stability. The numerical experiments on noiseless and noisy quantum hardware show that in dealing with various VQAs, our RL-based QAS outperforms existing QAS. Meanwhile, the methods we propose in the thesis can be readily adapted to address a wide range of other VQAs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen an explosive increase in research on large language models (LLMs), and accompanying public engagement on the topic. While starting as a niche area within natural language processing, LLMs have shown remarkable potential across a broad range of applications and domains, including games. This paper surveys the current state of the art across the various applications of LLMs in and for games, and identifies the different roles LLMs can take within a game. Importantly, we discuss underexplored areas and promising directions for future uses of LLMs in games and we reconcile the potential and limitations of LLMs within the games domain. As the first comprehensive survey and roadmap at the intersection of LLMs and games, we are hopeful that this paper will serve as the basis for groundbreaking research and innovation in this exciting new field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiju Guo, Ganqu Cui, Lifan Yuan, Ning Ding, Zexu Sun, Bowen Sun, Huimin Chen, Ruobing Xie, Jie Zhou, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Alignment in artificial intelligence pursues the consistency between model responses and human preferences as well as values. In practice, the multifaceted nature of human preferences inadvertently introduces what is known as the "alignment tax" -a compromise where enhancements in alignment within one objective (e.g.,harmlessness) can diminish performance in others (e.g.,helpfulness). However, existing alignment techniques are mostly unidirectional, leading to suboptimal trade-offs and poor flexibility over various objectives. To navigate this challenge, we argue the prominence of grounding LLMs with evident preferences. We introduce controllable preference optimization (CPO), which explicitly specifies preference scores for different objectives, thereby guiding the model to generate responses that meet the requirements. Our experimental analysis reveals that the aligned models can provide responses that match various preferences among the "3H" (helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness) desiderata. Furthermore, by introducing diverse data and alignment goals, we surpass baseline methods in aligning with single objectives, hence mitigating the impact of the alignment tax and achieving Pareto improvements in multi-objective alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kartik Chandra, Katherine M. Collins, Will Crichton, Tony Chen, Tzu-Mao Li, Adrian Weller, Rachit Nigam, Joshua Tenenbaum, Jonathan Ragan-Kelley</p>
<p>Abstract: Often, a good explanation for a program's unexpected behavior is a bug in the programmer's code. But sometimes, an even better explanation is a bug in the programmer's mental model of the language or API they are using. Instead of merely debugging our current code ("giving the programmer a fish"), what if our tools could directly debug our mental models ("teaching the programmer to fish")? In this paper, we apply recent ideas from computational cognitive science to offer a principled framework for doing exactly that. Given a "why?" question about a program, we automatically infer potential misconceptions about the language/API that might cause the user to be surprised by the program's behavior -- and then analyze those misconceptions to provide explanations of the program's behavior. Our key idea is to formally represent misconceptions as counterfactual (erroneous) semantics for the language/API, which can be inferred and debugged using program synthesis techniques. We demonstrate our framework, WatChat, by building systems for explanation in two domains: JavaScript type coercion, and the Git version control system. We evaluate WatChatJS and WatChatGit by comparing their outputs to experimentally-collected human-written explanations in these two domains: we show that WatChat's explanations exhibit key features of human-written explanation, unlike those of a state-of-the-art language model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Sanwal</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of Natural Language Inference (NLI), especially in tasks involving the classification of multiple input texts, the Cross-Entropy Loss metric is widely employed as a standard for error measurement. However, this metric falls short in effectively evaluating a model's capacity to understand language entailments. In this study, we introduce an innovative technique for generating a contrast set for the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset. Our strategy involves the automated substitution of verbs, adverbs, and adjectives with their synonyms to preserve the original meaning of sentences. This method aims to assess whether a model's performance is based on genuine language comprehension or simply on pattern recognition. We conducted our analysis using the ELECTRA-small model. The model achieved an accuracy of 89.9% on the conventional SNLI dataset but showed a reduced accuracy of 72.5% on our contrast set, indicating a substantial 17% decline. This outcome led us to conduct a detailed examination of the model's learning behaviors. Following this, we improved the model's resilience by fine-tuning it with a contrast-enhanced training dataset specifically designed for SNLI, which increased its accuracy to 85.5% on the contrast sets. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating diverse linguistic expressions into datasets for NLI tasks. We hope that our research will encourage the creation of more inclusive datasets, thereby contributing to the development of NLI models that are both more sophisticated and effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Zhang, Harold Soh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we are interested in automated methods for knowledge graph creation (KGC) from input text. Progress on large language models (LLMs) has prompted a series of recent works applying them to KGC, e.g., via zero/few-shot prompting. Despite successes on small domain-specific datasets, these models face difficulties scaling up to text common in many real-world applications. A principal issue is that, in prior methods, the KG schema has to be included in the LLM prompt to generate valid triplets; larger and more complex schemas easily exceed the LLMs' context window length. Furthermore, there are scenarios where a fixed pre-defined schema is not available and we would like the method to construct a high-quality KG with a succinct self-generated schema. To address these problems, we propose a three-phase framework named Extract-Define-Canonicalize (EDC): open information extraction followed by schema definition and post-hoc canonicalization. EDC is flexible in that it can be applied to settings where a pre-defined target schema is available and when it is not; in the latter case, it constructs a schema automatically and applies self-canonicalization. To further improve performance, we introduce a trained component that retrieves schema elements relevant to the input text; this improves the LLMs' extraction performance in a retrieval-augmented generation-like manner. We demonstrate on three KGC benchmarks that EDC is able to extract high-quality triplets without any parameter tuning and with significantly larger schemas compared to prior works. Code for EDC is available at https://github.com/clear-nus/edc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Guo, Daming Shi, Junjie Yu, Wenhui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is significantly transforming various fields like autonomous vehicle networks. However, real-world multi-agent systems typically contain multiple roles, and the scale of these systems dynamically fluctuates. Consequently, in order to achieve zero-shot scalable collaboration, it is essential that strategies for different roles can be updated flexibly according to the scales, which is still a challenge for current MARL frameworks. To address this, we propose a novel MARL framework named Scalable and Heterogeneous Proximal Policy Optimization (SHPPO), integrating heterogeneity into parameter-shared PPO-based MARL networks. We first leverage a latent network to learn strategy patterns for each agent adaptively. Second, we introduce a heterogeneous layer to be inserted into decision-making networks, whose parameters are specifically generated by the learned latent variables. Our approach is scalable as all the parameters are shared except for the heterogeneous layer, and gains both inter-individual and temporal heterogeneity, allowing SHPPO to adapt effectively to varying scales. SHPPO exhibits superior performance in classic MARL environments like Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) and Google Research Football (GRF), showcasing enhanced zero-shot scalability, and offering insights into the learned latent variables' impact on team performance by visualization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonwoo Kim, Gyoungjin Gim, Yungi Kim, Jihoo Kim, Byungju Kim, Wonseok Lee, Chanjun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a novel learning approach designed to enhance both mathematical reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on integrating the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and the Program-of-Thought (PoT) learning, hypothesizing that prioritizing the learning of mathematical reasoning ability is helpful for the amplification of problem-solving ability. Thus, the initial learning with CoT is essential for solving challenging mathematical problems. To this end, we propose a sequential learning approach, named SAAS (Solving Ability Amplification Strategy), which strategically transitions from CoT learning to PoT learning. Our empirical study, involving an extensive performance comparison using several benchmarks, demonstrates that our SAAS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. The results underscore the effectiveness of our sequential learning approach, marking a significant advancement in the field of mathematical reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyed Mahed Mousavi, Simone Alghisi, Giuseppe Riccardi</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs acquire knowledge from massive data snapshots collected at different timestamps. Their knowledge is then commonly evaluated using static benchmarks. However, factual knowledge is generally subject to time-sensitive changes, and static benchmarks cannot address those cases. We present an approach to dynamically evaluate the knowledge in LLMs and their time-sensitiveness against Wikidata, a publicly available up-to-date knowledge graph. We evaluate the time-sensitive knowledge in twenty-four private and open-source LLMs, as well as the effectiveness of four editing methods in updating the outdated facts. Our results show that 1) outdatedness is a critical problem across state-of-the-art LLMs; 2) LLMs output inconsistent answers when prompted with slight variations of the question prompt; and 3) the performance of the state-of-the-art knowledge editing algorithms is very limited, as they can not reduce the cases of outdatedness and output inconsistency.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate whether LLMs learn to make human-like preference judgements in strategic scenarios as compared with known empirical results. Solar and Mistral are shown to exhibit stable value-based preference consistent with humans and exhibit human-like preference for cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma (including stake-size effect) and traveler's dilemma (including penalty-size effect). We establish a relationship between model size, value-based preference, and superficiality. Finally, results here show that models tending to be less brittle have relied on sliding window attention suggesting a potential link. Additionally, we contribute a novel method for constructing preference relations from arbitrary LLMs and support for a hypothesis regarding human behavior in the traveler's dilemma.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Sun, Yu Yao, Huangyuan Hao, Yumou Qiu, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Testing conditional independence has many applications, such as in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Different test methods have been proposed. However, existing methods generally can not work when only discretized observations are available. Specifically, consider $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ are observed variables, where $\tilde{X}_2$ is a discretization of latent variables $X_2$. Applying existing test methods to the observations of $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ can lead to a false conclusion about the underlying conditional independence of variables $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$. Motivated by this, we propose a conditional independence test specifically designed to accommodate the presence of such discretization. To achieve this, we design the bridge equations to recover the parameter reflecting the statistical information of the underlying latent continuous variables. An appropriate test statistic and its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence have also been derived. Both theoretical results and empirical validation have been provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of our test methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kounianhua Du, Jizheng Chen, Renting Rui, Huacan Chai, Lingyue Fu, Wei Xia, Yasheng Wang, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the general large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing among natural language and different programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to fill the gap between programming languages and natural language, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging graphical representation into informative knowledge for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into the model parameters via finetuning the models with the help of a pretrained GNN expert model. Various experiments and ablations are done on four datasets including both the C++ and python languages to validate the hard meta-graph prompt, the soft prompting technique, and the effectiveness of the objectives for pretrained GNN expert. CodeGRAG improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anshuman Chhabra, Bo Li, Jian Chen, Prasant Mohapatra, Hongfu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: A core data-centric learning challenge is the identification of training samples that are detrimental to model performance. Influence functions serve as a prominent tool for this task and offer a robust framework for assessing training data influence on model predictions. Despite their widespread use, their high computational cost associated with calculating the inverse of the Hessian matrix pose constraints, particularly when analyzing large-sized deep models. In this paper, we establish a bridge between identifying detrimental training samples via influence functions and outlier gradient detection. This transformation not only presents a straightforward and Hessian-free formulation but also provides insights into the role of the gradient in sample impact. Through systematic empirical evaluations, we first validate the hypothesis of our proposed outlier gradient analysis approach on synthetic datasets. We then demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting mislabeled samples in vision models and selecting data samples for improving performance of natural language processing transformer models. We also extend its use to influential sample identification for fine-tuning Large Language Models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wu, Lutao Yan, Leixian Shen, Yunhai Wang, Nan Tang, Yuyu Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Chart question answering (ChartQA) tasks play a critical role in interpreting and extracting insights from visualization charts. While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o have shown promise in high-level ChartQA tasks, such as chart captioning, their effectiveness in low-level ChartQA tasks (e.g., identifying correlations) remains underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by evaluating MLLMs on low-level ChartQA using a newly curated dataset, ChartInsights, which consists of 22,347 (chart, task, query, answer) covering 10 data analysis tasks across 7 chart types. We systematically evaluate 19 advanced MLLMs, including 12 open-source and 7 closed-source models. The average accuracy rate across these models is 39.8%, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy at 69.17%. To further explore the limitations of MLLMs in low-level ChartQA, we conduct experiments that alter visual elements of charts (e.g., changing color schemes, adding image noise) to assess their impact on the task effectiveness. Furthermore, we propose a new textual prompt strategy, Chain-of-Charts, tailored for low-level ChartQA tasks, which boosts performance by 14.41%, achieving an accuracy of 83.58%. Finally, incorporating a visual prompt strategy that directs attention to relevant visual elements further improves accuracy to 84.32%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangjun Ruan, Chris J. Maddison, Tatsunori Hashimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how language model performance varies with scale is critical to benchmark and algorithm development. Scaling laws are one approach to building this understanding, but the requirement of training models across many different scales has limited their use. We propose an alternative, observational approach that bypasses model training and instead builds scaling laws from ~100 publically available models. Building a single scaling law from multiple model families is challenging due to large variations in their training compute efficiencies and capabilities. However, we show that these variations are consistent with a simple, generalized scaling law where language model performance is a function of a low-dimensional capability space, and model families only vary in their efficiency in converting training compute to capabilities. Using this approach, we show the surprising predictability of complex scaling phenomena: we show that several emergent phenomena follow a smooth, sigmoidal behavior and are predictable from small models; we show that the agent performance of models such as GPT-4 can be precisely predicted from simpler non-agentic benchmarks; and we show how to predict the impact of post-training interventions like Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency as language model capabilities continue to improve.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai Zhang, Boyuan Zheng, Tianying Ji, Jinhang Liu, Anqi Guo, Junqiao Zhao, Lanqing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline meta reinforcement learning (OMRL) has emerged as a promising approach for interaction avoidance and strong generalization performance by leveraging pre-collected data and meta-learning techniques. Previous context-based approaches predominantly rely on the intuition that alternating optimization between the context encoder and the policy can lead to performance improvements, as long as the context encoder follows the principle of maximizing the mutual information between the task variable $M$ and its latent representation $Z$ ($I(Z;M)$) while the policy adopts the standard offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms conditioning on the learned task representation.Despite promising results, the theoretical justification of performance improvements for such intuition remains underexplored.Inspired by the return discrepancy scheme in the model-based RL field, we find that the previous optimization framework can be linked with the general RL objective of maximizing the expected return, thereby explaining performance improvements. Furthermore, after scrutinizing this optimization framework, we find it ignores the variation of the task representation in the alternating optimization process, which weakens the condition necessary for monotonic performance improvements, and may therefore violate the monotonicity.We name this issue \underline{task representation shift} and theoretically prove that the monotonic performance improvements can be guaranteed with appropriate context encoder updates.We use different settings to rein in the task representation shift on three widely adopted training objectives concerning maximizing $I(Z;M)$ across different data qualities.Empirical results show that reining in the task representation shift can indeed improve performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzhao Wang, Yu Pan, Fupeng Sun, Shang Liu, Kalyan Talluri, Guanting Chen, Xiaocheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the supervised pre-trained transformer for a class of sequential decision-making problems. The class of considered problems is a subset of the general formulation of reinforcement learning in that there is no transition probability matrix; though seemingly restrictive, the subset class of problems covers bandits, dynamic pricing, and newsvendor problems as special cases. Such a structure enables the use of optimal actions/decisions in the pre-training phase, and the usage also provides new insights for the training and generalization of the pre-trained transformer. We first note the training of the transformer model can be viewed as a performative prediction problem, and the existing methods and theories largely ignore or cannot resolve an out-of-distribution issue. We propose a natural solution that includes the transformer-generated action sequences in the training procedure, and it enjoys better properties both numerically and theoretically. The availability of the optimal actions in the considered tasks also allows us to analyze the properties of the pre-trained transformer as an algorithm and explains why it may lack exploration and how this can be automatically resolved. Numerically, we categorize the advantages of pre-trained transformers over the structured algorithms such as UCB and Thompson sampling into three cases: (i) it better utilizes the prior knowledge in the pre-training data; (ii) it can elegantly handle the misspecification issue suffered by the structured algorithms; (iii) for short time horizon such as $T\le50$, it behaves more greedy and enjoys much better regret than the structured algorithms designed for asymptotic optimality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malika Nisal Ratnayake, Lex Gallon, Adel N. Toosi, Alan Dorin</p>
<p>Abstract: Field-captured video facilitates detailed studies of spatio-temporal aspects of animal locomotion, decision-making and environmental interactions including predator-prey relationships and habitat utilisation. But even though data capture is cheap with mass-produced hardware, storage, processing and transmission overheads provide a hurdle to acquisition of high resolution video from field-situated edge computing devices. Efficient compression algorithms are therefore essential if monitoring is to be conducted on single-board computers in situations where such hurdles must be overcome. Animal motion tracking in the field has unique characteristics that necessitate the use of novel video compression techniques, which may be underexplored or unsuitable in other contexts. In this article, we therefore introduce a new motion analysis-based video compression algorithm specifically designed for camera traps. We implemented and tested this algorithm using a case study of insect-pollinator motion tracking on three popular edge computing platforms. The algorithm identifies and stores only image regions depicting motion relevant to pollination monitoring, reducing overall data size by an average of 87% across diverse test datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the algorithm's capability to preserve critical information for insect behaviour analysis through both manual observation and automatic analysis of the compressed footage. The method presented in this paper enhances the applicability of low-powered computer vision edge devices to remote, in situ animal motion monitoring, and improves the efficiency of playback during behavioural analyses. Our new software, EcoMotionZip, is available Open Access.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manoj Kumar, Neil Houlsby, Emiel Hoogeboom</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating image variations, where a model produces variations of an input image while preserving the semantic context has gained increasing attention. Current image variation techniques involve adapting a text-to-image model to reconstruct an input image conditioned on the same image. We first demonstrate that a diffusion model trained to reconstruct an input image from frozen embeddings, can reconstruct the image with minor variations. Second, inspired by how text-to-image models learn from web-scale text-image pairs, we explore a new pretraining strategy to generate image variations using a large collection of image pairs. Our diffusion model \textit{Semantica} receives a random (encoded) image from a webpage as conditional input and denoises another noisy random image from the same webpage. We carefully examine various design choices for the image encoder, given its crucial role in extracting relevant context from the input image. Once trained, \textit{Semantica} can adaptively generate new images from a dataset by simply using images from that dataset as input. Finally, we identify limitations in standard image consistency metrics for evaluating image variations and propose alternative metrics based on few-shot generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxian Chen, Hanyang Zhao, Henry Lam, David Yao, Wenpin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a popular approach to improve reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), leading to better techniques to fine-tune large language models (LLM). A weakness of DPO, however, lies in its lack of capability to characterize the diversity of human preferences. Inspired by Mallows' theory of preference ranking, we develop in this paper a new approach, the MallowsPO. A distinct feature of this approach is a dispersion index, which reflects the dispersion of human preference to prompts. We show that existing DPO models can be reduced to special cases of this dispersion index, thus unified with MallowsPO. More importantly, we demonstrate (empirically) how to use this dispersion index to enhance the performance of DPO in a broad array of benchmark tasks, from synthetic bandit selection to controllable generations and dialogues, while maintaining great generalization capabilities. MallowsPO is also compatible with other SOTA offline preference optimization methods, boosting nearly 2\% extra LC win rate when used as a plugin for fine-tuning Llama3-Instruct.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinguo Cheng, Chunwei Yang, Wanlin Cai, Yuxuan Liang, Qingsong Wen, Yuankai Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series imputation is critical for many real-world applications and has been widely studied. However, existing models often require specialized designs tailored to specific missing patterns, variables, or domains which limits their generalizability. In addition, current evaluation frameworks primarily focus on domain-specific tasks and often rely on time-wise train/validation/test data splits, which fail to rigorously assess a model's ability to generalize across unseen variables or domains. In this paper, we present \textbf{NuwaTS}, a novel framework that repurposes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for general time series imputation. Once trained, NuwaTS can be applied to impute missing data across any domain. We introduce specialized embeddings for each sub-series patch, capturing information about the patch, its missing data patterns, and its statistical characteristics. By combining contrastive learning with the imputation task, we train PLMs to create a versatile, one-for-all imputation model. Additionally, we employ a plug-and-play fine-tuning approach, enabling efficient adaptation to domain-specific tasks with minimal adjustments. To evaluate cross-variable and cross-domain generalization, we propose a new benchmarking protocol that partitions the datasets along the variable dimension. Experimental results on over seventeen million time series samples from diverse domains demonstrate that NuwaTS outperforms state-of-the-art domain-specific models across various datasets under the proposed benchmarking protocol. Furthermore, we show that NuwaTS generalizes to other time series tasks, such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenzhong Wang, Zehui Lin, Wanyu Lin, Ming Yang, Minggang Zeng, Kay Chen Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Providing explainable molecular property predictions is critical for many scientific domains, such as drug discovery and material science. Though transformer-based language models have shown great potential in accurate molecular property prediction, they neither provide chemically meaningful explanations nor faithfully reveal the molecular structure-property relationships. In this work, we develop a framework for explainable molecular property prediction based on language models, dubbed as Lamole, which can provide chemical concepts-aligned explanations. We take a string-based molecular representation -- Group SELFIES -- as input tokens to pretrain and fine-tune our Lamole, as it provides chemically meaningful semantics. By disentangling the information flows of Lamole, we propose combining self-attention weights and gradients for better quantification of each chemically meaningful substructure's impact on the model's output. To make the explanations more faithfully respect the structure-property relationship, we then carefully craft a marginal loss to explicitly optimize the explanations to be able to align with the chemists' annotations. We bridge the manifold hypothesis with the elaborated marginal loss to prove that the loss can align the explanations with the tangent space of the data manifold, leading to concept-aligned explanations. Experimental results over six mutagenicity datasets and one hepatotoxicity dataset demonstrate Lamole can achieve comparable classification accuracy and boost the explanation accuracy by up to 14.3%, being the state-of-the-art in explainable molecular property prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangxiang Dai, Jin Li, Xutong Liu, Anqi Yu, John C. S. Lui</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the diversity of multi-LLM tasks and the variability in their pricing structures have become increasingly important, as costs can vary greatly between different LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the \textit{C2MAB-V}, a \underline{C}ost-effective \underline{C}ombinatorial \underline{M}ulti-armed \underline{B}andit with \underline{V}ersatile reward models for optimal LLM selection and usage. This online model differs from traditional static approaches or those reliant on a single LLM without cost consideration. With multiple LLMs deployed on a scheduling cloud and a local server dedicated to handling user queries, \textit{C2MAB-V} facilitates the selection of multiple LLMs over a combinatorial search space, specifically tailored for various collaborative task types with different reward models. Based on our designed online feedback mechanism and confidence bound technique, \textit{C2MAB-V} can effectively address the multi-LLM selection challenge by managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off across different models, while also balancing cost and reward for diverse tasks. The NP-hard integer linear programming problem for selecting multiple LLMs with trade-off dilemmas is addressed by: i) decomposing the integer problem into a relaxed form by the local server, ii) utilizing a discretization rounding scheme that provides optimal LLM combinations by the scheduling cloud, and iii) continual online updates based on feedback. Theoretically, we prove that \textit{C2MAB-V} offers strict guarantees over versatile reward models, matching state-of-the-art results for regret and violations in some degenerate cases. Empirically, we show that \textit{C2MAB-V} effectively balances performance and cost-efficiency with nine LLMs for three application scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Tang, Jiangweizhi Peng, Jiasheng Tang, Mingyi Hong, Fan Wang, Tsung-Hui Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we focus on the alignment problem of diffusion models with a continuous reward function, which represents specific objectives for downstream tasks, such as increasing darkness or improving the aesthetics of images. The central goal of the alignment problem is to adjust the distribution learned by diffusion models such that the generated samples maximize the target reward function. We propose a novel alignment approach, named Direct Noise Optimization (DNO), that optimizes the injected noise during the sampling process of diffusion models. By design, DNO operates at inference-time, and thus is tuning-free and prompt-agnostic, with the alignment occurring in an online fashion during generation. We rigorously study the theoretical properties of DNO and also propose variants to deal with non-differentiable reward functions. Furthermore, we identify that naive implementation of DNO occasionally suffers from the out-of-distribution reward hacking problem, where optimized samples have high rewards but are no longer in the support of the pretrained distribution. To remedy this issue, we leverage classical high-dimensional statistics theory to an effective probability regularization technique. We conduct extensive experiments on several important reward functions and demonstrate that the proposed DNO approach can achieve state-of-the-art reward scores within a reasonable time budget for generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajay Patel, Markus Hofmarcher, Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei, Marius-Constantin Dinu, Chris Callison-Burch, Sepp Hochreiter</p>
<p>Abstract: Training models to act as agents that can effectively navigate and perform actions in a complex environment, such as a web browser, has typically been challenging due to lack of training data. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated some capability to navigate novel environments as agents in a zero-shot or few-shot fashion, purely guided by natural language instructions as prompts. Recent research has also demonstrated LLMs have the capability to exceed their base performance through self-improvement, i.e. fine-tuning on data generated by the model itself. In this work, we explore the extent to which LLMs can self-improve their performance as agents in long-horizon tasks in a complex environment using the WebArena benchmark. In WebArena, an agent must autonomously navigate and perform actions on web pages to achieve a specified objective. We explore fine-tuning on three distinct synthetic training data mixtures and achieve a 31\% improvement in task completion rate over the base model on the WebArena benchmark through a self-improvement procedure. We additionally contribute novel evaluation metrics for assessing the performance, robustness, capabilities, and quality of trajectories of our fine-tuned agent models to a greater degree than simple, aggregate-level benchmark scores currently used to measure self-improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: The limited availability of psychologists necessitates efficient identification of individuals requiring urgent mental healthcare. This study explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines to analyze text data from online mental health forums used for consultations. By analyzing forum posts, these pipelines can flag users who may require immediate professional attention. A crucial challenge in this domain is data privacy and scarcity. To address this, we propose utilizing readily available curricular texts used in institutes specializing in mental health for pre-training the NLP pipelines. This helps us mimic the training process of a psychologist. Our work presents CASE-BERT that flags potential mental health disorders based on forum text. CASE-BERT demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving an f1 score of 0.91 for Depression and 0.88 for Anxiety, two of the most commonly reported mental health disorders. Our code and data are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyun Cui, Ziyang Zhang, Wen Wu, Guangzhi Sun, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in large language models raise the question of how alignment techniques will adapt as models become increasingly complex and humans will only be able to supervise them weakly. Weak-to-Strong mimics such a scenario where weak model supervision attempts to harness the full capabilities of a much stronger model. This work extends Weak-to-Strong to WeakS-to-Strong by exploring an ensemble of weak models which simulate the variability in human opinions. Confidence scores are estimated using a Bayesian approach to guide the WeakS-to-Strong generalization. Furthermore, we extend the application of WeakS-to-Strong from text classification tasks to text generation tasks where more advanced strategies are investigated for supervision. Moreover, direct preference optimization is applied to advance the student model's preference learning, beyond the basic learning framework of teacher forcing. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the reliability of a strong student model, showing potential for superalignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroaki Chiba-Okabe, Weijie J. Su</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI technology has sparked significant copyright concerns, leading to numerous lawsuits filed against AI developers. While various techniques for mitigating copyright issues have been studied, significant risks remain. Here, we propose a genericization method that modifies the outputs of a generative model to make them more generic and less likely to infringe copyright. To achieve this, we introduce a metric for quantifying the level of originality of data in a manner that is consistent with the legal framework. This metric can be estimated by drawing samples from a generative model, which is then used for the genericization process. As a practical implementation, we introduce PREGen, which combines our genericization method with an existing mitigation technique. Experiments demonstrate that our genericization method successfully modifies the output of a text-to-image generative model so that it produces more generic, copyright-compliant images. Compared to the existing method, PREGen reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted characters by more than half when the names of copyrighted characters are used as the prompt, dramatically improving the performance. Additionally, while generative models can produce copyrighted characters even when their names are not directly mentioned in the prompt, PREGen almost entirely prevents the generation of such characters in these cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyang Qin, Dancheng Liu, Chenhui Xu, Zheyu Yan, Zhaoxuan Tan, Zhenge Jia, Amir Nassereldine, Jiajie Li, Meng Jiang, Ahmed Abbasi, Jinjun Xiong, Yiyu Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The scaling laws have become the de facto guidelines for designing large language models (LLMs), but they were studied under the assumption of unlimited computing resources for both training and inference. As LLMs are increasingly used as personalized intelligent assistants, their customization (i.e., learning through fine-tuning) and deployment onto resource-constrained edge devices will become more and more prevalent. An urging but open question is how a resource-constrained computing environment would affect the design choices for a personalized LLM. We study this problem empirically in this work. In particular, we consider the tradeoffs among a number of key design factors and their intertwined impacts on learning efficiency and accuracy. The factors include the learning methods for LLM customization, the amount of personalized data used for learning customization, the types and sizes of LLMs, the compression methods of LLMs, the amount of time afforded to learn, and the difficulty levels of the target use cases. Through extensive experimentation and benchmarking, we draw a number of surprisingly insightful guidelines for deploying LLMs onto resource-constrained devices. For example, an optimal choice between parameter learning and RAG may vary depending on the difficulty of the downstream task, the longer fine-tuning time does not necessarily help the model, and a compressed LLM may be a better choice than an uncompressed LLM to learn from limited personalized data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tejaswini Pedapati, Amit Dhurandhar, Soumya Ghosh, Soham Dan, Prasanna Sattigeri</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating uncertainty or confidence in the responses of a model can be significant in evaluating trust not only in the responses, but also in the model as a whole. In this paper, we explore the problem of estimating confidence for responses of large language models (LLMs) with simply black-box or query access to them. We propose a simple and extensible framework where, we engineer novel features and train a (interpretable) model (viz. logistic regression) on these features to estimate the confidence. We empirically demonstrate that our simple framework is effective in estimating confidence of Flan-ul2, Llama-13b and Mistral-7b on four benchmark Q\&A tasks as well as of Pegasus-large and BART-large on two benchmark summarization tasks with it surpassing baselines by even over $10\%$ (on AUROC) in some cases. Additionally, our interpretable approach provides insight into features that are predictive of confidence, leading to the interesting and useful discovery that our confidence models built for one LLM generalize zero-shot across others on a given dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vignesh Kothapalli, Tianyu Pang, Shenyang Deng, Zongmin Liu, Yaoqing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Training strategies for modern deep neural networks (NNs) tend to induce a heavy-tailed (HT) empirical spectral density (ESD) in the layer weights. While previous efforts have shown that the HT phenomenon correlates with good generalization in large NNs, a theoretical explanation of its occurrence is still lacking. Especially, understanding the conditions which lead to this phenomenon can shed light on the interplay between generalization and weight spectra. Our work aims to bridge this gap by presenting a simple, rich setting to model the emergence of HT ESD. In particular, we present a theory-informed analysis for 'crafting' heavy tails in the ESD of two-layer NNs without any gradient noise. This is the first work to analyze a noise-free setting and incorporate optimizer (GD/Adam) dependent (large) learning rates into the HT ESD analysis. Our results highlight the role of learning rates on the Bulk+Spike and HT shape of the ESDs in the early phase of training, which can facilitate generalization in the two-layer NN. These observations shed light on the behavior of large-scale NNs, albeit in a much simpler setting. Last but not least, we present a novel perspective on the ESD evolution dynamics by analyzing the singular vectors of weight matrices and optimizer updates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abisek Rajakumar Kalarani, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Sumit Shekhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Metaphors are a common communication tool used in our day-to-day life. The detection and generation of metaphors in textual form have been studied extensively but metaphors in other forms have been under-explored. Recent studies have shown that Vision-Language (VL) models cannot understand visual metaphors in memes and adverts. As of now, no probing studies have been done that involve complex language phenomena like metaphors with videos. Hence, we introduce a new VL task of describing the metaphors present in the videos in our work. To facilitate this novel task, we construct and release a manually created dataset with 705 videos and 2115 human-written captions, along with a new metric called Average Concept Distance (ACD), to automatically evaluate the creativity of the metaphors generated. We also propose a novel low-resource video metaphor captioning system: GIT-LLaVA, which obtains comparable performance to SoTA video language models on the proposed task. We perform a comprehensive analysis of existing video language models on this task and publish our dataset, models, and benchmark results to enable further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Shi, Chiyu Ma, Wenhua Liang, Weicheng Ma, Soroush Vosoughi</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge presents a promising alternative to human evaluators across various tasks, but inherent biases, especially position bias - a tendency to favor solutions based on their position in the prompt - have compromised its effectiveness. Our study introduces a systematic framework to examine position bias in pairwise comparisons, focusing on repetition stability, position consistency, and preference fairness. This research significantly contributes to the field by introducing new concepts for understanding position bias and providing a multi-dimensional framework for evaluations. We conducted experiments with 12 LLM judges across MTBench and DevBench, covering 22 tasks and approximately 40 solution-generating models - candidates, resulting in over 100,000 evaluation instances. Our findings confirm that position bias in capable LLM judges is not due to random chances, along with notable variations observed across judges and tasks. Moreover, position bias is weakly influenced by the length of prompt components but significantly impacted by the quality gap between solutions. These insights can help optimize judge model selections, improve benchmark design, and inform future research on debiasing strategies, ultimately enhancing the reliability of LLM judges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph pooling has gained attention for its ability to obtain effective node and graph representations for various downstream tasks. Despite the recent surge in graph pooling approaches, there is a lack of standardized experimental settings and fair benchmarks to evaluate their performance. To address this issue, we have constructed a comprehensive benchmark that includes 17 graph pooling methods and 28 different graph datasets. This benchmark systematically assesses the performance of graph pooling methods in three dimensions, i.e., effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. We first evaluate the performance of these graph pooling approaches across different tasks including graph classification, graph regression and node classification. Then, we investigate their performance under potential noise attacks and out-of-distribution shifts in real-world scenarios. We also involve detailed efficiency analysis, backbone analysis, parameter analysis and visualization to provide more evidence. Extensive experiments validate the strong capability and applicability of graph pooling approaches in various scenarios, which can provide valuable insights and guidance for deep geometric learning research.

<p>Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generative models, biases inherent in training datasets often propagate into generated content, posing significant ethical challenges, particularly in socially sensitive contexts. We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in diffusion models through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models (LLMs). FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement and attire-based attribute prediction to systematically mitigate biases, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero-shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across multiple models, including DALL-E and various Stable Diffusion variants, demonstrate that FairCoT significantly improves fairness and diversity metrics without compromising image quality or relevance. Our approach advances ethical AI practices in generative modeling, promoting socially responsible content generation and setting new standards for fairness in AI-generated imagery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly ubiquitous in our daily lives, used in everyday tasks such as text-image searches, interactions with chatbots, and content generation. As use increases, so does concern over the disparities in performance and fairness of these models for different people in different parts of the world. To assess these growing regional disparities, we present World Wide Dishes, a mixed text and image dataset consisting of 765 dishes, with dish names collected in 131 local languages. World Wide Dishes has been collected purely through human contribution and decentralised means, by creating a website widely distributed through social networks. Using the dataset, we demonstrate a novel means of operationalising capability and representational biases in foundation models such as language models and text-to-image generative models. We enrich these studies with a pilot community review to understand, from a first-person perspective, how these models generate images for people in five African countries and the United States.
  We find that these models generally do not produce quality text and image outputs of dishes specific to different regions. This is true even for the US, which is typically considered to be more well-resourced in training data - though the generation of US dishes does outperform that of the investigated African countries. The models demonstrate a propensity to produce outputs that are inaccurate as well as culturally misrepresentative, flattening, and insensitive. These failures in capability and representational bias have the potential to further reinforce stereotypes and disproportionately contribute to erasure based on region.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Kai Qiu, Hao Chen, Jason Kuen, Zhe Lin, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional visual generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of diffusion models (DMs), especially in tasks like control-to-image generation. However, challenges such as expensive computational cost, high inference latency, and difficulties of integration with large language models (LLMs) have necessitated exploring alternatives to DMs. This paper introduces ControlVAR, a novel framework that explores pixel-level controls in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling for flexible and efficient conditional generation. In contrast to traditional conditional models that learn the conditional distribution, ControlVAR jointly models the distribution of image and pixel-level conditions during training and imposes conditional controls during testing. To enhance the joint modeling, we adopt the next-scale AR prediction paradigm and unify control and image representations. A teacher-forcing guidance strategy is proposed to further facilitate controllable generation with joint modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficacy and flexibility of ControlVAR across various conditional generation tasks against popular conditional DMs, \eg, ControlNet and T2I-Adaptor.

<p>Abstract: The evolution of large language models (LLMs) has enhanced the planning capabilities of language agents in diverse real-world scenarios. Despite these advancements, the potential of LLM-powered agents to comprehend ambiguous user instructions for reasoning and decision-making is still under exploration. In this work, we introduce a new task, Proactive Agent Planning, which requires language agents to predict clarification needs based on user-agent conversation and agent-environment interaction, invoke external tools to collect valid information, and generate a plan to fulfill the user's demands. To study this practical problem, we establish a new benchmark dataset, Ask-before-Plan. To tackle the deficiency of LLMs in proactive planning, we propose a novel multi-agent framework, Clarification-Execution-Planning (\texttt{CEP}), which consists of three agents specialized in clarification, execution, and planning. We introduce the trajectory tuning scheme for the clarification agent and static execution agent, as well as the memory recollection mechanism for the dynamic execution agent. Extensive evaluations and comprehensive analyses conducted on the Ask-before-Plan dataset validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p>

In this paper, we emphasize the necessity of autonomous adaptation in personal AI companionship, an underexplored yet promising direction. Such adaptability is crucial as it can facilitate more tailored interactions with users and allow the agent to evolve in response to users' changing needs. However, imbuing agents with autonomous adaptability presents unique challenges, including identifying optimal adaptations to meet users' expectations and ensuring a smooth transition during the adaptation process. To address them, we devise a hierarchical framework, AutoPal, that enables controllable and authentic adjustments to the agent's persona based on user interactions. A personamatching dataset is constructed to facilitate the learning of optimal persona adaptations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoPal and highlight the importance of autonomous adaptability in AI companionship.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lexin Zhou, Youmna Farag, Andreas Vlachos</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on dialogue constructiveness assessment focuses on (i) analysing conversational factors that influence individuals to take specific actions, win debates, change their perspectives or broaden their open-mindedness and (ii) predicting constructiveness outcomes following dialogues for such use cases. These objectives can be achieved by training either interpretable feature-based models (which often involve costly human annotations) or neural models such as pre-trained language models (which have empirically shown higher task accuracy but lack interpretability). In this paper we propose an LLM feature-based framework for dialogue constructiveness assessment that combines the strengths of feature-based and neural approaches, while mitigating their downsides. The framework first defines a set of dataset-independent and interpretable linguistic features, which can be extracted by both prompting an LLM and simple heuristics. Such features are then used to train LLM feature-based models. We apply this framework to three datasets of dialogue constructiveness and find that our LLM feature-based models outperform or performs at least as well as standard feature-based models and neural models. We also find that the LLM feature-based model learns more robust prediction rules instead of relying on superficial shortcuts, which often trouble neural models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongbo Li, Sen Lin, Lingjie Duan, Yingbin Liang, Ness B. Shroff</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has garnered significant attention because of its ability to adapt to new tasks that arrive over time. Catastrophic forgetting (of old tasks) has been identified as a major issue in CL, as the model adapts to new tasks. The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model has recently been shown to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting in CL, by employing a gating network to sparsify and distribute diverse tasks among multiple experts. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis of MoE and its impact on the learning performance in CL. This paper provides the first theoretical results to characterize the impact of MoE in CL via the lens of overparameterized linear regression tasks. We establish the benefit of MoE over a single expert by proving that the MoE model can diversify its experts to specialize in different tasks, while its router learns to select the right expert for each task and balance the loads across all experts. Our study further suggests an intriguing fact that the MoE in CL needs to terminate the update of the gating network after sufficient training rounds to attain system convergence, which is not needed in the existing MoE studies that do not consider the continual task arrival. Furthermore, we provide explicit expressions for the expected forgetting and overall generalization error to characterize the benefit of MoE in the learning performance in CL. Interestingly, adding more experts requires additional rounds before convergence, which may not enhance the learning performance. Finally, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real datasets to extend these insights from linear models to deep neural networks (DNNs), which also shed light on the practical algorithm design for MoE in CL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jared Moore, Tanvi Deshpande, Diyi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) appear to bias their survey answers toward certain values. Nonetheless, some argue that LLMs are too inconsistent to simulate particular values. Are they? To answer, we first define value consistency as the similarity of answers across (1) paraphrases of one question, (2) related questions under one topic, (3) multiple-choice and open-ended use-cases of one question, and (4) multilingual translations of a question to English, Chinese, German, and Japanese. We apply these measures to small and large, open LLMs including llama-3, as well as gpt-4o, using 8,000 questions spanning more than 300 topics. Unlike prior work, we find that models are relatively consistent across paraphrases, use-cases, translations, and within a topic. Still, some inconsistencies remain. Models are more consistent on uncontroversial topics (e.g., in the U.S., "Thanksgiving") than on controversial ones ("euthanasia"). Base models are both more consistent compared to fine-tuned models and are uniform in their consistency across topics, while fine-tuned models are more inconsistent about some topics ("euthanasia") than others ("women's rights") like our human subjects (n=165).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qixiang Chen, Lei Wang, Piotr Koniusz, Tom Gedeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Videos contain rich spatio-temporal information. Traditional methods for extracting motion, used in tasks such as action recognition, often rely on visual contents rather than precise motion features. This phenomenon is referred to as 'blind motion extraction' behavior, which proves inefficient in capturing motions of interest due to a lack of motion-guided cues. Recently, attention mechanisms have enhanced many computer vision tasks by effectively highlighting salient visual areas. Inspired by this, we propose a modified Sigmoid function with learnable slope and shift parameters as an attention mechanism to modulate motion signals from frame differencing maps. This approach generates a sequence of attention maps that enhance the processing of motion-related video content. To ensure temporal continuity and smoothness of the attention maps, we apply pair-wise temporal attention variation regularization to remove unwanted motions (e.g., noise) while preserving important ones. We then perform Hadamard product between each pair of attention maps and the original video frames to highlight the evolving motions of interest over time. These highlighted motions, termed video motion prompts, are subsequently used as inputs to the model instead of the original video frames. We formalize this process as a motion prompt layer and incorporate the regularization term into the loss function to learn better motion prompts. This layer serves as an adapter between the model and the video data, bridging the gap between traditional 'blind motion extraction' and the extraction of relevant motions of interest. We show that our lightweight, plug-and-play motion prompt layer seamlessly integrates into models like SlowFast, X3D, and TimeSformer, enhancing performance on benchmarks such as FineGym and MPII Cooking 2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksander Ficek, Jiaqi Zeng, Oleksii Kuchaiev</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have become popular methods for adapting large language models while minimizing compute requirements. In this paper, we apply PEFT methods (P-tuning, Adapters, and LoRA) to a modified Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) and a baseline GPT model across several sizes, ranging from 823 million to 48 billion parameters. We show that RETRO models outperform GPT models in zero-shot settings due to their unique pre-training process but GPT models have higher performance potential with PEFT. Additionally, our study indicates that 8B parameter models strike an optimal balance between cost and performance and P-tuning lags behind other PEFT techniques. We further provide a comparative analysis between applying PEFT to an Instruction-tuned RETRO model and base RETRO model. This work presents the first comprehensive comparison of various PEFT methods integrated with RAG, applied to both GPT and RETRO models, highlighting their relative performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Wei, Peiyan Hu, Ruiqi Feng, Haodong Feng, Yixuan Du, Tao Zhang, Rui Wang, Yue Wang, Zhi-Ming Ma, Tailin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Controlling the evolution of complex physical systems is a fundamental task across science and engineering. Classical techniques suffer from limited applicability or huge computational costs. On the other hand, recent deep learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches often struggle to optimize long-term control sequences under the constraints of system dynamics. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Physical systems Control (DiffPhyCon), a new class of method to address the physical systems control problem. DiffPhyCon excels by simultaneously minimizing both the learned generative energy function and the predefined control objectives across the entire trajectory and control sequence. Thus, it can explore globally and plan near-optimal control sequences. Moreover, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training distribution. We test our method on three tasks: 1D Burgers' equation, 2D jellyfish movement control, and 2D high-dimensional smoke control, where our generated jellyfish dataset is released as a benchmark for complex physical system control research. Our method outperforms widely applied classical approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. Notably, DiffPhyCon unveils an intriguing fast-close-slow-open pattern observed in the jellyfish, aligning with established findings in the field of fluid dynamics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongseok Hyun, Su Ho Han, Hyolim Kang, Joon-Young Lee, Seon Joo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The vocabulary size in temporal action localization (TAL) is limited by the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets. To overcome this, recent works integrate vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for open-vocabulary TAL (OV-TAL). However, despite the success of VLMs trained on extensive datasets, existing OV-TAL methods still rely on human-labeled TAL datasets of limited size to train action localizers, limiting their generalizability. In this paper, we explore the scalability of self-training with unlabeled YouTube videos for OV-TAL. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a class-agnostic action localizer is trained on a human-labeled TAL dataset to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled videos, and (2) the large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset is then used to train the localizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that leveraging web-scale videos in self-training significantly enhances the generalizability of an action localizer. Additionally, we identify limitations in existing OV-TAL evaluation schemes and propose a new benchmark for thorough assessment. Finally, we showcase the TAL performance of the large multimodal model Gemini-1.5 on our new benchmark. Code is released at https://github.com/HYUNJS/STOV-TAL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivia Y. Lee, Annie Xie, Kuan Fang, Karl Pertsch, Chelsea Finn</p>
<p>Abstract: Robots equipped with reinforcement learning (RL) have the potential to learn a wide range of skills solely from a reward signal. However, obtaining a robust and dense reward signal for general manipulation tasks remains a challenge. Existing learning-based approaches require significant data, such as human demonstrations of success and failure, to learn task-specific reward functions. Recently, there is also a growing adoption of large multi-modal foundation models for robotics that can perform visual reasoning in physical contexts and generate coarse robot motions for manipulation tasks. Motivated by this range of capability, in this work, we present Keypoint-based Affordance Guidance for Improvements (KAGI), a method leveraging rewards shaped by vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous RL. State-of-the-art VLMs have demonstrated impressive reasoning about affordances through keypoints in zero-shot, and we use these to define dense rewards that guide autonomous robotic learning. On real-world manipulation tasks specified by natural language descriptions, KAGI improves the sample efficiency of autonomous RL and enables successful task completion in 20K online fine-tuning steps. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of KAGI to reductions in the number of in-domain demonstrations used for pre-training, reaching similar performance in 35K online fine-tuning steps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Ren, Danica J. Sutherland</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influences the model's predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language models during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of how influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a uniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algorithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypothetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning, e.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question A, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We also extend our framework and highlight a unique "squeezing effect" to explain a previously observed phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running DPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides insights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analysis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM's finetuning but also inspires a simple, effective method to improve alignment performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengzhao Chen, Wenqi Shao, Peng Xu, Jiahao Wang, Peng Gao, Kaipeng Zhang, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are crucial in modern natural language processing and artificial intelligence. However, they face challenges in managing their significant memory requirements. Although quantization-aware training (QAT) offers a solution by reducing memory consumption through low-bit representations with minimal accuracy loss, it is impractical due to substantial training resources. To address this, we propose Efficient Quantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm. EfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all parameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters (E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable direct training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy loss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization. E2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end, further improving the performance of quantized models by considering interactions among all sub-modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of models, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with scales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance, EfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41 hours, with less than 3 points accuracy degradation compared to the full precision (69.48 vs. 72.41).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwook Kim, Seonho Lee, Jaeyo Shin, Jiho Choi, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

<p>Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and test data are inevitable over the lifecycle of a deployed model, leading to performance decay. Adapting a model on test samples can help mitigate this drop in performance. However, most test-time adaptation methods have focused on synthetic corruption shifts, leaving a variety of distribution shifts underexplored. In this paper, we focus on distribution shifts that evolve gradually over time, which are common in the wild but challenging for existing methods, as we show. To address this, we propose STAD, a probabilistic state-space model that adapts a deployed model to temporal distribution shifts by learning the time-varying dynamics in the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, our model infers time-evolving class prototypes that act as a dynamic classification head. Through experiments on real-world temporal distribution shifts, we show that our method excels in handling small batch sizes and label shift.</p>

We also train the 2B and 9B models with knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) instead of next token prediction. The resulting models deliver the best performance for their size, and even offer competitive alternatives to models that are 2-3 times bigger. We release all our models to the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyeon Kim, Joonhun Lee, Namhoon Cho, Sungjun Han, Wooseop Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning methods often rely on simplistic assumptions, typically including a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors. Such oversimplification can lead to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning, applicable to both discrete and continuous control settings. Our framework enhances the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating additional higher-order moment, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent noise, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to fully leverage the GGD. To address epistemic uncertainty, we enhance the batch inverse variance weighting by incorporating bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, resulting in improved robustness. Extensive experimental evaluations using policy gradient algorithms demonstrate the consistent efficacy of our method, showcasing significant performance improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Yicheng Zhu, Keren Ye, Junjie Ke, Jiahui Yu, Leonidas Guibas, Peyman Milanfar, Feng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing and disentangling visual attributes from objects is a foundation to many computer vision applications. While large vision language representations like CLIP had largely resolved the task of zero-shot object recognition, zero-shot visual attribute recognition remains a challenge because CLIP's contrastively-learned vision-language representation cannot effectively capture object-attribute dependencies. In this paper, we target this weakness and propose a sentence generation-based retrieval formulation for attribute recognition that is novel in 1) explicitly modeling a to-be-measured and retrieved object-attribute relation as a conditional probability graph, which converts the recognition problem into a dependency-sensitive language-modeling problem, and 2) applying a large pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) on this reformulation and naturally distilling its knowledge of image-object-attribute relations to use towards attribute recognition. Specifically, for each attribute to be recognized on an image, we measure the visual-conditioned probability of generating a short sentence encoding the attribute's relation to objects on the image. Unlike contrastive retrieval, which measures likelihood by globally aligning elements of the sentence to the image, generative retrieval is sensitive to the order and dependency of objects and attributes in the sentence. We demonstrate through experiments that generative retrieval consistently outperforms contrastive retrieval on two visual reasoning datasets, Visual Attribute in the Wild (VAW), and our newly-proposed Visual Genome Attribute Ranking (VGARank).</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-horizon event forecasting is critical across various domains, including retail, finance, healthcare, and social networks. Traditional methods, such as Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPP), often rely on autoregressive models to predict multiple future events. However, these models frequently suffer from issues like converging to constant or repetitive outputs, which limits their effectiveness and general applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce DeTPP (Detection-based Temporal Point Processes), a novel approach inspired by object detection techniques from computer vision. DeTPP employs a unique matching-based loss function that selectively prioritizes reliably predictable events, improving the accuracy and diversity of predictions during inference. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art in long-horizon event forecasting, achieving up to a 77% relative improvement over existing MTPP and next-K methods. The proposed hybrid approach enhances the accuracy of next event prediction by up to 2.7% on a large transactional dataset. Notably, DeTPP is also among the fastest methods for inference. The implementation of DeTPP is publicly available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mouxiang Chen, Lefei Shen, Zhuo Li, Xiaoyun Joy Wang, Jianling Sun, Chenghao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting visual models may offer a ``free lunch'' for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yair Stolero, Itzik Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-cost gyroscope calibration is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of gyroscope measurements. Stationary calibration estimates the deterministic parts of measurement errors. To this end, a common practice is to average the gyroscope readings during a predefined period and estimate the gyroscope bias. Calibration duration plays a crucial role in performance, therefore, longer periods are preferred. However, some applications require quick startup times and calibration is therefore allowed only for a short time. In this work, we focus on reducing low-cost gyroscope calibration time using deep learning methods. We propose a deep-learning framework and explore the possibilities of using multiple real and virtual gyroscopes to improve the calibration performance of single gyroscopes. To train and validate our approach, we recorded a dataset consisting of 169 hours of gyroscope readings, using 24 gyroscopes of two different brands. We also created a virtual dataset consisting of simulated gyroscope readings. The two datasets were used to evaluate our proposed approach. One of our key achievements in this work is reducing gyroscope calibration time by up to 89% using three low-cost gyroscopes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sorin Grigorescu, Mihai Zaha</p>
<p>Abstract: The underlying framework for controlling autonomous robots and complex automation applications are Operating Systems (OS) capable of scheduling perception-and-control tasks, as well as providing real-time data communication to other robotic peers and remote cloud computers. In this paper, we introduce CyberCortex AI, a robotics OS designed to enable heterogeneous AI-based robotics and complex automation applications. CyberCortex AI is a decentralized distributed OS which enables robots to talk to each other, as well as to High Performance Computers (HPC) in the cloud. Sensory and control data from the robots is streamed towards HPC systems with the purpose of training AI algorithms, which are afterwards deployed on the robots. Each functionality of a robot (e.g. sensory data acquisition, path planning, motion control, etc.) is executed within a so-called DataBlock of Filters shared through the internet, where each filter is computed either locally on the robot itself, or remotely on a different robotic system. The data is stored and accessed via a so-called Temporal Addressable Memory (TAM), which acts as a gateway between each filter's input and output. CyberCortex.AI has two main components: i) the CyberCortex AI inference system, which is a real-time implementation of the DataBlock running on the robots' embedded hardware, and ii) the CyberCortex AI dojo, which runs on an HPC computer in the cloud, and it is used to design, train and deploy AI algorithms. We present a quantitative and qualitative performance analysis of the proposed approach using two collaborative robotics applications: i) a forest fires prevention system based on an Unitree A1 legged robot and an Anafi Parrot 4K drone, as well as ii) an autonomous driving system which uses CyberCortex.AI for collaborative perception and motion control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li-Wei Chen, Hung-Shin Lee, Chen-Chi Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces VoxHakka, a text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for Taiwanese Hakka, a critically under-resourced language spoken in Taiwan. Leveraging the YourTTS framework, VoxHakka achieves high naturalness and accuracy and low real-time factor in speech synthesis while supporting six distinct Hakka dialects. This is achieved by training the model with dialect-specific data, allowing for the generation of speaker-aware Hakka speech. To address the scarcity of publicly available Hakka speech corpora, we employed a cost-effective approach utilizing a web scraping pipeline coupled with automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based data cleaning techniques. This process ensured the acquisition of a high-quality, multi-speaker, multi-dialect dataset suitable for TTS training. Subjective listening tests conducted using comparative mean opinion scores (CMOS) demonstrate that VoxHakka significantly outperforms existing publicly available Hakka TTS systems in terms of pronunciation accuracy, tone correctness, and overall naturalness. This work represents a significant advancement in Hakka language technology and provides a valuable resource for language preservation and revitalization efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kavya Manohar, Leena G Pillai</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the pitfalls in evaluating multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, with a particular focus on Indic language scripts. We investigate the text normalization routine employed by leading ASR models, including OpenAI Whisper, Meta's MMS, Seamless, and Assembly AI's Conformer, and their unintended consequences on performance metrics. Our research reveals that current text normalization practices, while aiming to standardize ASR outputs for fair comparison, by removing inconsistencies such as variations in spelling, punctuation, and special characters, are fundamentally flawed when applied to Indic scripts. Through empirical analysis using text similarity scores and in-depth linguistic examination, we demonstrate that these flaws lead to artificially improved performance metrics for Indic languages. We conclude by proposing a shift towards developing text normalization routines that leverage native linguistic expertise, ensuring more robust and accurate evaluations of multilingual ASR models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Fu, Raviteja Anantha, Prabal Vashisht, Jianpeng Cheng, Etai Littwin</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating user intent from a sequence of user interface (UI) actions is a core challenge in comprehensive UI understanding. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to substantial progress in this area, but their demands for extensive model parameters, computing power, and high latency makes them impractical for scenarios requiring lightweight, on-device solutions with low latency or heightened privacy. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets has hindered the development of such lightweight models. To address these challenges, we propose UI-JEPA, a novel framework that employs masking strategies to learn abstract UI embeddings from unlabeled data through self-supervised learning, combined with an LLM decoder fine-tuned for user intent prediction. We also introduce two new UI-grounded multimodal datasets, "Intent in the Wild" (IIW) and "Intent in the Tame" (IIT), designed for few-shot and zero-shot UI understanding tasks. IIW consists of 1.7K videos across 219 intent categories, while IIT contains 914 videos across 10 categories. We establish the first baselines for these datasets, showing that representations learned using a JEPA-style objective, combined with an LLM decoder, can achieve user intent predictions that match the performance of state-of-the-art large MLLMs, but with significantly reduced annotation and deployment resources. Measured by intent similarity scores, UI-JEPA outperforms GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Sonnet by 10.0% and 7.2% respectively, averaged across two datasets. Notably, UI-JEPA accomplishes the performance with a 50.5x reduction in computational cost and a 6.6x improvement in latency in the IIW dataset. These results underscore the effectiveness of UI-JEPA, highlighting its potential for lightweight, high-performance UI understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Guo, Darui Lu, Gregory Szumel, Rongze Gui, Tingyu Wang, Nicholas Konz, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Medical images acquired using different scanners and protocols can differ substantially in their appearance. This phenomenon, scanner domain shift, can result in a drop in the performance of deep neural networks which are trained on data acquired by one scanner and tested on another. This significant practical issue is well-acknowledged, however, no systematic study of the issue is available across different modalities and diagnostic tasks. Materials and Methods: In this paper, we present a broad experimental study evaluating the impact of scanner domain shift on convolutional neural network performance for different automated diagnostic tasks. We evaluate this phenomenon in common radiological modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. Results: We find that network performance on data from a different scanner is almost always worse than on same-scanner data, and we quantify the degree of performance drop across different datasets. Notably, we find that this drop is most severe for MRI, moderate for X-ray, and quite small for CT, on average, which we attribute to the standardized nature of CT acquisition systems which is not present in MRI or X-ray. We also study how injecting varying amounts of target domain data into the training set, as well as adding noise to the training data, helps with generalization. Conclusion: Our results provide extensive experimental evidence and quantification of the extent of performance drop caused by scanner domain shift in deep learning across different modalities, with the goal of guiding the future development of robust deep learning models for medical image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintian Zhang, Cheng Peng, Mengshu Sun, Xiang Chen, Lei Liang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have significantly enhanced the generative capabilities for various NLP tasks, LLMs still face limitations in directly handling retrieval tasks. However, many practical applications demand the seamless integration of both retrieval and generation. This paper introduces a novel and efficient One-pass Generation and retrieval framework (OneGen), designed to improve LLMs' performance on tasks that require both generation and retrieval. The proposed framework bridges the traditionally separate training approaches for generation and retrieval by incorporating retrieval tokens generated autoregressively. This enables a single LLM to handle both tasks simultaneously in a unified forward pass. We conduct experiments on two distinct types of composite tasks, RAG and Entity Linking, to validate the pluggability, effectiveness, and efficiency of OneGen in training and inference. Furthermore, our results show that integrating generation and retrieval within the same context preserves the generative capabilities of LLMs while improving retrieval performance. To the best of our knowledge, OneGen is the first to enable LLMs to conduct vector retrieval during the generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sam Gijsen, Kerstin Ritter</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal language modeling constitutes a recent breakthrough which leverages advances in large language models to pretrain capable multimodal models. The integration of natural language during pretraining has been shown to significantly improve learned representations, particularly in computer vision. However, the efficacy of multimodal language modeling in the realm of functional brain data, specifically for advancing pathology detection, remains unexplored. This study pioneers EEG-language models trained on clinical reports and 15000 EEGs. We extend methods for multimodal alignment to this novel domain and investigate which textual information in reports is useful for training EEG-language models. Our results indicate that models learn richer representations from being exposed to a variety of report segments, including the patient's clinical history, description of the EEG, and the physician's interpretation. Compared to models exposed to narrower clinical text information, we find such models to retrieve EEGs based on clinical reports (and vice versa) with substantially higher accuracy. Yet, this is only observed when using a contrastive learning approach. Particularly in regimes with few annotations, we observe that representations of EEG-language models can significantly improve pathology detection compared to those of EEG-only models, as demonstrated by both zero-shot classification and linear probes. In sum, these results highlight the potential of integrating brain activity data with clinical text, suggesting that EEG-language models represent significant progress for clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixuan Huang, Yukang Yang, Kaidi Fu, Yanyi Chu, Le Cong, Mengdi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents RNAdiffusion, a latent diffusion model for generating and optimizing discrete RNA sequences of variable lengths. RNA is a key intermediary between DNA and protein, exhibiting high sequence diversity and complex three-dimensional structures to support a wide range of functions. We utilize pretrained BERT-type models to encode raw RNA sequences into token-level, biologically meaningful representations. A Query Transformer is employed to compress such representations into a set of fixed-length latent vectors, with an autoregressive decoder trained to reconstruct RNA sequences from these latent variables. We then develop a continuous diffusion model within this latent space. To enable optimization, we integrate the gradients of reward models--surrogates for RNA functional properties--into the backward diffusion process, thereby generating RNAs with high reward scores. Empirical results confirm that RNAdiffusion generates non-coding RNAs that align with natural distributions across various biological metrics. Further, we fine-tune the diffusion model on mRNA 5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) and optimize sequences for high translation efficiencies. Our guided diffusion model effectively generates diverse 5'-UTRs with high Mean Ribosome Loading (MRL) and Translation Efficiency (TE), outperforming baselines in balancing rewards and structural stability trade-off. Our findings hold potential for advancing RNA sequence-function research and therapeutic RNA design.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in guiding embodied agents to execute language instructions across a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and navigation. However, existing methods are primarily designed for static environments and do not leverage the agent's own experiences to refine its initial plans. Given that real-world environments are inherently stochastic, initial plans based solely on LLMs' general knowledge may fail to achieve their objectives, unlike in static scenarios. To address this limitation, this study introduces the Experience-and-Emotion Map (E2Map), which integrates not only LLM knowledge but also the agent's real-world experiences, drawing inspiration from human emotional responses. The proposed methodology enables one-shot behavior adjustments by updating the E2Map based on the agent's experiences. Our evaluation in stochastic navigation environments, including both simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrates that the proposed method significantly enhances performance in stochastic environments compared to existing LLM-based approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ellen Su, Anu Vellore, Amy Chang, Raffaele Mura, Blaine Nelson, Paul Kassianik, Amin Karbasi</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in society creates new information security challenges for developers, organizations, and end-users alike. LLMs are trained on large volumes of data, and their susceptibility to reveal the exact contents of the source training datasets poses security and safety risks. Although current alignment procedures restrict common risky behaviors, they do not completely prevent LLMs from leaking data. Prior work demonstrated that LLMs may be tricked into divulging training data by using out-of-distribution queries or adversarial techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple, query-based decompositional method to extract news articles from two frontier LLMs. We use instruction decomposition techniques to incrementally extract fragments of training data. Out of 3723 New York Times articles, we extract at least one verbatim sentence from 73 articles, and over 20% of verbatim sentences from 6 articles. Our analysis demonstrates that this method successfully induces the LLM to generate texts that are reliable reproductions of news articles, meaning that they likely originate from the source training dataset. This method is simple, generalizable, and does not fine-tune or change the production model. If replicable at scale, this training data extraction methodology could expose new LLM security and safety vulnerabilities, including privacy risks and unauthorized data leaks. These implications require careful consideration from model development to its end-use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhang Shang, Bingxin Xu, Weitai Kang, Mu Cai, Yuheng Li, Zehao Wen, Zhen Dong, Kurt Keutzer, Yong Jae Lee, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire various strategies for integrating video modalities. A key approach is Video-LLMs, which incorporate an optimizable interface linking sophisticated video encoders to LLMs. However, due to computation and data limitations, these Video-LLMs are typically pre-trained to process only short videos, limiting their broader application for understanding longer video content. Additionally, fine-tuning Video-LLMs to handle longer videos is cost-prohibitive. Consequently, it becomes essential to explore the interpolation of Video-LLMs under a completely training-free setting. In this paper, we first identify the primary challenges in interpolating Video-LLMs: (1) the video encoder and modality alignment projector are fixed, preventing the integration of additional frames into Video-LLMs, and (2) the LLM backbone is limited in its content length capabilities, which complicates the processing of an increased number of video tokens. To address these challenges, we propose a specific INTerPolation method for Video-LLMs (INTP-Video-LLMs). We introduce an alternative video token rearrangement technique that circumvents limitations imposed by the fixed video encoder and alignment projector. Furthermore, we introduce a training-free LLM context window extension method to enable Video-LLMs to understand a correspondingly increased number of visual tokens.</p>

<p>Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) focuses on extracting causal relations between events in texts. Existing methods for ECI primarily rely on causal features and external knowledge. However, these approaches fall short in two dimensions: (1) causal features between events in a text often lack explicit clues, and (2) external knowledge may introduce bias, while specific problems require tailored analyses. To address these issues, we propose SemDI - a simple and effective Semantic Dependency Inquiry Network for ECI. SemDI captures semantic dependencies within the context using a unified encoder. Then, it utilizes a Cloze Analyzer to generate a fill-in token based on comprehensive context understanding. Finally, this fill-in token is used to inquire about the causal relation between two events. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SemDI, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/hrlics/SemDI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghao Liu, Mingxiu Sui, Yi Nan, Cangqing Wang, Zhijie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective communication in automated chat systems hinges on the ability to understand and respond to context. Traditional models often struggle with determining when additional context is necessary for generating appropriate responses. This paper introduces Context-Aware BERT (CA-BERT), a transformer-based model specifically fine-tuned to address this challenge. CA-BERT innovatively applies deep learning techniques to discern context necessity in multi-turn chat interactions, enhancing both the relevance and accuracy of responses.
  We describe the development of CA-BERT, which adapts the robust architecture of BERT with a novel training regimen focused on a specialized dataset of chat dialogues. The model is evaluated on its ability to classify context necessity, demonstrating superior performance over baseline BERT models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, CA-BERT's implementation showcases significant reductions in training time and resource usage, making it feasible for real-time applications.
  The results indicate that CA-BERT can effectively enhance the functionality of chatbots by providing a nuanced understanding of context, thereby improving user experience and interaction quality in automated systems. This study not only advances the field of NLP in chat applications but also provides a framework for future research into context-sensitive AI developments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panayiotis Christou, Shichu Chen, Xupeng Chen, Parijat Dube</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series forecasting has seen significant advancements with the introduction of token prediction mechanisms such as multi-head attention. However, these methods often struggle to achieve the same performance as in language modeling, primarily due to the quadratic computational cost and the complexity of capturing long-range dependencies in time-series data. State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have shown promise in addressing these challenges by offering efficient solutions with linear RNNs capable of modeling long sequences with larger context windows. However, there remains room for improvement in accuracy and scalability.
  We propose the use of Test-Time Training (TTT) modules in a parallel architecture to enhance performance in long-term time series forecasting. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that TTT modules consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including the Mamba-based TimeMachine, particularly in scenarios involving extended sequence and prediction lengths. Our results show significant improvements in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), especially on larger datasets such as Electricity, Traffic, and Weather, underscoring the effectiveness of TTT in capturing long-range dependencies. Additionally, we explore various convolutional architectures within the TTT framework, showing that even simple configurations like 1D convolution with small filters can achieve competitive results. This work sets a new benchmark for time-series forecasting and lays the groundwork for future research in scalable, high-performance forecasting models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mastering medical knowledge is crucial for medical-specific LLMs. However, despite the existence of medical benchmarks like MedQA, a unified framework that fully leverages existing knowledge bases to evaluate LLMs' mastery of medical knowledge is still lacking. In the study, we propose a novel framework PretexEval that dynamically generates reliable and diverse test samples to evaluate LLMs for any given medical knowledge base. We notice that test samples produced directly from knowledge bases by templates or LLMs may introduce factual errors and also lack diversity. To address these issues, we introduce a novel schema into our proposed evaluation framework that employs predicate equivalence transformations to produce a series of variants for any given medical knowledge point. Finally, these produced predicate variants are converted into textual language, resulting in a series of reliable and diverse test samples to evaluate whether LLMs fully master the given medical factual knowledge point. Here, we use our proposed framework to systematically investigate the mastery of medical factual knowledge of 12 well-known LLMs, based on two knowledge bases that are crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The evaluation results illustrate that current LLMs still exhibit significant deficiencies in fully mastering medical knowledge, despite achieving considerable success on some famous public benchmarks. These new findings provide valuable insights for developing medical-specific LLMs, highlighting that current LLMs urgently need to strengthen their comprehensive and in-depth mastery of medical knowledge before being applied to real-world medical scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cassandra A. Cohen, William W. Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a variant of chain of thought (CoT) prompting called Program Trace Prompting that makes explanations more observable while preserving the power, generality and flexibility of CoT. In our approach, few-shot CoT demonstrations are wrapped in a formal syntax based on Python, and each prompt: identifies and names steps; defines the input/output behavior of steps; and replaces CoT explanations of in-context examples with chains of these formalized steps on the same examples. Program Trace Prompting is applicable to many tasks, achieving strong results on the 23 diverse tasks in the BIG-Bench Hard benchmark. More importantly, by instrumenting explanations in this way, we enable new types of analysis. In particular, we identify "non-local errors" (which correspond to incorrectly learning the reasoning method illustrated in the demonstrations) as an unaddressed issue in CoT learning, and we present methods for verifying the modularity of steps in a CoT explanation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable training results by freezing the original weights and training only low-rank matrices, establishing itself as the predominant fine-tuning method for LLMs. In pursuit of performance closer to full-parameter training, a series of LoRA variants have emerged, such as LoRA+, PISSA, Olora, and LoRA-GA. However, these improvements complicate the initial setup of model training and increase initialization time. More importantly, they overlook the internal interactions of the original weight information. To address these issues, we introduce a novel theory, ``Weight Guide'' aimed at continuously guiding trainable matrices through the original weights during training to enhance the utilization of weight information. Based on this theory, we designed a new PEFT technique called Bone (\textbf{B}l\textbf{o}ck Affi\textbf{ne}), which not only enhances the utilization of original weight information but also emphasizes the internal connections between weights, leading to faster convergence and better data fitting. Experimental comparisons across two different LLM architectures (LLaMA2, RWKV6) and various parameter scales demonstrate that the Bone structure can achieve rapid convergence and superior data fitting without the need for complex initialization. For example, when fine-tuning LLaMA2-7B on the MetaMathQA dataset and validating on GSM8k and math benchmarks, Bone achieved fine-tuning scores of 49.36 and 8.8, respectively, outperforming PISSA by 5.84\% and 1.96\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoming Shi, Shiyu Wang, Yuqi Nie, Dianqi Li, Zhou Ye, Qingsong Wen, Ming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheda Mai, Arpita Chowdhury, Ping Zhang, Cheng-Hao Tu, Hong-You Chen, Vardaan Pahuja, Tanya Berger-Wolf, Song Gao, Charles Stewart, Yu Su, Wei-Lun Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning is arguably the most straightforward way to tailor a pre-trained model (e.g., a foundation model) to downstream applications, but it also comes with the risk of losing valuable knowledge the model had learned in pre-training. For example, fine-tuning a pre-trained classifier capable of recognizing a large number of classes to master a subset of classes at hand is shown to drastically degrade the model's accuracy in the other classes it had previously learned. As such, it is hard to further use the fine-tuned model when it encounters classes beyond the fine-tuning data. In this paper, we systematically dissect the issue, aiming to answer the fundamental question, "What has been damaged in the fine-tuned model?" To our surprise, we find that the fine-tuned model neither forgets the relationship among the other classes nor degrades the features to recognize these classes. Instead, the fine-tuned model often produces more discriminative features for these other classes, even if they were missing during fine-tuning! {What really hurts the accuracy is the discrepant logit scales between the fine-tuning classes and the other classes}, implying that a simple post-processing calibration would bring back the pre-trained model's capability and at the same time unveil the feature improvement over all classes. We conduct an extensive empirical study to demonstrate the robustness of our findings and provide preliminary explanations underlying them, suggesting new directions for future theoretical analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheda Mai, Ping Zhang, Cheng-Hao Tu, Hong-You Chen, Li Zhang, Wei-Lun Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has attracted significant attention lately, due to the increasing size of pre-trained models and the need to fine-tune (FT) them for superior downstream performance. This community-wide enthusiasm has sparked a plethora of approaches. Nevertheless, a systematic study to understand their performance and suitable application scenarios is lacking, leaving questions like when to apply PETL and which approach to use largely unanswered. In this paper, we conduct a unifying empirical study of representative PETL methods in the context of Vision Transformers. We systematically tune their hyper-parameters to fairly compare their accuracy on downstream tasks. Our study not only offers a valuable user guide but also unveils several new insights. First, if tuned carefully, different PETL methods can obtain similar accuracy in the low-shot benchmark VTAB-1K. This includes simple methods like FT the bias terms that were reported inferior. Second, though with similar accuracy, we find that PETL methods make different mistakes and high-confidence predictions, likely due to their different inductive biases. Such an inconsistency (or complementariness) opens up the opportunity for ensemble methods, and we make preliminary attempts at this. Third, going beyond the commonly used low-shot tasks, we find that PETL is also useful in many-shot regimes -- it achieves comparable and sometimes better accuracy than full FT, using much fewer learnable parameters. Last but not least, we investigate PETL's ability to preserve a pre-trained model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g., a CLIP backbone). Perhaps not surprisingly, PETL methods outperform full FT alone. However, with weight-space ensembles, the fully fine-tuned model can better balance target (i.e., downstream) distribution and distribution shift performance, suggesting a future research direction for PETL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankit Maloo, Abhinav Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating domain-specific content using small language models poses challenges, especially when dealing with multiple distinct datasets with minimal overlap. In this study, we explore methods to enable a small language model to produce coherent and relevant outputs for two different domains: stories (Dataset A) and recipes (Dataset B). Our initial experiments show that training individual models on each dataset yields satisfactory results, with each model generating appropriate content within its domain. We find that utilizing custom tokenizers tailored to each dataset significantly enhances generation quality compared to using a generic tokenizer. Attempts to adapt a single model to both domains using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or standard fine-tuning do not yield substantial results, often failing to produce meaningful outputs. Moreover, full fine-tuning without freezing the model's existing weights leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses previously learned information and only retains knowledge from the new data. To overcome these challenges, we employ a knowledge expansion strategy: training only with additional parameters. This approach enables the model to generate both stories and recipes upon request, effectively handling multiple domains without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge expansion with frozen layers is an effective method for small language models to generate domain-specific content across distinct datasets. This work contributes to the development of efficient multi-domain language models and provides insights into managing catastrophic forgetting in small-scale architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanting Xie, So Yeon Min, Tianyi Zhang, Aarav Bajaj, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Yonatan Bisk</p>
<p>Abstract: There is no limit to how much a robot might explore and learn, but all of that knowledge needs to be searchable and actionable. Within language research, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has become the workhouse of large-scale non-parametric knowledge, however existing techniques do not directly transfer to the embodied domain, which is multimodal, data is highly correlated, and perception requires abstraction.
  To address these challenges, we introduce Embodied-RAG, a framework that enhances the foundational model of an embodied agent with a non-parametric memory system capable of autonomously constructing hierarchical knowledge for both navigation and language generation. Embodied-RAG handles a full range of spatial and semantic resolutions across diverse environments and query types, whether for a specific object or a holistic description of ambiance. At its core, Embodied-RAG's memory is structured as a semantic forest, storing language descriptions at varying levels of detail. This hierarchical organization allows the system to efficiently generate context-sensitive outputs across different robotic platforms. We demonstrate that Embodied-RAG effectively bridges RAG to the robotics domain, successfully handling over 200 explanation and navigation queries across 19 environments, highlighting its promise for general-purpose non-parametric system for embodied agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaepill Choi, Kyubyung Chae, Jiwoo Song, Yohan Jo, Taesup Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: In abstractive summarization, the challenge of producing concise and accurate summaries arises from the vast amount of information contained in the source document. Consequently, although Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, they often introduce inaccuracies by hallucinating content not found in the original source. While supervised fine-tuning methods that maximize likelihood contribute to this issue, they do not consistently enhance the faithfulness of the summaries. Preference-based optimization methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), can further refine the model to align with human preferences. However, these methods still heavily depend on costly human feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel and straightforward approach called Model-based Preference Optimization (MPO) to fine-tune LLMs for improved summarization abilities without any human feedback. By leveraging the model's inherent summarization capabilities, we create a preference dataset that is fully generated by the model using different decoding strategies. Our experiments on standard summarization datasets and various metrics demonstrate that our proposed MPO significantly enhances the quality of generated summaries without relying on human feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Chen, Xianghu Yue, Xiaoxue Gao, Chen Zhang, Luis Fernando D'Haro, Robby T. Tan, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Various audio-LLMs (ALLMs) have been explored recently for tackling different audio tasks simultaneously using a single, unified model. While existing evaluations of ALLMs primarily focus on single-audio tasks, real-world applications often involve processing multiple audio streams simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose the first multi-audio evaluation (MAE) benchmark that consists of 20 datasets from 11 multi-audio tasks encompassing both speech and sound scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on MAE demonstrate that the existing ALLMs, while being powerful in comprehending primary audio elements in individual audio inputs, struggling to handle multi-audio scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel multi-audio-LLM (MALLM) to capture audio context among multiple similar audios using discriminative learning on our proposed synthetic data. The results demonstrate that the proposed MALLM outperforms all baselines and achieves high data efficiency using synthetic data without requiring human annotations. The proposed MALLM opens the door for ALLMs towards multi-audio processing era and brings us closer to replicating human auditory capabilities in machines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Chen, Yue Song, Rui Wang, Xiaojun Wu, Nicu Sebe</p>
<p>Abstract: Riemannian neural networks, which extend deep learning techniques to Riemannian spaces, have gained significant attention in machine learning. To better classify the manifold-valued features, researchers have started extending Euclidean multinomial logistic regression (MLR) into Riemannian manifolds. However, existing approaches suffer from limited applicability due to their strong reliance on specific geometric properties. This paper proposes a framework for designing Riemannian MLR over general geometries, referred to as RMLR. Our framework only requires minimal geometric properties, thus exhibiting broad applicability and enabling its use with a wide range of geometries. Specifically, we showcase our framework on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold and special orthogonal group, i.e., the set of rotation matrices. On the SPD manifold, we develop five families of SPD MLRs under five types of power-deformed metrics. On rotation matrices we propose Lie MLR based on the popular bi-invariant metric. Extensive experiments on different Riemannian backbone networks validate the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahed Masoudian, Markus Frohmann, Navid Rekabsaz, Markus Schedl</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models frequently inherit societal biases from their training data. Numerous techniques have been proposed to mitigate these biases during both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. However, fine-tuning a pre-trained debiased language model on a downstream task can reintroduce biases into the model. Additionally, existing debiasing methods for downstream tasks either (i) require labels of protected attributes (e.g., age, race, or political views) that are often not available or (ii) rely on indicators of bias, which restricts their applicability to gender debiasing since they rely on gender-specific words. To address this, we introduce a novel debiasing regularization technique based on the class-wise variance of embeddings. Crucially, our method does not require attribute labels and targets any attribute, thus addressing the shortcomings of existing debiasing methods. Our experiments on encoder language models and three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing strong debiasing baselines that rely on target attribute labels while maintaining performance on the target task.</p>

Namely, we are the first to prove that, under very mild conditions, tabular average reward TD converges almost surely to a sample path dependent fixed point. Key to this success is a new general stochastic approximation result concerning nonexpansive mappings with Markovian and additive noise, built on recent advances in stochastic Krasnoselskii-Mann iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Zhang, Lu Li, Shuyan Wan, Sijie Wang, Zhiyi Wang, Zhiyuan Lu, Dong Hao, Wanli Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper discusses signed graphs, which model friendly or antagonistic relationships using edges marked with positive or negative signs, focusing on the task of link sign prediction. While Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have advanced, they face challenges like graph sparsity and unbalanced triangles. The authors propose using data augmentation (DA) techniques to address these issues, although many existing methods are not suitable for signed graphs due to a lack of side information. They highlight that the random DropEdge method, a rare DA approach applicable to signed graphs, does not enhance link sign prediction performance. In response, they introduce the Signed Graph Augmentation (SGA) framework, which includes a structure augmentation module to identify candidate edges and a strategy for selecting beneficial candidates, ultimately improving SGNN training. Experimental results show that SGA significantly boosts the performance of SGNN models, with a notable 32.3% improvement in F1-micro for SGCN on the Slashdot dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johan Bjorck, Alon Benhaim, Vishrav Chaudhary, Furu Wei, Xia Song</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art LLMs are powered by scaling -- scaling model size, dataset size and cluster size. It is economically infeasible to extensively tune hyperparameter for the largest runs. Instead, approximately optimal hyperparameters must be inferred or \textit{transferred} from smaller experiments. Hyperparameter transfer across model sizes has been studied in Yang et al. However, hyperparameter transfer across dataset size -- or token horizon -- has not been studied yet. To remedy this we conduct a large scale empirical study on how optimal learning rate (LR) depends on token horizon in LLM training. We first demonstrate that the optimal LR changes significantly with token horizon -- longer training necessitates smaller LR. Secondly we demonstrate the the optimal LR follows a scaling law, and that the optimal LR for longer horizons can be accurately estimated from shorter horizons via such scaling laws. We also provide a rule-of-thumb for transferring LR across token horizons with zero overhead over current practices. Lastly we provide evidence that LLama-1 used too high LR, and estimate the performance hit from this. We thus argue that hyperparameter transfer across data size is an important and overlooked component of LLM training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ganchao Wei, Li Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow matching (FM) is a family of training algorithms for fitting continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). A standard approach to FM, called conditional flow matching (CFM), exploits the fact that the marginal vector field of a CNF can be learned by fitting least-square regression to the so-called conditional vector field specified given one or both ends of the flow path. We show that viewing CFM training from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective on parameter estimation opens the door to generalizations of CFM algorithms. We propose one such extension by introducing a CFM algorithm based on defining conditional probability paths given what we refer to as ``streams'', instances of latent stochastic paths that connect pairs of noise and observed data. Further, we advocates the modeling of these latent streams using Gaussian processes (GPs). The unique distributional properties of GPs, and in particular the fact that the velocities of a GP is still a GP, allows drawing samples from the resulting stream-augmented conditional probability path without simulating the actual streams, and hence the ``simulation-free" nature of CFM training is preserved. We show that this generalization of the CFM can substantially reduce the variance in the estimated marginal vector field at a moderate computational cost, thereby improving the quality of the generated samples under common metrics. Additionally, we show that adopting the GP on the streams allows for flexibly linking multiple related training data points (e.g., time series) and incorporating additional prior information. We empirically validate our claim through both simulations and applications to two hand-written image datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noel Loo, Fotis Iliopoulos, Wei Hu, Erik Vee</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a promising approach for transferring knowledge from a larger, more complex teacher model to a smaller student model. Traditionally, KD involves training the student to mimic the teacher's output probabilities, while more advanced techniques have explored guiding the student to adopt the teacher's internal representations. Despite its widespread success, the performance of KD in binary classification and few-class problems has been less satisfactory. This is because the information about the teacher model's generalization patterns scales directly with the number of classes. Moreover, several sophisticated distillation methods may not be universally applicable or effective for data types beyond Computer Vision. Consequently, effective distillation techniques remain elusive for a range of key real-world applications, such as sentiment analysis, search query understanding, and advertisement-query relevance assessment. Taking these observations into account, we introduce a novel method for distilling knowledge from the teacher's model representations, which we term Learning Embedding Linear Projections (LELP). Inspired by recent findings about the structure of final-layer representations, LELP works by identifying informative linear subspaces in the teacher's embedding space, and splitting them into pseudo-subclasses. The student model is then trained to replicate these pseudo-classes. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale NLP benchmarks like Amazon Reviews and Sentiment140 demonstrate the LELP is consistently competitive with, and typically superior to, existing state-of-the-art distillation algorithms for binary and few-class problems, where most KD methods suffer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre D\'efossez, Laurent Mazar\'e, Manu Orsini, Am\'elie Royer, Patrick P\'erez, Herv\'e J\'egou, Edouard Grave, Neil Zeghidour</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Moshi, a speech-text foundation model and full-duplex spoken dialogue framework. Current systems for spoken dialogue rely on pipelines of independent components, namely voice activity detection, speech recognition, textual dialogue and text-to-speech. Such frameworks cannot emulate the experience of real conversations. First, their complexity induces a latency of several seconds between interactions. Second, text being the intermediate modality for dialogue, non-linguistic information that modifies meaning -- such as emotion or non-speech sounds -- is lost in the interaction. Finally, they rely on a segmentation into speaker turns, which does not take into account overlapping speech, interruptions and interjections. Moshi solves these independent issues altogether by casting spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech generation. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. We moreover extend the hierarchical semantic-to-acoustic token generation of previous work to first predict time-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. Not only this "Inner Monologue" method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated speech, but we also illustrate how it can provide streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech. Our resulting model is the first real-time full-duplex spoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in practice, and is available at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi.</p>

Through an expanded set of interactions, including social and tool-based engagements as well as spatial reasoning, our framework facilitates the creation of rich, diverse virtual environments. Findings from a preliminary user study (N=12) provide insight into the user experience of this approach, how social contexts shape the prompting of spatial environments, and perspective on social applications of prompt-based 3D co-creation. In addition to highlighting the potential of AI-supported multi-user world creation and offering new pathways for AI-augmented creative processes in VR, this article presents a set of implications for designing human-centered interfaces that incorporate AI models into 3D content generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroaki Chiba-Okabe</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic approach to analyzing copyright infringement disputes by formalizing relevant judicial principles within a coherent framework based on the random-worlds method. The approach provides a structured analysis of key evidentiary principles, with particular emphasis on the "inverse ratio rule"--a controversial doctrine adopted by some courts. Although this rule has faced significant criticism, a formal proof demonstrates its validity, provided it is properly defined. Additionally, the paper examines the heightened copyright risks posed by generative AI, highlighting how extensive access to copyrighted material by generative models increases the risk of infringement. Utilizing the probabilistic approach, the Near Access-Free (NAF) condition, previously proposed as a potential mitigation strategy, is evaluated. The analysis reveals that while the NAF condition mitigates some infringement risks, its justifiability and efficacy are questionable in certain contexts. These findings demonstrate how a rigorous probabilistic approach can advance our understanding of copyright jurisprudence and its interaction with emerging technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco N. F. Q. Simoes, Mehdi Dastani, Thijs van Ommen</p>
<p>Abstract: To effectively study complex causal systems, it is often useful to construct representations that simplify parts of the system by discarding irrelevant details while preserving key features. The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is a widely used approach in representation learning that compresses random variables while retaining information about a target variable. Traditional methods like IB are purely statistical and ignore underlying causal structures, making them ill-suited for causal tasks. We propose the Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), a causal extension of the IB, which compresses a set of chosen variables while maintaining causal control over a target variable. This method produces representations which are causally interpretable, and which can be used when reasoning about interventions. We present experimental results demonstrating that the learned representations accurately capture causality as intended.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saurav Jha, Shiqi Yang, Masato Ishii, Mengjie Zhao, Christian Simon, Muhammad Jehanzeb Mirza, Dong Gong, Lina Yao, Shusuke Takahashi, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized text-to-image diffusion models have grown popular for their ability to efficiently acquire a new concept from user-defined text descriptions and a few images. However, in the real world, a user may wish to personalize a model on multiple concepts but one at a time, with no access to the data from previous concepts due to storage/privacy concerns. When faced with this continual learning (CL) setup, most personalization methods fail to find a balance between acquiring new concepts and retaining previous ones -- a challenge that continual personalization (CP) aims to solve. Inspired by the successful CL methods that rely on class-specific information for regularization, we resort to the inherent class-conditioned density estimates, also known as diffusion classifier (DC) scores, for continual personalization of text-to-image diffusion models. Namely, we propose using DC scores for regularizing the parameter-space and function-space of text-to-image diffusion models, to achieve continual personalization. Using several diverse evaluation setups, datasets, and metrics, we show that our proposed regularization-based CP methods outperform the state-of-the-art C-LoRA, and other baselines. Finally, by operating in the replay-free CL setup and on low-rank adapters, our method incurs zero storage and parameter overhead, respectively, over the state-of-the-art.</p>
