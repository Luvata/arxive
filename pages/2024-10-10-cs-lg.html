<p><b>Authors:</b> Sizhuang He, Daniel Levine, Ivan Vrkic, Marco Francesco Bressana, David Zhang, Syed Asad Rizvi, Yangtian Zhang, Emanuele Zappala, David van Dijk</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce CaLMFlow (Causal Language Models for Flow Matching), a novel framework that casts flow matching as a Volterra integral equation (VIE), leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) for continuous data generation. CaLMFlow enables the direct application of LLMs to learn complex flows by formulating flow matching as a sequence modeling task, bridging discrete language modeling and continuous generative modeling. Our method implements tokenization across space and time, thereby solving a VIE over these domains. This approach enables efficient handling of high-dimensional data and outperforms ODE solver-dependent methods like conditional flow matching (CFM). We demonstrate CaLMFlow's effectiveness on synthetic and real-world data, including single-cell perturbation response prediction, showcasing its ability to incorporate textual context and generalize to unseen conditions. Our results highlight LLM-driven flow matching as a promising paradigm in generative modeling, offering improved scalability, flexibility, and context-awareness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinnan Dai, Haohao Qu, Yifen Shen, Bohang Zhang, Qihao Wen, Wenqi Fan, Dongsheng Li, Jiliang Tang, Caihua Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarking the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in graph-related tasks is becoming an increasingly popular and crucial area of research. Recent studies have shown that LLMs exhibit a preliminary ability to understand graph structures and node features. However, the potential of LLMs in graph pattern mining remains largely unexplored. This is a key component in fields such as computational chemistry, biology, and social network analysis. To bridge this gap, this work introduces a comprehensive benchmark to assess LLMs' capabilities in graph pattern tasks. We have developed a benchmark that evaluates whether LLMs can understand graph patterns based on either terminological or topological descriptions. Additionally, our benchmark tests the LLMs' capacity to autonomously discover graph patterns from data. The benchmark encompasses both synthetic and real datasets, and a variety of models, with a total of 11 tasks and 7 models. Our experimental framework is designed for easy expansion to accommodate new models and datasets. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs have preliminary abilities to understand graph patterns, with O1-mini outperforming in the majority of tasks; (2) Formatting input data to align with the knowledge acquired during pretraining can enhance performance; (3) The strategies employed by LLMs may differ from those used in conventional algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: To enhance the accuracy of power load forecasting in wind farms, this study introduces an advanced combined forecasting method that integrates Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) with an Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm to optimize the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Initially, the VMD algorithm is employed to perform high-precision modal decomposition of the original power load data, which is then categorized into high-frequency and low-frequency sequences based on mutual information entropy theory. Subsequently, this research profoundly modifies the traditional multiverse optimizer by incorporating Tent chaos mapping, exponential travel distance rate, and an elite reverse learning mechanism, developing the IPSO-ELM prediction model. This model independently predicts the high and low-frequency sequences and reconstructs the data to achieve the final forecasting results. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves prediction accuracy and convergence speed compared to traditional ELM, PSO-ELM, and PSO-ELM methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilong Li, Jingyu Liu, Hao Zhang, M Badri Narayanan, Utkarsh Sharma, Shuai Zhang, Pan Hu, Yijing Zeng, Jayaram Raghuram, Suman Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) locally on mobile devices is advantageous in scenarios where transmitting data to remote cloud servers is either undesirable due to privacy concerns or impractical due to network connection. Recent advancements (MLC, 2023a; Gerganov, 2023) have facilitated the local deployment of LLMs. However, local deployment also presents challenges, particularly in balancing quality (generative performance), latency, and throughput within the hardware constraints of mobile devices. In this paper, we introduce our lightweight, all-in-one automated benchmarking framework that allows users to evaluate LLMs on mobile devices. We provide a comprehensive benchmark of various popular LLMs with different quantization configurations (both weights and activations) across multiple mobile platforms with varying hardware capabilities. Unlike traditional benchmarks that assess full-scale models on high-end GPU clusters, we focus on evaluating resource efficiency (memory and power consumption) and harmful output for compressed models on mobile devices. Our key observations include i) differences in energy efficiency and throughput across mobile platforms; ii) the impact of quantization on memory usage, GPU execution time, and power consumption; and iii) accuracy and performance degradation of quantized models compared to their non-quantized counterparts; and iv) the frequency of hallucinations and toxic content generated by compressed LLMs on mobile devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Zou, Xuyang Liu, Ting Liu, Siteng Huang, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenwen Liang, Ye Liu, Tong Niu, Xiangliang Zhang, Yingbo Zhou, Semih Yavuz</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in the general capability of large language models (LLMs), they continue to struggle with consistent and accurate reasoning, especially in complex tasks such as mathematical and code reasoning. One key limitation is that LLMs are trained primarily on correct solutions, reducing their ability to detect and learn from errors, which hampers their ability to reliably verify and rank outputs. To address this, we scale up the inference-time computation by generating multiple reasoning paths and employing verifiers to assess and rank the generated outputs by correctness. To facilitate this, we introduce a comprehensive dataset consisting of correct and incorrect solutions for math and code tasks, generated by multiple LLMs. This diverse set of solutions enables verifiers to more effectively distinguish and rank correct answers from erroneous outputs. The training methods for building verifiers were selected based on an extensive comparison of existing approaches. Moreover, to leverage the unique strengths of different reasoning strategies, we propose a novel collaborative method integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-of-Thought (PoT) solutions for verification. CoT provides a clear, step-by-step reasoning process that enhances interpretability, while PoT, being executable, offers a precise and error-sensitive validation mechanism. By taking both of their strengths, our approach significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of reasoning verification. Our verifiers, Math-Rev and Code-Rev, demonstrate substantial performance gains to existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks such as GSM8k and MATH and even outperforming GPT-4o with Qwen-72B-Instruct as the reasoner.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05323">From Incomplete Coarse-Grained to Complete Fine-Grained: A Two-Stage Framework for Spatiotemporal Data Reconstruction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Sun, Haoyang Su, En Wang, Funing Yang, Yongjian Yang, Wenbin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of various sensing devices, spatiotemporal data is becoming increasingly important nowadays. However, due to sensing costs and privacy concerns, the collected data is often incomplete and coarse-grained, limiting its application to specific tasks. To address this, we propose a new task called spatiotemporal data reconstruction, which aims to infer complete and fine-grained data from sparse and coarse-grained observations. To achieve this, we introduce a two-stage data inference framework, DiffRecon, grounded in the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). In the first stage, we present Diffusion-C, a diffusion model augmented by ST-PointFormer, a powerful encoder designed to leverage the spatial correlations between sparse data points. Following this, the second stage introduces Diffusion-F, which incorporates the proposed T-PatternNet to capture the temporal pattern within sequential data. Together, these two stages form an end-to-end framework capable of inferring complete, fine-grained data from incomplete and coarse-grained observations. We conducted experiments on multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05326">Early-Cycle Internal Impedance Enables ML-Based Battery Cycle Life Predictions Across Manufacturers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tyler Sours, Shivang Agarwal, Marc Cormier, Jordan Crivelli-Decker, Steffen Ridderbusch, Stephen L. Glazier, Connor P. Aiken, Aayush R. Singh, Ang Xiao, Omar Allam</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the end-of-life (EOL) of lithium-ion batteries across different manufacturers presents significant challenges due to variations in electrode materials, manufacturing processes, cell formats, and a lack of generally available data. Methods that construct features solely on voltage-capacity profile data typically fail to generalize across cell chemistries. This study introduces a methodology that combines traditional voltage-capacity features with Direct Current Internal Resistance (DCIR) measurements, enabling more accurate and generalizable EOL predictions. The use of early-cycle DCIR data captures critical degradation mechanisms related to internal resistance growth, enhancing model robustness. Models are shown to successfully predict the number of cycles to EOL for unseen manufacturers of varied electrode composition with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 150 cycles. This cross-manufacturer generalizability reduces the need for extensive new data collection and retraining, enabling manufacturers to optimize new battery designs using existing datasets. Additionally, a novel DCIR-compatible dataset is released as part of ongoing efforts to enrich the growing ecosystem of cycling data and accelerate battery materials development.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05328">Reward Learning From Preference With Ties</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinsong Liu, Dongdong Ge, Ruihao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward learning plays a pivotal role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), ensuring the alignment of language models. The Bradley-Terry (BT) model stands as the prevalent choice for capturing human preferences from datasets containing pairs of chosen and rejected responses. In preference modeling, the focus is not on absolute values but rather on the reward difference between chosen and rejected responses, referred to as preference strength. Thus, precise evaluation of preference strength holds paramount importance in preference modeling. However, an easily overlooked factor significantly affecting preference strength measurement is that human attitudes towards two responses may not solely indicate a preference for one over the other and ties are also a common occurrence. To address this, we propose the adoption of the generalized Bradley-Terry model -- the Bradley-Terry model with ties (BTT) -- to accommodate tied preferences, thus leveraging additional information. We prove that even with the access to the true distributions of prompt and response, disregarding ties can lead to a notable bias in preference strength measurement. Comprehensive experiments further validate the advantages of incorporating ties in preference modeling. Notably, fine-tuning with BTT significantly outperforms fine-tuning with BT on synthetic preference datasets with ties, labeled by state-of-the-art open-source LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divya Jyoti Bajpai, Manjesh Kumar Hanawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various domains. However, their large size is a challenge for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as mobile, edge, and IoT platforms. To overcome this, a distributed inference setup can be used where a small-sized DNN (initial few layers) can be deployed on mobile, a bigger version on the edge, and the full-fledged, on the cloud. A sample that has low complexity (easy) could be then inferred on mobile, that has moderate complexity (medium) on edge, and higher complexity (hard) on the cloud. As the complexity of each sample is not known beforehand, the following question arises in distributed inference: how to decide complexity so that it is processed by enough layers of DNNs. We develop a novel approach named DIMEE that utilizes Early Exit (EE) strategies developed to minimize inference latency in DNNs. DIMEE aims to improve the accuracy, taking into account the offloading cost from mobile to edge/cloud. Experimental validation on GLUE datasets, encompassing various NLP tasks, shows that our method significantly reduces the inference cost (> 43%) while maintaining a minimal drop in accuracy (< 0.3%) compared to the case where all the inference is made in cloud.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamel Alrashedy, Pradyumna Tambwekar, Zulfiqar Zaidi, Megan Langwasser, Wei Xu, Matthew Gombolay</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI has transformed the fields of Design and Manufacturing by providing efficient and automated methods for generating and modifying 3D objects. One approach involves using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate Computer- Aided Design (CAD) scripting code, which can then be executed to render a 3D object; however, the resulting 3D object may not meet the specified requirements. Testing the correctness of CAD generated code is challenging due to the complexity and structure of 3D objects (e.g., shapes, surfaces, and dimensions) that are not feasible in code. In this paper, we introduce CADCodeVerify, a novel approach to iteratively verify and improve 3D objects generated from CAD code. Our approach works by producing ameliorative feedback by prompting a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate and answer a set of validation questions to verify the generated object and prompt the VLM to correct deviations. To evaluate CADCodeVerify, we introduce, CADPrompt, the first benchmark for CAD code generation, consisting of 200 natural language prompts paired with expert-annotated scripting code for 3D objects to benchmark progress. Our findings show that CADCodeVerify improves VLM performance by providing visual feedback, enhancing the structure of the 3D objects, and increasing the success rate of the compiled program. When applied to GPT-4, CADCodeVerify achieved a 7.30% reduction in Point Cloud distance and a 5.0% improvement in success rate compared to prior work</p>

<p>Abstract: Classifiers trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) tend to rely on attributes that have high spurious correlation with the target. This can degrade the performance on underrepresented (or 'minority') groups that lack these attributes, posing significant challenges for both out-of-distribution generalization and fairness objectives. Many studies aim to enhance robustness to spurious correlation, but they sometimes depend on group annotations for training. Additionally, a common limitation in previous research is the reliance on group-annotated validation datasets for model selection. This constrains their applicability in situations where the nature of the spurious correlation is not known, or when group labels for certain spurious attributes are not available. To enhance model robustness with minimal group annotation assumptions, we propose Environment-based Validation and Loss-based Sampling (EVaLS). It uses the losses from an ERM-trained model to construct a balanced dataset of high-loss and low-loss samples, mitigating group imbalance in data. This significantly enhances robustness to group shifts when equipped with a simple post-training last layer retraining. By using environment inference methods to create diverse environments with correlation shifts, EVaLS can potentially eliminate the need for group annotation in validation data. In this context, the worst environment accuracy acts as a reliable surrogate throughout the retraining process for tuning hyperparameters and finding a model that performs well across diverse group shifts. EVaLS effectively achieves group robustness, showing that group annotation is not necessary even for validation. It is a fast, straightforward, and effective approach that reaches near-optimal worst group accuracy without needing group annotations, marking a new chapter in the robustness of trained models against spurious correlation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Zhang, Junhong Ye, Xingjun Ma, Yige Li, Yunfan Yang, Jitao Sang, Dit-Yan Yeung</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to their multimodal capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have found numerous impactful applications in real-world scenarios. However, recent studies have revealed that VLMs are vulnerable to image-based adversarial attacks, particularly targeted adversarial images that manipulate the model to generate harmful content specified by the adversary. Current attack methods rely on predefined target labels to create targeted adversarial attacks, which limits their scalability and applicability for large-scale robustness evaluations. In this paper, we propose AnyAttack, a self-supervised framework that generates targeted adversarial images for VLMs without label supervision, allowing any image to serve as a target for the attack. To address the limitation of existing methods that require label supervision, we introduce a contrastive loss that trains a generator on a large-scale unlabeled image dataset, LAION-400M dataset, for generating targeted adversarial noise. This large-scale pre-training endows our method with powerful transferability across a wide range of VLMs. Extensive experiments on five mainstream open-source VLMs (CLIP, BLIP, BLIP2, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) across three multimodal tasks (image-text retrieval, multimodal classification, and image captioning) demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. Additionally, we successfully transfer AnyAttack to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google's Gemini, Claude's Sonnet, and Microsoft's Copilot. These results reveal an unprecedented risk to VLMs, highlighting the need for effective countermeasures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tai-Lin Wu, Ti-Rong Wu, Chung-Chin Shih, Yan-Ru Ju, I-Chen Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although AlphaZero has achieved superhuman levels in Go, recent research has highlighted its vulnerability in particular situations requiring a more comprehensive understanding of the entire board. To address this challenge, this paper introduces ResTNet, a network that interleaves residual networks and Transformer. Our empirical experiments demonstrate several advantages of using ResTNet. First, it not only improves playing strength but also enhances the ability of global information. Second, it defends against an adversary Go program, called cyclic-adversary, tailor-made for attacking AlphaZero algorithms, significantly reducing the average probability of being attacked rate from 70.44% to 23.91%. Third, it improves the accuracy from 59.15% to 80.01% in correctly recognizing ladder patterns, which are one of the challenging patterns for Go AIs. Finally, ResTNet offers a potential explanation of the decision-making process and can also be applied to other games like Hex. To the best of our knowledge, ResTNet is the first to integrate residual networks and Transformer in the context of AlphaZero for board games, suggesting a promising direction for enhancing AlphaZero's global understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal missingness, defined as unobserved patterns in time series, and its predictive potentials represent an emerging area in clinical machine learning. We trained a gated recurrent unit with decay mechanisms, called GRU-D, for a binary classification between elderly - and young patients. We extracted time series for 5 vital signs from MIMIC-IV as model inputs. GRU-D was evaluated with means of 0.780 AUROC and 0.810 AUPRC on bootstrapped data. Interpreting trained model parameters, we found differences in blood pressure missingness and respiratory rate missingness as important predictors learned by parameterized hidden gated units. We successfully showed how GRU-D can be used to reveal patterns in temporal missingness building the basis of novel research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianzhi Yu, Xinni Zhang, Yankai Chen, Aiwei Liu, Yifei Zhang, Philip S. Yu, Irwin King</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to empower machine learning models to learn continually from new data, while building upon previously acquired knowledge without forgetting. As machine learning models have evolved from small to large pre-trained architectures, and from supporting unimodal to multimodal data, multimodal continual learning (MMCL) methods have recently emerged. The primary challenge of MMCL is that it goes beyond a simple stacking of unimodal CL methods, as such straightforward approaches often yield unsatisfactory performance. In this work, we present the first comprehensive survey on MMCL. We provide essential background knowledge and MMCL settings, as well as a structured taxonomy of MMCL methods. We categorize existing MMCL methods into four categories, i.e., regularization-based, architecture-based, replay-based, and prompt-based methods, explaining their methodologies and highlighting their key innovations. Additionally, to prompt further research in this field, we summarize open MMCL datasets and benchmarks, and discuss several promising future directions for investigation and development. We have also created a GitHub repository for indexing relevant MMCL papers and open resources available at https://github.com/LucyDYu/Awesome-Multimodal-Continual-Learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Riccardo Crescenzi</p>
<p>Abstract: The unprecedented pace of machine learning research has lead to incredible advances, but also poses hard challenges. At present, the field lacks strong theoretical underpinnings, and many important achievements stem from ad hoc design choices which are hard to justify in principle and whose effectiveness often goes unexplained. Research debt is increasing and many papers are found not to be reproducible.
  This thesis is a survey that covers some recent work attempting to study machine learning categorically. Category theory is a branch of abstract mathematics that has found successful applications in many fields, both inside and outside mathematics. Acting as a lingua franca of mathematics and science, category theory might be able to give a unifying structure to the field of machine learning. This could solve some of the aforementioned problems.
  In this work, we mainly focus on the application of category theory to deep learning. Namely, we discuss the use of categorical optics to model gradient-based learning, the use of categorical algebras and integral transforms to link classical computer science to neural networks, the use of functors to link different layers of abstraction and preserve structure, and, finally, the use of string diagrams to provide detailed representations of neural network architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wireless networks supporting artificial intelligence have gained significant attention, with Over-the-Air Federated Learning emerging as a key application due to its unique transmission and distributed computing characteristics. This paper derives error bounds for Over-the-Air Federated Learning in a Cell-free MIMO system and formulates an optimization problem to minimize optimality gap via joint optimization of power control and beamforming. We introduce the MOP-LOFPC algorithm, which employs Lyapunov optimization to decouple long-term constraints across rounds while requiring only causal channel state information. Experimental results demonstrate that MOP-LOFPC achieves a better and more flexible trade-off between the model's training loss and adherence to long-term power constraints compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Miao, Zida Liu, Jun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection of malicious social bots has become a crucial task, as bots can be easily deployed and manipulated to spread disinformation, promote conspiracy messages, and more. Most existing approaches utilize graph neural networks (GNNs)to capture both user profle and structural features,achieving promising progress. However, they still face limitations including the expensive training on large underlying graph, the performance degration when similar neighborhood patterns' assumption preferred by GNNs is not satisfied, and the dynamic features of bots in a highly adversarial context. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method named BSG4Bot with an intuition that GNNs training on Biased SubGraphs can improve both performance and time/space efficiency in bot detection. Specifically, BSG4Bot first pre-trains a classifier on node features efficiently to define the node similarities, and constructs biased subgraphs by combining the similarities computed by the pre-trained classifier and the node importances computed by Personalized PageRank (PPR scores). BSG4Bot then introduces a heterogeneous GNN over the constructed subgraphs to detect bots effectively and efficiently. The relatively stable features, including the content category and temporal activity features, are explored and incorporated into BSG4Bot after preliminary verification on sample data. The extensive experimental studies show that BSG4Bot outperforms the state-of-the-art bot detection methods, while only needing nearly 1/5 training time.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across tasks and specialized domains, scaling LLMs based on existing models has garnered significant attention, which faces the challenge of decreasing performance when combining disparate models. Various techniques have been proposed for the aggregation of pre-trained LLMs, including model merging, Mixture-of-Experts, and stacking. Despite their merits, a comprehensive comparison and synergistic application of them to a diverse model zoo is yet to be adequately addressed. In light of this research gap, this paper introduces Model-GLUE, a holistic LLM scaling guideline. First, our work starts with a benchmarking of existing LLM scaling techniques, especially selective merging, and variants of mixture. Utilizing the insights from the benchmark results, we formulate an strategy for the selection and aggregation of a heterogeneous model zoo characterizing different architectures and initialization. Our methodology involves the clustering of mergeable models and optimal merging strategy selection, and the integration of clusters through a model mixture. Finally, evidenced by our experiments on a diverse Llama-2-based model zoo, Model-GLUE shows an average performance enhancement of 5.61%, achieved without additional training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shambhavi Mishra, T. Satyanarayana Murthy</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern urban centers, effective transportation management poses a significant challenge, with traffic jams and inconsistent travel durations greatly affecting commuters and logistics operations. This study introduces a novel method for enhancing urban mobility by combining machine learning algorithms with live traffic information. We developed predictive models for journey time and congestion analysis using data from New York City's yellow taxi trips. The research employed a spatiotemporal analysis framework to identify traffic trends and implemented real-time route optimization using the GraphHopper API. This system determines the most efficient paths based on current conditions, adapting to changes in traffic flow. The methodology utilizes Spark MLlib for predictive modeling and Spark Streaming for processing data in real-time. By integrating historical data analysis with current traffic inputs, our system shows notable enhancements in both travel time forecasts and route optimization, demonstrating its potential for widespread application in major urban areas. This research contributes to ongoing efforts aimed at reducing urban congestion and improving transportation efficiency through advanced data-driven methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forensic analysts often use social media imagery and texts to understand important events. A primary challenge is the initial sifting of irrelevant posts. This work introduces an interactive process for training an event-centric, learning-based multimodal classification model that automates sanitization. We propose a method based on Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) and evaluate active learning and pseudo-labeling formulations to reduce the number of posts the analyst must manually annotate. Our results indicate that BGNNs are useful for social-media data sifting for forensics investigations of events of interest, the value of active learning and pseudo-labeling varies based on the setting, and incorporating unlabelled data from other events improves performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuwei Zhang, Tong Xia, Aaqib Saeed, Cecilia Mascolo</p>
<p>Abstract: The high incidence and mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases underscores the importance of early screening. Machine learning models can automate clinical consultations and auscultation, offering vital support in this area. However, the data involved, spanning demographics, medical history, symptoms, and respiratory audio, are heterogeneous and complex. Existing approaches are insufficient and lack generalizability, as they typically rely on limited training data, basic fusion techniques, and task-specific models. In this paper, we propose RespLLM, a novel multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that unifies text and audio representations for respiratory health prediction. RespLLM leverages the extensive prior knowledge of pretrained LLMs and enables effective audio-text fusion through cross-modal attentions. Instruction tuning is employed to integrate diverse data from multiple sources, ensuring generalizability and versatility of the model. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that RespLLM outperforms leading baselines by an average of 4.6% on trained tasks, 7.9% on unseen datasets, and facilitates zero-shot predictions for new tasks. Our work lays the foundation for multimodal models that can perceive, listen to, and understand heterogeneous data, paving the way for scalable respiratory health diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas P. Zollo, Zhun Deng, Jake C. Snell, Toniann Pitassi, Richard Zemel</p>
<p>Abstract: A reliable deep learning system should be able to accurately express its confidence with respect to its predictions, a quality known as calibration. One of the most effective ways to produce reliable confidence estimates with a pre-trained model is by applying a post-hoc recalibration method. Popular recalibration methods like temperature scaling are typically fit on a small amount of data and work in the model's output space, as opposed to the more expressive feature embedding space, and thus usually have only one or a handful of parameters. However, the target distribution to which they are applied is often complex and difficult to fit well with such a function. To this end we propose \textit{selective recalibration}, where a selection model learns to reject some user-chosen proportion of the data in order to allow the recalibrator to focus on regions of the input space that can be well-captured by such a model. We provide theoretical analysis to motivate our algorithm, and test our method through comprehensive experiments on difficult medical imaging and zero-shot classification tasks. Our results show that selective recalibration consistently leads to significantly lower calibration error than a wide range of selection and recalibration baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Xue, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah, Xiaorui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in graph representation learning, and various sampling approaches have been proposed to scale GNNs to applications with large-scale graphs. A class of promising GNN training algorithms take advantage of historical embeddings to reduce the computation and memory cost while maintaining the model expressiveness of GNNs. However, they incur significant computation bias due to the stale feature history. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of their staleness and inferior performance on large-scale problems. Motivated by our discoveries, we propose a simple yet highly effective training algorithm (REST) to effectively reduce feature staleness, which leads to significantly improved performance and convergence across varying batch sizes. The proposed algorithm seamlessly integrates with existing solutions, boasting easy implementation, while comprehensive experiments underscore its superior performance and efficiency on large-scale benchmarks. Specifically, our improvements to state-of-the-art historical embedding methods result in a 2.7% and 3.6% performance enhancement on the ogbn-papers100M and ogbn-products dataset respectively, accompanied by notably accelerated convergence.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05419">Refining Counterfactual Explanations With Joint-Distribution-Informed Shapley Towards Actionable Minimality</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei You, Yijun Bian, Lele Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CE) identify data points that closely resemble the observed data but produce different machine learning (ML) model outputs, offering critical insights into model decisions. Despite the diverse scenarios, goals and tasks to which they are tailored, existing CE methods often lack actionable efficiency because of unnecessary feature changes included within the explanations that are presented to users and stakeholders. We address this problem by proposing a method that minimizes the required feature changes while maintaining the validity of CE, without imposing restrictions on models or CE algorithms, whether instance- or group-based. The key innovation lies in computing a joint distribution between observed and counterfactual data and leveraging it to inform Shapley values for feature attributions (FA). We demonstrate that optimal transport (OT) effectively derives this distribution, especially when the alignment between observed and counterfactual data is unclear in used CE methods. Additionally, a counterintuitive finding is uncovered: it may be misleading to rely on an exact alignment defined by the CE generation mechanism in conducting FA. Our proposed method is validated on extensive experiments across multiple datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in refining CE towards greater actionable efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amber Cassimon, Phil Reiter, Siegfried Mercelis, Kevin Mets</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper showcases the use of a reinforcement learning-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS) agent to design a small neural network to perform active fire detection on multispectral satellite imagery. Specifically, we aim to design a neural network that can determine if a single multispectral pixel is a part of a fire, and do so within the constraints of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) nanosatellite with a limited power budget, to facilitate on-board processing of sensor data. In order to use reinforcement learning, a reward function is needed. We supply this reward function in the shape of a regression model that predicts the F1 score obtained by a particular architecture, following quantization to INT8 precision, from purely architectural features. This model is trained by collecting a random sample of neural network architectures, training these architectures, and collecting their classification performance statistics. Besides the F1 score, we also include the total number of trainable parameters in our reward function to limit the size of the designed model and ensure it fits within the resource constraints imposed by nanosatellite platforms. Finally, we deployed the best neural network to the Google Coral Micro Dev Board and evaluated its inference latency and power consumption. This neural network consists of 1,716 trainable parameters, takes on average 984{\mu}s to inference, and consumes around 800mW to perform inference. These results show that our reinforcement learning-based NAS approach can be successfully applied to novel problems not tackled before.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo-Ruei Huang, Chun-Kai Yang, Chun-Mao Lai, Dai-Jie Wu, Shao-Hua Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from observation (LfO) aims to imitate experts by learning from state-only demonstrations without requiring action labels. Existing adversarial imitation learning approaches learn a generator agent policy to produce state transitions that are indistinguishable to a discriminator that learns to classify agent and expert state transitions. Despite its simplicity in formulation, these methods are often sensitive to hyperparameters and brittle to train. Motivated by the recent success of diffusion models in generative modeling, we propose to integrate a diffusion model into the adversarial imitation learning from observation framework. Specifically, we employ a diffusion model to capture expert and agent transitions by generating the next state, given the current state. Then, we reformulate the learning objective to train the diffusion model as a binary classifier and use it to provide "realness" rewards for policy learning. Our proposed framework, Diffusion Imitation from Observation (DIFO), demonstrates superior performance in various continuous control domains, including navigation, locomotion, manipulation, and games.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David R\"ugamer, and Bernard X. W. Liew, Zainab Altai, Almond St\"ocker</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-structured networks (SSNs) merge the structures familiar from additive models with deep neural networks, allowing the modeling of interpretable partial feature effects while capturing higher-order non-linearities at the same time. A significant challenge in this integration is maintaining the interpretability of the additive model component. Inspired by large-scale biomechanics datasets, this paper explores extending SSNs to functional data. Existing methods in functional data analysis are promising but often not expressive enough to account for all interactions and non-linearities and do not scale well to large datasets. Although the SSN approach presents a compelling potential solution, its adaptation to functional data remains complex. In this work, we propose a functional SSN method that retains the advantageous properties of classical functional regression approaches while also improving scalability. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach accurately recovers underlying signals, enhances predictive performance, and performs favorably compared to competing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Weather forecasting has seen a shift in methods from numerical simulations to data-driven systems. While initial research in the area focused on deterministic forecasting, recent works have used diffusion models to produce skillful ensemble forecasts. These models are trained on a single forecasting step and rolled out autoregressively. However, they are computationally expensive and accumulate errors for high temporal resolution due to the many rollout steps. We address these limitations with Continuous Ensemble Forecasting, a novel and flexible method for sampling ensemble forecasts in diffusion models. The method can generate temporally consistent ensemble trajectories completely in parallel, with no autoregressive steps. Continuous Ensemble Forecasting can also be combined with autoregressive rollouts to yield forecasts at an arbitrary fine temporal resolution without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate that the method achieves competitive results for global weather forecasting with good probabilistic properties.</p>

<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show impressive decision-making abilities, current methods lack a mechanism for automatic self-improvement from errors during task execution. We propose LEAP, an iterative fine-tuning framework that continually improves LLM agents using feedback from AI expert teachers. Our key insight is to equip the expert teachers with a privileged state -- information that is available during training but hidden at test time. This allows even weak experts to provide precise guidance, significantly improving the student agent's performance without access to privileged information at test time. We evaluate LEAP on diverse decision-making benchmarks, including text-based games (ALFWorld), web navigation (WebShop), and interactive coding (Intercode Bash). Our experiments show that LEAP (1) outperforms behavior cloning and ReAct baselines (2) enables weak student models (e.g., Llama3-8B) to exceed the performance of strong teacher models (GPT4-o), and (3) allows weak models to self-improve using privileged versions of themselves. We also provide a theoretical analysis showing that LEAP's success hinges on balancing privileged information with the student's realizability, which we empirically validate.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charbel Sakr, Brucek Khailany</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose ESPACE, an LLM compression technique based on dimensionality reduction of activations. Unlike prior works on weight-centric tensor decomposition, ESPACE projects activations onto a pre-calibrated set of principal components. The activation-centrality of the approach enables retraining LLMs with no loss of expressivity; while at inference, weight decomposition is obtained as a byproduct of matrix multiplication associativity. Theoretical results on the construction of projection matrices with optimal computational accuracy are provided. Experimentally, we find ESPACE enables 50% compression of GPT3, Llama2, and Nemotron4 models with small accuracy degradation, as low as a 0.18 perplexity increase on GPT3-22B. At lower compression rates of 20% to 40%, ESPACE drives GPT3 models to outperforming their baseline, by up to a 0.38 decrease in perplexity for GPT3-8B. ESPACE also reduces GEMM execution time and prefill inference latency on existing hardware. Comparison with related works on compressing Llama2-7B via matrix factorization shows that ESPACE is a first step in advancing the state-of-the-art in tensor decomposition compression of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Zhou, Rose Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, but their potential for anomaly detection remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates whether LLMs can understand and detect anomalies in time series data, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Inspired by conjectures about LLMs' behavior from time series forecasting research, we formulate key hypotheses about LLMs' capabilities in time series anomaly detection. We design and conduct principled experiments to test each of these hypotheses.
  Our investigation reveals several surprising findings about LLMs for time series:
  1. LLMs understand time series better as *images* rather than as text
  2. LLMs did not demonstrate enhanced performance when prompted to engage in *explicit reasoning* about time series analysis
  3. Contrary to common beliefs, LLM's understanding of time series *do not* stem from their repetition biases or arithmetic abilities
  4. LLMs' behaviors and performance in time series analysis *vary significantly* across different model architectures
  This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of contemporary LLM capabilities in time series anomaly detection. Our results suggest that while LLMs can understand time series anomalies, many common conjectures based on their reasoning capabilities do not hold. These insights pave the way for more effective LLM-based approaches in time series analysis, bridging the gap between forecasting and anomaly detection applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwen Xu, Qin Lu, Georgios B. Giannakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The Gaussian process (GP) is a Bayesian nonparametric paradigm that is widely adopted for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in a number of safety-critical applications, including robotics, healthcare, as well as surveillance. The consistency of the resulting uncertainty values however, hinges on the premise that the learning function conforms to the properties specified by the GP model, such as smoothness, periodicity and more, which may not be satisfied in practice, especially with data arriving on the fly. To combat against such model mis-specification, we propose to wed the GP with the prevailing conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free post-processing framework that produces it prediction sets with a provably valid coverage under the sole assumption of data exchangeability. However, this assumption is usually violated in the online setting, where a prediction set is sought before revealing the true label. To ensure long-term coverage guarantee, we will adaptively set the key threshold parameter based on the feedback whether the true label falls inside the prediction set.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeyeon Kim, Sehyun Kwon, Joo Young Choi, Jongho Park, Jaewoong Cho, Jason D. Lee, Ernest K. Ryu</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) describes a language model's ability to generate outputs based on a set of input demonstrations and a subsequent query. To understand this remarkable capability, researchers have studied simplified, stylized models. These studies have consistently observed long loss plateaus, during which models exhibit minimal improvement, followed by a sudden, rapid surge of learning. In this work, we reveal that training on multiple diverse ICL tasks simultaneously shortens the loss plateaus, making each task easier to learn. This finding is surprising as it contradicts the natural intuition that the combined complexity of multiple ICL tasks would lengthen the learning process, not shorten it. Our result suggests that the recent success in large-scale training of language models may be attributed not only to the richness of the data at scale but also to the easier optimization (training) induced by the diversity of natural language training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barak Gahtan, Shany Funk, Einat Kodesh, Itay Ketko, Tsvi Kuflik, Alex M. Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) identifies daily activities from time-series data collected by wearable devices like smartwatches. Recent advancements in Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and low-cost sensors have broadened HAR applications across fields like healthcare, biometrics, sports, and personal fitness. However, challenges remain in efficiently processing the vast amounts of data generated by these devices and developing models that can accurately recognize a wide range of activities from continuous recordings, without relying on predefined activity training sessions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for imputing, analyzing, and identifying activities from wearable data, specifically targeting group training scenarios without explicit activity sessions. Our approach is based on data collected from 135 soldiers wearing Garmin 55 smartwatches over six months. The framework integrates multiple data streams, handles missing data through cross-domain statistical methods, and identifies activities with high accuracy using machine learning (ML). Additionally, we utilized statistical analysis techniques to evaluate the performance of each individual within the group, providing valuable insights into their respective positions in the group in an easy-to-understand visualization. These visualizations facilitate easy understanding of performance metrics, enhancing group interactions and informing individualized training programs. We evaluate our framework through traditional train-test splits and out-of-sample scenarios, focusing on the model's generalization capabilities. Additionally, we address sleep data imputation without relying on ML, improving recovery analysis. Our findings demonstrate the potential of wearable data for accurately identifying group activities, paving the way for intelligent, data-driven training solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debabrota Basu, Sourav Chakraborty, Debarshi Chanda, Buddha Dev Das, Arijit Ghosh, Arnab Ray</p>
<p>Abstract: Testing whether a sample survey is a credible representation of the population is an important question to ensure the validity of any downstream research. While this problem, in general, does not have an efficient solution, one might take a task-based approach and aim to understand whether a certain data analysis tool, like linear regression, would yield similar answers both on the population and the sample survey. In this paper, we design an algorithm to test the credibility of a sample survey in terms of linear regression. In other words, we design an algorithm that can certify if a sample survey is good enough to guarantee the correctness of data analysis done using linear regression tools. Nowadays, one is naturally concerned about data privacy in surveys. Thus, we further test the credibility of surveys published in a differentially private manner. Specifically, we focus on Local Differential Privacy (LDP), which is a standard technique to ensure privacy in surveys where the survey participants might not trust the aggregator. We extend our algorithm to work even when the data analysis has been done using surveys with LDP. In the process, we also propose an algorithm that learns with high probability the guarantees a linear regression model on a survey published with LDP. Our algorithm also serves as a mechanism to learn linear regression models from data corrupted with noise coming from any subexponential distribution. We prove that it achieves the optimal estimation error bound for $\ell_1$ linear regression, which might be of broader interest. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithms while trying to reduce the sample complexity for both public and private surveys. We also numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on real and synthetic datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyue Wen, Huaqing Zhang, Hongzhou Lin, Jingzhao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances the reasoning performance of large language models (LLM). While current theoretical studies often attribute this improvement to increased expressiveness and computational capacity, we argue that expressiveness is not the primary limitation in the LLM regime, as current large models will fail on simple tasks. Using a parity-learning setup, we demonstrate that CoT can substantially improve sample efficiency even when the representation power is sufficient. Specifically, with CoT, a transformer can learn the function within polynomial samples, whereas without CoT, the required sample size is exponential. Additionally, we show that CoT simplifies the learning process by introducing sparse sequential dependencies among input tokens, and leads to a sparse and interpretable attention. We validate our theoretical analysis with both synthetic and real-world experiments, confirming that sparsity in attention layers is a key factor of the improvement induced by CoT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravindran Kannan, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Praneeth Kacham, David P. Woodruff</p>
<p>Abstract: A central problem related to transformers can be stated as follows: given two $n \times d$ matrices $Q$ and $K$, and a non-negative function $f$, define the matrix $A$ as follows: (1) apply the function $f$ to each entry of the $n \times n$ matrix $Q K^T$, and then (2) normalize each of the row sums of $A$ to be equal to $1$. The matrix $A$ can be computed in $O(n^2 d)$ time assuming $f$ can be applied to a number in constant time, but the quadratic dependence on $n$ is prohibitive in applications where it corresponds to long context lengths. For a large class of functions $f$, we show how to find all the ``large attention scores", i.e., entries of $A$ which are at least a positive value $\varepsilon$, in time with linear dependence on $n$ (i.e., $n \cdot \textrm{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$) for a positive parameter $\varepsilon > 0$. Our class of functions include all functions $f$ of the form $f(x) = |x|^p$, as explored recently in transformer models. Using recently developed tools from randomized numerical linear algebra, we prove that for any $K$, there is a ``universal set" $U \subset [n]$ of size independent of $n$, such that for any $Q$ and any row $i$, the large attention scores $A_{i,j}$ in row $i$ of $A$ all have $j \in U$. We also find $U$ in $n \cdot \textrm{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ time. Notably, we (1) make no assumptions on the data, (2) our workspace does not grow with $n$, and (3) our algorithms can be computed in streaming and parallel settings. We call the attention mechanism that uses only the subset of keys in the universal set as LevAttention since our algorithm to identify the universal set $U$ is based on leverage scores. We empirically show the benefits of our scheme for vision transformers, showing how to train new models that use our universal set while training as well, showing that our model is able to consistently select ``important keys'' during training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Panigrahi, Bingbin Liu, Sadhika Malladi, Andrej Risteski, Surbhi Goel</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation leverages a teacher model to improve the training of a student model. A persistent challenge is that a better teacher does not always yield a better student, to which a common mitigation is to use additional supervision from several ``intermediate'' teachers. One empirically validated variant of this principle is progressive distillation, where the student learns from successive intermediate checkpoints of the teacher. Using sparse parity as a sandbox, we identify an implicit curriculum as one mechanism through which progressive distillation accelerates the student's learning. This curriculum is available only through the intermediate checkpoints but not the final converged one, and imparts both empirical acceleration and a provable sample complexity benefit to the student. We then extend our investigation to Transformers trained on probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) and real-world pre-training datasets (Wikipedia and Books). Through probing the teacher model, we identify an analogous implicit curriculum where the model progressively learns features that capture longer context. Our theoretical and empirical findings on sparse parity, complemented by empirical observations on more complex tasks, highlight the benefit of progressive distillation via implicit curriculum across setups.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humans have the ability to learn new tasks by inferring high-level concepts from existing solution, then manipulating these concepts in lieu of the raw data. Can we automate this process by deriving latent semantic structures in a document collection using foundation models? We introduce fPLSA, a foundation-model-based Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) method that iteratively clusters and tags document segments based on document-level contexts. These tags can be used to model the structure of given documents and for hierarchical sampling of new texts. Our experiments on story writing, math, and multi-step reasoning datasets demonstrate that fPLSA tags help reconstruct the original texts better than existing tagging methods. Moreover, when used for hierarchical sampling, fPLSA produces more diverse outputs with a higher likelihood of hitting the correct answer than direct sampling and hierarchical sampling with existing tagging methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alec F. Diallo, Vaishak Belle, Paul Patras</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their success and widespread adoption, the opaque nature of deep neural networks (DNNs) continues to hinder trust, especially in critical applications. Current interpretability solutions often yield inconsistent or oversimplified explanations, or require model changes that compromise performance. In this work, we introduce TRACER, a novel method grounded in causal inference theory designed to estimate the causal dynamics underpinning DNN decisions without altering their architecture or compromising their performance. Our approach systematically intervenes on input features to observe how specific changes propagate through the network, affecting internal activations and final outputs. Based on this analysis, we determine the importance of individual features, and construct a high-level causal map by grouping functionally similar layers into cohesive causal nodes, providing a structured and interpretable view of how different parts of the network influence the decisions. TRACER further enhances explainability by generating counterfactuals that reveal possible model biases and offer contrastive explanations for misclassifications. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets, we demonstrate TRACER's effectiveness over existing methods and show its potential for creating highly compressed yet accurate models, illustrating its dual versatility in both understanding and optimizing DNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shriya Jaddu, Sidh Jaddu, Camilo Gutierrez, Quincy K. Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: Introduction: Approximately 23 million or 30% of epilepsy patients worldwide suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). The unpredictability of seizure occurrences, which causes safety issues as well as social concerns, restrict the lifestyles of DRE patients. Surgical solutions and EEG-based solutions are very expensive, unreliable, invasive or impractical. The goal of this research was to employ improved technologies and methods to epilepsy patient physiological data and predict seizures up to two hours before onset, enabling non-invasive, affordable seizure prediction for DRE patients.
  Methods: This research used a 1D Convolutional Neural Network-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network that was trained on a diverse set of epileptic patient physiological data to predict seizures. Transfer learning was further utilized to personalize and optimize predictions for specific patients. Clinical data was retrospectively obtained for nine epilepsy patients via wearable devices over a period of about three to five days from a prospectively maintained database. The physiological data included 54 seizure occurrences and included heart rate, blood volume pulse, accelerometry, body temperature, and electrodermal activity.
  Results and Conclusion: A general deep-learning model trained on the physiological data with randomly sampled test data achieved an accuracy of 91.94%. However, such a generalized deep learning model had varied performances on data from unseen patients. When the general model was personalized (further trained) with patient-specific data, the personalized model achieved significantly improved performance with accuracies as high as 97%. This preliminary research shows that patient-specific personalization may be a viable approach to achieve affordable, non-invasive seizure prediction that can improve the quality of life for DRE patients.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05493">Transformers learn variable-order Markov chains in-context</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruida Zhou, Chao Tian, Suhas Diggavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) capability. However, it is still unclear how the underlying transformers accomplish it, especially in more complex scenarios. Toward this goal, several recent works studied how transformers learn fixed-order Markov chains (FOMC) in context, yet natural languages are more suitably modeled by variable-order Markov chains (VOMC), i.e., context trees (CTs). In this work, we study the ICL of VOMC by viewing language modeling as a form of data compression and focus on small alphabets and low-order VOMCs. This perspective allows us to leverage mature compression algorithms, such as context-tree weighting (CTW) and prediction by partial matching (PPM) algorithms as baselines, the former of which is Bayesian optimal for a class of CTW priors. We empirically observe a few phenomena: 1) Transformers can indeed learn to compress VOMC in-context, while PPM suffers significantly; 2) The performance of transformers is not very sensitive to the number of layers, and even a two-layer transformer can learn in-context quite well; and 3) Transformers trained and tested on non-CTW priors can significantly outperform the CTW algorithm. To explain these phenomena, we analyze the attention map of the transformers and extract two mechanisms, on which we provide two transformer constructions: 1) A construction with $D+2$ layers that can mimic the CTW algorithm accurately for CTs of maximum order $D$, 2) A 2-layer transformer that utilizes the feed-forward network for probability blending. One distinction from the FOMC setting is that a counting mechanism appears to play an important role. We implement these synthetic transformer layers and show that such hybrid transformers can match the ICL performance of transformers, and more interestingly, some of them can perform even better despite the much-reduced parameter sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bobak T. Kiani, Lukas Fesser, Melanie Weber</p>
<p>Abstract: Data with geometric structure is ubiquitous in machine learning often arising from fundamental symmetries in a domain, such as permutation-invariance in graphs and translation-invariance in images. Group-convolutional architectures, which encode symmetries as inductive bias, have shown great success in applications, but can suffer from instabilities as their depth increases and often struggle to learn long range dependencies in data. For instance, graph neural networks experience instability due to the convergence of node representations (over-smoothing), which can occur after only a few iterations of message-passing, reducing their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Here, we propose and study unitary group convolutions, which allow for deeper networks that are more stable during training. The main focus of the paper are graph neural networks, where we show that unitary graph convolutions provably avoid over-smoothing. Our experimental results confirm that unitary graph convolutional networks achieve competitive performance on benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art graph neural networks. We complement our analysis of the graph domain with the study of general unitary convolutions and analyze their role in enhancing stability in general group convolutional architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Ferguson, Andrew Gillman, James Hardin, Levent Burak Kara</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalar fields, such as stress or temperature fields, are often calculated in shape optimization and design problems in engineering. For complex problems where shapes have varying topology and cannot be parametrized, data-driven scalar field prediction can be faster than traditional finite element methods. However, current data-driven techniques to predict scalar fields are limited to a fixed grid domain, instead of arbitrary mesh structures. In this work, we propose a method to predict scalar fields on arbitrary meshes. It uses a convolutional neural network whose feature maps at multiple resolutions are interpolated to node positions before being fed into a multilayer perceptron to predict solutions to partial differential equations at mesh nodes. The model is trained on finite element von Mises stress fields, and once trained it can estimate stress values at each node on any input mesh. Two shape datasets are investigated, and the model has strong performance on both, with a median R-squared value of 0.91. We also demonstrate the model on a temperature field in a heat conduction problem, where its predictions have a median R-squared value of 0.99. Our method provides a potential flexible alternative to finite element analysis in engineering design contexts. Code and datasets are available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guojun Xiong, Ujwal Dinesha, Debajoy Mukherjee, Jian Li, Srinivas Shakkottai</p>
<p>Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) has been widely used to model constrained sequential decision making problems, where the state of each restless arm evolves according to a Markov chain and each state transition generates a scalar reward. However, the success of RMAB crucially relies on the availability and quality of reward signals. Unfortunately, specifying an exact reward function in practice can be challenging and even infeasible. In this paper, we introduce Pref-RMAB, a new RMAB model in the presence of preference signals, where the decision maker only observes pairwise preference feedback rather than scalar reward from the activated arms at each decision epoch. Preference feedback, however, arguably contains less information than the scalar reward, which makes Pref-RMAB seemingly more difficult. To address this challenge, we present a direct online preference learning (DOPL) algorithm for Pref-RMAB to efficiently explore the unknown environments, adaptively collect preference data in an online manner, and directly leverage the preference feedback for decision-makings. We prove that DOPL yields a sublinear regret. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithm to ensure $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T\ln T})$ regret for RMAB with preference feedback. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of DOPL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Hartmann, Guoliang He, Eiko Yoneki</p>
<p>Abstract: The real-world effectiveness of deep neural networks often depends on their latency, thereby necessitating optimization techniques that can reduce a model's inference time while preserving its performance. One popular approach is to sequentially rewrite the input computation graph into an equivalent but faster one by replacing individual subgraphs. This approach gives rise to the so-called phase-ordering problem in which the application of one rewrite rule can eliminate the possibility to apply an even better one later on. Recent work has shown that equality saturation, a technique from compiler optimization, can mitigate this issue by first building an intermediate representation (IR) that efficiently stores multiple optimized versions of the input program before extracting the best solution in a second step. In practice, however, memory constraints prevent the IR from capturing all optimized versions and thus reintroduce the phase-ordering problem in the construction phase. In this paper, we present a tensor graph rewriting approach that uses Monte Carlo tree search to build superior IRs by identifying the most promising rewrite rules. We also introduce a novel extraction algorithm that can provide fast and accurate runtime estimates of tensor programs represented in an IR. Our approach improves the inference speedup of neural networks by up to 11% compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuel Buttaci, Giuseppe Carlo Calafiore</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning has emerged in the last decade as a distributed optimization paradigm due to the rapidly increasing number of portable devices able to support the heavy computational needs related to the training of machine learning models. Federated learning utilizes gradient-based optimization to minimize a loss objective shared across participating agents. To the best of our knowledge, the literature mostly lacks elegant solutions that naturally harness the reciprocal statistical similarity between clients to redesign the optimization procedure. To address this gap, by conceiving the federated network as a similarity graph, we propose a novel modified framework wherein each client locally performs a perturbed gradient step leveraging prior information about other statistically affine clients. We theoretically prove that our procedure, due to a suitably introduced adaptation in the update rule, achieves a quantifiable speedup concerning the exponential contraction factor in the strongly convex case compared with popular algorithms FedAvg and FedProx, here analyzed as baselines. Lastly, we legitimize our conclusions through experimental results on the CIFAR10 and FEMNIST datasets, where we show that our algorithm speeds convergence up to a margin of 30 global rounds compared with FedAvg while modestly improving generalization on unseen data in heterogeneous settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Song, Thomas Anderson Keller, Yisong Yue, Pietro Perona, Max Welling</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a vast literature on representation learning based on principles such as coding efficiency, statistical independence, causality, controllability, or symmetry. In this paper we propose to learn representations from sequence data by factorizing the transformations of the latent variables into sparse components. Input data are first encoded as distributions of latent activations and subsequently transformed using a probability flow model, before being decoded to predict a future input state. The flow model is decomposed into a number of rotational (divergence-free) vector fields and a number of potential flow (curl-free) fields. Our sparsity prior encourages only a small number of these fields to be active at any instant and infers the speed with which the probability flows along these fields. Training this model is completely unsupervised using a standard variational objective and results in a new form of disentangled representations where the input is not only represented by a combination of independent factors, but also by a combination of independent transformation primitives given by the learned flow fields. When viewing the transformations as symmetries one may interpret this as learning approximately equivariant representations. Empirically we demonstrate that this model achieves state of the art in terms of both data likelihood and unsupervised approximate equivariance errors on datasets composed of sequence transformations.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of transformers for entity-tracking tasks in large language models. We identify a theoretical constraint, showing that transformers require at least $\log_2 (n+1)$ layers to handle entity tracking with $n$ state changes. To address this issue, we propose an efficient and frugal enhancement to the standard attention mechanism, enabling it to manage long-term dependencies more efficiently. By considering attention as an adjacency matrix, our model can track entity states with a single layer. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in entity tracking datasets while keeping competitive performance on standard natural language modeling. Our modified attention allows us to achieve the same performance with drastically fewer layers. Additionally, our enhanced mechanism reveals structured internal representations of attention. Extensive experiments on both toy and complex datasets validate our approach. Our contributions include theoretical insights, an improved attention mechanism, and empirical validation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dibyajyoti Chakraborty, Seung Whan Chung, Ashesh Chattopadhyay, Romit Maulik</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the long-term behavior of chaotic systems remains a formidable challenge due to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and the inherent limitations of traditional data-driven modeling approaches. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging the recently proposed multi-step penalty (MP) optimization technique. Our approach extends the applicability of MP optimization to a wide range of deep learning architectures, including Fourier Neural Operators and UNETs. By introducing penalized local discontinuities in the forecast trajectory, we effectively handle the non-convexity of loss landscapes commonly encountered in training neural networks for chaotic systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through its application to two challenging use-cases: the prediction of flow velocity evolution in two-dimensional turbulence and ocean dynamics using reanalysis data. Our results highlight the potential of this approach for accurate and stable long-term prediction of chaotic dynamics, paving the way for new advancements in data-driven modeling of complex natural phenomena.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Yao, Chuming Li, Canran Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Data selection is essential for training deep learning models. An effective data sampler assigns proper sampling probability for training data and helps the model converge to a good local minimum with high performance. Previous studies in data sampling are mainly based on heuristic rules or learning through a huge amount of time-consuming trials. In this paper, we propose an automatic \textbf{swift sampler} search algorithm, \textbf{SS}, to explore automatically learning effective samplers efficiently. In particular, \textbf{SS} utilizes a novel formulation to map a sampler to a low dimension of hyper-parameters and uses an approximated local minimum to quickly examine the quality of a sampler. Benefiting from its low computational expense, \textbf{SS} can be applied on large-scale data sets with high efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that \textbf{SS} powered sampling can achieve obvious improvements (e.g., 1.5\% on ImageNet) and transfer among different neural networks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyoseo Kim, Dongyoon Han, Junsuk Choe</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove specific knowledge from a model. Current methods, such as task arithmetic, rely on fine-tuning models on the forget set, generating a task vector, and subtracting it from the original model. However, we argue the effectiveness of this approach is highly sensitive to hyperparameter selection, necessitating careful validation to identify the best model among many fine-tuned candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel method that leverages all given fine-tuned models rather than selecting a single one. By constructing task vectors from models trained with varied hyperparameters and merging only the components of the task vectors with consistent signs, we perform unlearning by negating the merged task vector from the original model. Given that existing methods also utilize multiple fine-tuned models, our approach delivers more effective unlearning without incurring additional computational costs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both vision-language models and standard image classification models, showing improved unlearning performance with minimal degradation on the retain set, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueru Wen, Jie Lou, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xing Yu, Xinyu Lu, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Debing Zhang, Le Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are crucial for aligning language models with human preferences. Currently, the evaluation of RMs depends on measuring accuracy against a validation set of manually annotated preference data. Although this method is straightforward and widely adopted, the relationship between RM accuracy and downstream policy performance remains under-explored. In this work, we conduct experiments in a synthetic setting to investigate how differences in RM measured by accuracy translate into gaps in optimized policy performance. Our findings reveal that while there is a weak positive correlation between accuracy and downstream performance, policies optimized towards RMs with similar accuracy can exhibit quite different performance. Moreover, we discover that the way of measuring accuracy significantly impacts its ability to predict the final policy performance. Through the lens of Regressional Goodhart's effect, we identify the existence of exogenous variables impacting the relationship between RM quality measured by accuracy and policy model capability. This underscores the inadequacy of relying solely on accuracy to reflect their impact on policy optimization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05593">When Graph Neural Networks Meet Dynamic Mode Decomposition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dai Shi, Lequan Lin, Andi Han, Zhiyong Wang, Yi Guo, Junbin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as fundamental tools for a wide range of prediction tasks on graph-structured data. Recent studies have drawn analogies between GNN feature propagation and diffusion processes, which can be interpreted as dynamical systems. In this paper, we delve deeper into this perspective by connecting the dynamics in GNNs to modern Koopman theory and its numerical method, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). We illustrate how DMD can estimate a low-rank, finite-dimensional linear operator based on multiple states of the system, effectively approximating potential nonlinear interactions between nodes in the graph. This approach allows us to capture complex dynamics within the graph accurately and efficiently. We theoretically establish a connection between the DMD-estimated operator and the original dynamic operator between system states. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a family of DMD-GNN models that effectively leverage the low-rank eigenfunctions provided by the DMD algorithm. We further discuss the potential of enhancing our approach by incorporating domain-specific constraints such as symmetry into the DMD computation, allowing the corresponding GNN models to respect known physical properties of the underlying system. Our work paves the path for applying advanced dynamical system analysis tools via GNNs. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on various learning tasks, including directed graphs, large-scale graphs, long-range interactions, and spatial-temporal graphs. We also empirically verify that our proposed models can serve as powerful encoders for link prediction tasks. The results demonstrate that our DMD-enhanced GNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating DMD into GNN frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this study, we explore a surprising phenomenon related to ICL: LLMs can perform multiple, computationally distinct ICL tasks simultaneously, during a single inference call, a capability we term "task superposition". We provide empirical evidence of this phenomenon across various LLM families and scales and show that this phenomenon emerges even if we train the model to in-context learn one task at a time. We offer theoretical explanations that this capability is well within the expressive power of transformers. We also explore how LLMs internally compose task vectors during superposition. Furthermore, we show that larger models can solve more ICL tasks in parallel, and better calibrate their output distribution. Our findings offer insights into the latent capabilities of LLMs, further substantiate the perspective of "LLMs as superposition of simulators", and raise questions about the mechanisms enabling simultaneous task execution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhui Jang, Jaehyung Kim, Sungsoo Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to chemistry has shown promising performance in molecular understanding tasks, such as generating a text description from a molecule. However, proper reasoning based on molecular structural information remains a significant challenge, e.g., even advanced LLMs such as GPT-4o struggle to identify functional groups which are crucial for inferring the molecular property of interest. To address this limitation, we propose StructCoT, a structure-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) that enhances LLMs' understanding of molecular structures by explicitly injecting the key structural features of molecules. Moreover, we introduce two fine-tuning frameworks for adapting the existing LLMs to use our StructCoT. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating StructCoT with our fine-tuning frameworks leads to consistent improvements in both molecular understanding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Munn, Susan Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have been fueled by the development of foundation models such as BERT, GPT, T5, and Vision Transformers. These models are first pretrained on vast and diverse datasets and then adapted to specific downstream tasks, often with significantly less data. However, the mechanisms behind the success of this ubiquitous pretrain-then-adapt paradigm remain underexplored, particularly the characteristics of pretraining checkpoints that lend themselves to good downstream adaptation. We introduce a Bayesian model selection criterion, called the downstream free energy, which quantifies a checkpoint's adaptability by measuring the concentration of nearby favorable parameters for the downstream task. We demonstrate that this free energy criterion can be effectively implemented without access to the downstream data or prior knowledge of the downstream task. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that the free energy criterion reliably correlates with improved fine-tuning performance, offering a principled approach to predicting model adaptability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are effective for modeling event occurrences over time, but they struggle with sparse and uncertain events in federated systems, where privacy is a major concern. To address this, we propose \textit{FedPP}, a Federated neural nonparametric Point Process model. FedPP integrates neural embeddings into Sigmoidal Gaussian Cox Processes (SGCPs) on the client side, which is a flexible and expressive class of TPPs, allowing it to generate highly flexible intensity functions that capture client-specific event dynamics and uncertainties while efficiently summarizing historical records. For global aggregation, FedPP introduces a divergence-based mechanism that communicates the distributions of SGCPs' kernel hyperparameters between the server and clients, while keeping client-specific parameters local to ensure privacy and personalization. FedPP effectively captures event uncertainty and sparsity, and extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in federated settings, particularly with KL divergence and Wasserstein distance-based global aggregation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emam Hossain, Md Osman Gani, Devon Dunmire, Aneesh Subramanian, Hammad Younas</p>
<p>Abstract: The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has emerged as a significant contributor to global sea level rise, primarily due to increased meltwater runoff. Supraglacial lakes, which form on the ice sheet surface during the summer months, can impact ice sheet dynamics and mass loss; thus, better understanding these lakes' seasonal evolution and dynamics is an important task. This study presents a computationally efficient time series classification approach that uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) of the Reconstructed Phase Spaces (RPSs) to identify supraglacial lakes based on their seasonal evolution: 1) those that refreeze at the end of the melt season, 2) those that drain during the melt season, and 3) those that become buried, remaining liquid insulated a few meters beneath the surface. Our approach uses time series data from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, which utilize microwave and visible radiation, respectively. Evaluated on a GrIS-wide dataset, the RPS-GMM model, trained on a single representative sample per class, achieves 85.46% accuracy with Sentinel-1 data alone and 89.70% with combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. This performance significantly surpasses existing machine learning and deep learning models which require a large training data. The results demonstrate the robustness of the RPS-GMM model in capturing the complex temporal dynamics of supraglacial lakes with minimal training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Xue, Penghao Cai, Xiaojun Yuan, Xiqi Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems sample from the posterior using score functions and accept the generated random samples as solutions. In applications that posterior mean is preferred, we have to generate multiple samples from the posterior which is time-consuming. In this work, by analyzing the probability density evolution of the conditional reverse diffusion process, we prove that the posterior mean can be achieved by tracking the mean of each reverse diffusion step. Based on that, we establish a framework termed reverse mean propagation (RMP) that targets the posterior mean directly. We show that RMP can be implemented by solving a variational inference problem, which can be further decomposed as minimizing a reverse KL divergence at each reverse step. We further develop an algorithm that optimizes the reverse KL divergence with natural gradient descent using score functions and propagates the mean at each reverse step. Experiments demonstrate the validity of the theory of our framework and show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on reconstruction performance with lower computational complexity in various inverse problems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05648">Does RoBERTa Perform Better than BERT in Continual Learning: An Attention Sink Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueying Bai, Yifan Sun, Niranjan Balasubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to train models that can sequentially learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks' knowledge. Although previous works observed that pre-training can benefit CL, it remains unclear whether a pre-trained model with higher downstream capacity also performs better in CL. In this paper, we observe that pre-trained models may allocate high attention scores to some 'sink' tokens, such as [SEP] tokens, which are ubiquitous across various tasks. Such attention sinks may lead to models' over-smoothing in single-task learning and interference in sequential tasks' learning, which may compromise the models' CL performance despite their high pre-trained capabilities. To reduce these effects, we propose a pre-scaling mechanism that encourages attention diversity across all tokens. Specifically, it first scales the task's attention to the non-sink tokens in a probing stage, and then fine-tunes the model with scaling. Experiments show that pre-scaling yields substantial improvements in CL without experience replay, or progressively storing parameters from previous tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claire Chen, Shuze Liu, Shangtong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning, classic on-policy evaluation methods often suffer from high variance and require massive online data to attain the desired accuracy. Previous studies attempt to reduce evaluation variance by searching for or designing proper behavior policies to collect data. However, these approaches ignore the safety of such behavior policies -- the designed behavior policies have no safety guarantee and may lead to severe damage during online executions. In this paper, to address the challenge of reducing variance while ensuring safety simultaneously, we propose an optimal variance-minimizing behavior policy under safety constraints. Theoretically, while ensuring safety constraints, our evaluation method is unbiased and has lower variance than on-policy evaluation. Empirically, our method is the only existing method to achieve both substantial variance reduction and safety constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, we show our method is even superior to previous methods in both variance reduction and execution safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giang Ngo, Dang Nguyen, Sunil Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: The objective of active level set estimation for a black-box function is to precisely identify regions where the function values exceed or fall below a specified threshold by iteratively performing function evaluations to gather more information about the function. This becomes particularly important when function evaluations are costly, drastically limiting our ability to acquire large datasets. A promising way to sample-efficiently model the black-box function is by incorporating prior knowledge from a related function. However, this approach risks slowing down the estimation task if the prior knowledge is irrelevant or misleading. In this paper, we present a novel transfer learning method for active level set estimation that safely integrates a given prior knowledge while constantly adjusting it to guarantee a robust performance of a level set estimation algorithm even when the prior knowledge is irrelevant. We theoretically analyze this algorithm to show that it has a better level set convergence compared to standard transfer learning approaches that do not make any adjustment to the prior. Additionally, extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method when applied to various different level set estimation algorithms as well as different transfer learning scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: The scaling of large language models (LLMs) is a critical research area for the efficiency and effectiveness of model training and deployment. Our work investigates the transferability and discrepancies of scaling laws between Dense Models and Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including consistent loss scaling, optimal batch size and learning rate scaling, and resource allocation strategies scaling, our findings reveal that the power-law scaling framework also applies to MoE Models, indicating that the fundamental principles governing the scaling behavior of these models are preserved, even though the architecture differs. Additionally, MoE Models demonstrate superior generalization, resulting in lower testing losses with the same training compute budget compared to Dense Models. These findings indicate the scaling consistency and transfer generalization capabilities of MoE Models, providing new insights for optimizing MoE Model training and deployment strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhan-Lun Chang, Dong-Jun Han, Rohit Parasnis, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Christopher G. Brinton</p>
<p>Abstract: While most existing federated learning (FL) approaches assume a fixed set of clients in the system, in practice, clients can dynamically leave or join the system depending on their needs or interest in the specific task. This dynamic FL setting introduces several key challenges: (1) the objective function dynamically changes depending on the current set of clients, unlike traditional FL approaches that maintain a static optimization goal; (2) the current global model may not serve as the best initial point for the next FL rounds and could potentially lead to slow adaptation, given the possibility of clients leaving or joining the system. In this paper, we consider a dynamic optimization objective in FL that seeks the optimal model tailored to the currently active set of clients. Building on our probabilistic framework that provides direct insights into how the arrival and departure of different types of clients influence the shifts in optimal points, we establish an upper bound on the optimality gap, accounting for factors such as stochastic gradient noise, local training iterations, non-IIDness of data distribution, and deviations between optimal points caused by dynamic client pattern. We also propose an adaptive initial model construction strategy that employs weighted averaging guided by gradient similarity, prioritizing models trained on clients whose data characteristics align closely with the current one, thereby enhancing adaptability to the current clients. The proposed approach is validated on various datasets and FL algorithms, demonstrating robust performance across diverse client arrival and departure patterns, underscoring its effectiveness in dynamic FL environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xihan Qin, Li Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Comorbidity carries significant implications for disease understanding and management. The genetic causes for comorbidity often trace back to mutations occurred either in the same gene associated with two diseases or in different genes associated with different diseases respectively but coming into connection via protein-protein interactions. Therefore, human interactome has been used in more sophisticated study of disease comorbidity. Human interactome, as a large incomplete graph, presents its own challenges to extracting useful features for comorbidity prediction. In this work, we introduce a novel approach named Biologically Supervised Graph Embedding (BSE) to allow for selecting most relevant features to enhance the prediction accuracy of comorbid disease pairs. Our investigation into BSE's impact on both centered and uncentered embedding methods showcases its consistent superiority over the state-of-the-art techniques and its adeptness in selecting dimensions enriched with vital biological insights, thereby improving prediction performance significantly, up to 50% when measured by ROC for some variations. Further analysis indicates that BSE consistently and substantially improves the ratio of disease associations to gene connectivity, affirming its potential in uncovering latent biological factors affecting comorbidity. The statistically significant enhancements across diverse metrics underscore BSE's potential to introduce novel avenues for precise disease comorbidity predictions and other potential applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'es P\'aez</p>
<p>Abstract: In the natural and social sciences, it is common to use toy models -- extremely simple and highly idealized representations -- to understand complex phenomena. Some of the simple surrogate models used to understand opaque machine learning (ML) models, such as rule lists and sparse decision trees, bear some resemblance to scientific toy models. They allow non-experts to understand how an opaque ML model works globally via a much simpler model that highlights the most relevant features of the input space and their effect on the output. The obvious difference is that the common target of a toy and a full-scale model in the sciences is some phenomenon in the world, while the target of a surrogate model is another model. This essential difference makes toy surrogate models (TSMs) a new object of study for theories of understanding, one that is not easily accommodated under current analyses. This paper provides an account of what it means to understand an opaque ML model globally with the aid of such simple models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting anomalies in a temporal sequence of graphs can be applied is areas such as the detection of accidents in transport networks and cyber attacks in computer networks. Existing methods for detecting abnormal graphs can suffer from multiple limitations, such as high false positive rates as well as difficulties with handling variable-sized graphs and non-trivial temporal dynamics. To address this, we propose a technique where temporal dependencies are explicitly modelled via time series analysis of a large set of pertinent graph features, followed by using residuals to remove the dependencies. Extreme Value Theory is then used to robustly model and classify any remaining extremes, aiming to produce low false positives rates. Comparative evaluations on a multitude of graph instances show that the proposed approach obtains considerably better accuracy than TensorSplat and Laplacian Anomaly Detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are proficient in graph representation learning and achieve promising performance on versatile tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Usually, a comprehensive hyperparameter tuning is essential for fully unlocking GNN's top performance, especially for complicated tasks such as node classification on large graphs and long-range graphs. This is usually associated with high computational and time costs and careful design of appropriate search spaces. This work introduces a graph-conditioned latent diffusion framework (GNN-Diff) to generate high-performing GNNs based on the model checkpoints of sub-optimal hyperparameters selected by a light-tuning coarse search. We validate our method through 166 experiments across four graph tasks: node classification on small, large, and long-range graphs, as well as link prediction. Our experiments involve 10 classic and state-of-the-art target models and 20 publicly available datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that GNN-Diff: (1) boosts the performance of GNNs with efficient hyperparameter tuning; and (2) presents high stability and generalizability on unseen data across multiple generation runs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuansen Peng, Hanning Tang, Zhiguo Wang, Xiaojing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning graph structures from smooth signals is a significant problem in data science and engineering. A common challenge in real-world scenarios is the availability of only partially observed nodes. While some studies have considered hidden nodes and proposed various optimization frameworks, existing methods often lack the practical efficiency needed for large-scale networks or fail to provide theoretical convergence guarantees. In this paper, we address the problem of inferring network topologies from smooth signals with partially observed nodes. We propose a first-order algorithmic framework that includes two variants: one based on column sparsity regularization and the other on a low-rank constraint. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and demonstrate the linear convergence rate of our algorithms. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that our results align with theoretical predictions, exhibiting not only linear convergence but also superior speed compared to existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a first-order algorithmic framework for inferring network structures from smooth signals under partial observability, offering both guaranteed linear convergence and practical effectiveness for large-scale networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daoyu Wang, Mingyue Cheng, Zhiding Liu, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become a popular and effective approach for enhancing time series forecasting, enabling models to learn universal representations from unlabeled data. However, effectively capturing both the global sequence dependence and local detail features within time series data remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel generative self-supervised method called TimeDART, denoting Diffusion Auto-regressive Transformer for Time series forecasting. In TimeDART, we treat time series patches as basic modeling units. Specifically, we employ an self-attention based Transformer encoder to model the dependencies of inter-patches. Additionally, we introduce diffusion and denoising mechanisms to capture the detail locality features of intra-patch. Notably, we design a cross-attention-based denoising decoder that allows for adjustable optimization difficulty in the self-supervised task, facilitating more effective self-supervised pre-training. Furthermore, the entire model is optimized in an auto-regressive manner to obtain transferable representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeDART achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance compared to the most advanced competitive methods in forecasting tasks.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05726">Less is more: Embracing sparsity and interpolation with Esiformer for time series forecasting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyang Guo, Yanjun Zhao, Sizhe Dang, Tian Zhou, Liang Sun, Yi Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting has played a significant role in many practical fields. But time series data generated from real-world applications always exhibits high variance and lots of noise, which makes it difficult to capture the inherent periodic patterns of the data, hurting the prediction accuracy significantly. To address this issue, we propose the Esiformer, which apply interpolation on the original data, decreasing the overall variance of the data and alleviating the influence of noise. What's more, we enhanced the vanilla transformer with a robust Sparse FFN. It can enhance the representation ability of the model effectively, and maintain the excellent robustness, avoiding the risk of overfitting compared with the vanilla implementation. Through evaluations on challenging real-world datasets, our method outperforms leading model PatchTST, reducing MSE by 6.5% and MAE by 5.8% in multivariate time series forecasting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meifan Zhang, Zhanhong Xie, Lihua Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces two primary challenges: the risk of privacy leakage due to parameter sharing and communication inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose DPSFL, a federated learning method that utilizes differentially private sketches. DPSFL compresses the local gradients of each client using a count sketch, thereby improving communication efficiency, while adding noise to the sketches to ensure differential privacy (DP). We provide a theoretical analysis of privacy and convergence for the proposed method. Gradient clipping is essential in DP learning to limit sensitivity and constrain the addition of noise. However, clipping introduces bias into the gradients, negatively impacting FL performance. To mitigate the impact of clipping, we propose an enhanced method, DPSFL-AC, which employs an adaptive clipping strategy. Experimental comparisons with existing techniques demonstrate the superiority of our methods concerning privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and model accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuan-Ta Li, Ping-Chun Hsieh, Yu-Chih Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The piecewise-stationary bandit problem is an important variant of the multi-armed bandit problem that further considers abrupt changes in the reward distributions. The main theme of the problem is the trade-off between exploration for detecting environment changes and exploitation of traditional bandit algorithms. While this problem has been extensively investigated, existing works either assume knowledge about the number of change points $M$ or require extremely high computational complexity. In this work, we revisit the piecewise-stationary bandit problem from a minimalist perspective. We propose a novel and generic exploration mechanism, called diminishing exploration, which eliminates the need for knowledge about $M$ and can be used in conjunction with an existing change detection-based algorithm to achieve near-optimal regret scaling. Simulation results show that despite oblivious of $M$, equipping existing algorithms with the proposed diminishing exploration generally achieves better empirical regret than the traditional uniform exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhonghan Chen, Ruiyuan Zhang, Xi Zhao, Xiaojun Cheng, Xiaofang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense high dimensional vectors are becoming increasingly vital in fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and large language models (LLMs), serving as standard representations for multimodal data. Now the dimensionality of these vector can exceed several thousands easily. Despite the nearest neighbor search (NNS) over these dense high dimensional vectors have been widely used for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and many other applications, the effectiveness of NNS in such a high-dimensional space remains uncertain, given the possible challenge caused by the "curse of dimensionality." To address above question, in this paper, we conduct extensive NNS studies with different distance functions, such as $L_1$ distance, $L_2$ distance and angular-distance, across diverse embedding datasets, of varied types, dimensionality and modality. Our aim is to investigate factors influencing the meaningfulness of NNS. Our experiments reveal that high-dimensional text embeddings exhibit increased resilience as dimensionality rises to higher levels when compared to random vectors. This resilience suggests that text embeddings are less affected to the "curse of dimensionality," resulting in more meaningful NNS outcomes for practical use. Additionally, the choice of distance function has minimal impact on the relevance of NNS. Our study shows the effectiveness of the embedding-based data representation method and can offer opportunity for further optimization of dense vector-related applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05782">Reinforcement Learning From Imperfect Corrective Actions And Proxy Rewards</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaohui Jiang, Xuening Feng, Paul Weng, Yifei Zhu, Yan Song, Tianze Zhou, Yujing Hu, Tangjie Lv, Changjie Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: In practice, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are often trained with a possibly imperfect proxy reward function, which may lead to a human-agent alignment issue (i.e., the learned policy either converges to non-optimal performance with low cumulative rewards, or achieves high cumulative rewards but in undesired manner). To tackle this issue, we consider a framework where a human labeler can provide additional feedback in the form of corrective actions, which expresses the labeler's action preferences although this feedback may possibly be imperfect as well. In this setting, to obtain a better-aligned policy guided by both learning signals, we propose a novel value-based deep RL algorithm called Iterative learning from Corrective actions and Proxy rewards (ICoPro), which cycles through three phases: (1) Solicit sparse corrective actions from a human labeler on the agent's demonstrated trajectories; (2) Incorporate these corrective actions into the Q-function using a margin loss to enforce adherence to labeler's preferences; (3) Train the agent with standard RL losses regularized with a margin loss to learn from proxy rewards and propagate the Q-values learned from human feedback. Moreover, another novel design in our approach is to integrate pseudo-labels from the target Q-network to reduce human labor and further stabilize training. We experimentally validate our proposition on a variety of tasks (Atari games and autonomous driving on highway). On the one hand, using proxy rewards with different levels of imperfection, our method can better align with human preferences and is more sample-efficient than baseline methods. On the other hand, facing corrective actions with different types of imperfection, our method can overcome the non-optimality of this feedback thanks to the guidance from proxy reward.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang He, Xiaoxia Huang, Lanhua Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has emerged as a propelling technology in vehicular communication. Usually, an appropriate decision on user association requires timely channel information between vehicles and base stations (BSs), which is challenging given a fast-fading mmWave vehicular channel. In this paper, relying solely on learning transmission rate, we propose a low-complexity semi-distributed contextual correlated upper confidence bound (SD-CC-UCB) algorithm to establish an up-to-date user association without explicit measurement of channel state information (CSI). Under a contextual multi-arm bandits framework, SD-CC-UCB learns and predicts the transmission rate given the location and velocity of the vehicle, which can adequately capture the intricate channel condition for a prompt decision on user association. Further, SD-CC-UCB efficiently identifies the set of candidate BSs which probably support supreme transmission rate by leveraging the correlated distributions of transmission rates on different locations. To further refine the learning transmission rate over the link to candidate BSs, each vehicle deploys the Thompson Sampling algorithm by taking the interference among vehicles and handover overhead into consideration. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm achieves the network throughput within 100%-103% of a benchmark algorithm which requires perfect instantaneous CSI, demonstrating the effectiveness of SD-CC-UCB in vehicular communications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Quadir, M. Sajid, Mushir Akhtar, M. Tanveer, P. N. Suganthan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose enhanced feature based granular ball twin support vector machine (EF-GBTSVM). EF-GBTSVM employs the coarse granularity of granular balls (GBs) as input rather than individual data samples. The GBs are mapped to the feature space of the hidden layer using random projection followed by the utilization of a non-linear activation function. The concatenation of original and hidden features derived from the centers of GBs gives rise to an enhanced feature space, commonly referred to as the random vector functional link (RVFL) space. This space encapsulates nuanced feature information to GBs. Further, we employ twin support vector machine (TSVM) in the RVFL space for classification. TSVM generates the two non-parallel hyperplanes in the enhanced feature space, which improves the generalization performance of the proposed EF-GBTSVM model. Moreover, the coarser granularity of the GBs enables the proposed EF-GBTSVM model to exhibit robustness to resampling, showcasing reduced susceptibility to the impact of noise and outliers. We undertake a thorough evaluation of the proposed EF-GBTSVM model on benchmark UCI and KEEL datasets. This evaluation encompasses scenarios with and without the inclusion of label noise. Moreover, experiments using NDC datasets further emphasize the proposed model's ability to handle large datasets. Experimental results, supported by thorough statistical analyses, demonstrate that the proposed EF-GBTSVM model significantly outperforms the baseline models in terms of generalization capabilities, scalability, and robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binchuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: The underlying mechanism by which simple gradient-based iterative algorithms can effectively handle the non-convex problem of deep model training remains incompletely understood within the traditional convex and non-convex analysis frameworks, which often require the Lipschitz smoothness of the gradient and strong convexity. In this paper, we introduce $\mathcal{H}(\phi)$-convexity and $\mathcal{H}(\Phi)$-smoothness, which broaden the existing concepts of smoothness and convexity, and delineate their fundamental properties. Building on these concepts, we introduce the high-order gradient descent and high-order stochastic gradient descent methods, which serve as extensions to the traditional gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent methods, respectively. Furthermore, we establish descent lemmas for the $\mathcal{H}(\phi)$-convex and $\mathcal{H}(\Phi)$-smooth objective functions when utilizing these four methods. On the basis of these findings, we develop the gradient structure control algorithm to address non-convex optimization objectives, encompassing both the functions represented by machine learning models and common loss functions in deep learning. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is empirically validated through experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniela Gallo, Angelica Liguori, Ettore Ritacco, Luca Caviglione, Fabrizio Durante, Giuseppe Manco</p>
<p>Abstract: To achieve accurate and unbiased predictions, Machine Learning (ML) models rely on large, heterogeneous, and high-quality datasets. However, this could raise ethical and legal concerns regarding copyright and authorization aspects, especially when information is gathered from the Internet. With the rise of generative models, being able to track data has become of particular importance, especially since they may (un)intentionally replicate copyrighted contents. Therefore, this work proposes Copyright Audit via Prompts generation (CAP), a framework for automatically testing whether an ML model has been trained with unauthorized data. Specifically, we devise an approach to generate suitable keys inducing the model to reveal copyrighted contents. To prove its effectiveness, we conducted an extensive evaluation campaign on measurements collected in four IoT scenarios. The obtained results showcase the effectiveness of CAP, when used against both realistic and synthetic datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aapo Hyv\"arinen</p>
<p>Abstract: The Langevin algorithm is a classic method for sampling from a given pdf in a real space. In its basic version, it only requires knowledge of the gradient of the log-density, also called the score function. However, in deep learning, it is often easier to learn the so-called "noisy score function", i.e. the gradient of the log-density of noisy data, more precisely when Gaussian noise is added to the data. Such an estimate is biased and complicates the use of the Langevin method. Here, we propose a noise-corrected version of the Langevin algorithm, where the bias due to noisy data is removed, at least regarding first-order terms. Unlike diffusion models, our algorithm needs to know the noisy score function for one single noise level only. We further propose a simple special case which has an interesting intuitive interpretation of iteratively adding noise the data and then attempting to remove half of that noise.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05838">Time Transfer: On Optimal Learning Rate and Batch Size In The Infinite Data Limit</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Oleg Filatov, Jan Ebert, Jiangtao Wang, Stefan Kesselheim</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the main challenges in optimal scaling of large language models (LLMs) is the prohibitive cost of hyperparameter tuning, particularly learning rate $\eta$ and batch size $B$. While techniques like $\mu$P (Yang et al., 2022) provide scaling rules for optimal $\eta$ transfer in the infinite model size limit, the optimal scaling behavior in the infinite data size limit ($T \to \infty$) remains unknown. We fill in this gap by observing for the first time an interplay of three optimal $\eta$ scaling regimes: $\eta \propto \sqrt{T}$, $\eta \propto 1$, and $\eta \propto 1/\sqrt{T}$ with transitions controlled by $B$ and its relation to the time-evolving critical batch size $B_\mathrm{crit} \propto T$. Furthermore, we show that the optimal batch size is positively correlated with $B_\mathrm{crit}$: keeping it fixed becomes suboptimal over time even if learning rate is scaled optimally. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that the observed optimal $\eta$ and $B$ dynamics are preserved with $\mu$P model scaling, challenging the conventional view of $B_\mathrm{crit}$ dependence solely on loss value. Complementing optimality, we examine the sensitivity of loss to changes in learning rate, where we find the sensitivity to decrease with $T \to \infty$ and to remain constant with $\mu$P model scaling. We hope our results make the first step towards a unified picture of the joint optimal data and model scaling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming scientific computing with deep neural network surrogates that approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional off-line training methods face issues with storage and I/O efficiency, as the training dataset has to be computed with numerical solvers up-front. Our previous work, the Melissa framework, addresses these problems by enabling data to be created "on-the-fly" and streamed directly into the training process. In this paper we introduce a new active learning method to enhance data-efficiency for on-line surrogate training. The surrogate is direct and multi-parametric, i.e., it is trained to predict a given timestep directly with different initial and boundary conditions parameters. Our approach uses Adaptive Multiple Importance Sampling guided by training loss statistics, in order to focus NN training on the difficult areas of the parameter space. Preliminary results for 2D heat PDE demonstrate the potential of this method, called Breed, to improve the generalization capabilities of surrogates while reducing computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study differentially private (DP) optimization algorithms for stochastic and empirical objectives which are neither smooth nor convex, and propose methods that return a Goldstein-stationary point with sample complexity bounds that improve on existing works. We start by providing a single-pass $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithm that returns an $(\alpha,\beta)$-stationary point as long as the dataset is of size $\widetilde{\Omega}\left(1/\alpha\beta^{3}+d/\epsilon\alpha\beta^{2}+d^{3/4}/\epsilon^{1/2}\alpha\beta^{5/2}\right)$, which is $\Omega(\sqrt{d})$ times smaller than the algorithm of Zhang et al. [2024] for this task, where $d$ is the dimension. We then provide a multi-pass polynomial time algorithm which further improves the sample complexity to $\widetilde{\Omega}\left(d/\beta^2+d^{3/4}/\epsilon\alpha^{1/2}\beta^{3/2}\right)$, by designing a sample efficient ERM algorithm, and proving that Goldstein-stationary points generalize from the empirical loss to the population loss.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vibration-based condition monitoring techniques are commonly used to identify faults in rolling element bearings. Accuracy and speed of fault detection procedures are critical performance measures in condition monitoring. Delay is especially important in remote condition monitoring and time-sensitive industrial applications. While most existing methods focus on accuracy, little attention has been given to the inference time in the fault identification process. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach for real-time fault identification in rolling element bearings. We encode raw vibration signals into two-dimensional images using various encoding methods and use these with a CNN to classify several categories of bearing fault types and sizes. We analyse the interplay between fault identification accuracy and processing time. For training and evaluation we use a bearing failure CWRU dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuopeng Xu, Yujie Li, Cheng Liu, Ning Gui</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying causal relations from purely observational data typically requires additional assumptions on relations and/or noise. Most current methods restrict their analysis to datasets that are assumed to have pure linear or nonlinear relations, which is often not reflective of real-world datasets that contain a combination of both. This paper presents CaPS, an ordering-based causal discovery algorithm that effectively handles linear and nonlinear relations. CaPS introduces a novel identification criterion for topological ordering and incorporates the concept of "parent score" during the post-processing optimization stage. These scores quantify the strength of the average causal effect, helping to accelerate the pruning process and correct inaccurate predictions in the pruning step. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solutions outperform state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data with varying ratios of linear and nonlinear relations. The results obtained from real-world data also support the competitiveness of CaPS. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/E2real/CaPS.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the realm of computational physics, an enduring topic is the numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, the attention of researchers has shifted towards Neural Operator methods, renowned for their capability to approximate ``operators'' -- mappings from functions to functions. Despite the universal approximation theorem within neural operators, ensuring error bounds often requires employing numerous Fourier layers. However, what about lightweight models? In response to this question, we introduce DimOL (Dimension-aware Operator Learning), drawing insights from dimensional analysis. To implement DimOL, we propose the ProdLayer, which can be seamlessly integrated into FNO-based and Transformer-based PDE solvers, enhancing their ability to handle sum-of-products structures inherent in many physical systems. Empirically, DimOL models achieve up to 48% performance gain within the PDE datasets. Furthermore, by analyzing Fourier components' weights, we can symbolically discern the physical significance of each term. This sheds light on the opaque nature of neural networks, unveiling underlying physical principles.</p>

Existing architecture-based strategies encounter two primary challenges: 1) Integrating a pre-trained network with a trainable sub-network complicates the delicate balance between learning plasticity and memory stability across evolving tasks during learning. 2) The absence of robust interconnections between pre-trained networks and various sub-networks limits the effective retrieval of pertinent information during inference. In this study, we introduce the Artsy, inspired by the activation mechanisms of silent synapses via spike-timing-dependent plasticity observed in mature brains, to enhance the continual learning capabilities of pre-trained models. The Artsy integrates two key components: During training, the Artsy mimics mature brain dynamics by maintaining memory stability for previously learned knowledge within the pre-trained network while simultaneously promoting learning plasticity in task-specific sub-networks. During inference, artificial silent and functional synapses are utilized to establish precise connections between the pre-synaptic neurons in the pre-trained network and the post-synaptic neurons in the sub-networks, facilitated through synaptic consolidation, thereby enabling effective extraction of relevant information from test samples. Comprehensive experimental evaluations reveal that our model significantly outperforms conventional methods on class-incremental learning tasks, while also providing enhanced biological interpretability for architecture-based approaches. Moreover, we propose that the Artsy offers a promising avenue for simulating biological synaptic mechanisms, potentially advancing our understanding of neural plasticity in both artificial and biological systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Jourdan, Gregory Schwartzman</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the first mini-batch kernel $k$-means algorithm, offering an order of magnitude improvement in running time compared to the full batch algorithm. A single iteration of our algorithm takes $\widetilde{O}(kb^2)$ time, significantly faster than the $O(n^2)$ time required by the full batch kernel $k$-means, where $n$ is the dataset size and $b$ is the batch size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithm consistently achieves a 10-100x speedup with minimal loss in quality, addressing the slow runtime that has limited kernel $k$-means adoption in practice. We further complement these results with a theoretical analysis under an early stopping condition, proving that with a batch size of $\widetilde{\Omega}(\max \{\gamma^{4}, \gamma^{2}\} \cdot \epsilon^{-2})$, the algorithm terminates in $O(\gamma^2/\epsilon)$ iterations with high probability, where $\gamma$ bounds the norm of points in feature space and $\epsilon$ is a termination threshold. Our analysis holds for any reasonable center initialization, and when using $k$-means++ initialization, the algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $O(\log k)$ in expectation. For normalized kernels, such as Gaussian or Laplacian it holds that $\gamma=1$. Taking $\epsilon = O(1)$ and $b=\Theta(\log n)$, the algorithm terminates in $O(1)$ iterations, with each iteration running in $\widetilde{O}(k)$ time.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05911">Accelerating Error Correction Code Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Matan Levy, Yoni Choukroun, Lior Wolf</p>
<p>Abstract: Error correction codes (ECC) are crucial for ensuring reliable information transmission in communication systems. Choukroun & Wolf (2022b) recently introduced the Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT), which has demonstrated promising performance across various transmission channels and families of codes. However, its high computational and memory demands limit its practical applications compared to traditional decoding algorithms. Achieving effective quantization of the ECCT presents significant challenges due to its inherently small architecture, since existing, very low-precision quantization techniques often lead to performance degradation in compact neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel acceleration method for transformer-based decoders. We first propose a ternary weight quantization method specifically designed for the ECCT, inducing a decoder with multiplication-free linear layers. We present an optimized self-attention mechanism to reduce computational complexity via codeaware multi-heads processing. Finally, we provide positional encoding via the Tanner graph eigendecomposition, enabling a richer representation of the graph connectivity. The approach not only matches or surpasses ECCT's performance but also significantly reduces energy consumption, memory footprint, and computational complexity. Our method brings transformer-based error correction closer to practical implementation in resource-constrained environments, achieving a 90% compression ratio and reducing arithmetic operation energy consumption by at least 224 times on modern hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Sol\'is-Garc\'ia, Bel\'en Vega-M\'arquez, Juan A. Nepomuceno, Isabel A. Nepomuceno-Chamorro</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of imputing multivariate time series spans a wide range of fields, from clinical healthcare to multi-sensor systems. Initially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were employed for this task; however, their error accumulation issues led to the adoption of Transformers, leveraging attention mechanisms to mitigate these problems. Concurrently, the promising results of diffusion models in capturing original distributions have positioned them at the forefront of current research, often in conjunction with Transformers. In this paper, we propose replacing time-oriented Transformers with State-Space Models (SSM), which are better suited for temporal data modeling. Specifically, we utilize the latest SSM variant, S6, which incorporates attention-like mechanisms. By embedding S6 within Mamba blocks, we develop a model that integrates SSM, Graph Neural Networks, and node-oriented Transformers to achieve enhanced spatiotemporal representations. Implementing these architectural modifications, previously unexplored in this field, we present Time series Imputation with Bi-directional mamba blocks and diffusion models (TIMBA). TIMBA achieves superior performance in almost all benchmark scenarios and performs comparably in others across a diverse range of missing value situations and three real-world datasets. We also evaluate how the performance of our model varies with different amounts of missing values and analyse its performance on downstream tasks. In addition, we provide the original code to replicate the results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elissa Mhanna, Mohamad Assaad</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-order (ZO) optimization is a powerful tool for dealing with realistic constraints. On the other hand, the gradient-tracking (GT) technique proved to be an efficient method for distributed optimization aiming to achieve consensus. However, it is a first-order (FO) method that requires knowledge of the gradient, which is not always possible in practice. In this work, we introduce a zero-order distributed optimization method based on a one-point estimate of the gradient tracking technique. We prove that this new technique converges with a single noisy function query at a time in the non-convex setting. We then establish a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{K}})$ after a number of iterations K, which competes with that of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{K}})$ of its centralized counterparts. Finally, a numerical example validates our theoretical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Li, Jie Ma, Miguel Ballesteros, Yassine Benajiba, Graham Horwood</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly versatile, numerous large scale benchmarks have been developed to thoroughly assess their capabilities. These benchmarks typically consist of diverse datasets and prompts to evaluate different aspects of LLM performance. However, comprehensive evaluations on hundreds or thousands of prompts incur tremendous costs in terms of computation, money, and time. In this work, we investigate strategies to improve evaluation efficiency by selecting a subset of examples from each benchmark using a learned policy. Our approach models the dependencies across test examples, allowing accurate prediction of the evaluation outcomes for the remaining examples based on the outcomes of the selected ones. Consequently, we only need to acquire the actual evaluation outcomes for the selected subset. We rigorously explore various subset selection policies and introduce a novel RL-based policy that leverages the captured dependencies. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of evaluation prompts required while maintaining accurate performance estimates compared to previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Ren, Zishi Zhang, Jinyang Jiang, Guanghao Li, Zeliang Zhang, Mingqian Feng, Yijie Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the limitations of backpropagation, perturbation-based gradient computation methods have recently gained focus for learning with only forward passes, also referred to as queries. Conventional forward learning consumes enormous queries on each data point for accurate gradient estimation through Monte Carlo sampling, which hinders the scalability of those algorithms. However, not all data points deserve equal queries for gradient estimation. In this paper, we study the problem of improving the forward learning efficiency from a novel perspective: how to reduce the gradient estimation variance with minimum cost? For this, we propose to allocate the optimal number of queries over each data in one batch during training to achieve a good balance between estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, with a simplified proxy objective and a reparameterization technique, we derive a novel plug-and-play query allocator with minimal parameters. Theoretical results are carried out to verify its optimality. We conduct extensive experiments for fine-tuning Vision Transformers on various datasets and further deploy the allocator to two black-box applications: prompt tuning and multimodal alignment for foundation models. All findings demonstrate that our proposed allocator significantly enhances the scalability of forward-learning algorithms, paving the way for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiguang Wu, Yaqing Wang, Yatao Bian, Quanming Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta-learning enables learning systems to adapt quickly to new tasks, similar to humans. To emulate this human-like rapid learning and enhance alignment and discrimination abilities, we propose ConML, a universal meta-learning framework that can be applied to various meta-learning algorithms without relying on specific model architectures nor target models. The core of ConML is task-level contrastive learning, which extends contrastive learning from the representation space in unsupervised learning to the model space in meta-learning. By leveraging task identity as an additional supervision signal during meta-training, we contrast the outputs of the meta-learner in the model space, minimizing inner-task distance (between models trained on different subsets of the same task) and maximizing inter-task distance (between models from different tasks). We demonstrate that ConML integrates seamlessly with optimization-based, metric-based, and amortization-based meta-learning algorithms, as well as in-context learning, resulting in performance improvements across diverse few-shot learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Loukas, Karolis Martinkus, Ed Wagstaff, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: As training datasets grow larger, we aspire to develop models that generalize well to any diverse test distribution, even if the latter deviates significantly from the training data. Various approaches like domain adaptation, domain generalization, and robust optimization attempt to address the out-of-distribution challenge by posing assumptions about the relation between training and test distribution. Differently, we adopt a more conservative perspective by accounting for the worst-case error across all sufficiently diverse test distributions within a known domain. Our first finding is that training on a uniform distribution over this domain is optimal. We also interrogate practical remedies when uniform samples are unavailable by considering methods for mitigating non-uniformity through finetuning and rebalancing. Our theory provides a mathematical grounding for previous observations on the role of entropy and rebalancing for o.o.d. generalization and foundation model training. We also provide new empirical evidence across tasks involving o.o.d. shifts which illustrate the broad applicability of our perspective.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05985">Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent with Decoupled Backpropagation and Layer-Wise Updates</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Cabrel Teguemne Fokam, Khaleelulla Khan Nazeer, Lukas K\"onig, David Kappel, Anand Subramoney</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing size of deep learning models has created the need for more efficient alternatives to the standard error backpropagation algorithm, that make better use of asynchronous, parallel and distributed computing. One major shortcoming of backpropagation is the interlocking between the forward phase of the algorithm, which computes a global loss, and the backward phase where the loss is backpropagated through all layers to compute the gradients, which are used to update the network parameters. To address this problem, we propose a method that parallelises SGD updates across the layers of a model by asynchronously updating them from multiple threads. Furthermore, since we observe that the forward pass is often much faster than the backward pass, we use separate threads for the forward and backward pass calculations, which allows us to use a higher ratio of forward to backward threads than the usual 1:1 ratio, reducing the overall staleness of the parameters. Thus, our approach performs asynchronous stochastic gradient descent using separate threads for the loss (forward) and gradient (backward) computations and performs layer-wise partial updates to parameters in a distributed way. We show that this approach yields close to state-of-the-art results while running up to 2.97x faster than Hogwild! scaled on multiple devices (Locally-Partitioned-Asynchronous-Parallel SGD). We theoretically prove the convergence of the algorithm using a novel theoretical framework based on stochastic differential equations and the drift diffusion process, by modeling the asynchronous parameter updates as a stochastic process.</p>

To study this I formulate an optimization problem using neural networks with different activation functions in the hidden layers. By initializing model weights with different random seeds, I calculate the Lyapunov exponent while performing traditional gradient descent on these model weights. The findings demonstrate that variations in the learning rate can induce chaotic changes in model weights. I also show that activation functions with more negative Lyapunov exponents exhibit better convergence properties. Additionally, the study also demonstrates that Lyapunov exponents can be utilized to select effective initial model weights for deep neural networks, potentially enhancing the optimization process.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06003">Is the MMI Criterion Necessary for Interpretability? Degenerating Non-causal Features to Plain Noise for Self-Rationalization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Liu, Zhiying Deng, Zhongyu Niu, Jun Wang, Haozhao Wang, YuanKai Zhang, Ruixuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: An important line of research in the field of explainability is to extract a small subset of crucial rationales from the full input. The most widely used criterion for rationale extraction is the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. However, in certain datasets, there are spurious features non-causally correlated with the label and also get high mutual information, complicating the loss landscape of MMI. Although some penalty-based methods have been developed to penalize the spurious features (e.g., invariance penalty, intervention penalty, etc) to help MMI work better, these are merely remedial measures. In the optimization objectives of these methods, spurious features are still distinguished from plain noise, which hinders the discovery of causal rationales. This paper aims to develop a new criterion that treats spurious features as plain noise, allowing the model to work on datasets rich in spurious features as if it were working on clean datasets, thereby making rationale extraction easier. We theoretically observe that removing either plain noise or spurious features from the input does not alter the conditional distribution of the remaining components relative to the task label. However, significant changes in the conditional distribution occur only when causal features are eliminated. Based on this discovery, the paper proposes a criterion for \textbf{M}aximizing the \textbf{R}emaining \textbf{D}iscrepancy (MRD). Experiments on six widely used datasets show that our MRD criterion improves rationale quality (measured by the overlap with human-annotated rationales) by up to $10.4\%$ as compared to several recent competitive MMI variants.

Using eigendecomposition of the pullback of the distance metric defined on the output space through the Jacobian of the model, we are able to reconstruct equivalence classes in the input space and navigate across them. We illustrate how this method can be used as a powerful tool for investigating how a Transformer sees the input space, facilitating local and task-agnostic explainability in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saqib Javed, Hieu Le, Mathieu Salzmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to train models that perform well not only on the training (source) domains but also on novel, unseen target data distributions. A key challenge in DG is preventing overfitting to source domains, which can be mitigated by finding flatter minima in the loss landscape. In this work, we propose Quantization-aware Training for Domain Generalization (QT-DoG) and demonstrate that weight quantization effectively leads to flatter minima in the loss landscape, thereby enhancing domain generalization. Unlike traditional quantization methods focused on model compression, QT-DoG exploits quantization as an implicit regularizer by inducing noise in model weights, guiding the optimization process toward flatter minima that are less sensitive to perturbations and overfitting. We provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence demonstrating that quantization inherently encourages flatter minima, leading to better generalization across domains. Moreover, with the benefit of reducing the model size through quantization, we demonstrate that an ensemble of multiple quantized models further yields superior accuracy than the state-of-the-art DG approaches with no computational or memory overheads. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that QT-DoG generalizes across various datasets, architectures, and quantization algorithms, and can be combined with other DG methods, establishing its versatility and robustness.</p>

In contrast to existing techniques such as distillation, probing, or early decoding, our expansions rely solely on the model itself and requires no data, training, or sampling from the model. We demonstrate how our framework grounds and subsumes logit lens, reveals a (super-)exponential path structure in the recursive residual depth and opens up several applications. These include sketching a transformer large language model with $n$-gram statistics extracted from its computations, and indexing the models' levels of toxicity knowledge. Our approach enables data-free analysis of residual computation for model interpretability, development, and evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Zhang, Jeffrey T. H. Wong, Can Xiao, George A. Constantinides, Yiren Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: he growing number of parameters and computational demands of large language models (LLMs) present significant challenges for their efficient deployment. Recently, there is an increasing interest in quantizing weights to extremely low precision while offsetting the resulting error with low-rank, high-precision error reconstruction terms. The combination of quantization and low-rank approximation is now popular in both adapter-based, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoftQ and low-precision inference techniques including ZeroQuant-V2. Usually, the low-rank terms are calculated via the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the weight quantization error, minimizing the Frobenius and spectral norms of the weight approximation error. Recent methods like LQ-LoRA and LQER introduced hand-crafted heuristics to minimize errors in layer outputs (activations) rather than weights, resulting improved quantization results. However, these heuristic methods lack an analytical solution to guide the design of quantization error reconstruction terms. In this paper, we revisit this problem and formulate an analytical framework, named Quantization Error Reconstruction Analysis (QERA), and offer a closed-form solution to the problem. We show QERA benefits both existing low-precision fine-tuning and inference methods -- QERA achieves a fine-tuned accuracy gain of $\Delta_{\text{acc}}$ = 6.05% of 2-bit RoBERTa-base on GLUE compared to LoftQ; and obtains $\Delta_{\text{acc}}$ = 2.97% higher post-training quantization accuracy of 4-bit Llama-3.1-70B on average than ZeroQuant-V2 and $\Delta_{\text{ppl}}$ = - 0.28 lower perplexity on WikiText2 than LQER.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning low-dimensional numerical representations from symbolic data, e.g., embedding the nodes of a graph into a geometric space, is an important concept in machine learning. While embedding into Euclidean space is common, recent observations indicate that hyperbolic geometry is better suited to represent hierarchical information and heterogeneous data (e.g., graphs with a scale-free degree distribution). Despite their potential for more accurate representations, hyperbolic embeddings also have downsides like being more difficult to compute and harder to use in downstream tasks.
  We propose embedding into a weighted space, which is closely related to hyperbolic geometry but mathematically simpler. We provide the embedding algorithm WEmbed and demonstrate, based on generated as well as over 2000 real-world graphs, that our weighted embeddings heavily outperform state-of-the-art Euclidean embeddings for heterogeneous graphs while using fewer dimensions. The running time of WEmbed and embedding quality for the remaining instances is on par with state-of-the-art Euclidean embedders.</p>

Nonetheless, existing results remain hard to compare and a fine-grained understanding of the trainability of transformers on regular languages is still lacking. We investigate transformers trained on regular languages from a mechanistic interpretability perspective. Using an extension of the $L^*$ algorithm, we extract Moore machines from transformers. We empirically find tighter lower bounds on the trainability of transformers, when a finite number of symbols determine the state. Additionally, our mechanistic insight allows us to characterise the regular languages a one-layer transformer can learn with good length generalisation. However, we also identify failure cases where the determining symbols get misrecognised due to saturation of the attention mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominik Gond, Jan-Tobias Sohns, Heike Leitte, Hans Hasse, Fabian Jirasek</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the thermodynamic properties of mixtures is crucial for process design and optimization in chemical engineering. Machine learning (ML) methods are gaining increasing attention in this field, but experimental data for training are often scarce, which hampers their application. In this work, we introduce a novel generic approach for improving data-driven models: inspired by the ancient rule "similia similibus solvuntur", we lump components that behave similarly into chemical classes and model them jointly in the first step of a hierarchical approach. While the information on class affiliations can stem in principle from any source, we demonstrate how classes can reproducibly be defined based on mixture data alone by agglomerative clustering. The information from this clustering step is then used as an informed prior for fitting the individual data. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach by applying it in connection with a matrix completion method (MCM) for predicting isothermal activity coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. Using clustering leads to significantly improved predictions compared to an MCM without clustering. Furthermore, the chemical classes learned from the clustering give exciting insights into what matters on the molecular level for modeling given mixture properties.</p>

  This approach comes at the computational cost of exploring a large, non-convex hypothesis space. In particular, solving the maximum likelihood term involves counting the number of linear extensions of posets, which in general is #P-complete. Fortunately, bound estimates suffice for model comparison, and admit incorporation into a bespoke branch-and-bound algorithm. We show that the posterior probability as defined is antitonic w.r.t. search depth for branching rules that are monotonic w.r.t. model inclusion. This allows pruning of large portions of the search space, which we show experimentally leads to rapid convergence toward optimal solutions that are consistent with manually built EKGs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angela van Sprang, Erman Acar, Willem Zuidema</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been a recent push of research on Transformer-based models for long-term time series forecasting, even though they are inherently difficult to interpret and explain. While there is a large body of work on interpretability methods for various domains and architectures, the interpretability of Transformer-based forecasting models remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we develop a framework based on Concept Bottleneck Models to enforce interpretability of time series Transformers. We modify the training objective to encourage a model to develop representations similar to predefined interpretable concepts. In our experiments, we enforce similarity using Centered Kernel Alignment, and the predefined concepts include time features and an interpretable, autoregressive surrogate model (AR). We apply the framework to the Autoformer model, and present an in-depth analysis for a variety of benchmark tasks. We find that the model performance remains mostly unaffected, while the model shows much improved interpretability. Additionally, interpretable concepts become local, which makes the trained model easily intervenable. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a successful intervention in the scenario of a time shift in the data, which eliminates the need to retrain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Chen, Dingling Yao, Adeel Pervez, Dan Alistarh, Francesco Locatello</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Scalable Mechanistic Neural Network (S-MNN), an enhanced neural network framework designed for scientific machine learning applications involving long temporal sequences. By reformulating the original Mechanistic Neural Network (MNN) (Pervez et al., 2024), we reduce the computational time and space complexities from cubic and quadratic with respect to the sequence length, respectively, to linear. This significant improvement enables efficient modeling of long-term dynamics without sacrificing accuracy or interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S-MNN matches the original MNN in precision while substantially reducing computational resources. Consequently, S-MNN can drop-in replace the original MNN in applications, providing a practical and efficient tool for integrating mechanistic bottlenecks into neural network models of complex dynamical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geoffrey Cideron, Andrea Agostinelli, Johan Ferret, Sertan Girgin, Romuald Elie, Olivier Bachem, Sarah Perrin, Alexandre Ram\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models are transforming creative domains such as music generation, with inference-time strategies like Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) playing a crucial role. However, CFG doubles inference cost while limiting originality and diversity across generated contents. In this paper, we introduce diversity-rewarded CFG distillation, a novel finetuning procedure that distills the strengths of CFG while addressing its limitations. Our approach optimises two training objectives: (1) a distillation objective, encouraging the model alone (without CFG) to imitate the CFG-augmented predictions, and (2) an RL objective with a diversity reward, promoting the generation of diverse outputs for a given prompt. By finetuning, we learn model weights with the ability to generate high-quality and diverse outputs, without any inference overhead. This also unlocks the potential of weight-based model merging strategies: by interpolating between the weights of two models (the first focusing on quality, the second on diversity), we can control the quality-diversity trade-off at deployment time, and even further boost performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the MusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023) text-to-music generative model, where our approach surpasses CFG in terms of quality-diversity Pareto optimality. According to human evaluators, our finetuned-then-merged model generates samples with higher quality-diversity than the base model augmented with CFG.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi-Hao Zhou, Siyuan Fang, Zi-Jing Zhou, Tong Wei, Yuanyu Wan, Min-Ling Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-tailed semi-supervised learning poses a significant challenge in training models with limited labeled data exhibiting a long-tailed label distribution. Current state-of-the-art LTSSL approaches heavily rely on high-quality pseudo-labels for large-scale unlabeled data. However, these methods often neglect the impact of representations learned by the neural network and struggle with real-world unlabeled data, which typically follows a different distribution than labeled data. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic framework that unifies various recent proposals in long-tail learning. Our framework derives the class-balanced contrastive loss through Gaussian kernel density estimation. We introduce a continuous contrastive learning method, CCL, extending our framework to unlabeled data using reliable and smoothed pseudo-labels. By progressively estimating the underlying label distribution and optimizing its alignment with model predictions, we tackle the diverse distribution of unlabeled data in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets with varying unlabeled data distributions demonstrate that CCL consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 4% improvement on the ImageNet-127 dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Messuti, ortensia Amoroso, Ferdinando Napolitano, Mariarosaria Falanga, Paolo Capuano, Silvia Scarpetta</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable success in various fields, including seismology. However, one major challenge in deep learning is the presence of mislabeled examples. Additionally, accurately estimating model uncertainty is another challenge in machine learning. In this study, we develop Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify seismic waveforms based on first-motion polarity. We trained multiple CNN models with different settings. We also constructed ensembles of networks to estimate uncertainty. The results showed that each training setting achieved satisfactory performances, with the ensemble method outperforming individual networks in uncertainty estimation. We observe that the uncertainty estimation ability of the ensembles of networks can be enhanced using dropout layers. In addition, comparisons among different training settings revealed that the use of dropout improved the robustness of networks to mislabeled examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Huertas Celdr\'an, Chao Feng, Sabyasachi Banik, Gerome Bovet, Gregorio Martinez Perez, Burkhard Stiller</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), introduced in 2016, was designed to enhance data privacy in collaborative model training environments. Among the FL paradigm, horizontal FL, where clients share the same set of features but different data samples, has been extensively studied in both centralized and decentralized settings. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), which is crucial in real-world decentralized scenarios where clients possess different, yet sensitive, data about the same entity, remains underexplored. Thus, this work introduces De-VertiFL, a novel solution for training models in a decentralized VFL setting. De-VertiFL contributes by introducing a new network architecture distribution, an innovative knowledge exchange scheme, and a distributed federated training process. Specifically, De-VertiFL enables the sharing of hidden layer outputs among federation clients, allowing participants to benefit from intermediate computations, thereby improving learning efficiency. De-VertiFL has been evaluated using a variety of well-known datasets, including both image and tabular data, across binary and multiclass classification tasks. The results demonstrate that De-VertiFL generally surpasses state-of-the-art methods in F1-score performance, while maintaining a decentralized and privacy-preserving framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divyat Mahajan, Jannes Gladrow, Agrin Hilmkil, Cheng Zhang, Meyer Scetbon</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing acquisition of datasets over time, we now have access to precise and varied descriptions of the world, capturing all sorts of phenomena. These datasets can be seen as empirical observations of unknown causal generative processes, which can commonly be described by Structural Causal Models (SCMs). Recovering these causal generative processes from observations poses formidable challenges, and often require to learn a specific generative model for each dataset. In this work, we propose to learn a \emph{single} model capable of inferring in a zero-shot manner the causal generative processes of datasets. Rather than learning a specific SCM for each dataset, we enable the Fixed-Point Approach (FiP) proposed in~\cite{scetbon2024fip}, to infer the generative SCMs conditionally on their empirical representations. More specifically, we propose to amortize the learning of a conditional version of FiP to infer generative SCMs from observations and causal structures on synthetically generated datasets. We show that our model is capable of predicting in zero-shot the true generative SCMs, and as a by-product, of (i) generating new dataset samples, and (ii) inferring intervened ones. Our experiments demonstrate that our amortized procedure achieves performances on par with SoTA methods trained specifically for each dataset on both in and out-of-distribution problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that SCMs are inferred in a zero-shot manner from observations, paving the way for a paradigmatic shift towards the assimilation of causal knowledge across datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barak Gahtan, Robert J. Shahla, Reuven Cohen, Alex M. Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: QUIC, a new and increasingly used transport protocol, enhances TCP by providing better security, performance, and features like stream multiplexing. These features, however, also impose challenges for network middle-boxes that need to monitor and analyze web traffic. This paper proposes a novel solution for estimating the number of HTTP/3 responses in a given QUIC connection by an observer. This estimation reveals server behavior, client-server interactions, and data transmission efficiency, which is crucial for various applications such as designing a load balancing solution and detecting HTTP/3 flood attacks. The proposed scheme transforms QUIC connection traces into a sequence of images and trains machine learning (ML) models to predict the number of responses. Then, by aggregating images of a QUIC connection, an observer can estimate the total number of responses. As the problem is formulated as a discrete regression problem, we introduce a dedicated loss function. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a dataset of over seven million images, generated from $100,000$ traces collected from over $44,000$ websites over a four-month period, from various vantage points. The scheme achieves up to 97\% cumulative accuracy in both known and unknown web server settings and 92\% accuracy in estimating the total number of responses in unseen QUIC traces.</p>

<p>Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has shown great potential in various applications, such as robot control. However, traditional IL methods are usually designed to learn only one specific type of behavior since demonstrations typically correspond to a single expert. In this work, we introduce the first generic framework for Quality Diversity Imitation Learning (QD-IL), which enables the agent to learn a broad range of skills from limited demonstrations. Our framework integrates the principles of quality diversity with adversarial imitation learning (AIL) methods, and can potentially improve any inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) method. Empirically, our framework significantly improves the QD performance of GAIL and VAIL on the challenging continuous control tasks derived from Mujoco environments. Moreover, our method even achieves 2x expert performance in the most challenging Humanoid environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Chen, Ang Li, Ethan Che, Tianyi Peng, Jing Dong, Hongseok Namkoong</p>
<p>Abstract: Queuing network control determines the allocation of scarce resources to manage congestion, a fundamental problem in manufacturing, communications, and healthcare. Compared to standard RL problems, queueing problems are distinguished by unique challenges: i) a system operating in continuous time, ii) high stochasticity, and iii) long horizons over which the system can become unstable (exploding delays). To spur methodological progress tackling these challenges, we present an open-sourced queueing simulation framework, QGym, that benchmark queueing policies across realistic problem instances. Our modular framework allows the researchers to build on our initial instances, which provide a wide range of environments including parallel servers, criss-cross, tandem, and re-entrant networks, as well as a realistically calibrated hospital queuing system. QGym makes it easy to compare multiple policies, including both model-free RL methods and classical queuing policies. Our testbed complements the traditional focus on evaluating algorithms based on mathematical guarantees in idealized settings, and significantly expands the scope of empirical benchmarking in prior work.

<p>Abstract: We study the least-square regression problem with a two-layer fully-connected neural network, with ReLU activation function, trained by gradient flow. Our first result is a generalization result, that requires no assumptions on the underlying regression function or the noise other than that they are bounded. We operate in the neural tangent kernel regime, and our generalization result is developed via a decomposition of the excess risk into estimation and approximation errors, viewing gradient flow as an implicit regularizer. This decomposition in the context of neural networks is a novel perspective of gradient descent, and helps us avoid uniform convergence traps. In this work, we also establish that under the same setting, the trained network overfits to the data. Together, these results, establishes the first result on benign overfitting for finite-width ReLU networks for arbitrary regression functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adarsh Kumarappan, Mo Tiwari, Peiyang Song, Robert Joseph George, Chaowei Xiao, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful in mathematical reasoning tasks such as formal theorem proving when integrated with interactive proof assistants like Lean. Existing approaches involve training or fine-tuning an LLM on a specific dataset to perform well on particular domains, such as undergraduate-level mathematics. These methods struggle with generalizability to advanced mathematics. A fundamental limitation is that these approaches operate on static domains, failing to capture how mathematicians often work across multiple domains and projects simultaneously or cyclically. We present LeanAgent, a novel lifelong learning framework for theorem proving that continuously generalizes to and improves on ever-expanding mathematical knowledge without forgetting previously learned knowledge. LeanAgent introduces several key innovations, including a curriculum learning strategy that optimizes the learning trajectory in terms of mathematical difficulty, a dynamic database for efficient management of evolving mathematical knowledge, and progressive training to balance stability and plasticity. LeanAgent successfully proves 162 theorems previously unproved by humans across 23 diverse Lean repositories, many from advanced mathematics. It performs up to 11$\times$ better than the static LLM baseline, proving challenging theorems in domains like abstract algebra and algebraic topology while showcasing a clear progression of learning from basic concepts to advanced topics. In addition, we analyze LeanAgent's superior performance on key lifelong learning metrics. LeanAgent achieves exceptional scores in stability and backward transfer, where learning new tasks improves performance on previously learned tasks. This emphasizes LeanAgent's continuous generalizability and improvement, explaining its superior theorem proving performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06212">Solving robust MDPs as a sequence of static RL problems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Adil Zouitine, Matthieu Geist, Emmanuel Rachelson</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing control policies whose performance level is guaranteed to remain above a given threshold in a span of environments is a critical feature for the adoption of reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world applications. The search for such robust policies is a notoriously difficult problem, related to the so-called dynamic model of transition function uncertainty, where the environment dynamics are allowed to change at each time step. But in practical cases, one is rather interested in robustness to a span of static transition models throughout interaction episodes. The static model is known to be harder to solve than the dynamic one, and seminal algorithms, such as robust value iteration, as well as most recent works on deep robust RL, build upon the dynamic model. In this work, we propose to revisit the static model. We suggest an analysis of why solving the static model under some mild hypotheses is a reasonable endeavor, based on an equivalence with the dynamic model, and formalize the general intuition that robust MDPs can be solved by tackling a series of static problems. We introduce a generic meta-algorithm called IWOCS, which incrementally identifies worst-case transition models so as to guide the search for a robust policy. Discussion on IWOCS sheds light on new ways to decouple policy optimization and adversarial transition functions and opens new perspectives for analysis. We derive a deep RL version of IWOCS and demonstrate it is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms on classical benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael K. Cohen, Marcus Hutter, Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning, if the agent's reward differs from the designers' true utility, even only rarely, the state distribution resulting from the agent's policy can be very bad, in theory and in practice. When RL policies would devolve into undesired behavior, a common countermeasure is KL regularization to a trusted policy ("Don't do anything I wouldn't do"). All current cutting-edge language models are RL agents that are KL-regularized to a "base policy" that is purely predictive. Unfortunately, we demonstrate that when this base policy is a Bayesian predictive model of a trusted policy, the KL constraint is no longer reliable for controlling the behavior of an advanced RL agent. We demonstrate this theoretically using algorithmic information theory, and while systems today are too weak to exhibit this theorized failure precisely, we RL-finetune a language model and find evidence that our formal results are plausibly relevant in practice. We also propose a theoretical alternative that avoids this problem by replacing the "Don't do anything I wouldn't do" principle with "Don't do anything I mightn't do".</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> In\^es Oliveira e Silva, S\'ergio Jesus, Hugo Ferreira, Pedro Saleiro, In\^es Sousa, Pedro Bizarro, Carlos Soares</p>
<p>Abstract: Data used by automated decision-making systems, such as Machine Learning models, often reflects discriminatory behavior that occurred in the past. These biases in the training data are sometimes related to label noise, such as in COMPAS, where more African-American offenders are wrongly labeled as having a higher risk of recidivism when compared to their White counterparts. Models trained on such biased data may perpetuate or even aggravate the biases with respect to sensitive information, such as gender, race, or age. However, while multiple label noise correction approaches are available in the literature, these focus on model performance exclusively. In this work, we propose Fair-OBNC, a label noise correction method with fairness considerations, to produce training datasets with measurable demographic parity. The presented method adapts Ordering-Based Noise Correction, with an adjusted criterion of ordering, based both on the margin of error of an ensemble, and the potential increase in the observed demographic parity of the dataset. We evaluate Fair-OBNC against other different pre-processing techniques, under different scenarios of controlled label noise. Our results show that the proposed method is the overall better alternative within the pool of label correction methods, being capable of attaining better reconstructions of the original labels. Models trained in the corrected data have an increase, on average, of 150% in demographic parity, when compared to models trained in data with noisy labels, across the considered levels of label noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Kannan</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to steer AI behavior is crucial to preventing its long term dangerous and catastrophic potential. Representation Engineering (RepE) has emerged as a novel, powerful method to steer internal model behaviors, such as "honesty", at a top-down level. Understanding the steering of representations should thus be placed at the forefront of alignment initiatives. Unfortunately, current efforts to understand plasticity at this level are highly neglected. This paper aims to bridge the knowledge gap and understand how LLM representation stability, specifically for the concept of "honesty", and model plasticity evolve by applying steering vectors extracted at different fine-tuning stages, revealing differing magnitudes of shifts in model behavior. The findings are pivotal, showing that while early steering exhibits high plasticity, later stages have a surprisingly responsive critical window. This pattern is observed across different model architectures, signaling that there is a general pattern of model plasticity that can be used for effective intervention. These insights greatly contribute to the field of AI transparency, addressing a pressing lack of efficiency limiting our ability to effectively steer model behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marius-Constantin Dinu</p>
<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems advance, we move towards broad AI: systems capable of performing well on diverse tasks, understanding context, and adapting rapidly to new scenarios. A central challenge for broad AI systems is to generalize over tasks in related domains and being robust to distribution shifts. Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI bridges the gap between symbolic and sub-symbolic paradigms to address these challenges, enabling adaptable, generalizable, and more interpretable systems. The development of broad AI requires advancements in domain adaptation (DA), enabling models trained on source domains to effectively generalize to unseen target domains. Traditional approaches often rely on parameter optimization and fine-tuning, which can be impractical due to high costs and risks of catastrophic forgetting. NeSy AI systems use multiple models and methods to generalize to unseen domains and maintain performance across varying conditions. We analyze common DA and NeSy approaches with a focus on deep domain-invariant learning, extending to real-world challenges such as adapting to continuously changing domains and handling large domain gaps. We showcase state-of-the-art model-selection methods for scenarios with limited samples and introduce domain-specific adaptations without gradient-based updates for cases where model tuning is infeasible. This work establishes a framework for scalable and generalizable broad AI systems applicable across various problem settings, demonstrating how symbolic reasoning and large language models can build universal computational graphs that generalize across domains and problems, contributing to more adaptable AI approaches for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Allen Nie, Yi Su, Bo Chang, Jonathan N. Lee, Ed H. Chi, Quoc V. Le, Minmin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their success in many domains, large language models (LLMs) remain under-studied in scenarios requiring optimal decision-making under uncertainty. This is crucial as many real-world applications, ranging from personalized recommendations to healthcare interventions, demand that LLMs not only predict but also actively learn to make optimal decisions through exploration. In this work, we measure LLMs' (in)ability to make optimal decisions in bandits, a state-less reinforcement learning setting relevant to many applications. We develop a comprehensive suite of environments, including both context-free and contextual bandits with varying task difficulties, to benchmark LLMs' performance. Motivated by the existence of optimal exploration algorithms, we propose efficient ways to integrate this algorithmic knowledge into LLMs: by providing explicit algorithm-guided support during inference; and through algorithm distillation via in-context demonstrations and fine-tuning, using synthetic data generated from these algorithms. Impressively, these techniques allow us to achieve superior exploration performance with smaller models, surpassing larger models on various tasks. We conducted an extensive ablation study to shed light on various factors, such as task difficulty and data representation, that influence the efficiency of LLM exploration. Additionally, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the LLM's exploration efficiency using the concept of regret, linking its ability to explore to the model size and underlying algorithm.</p>

SymDiff resembles a learned data augmentation that is deployed at sampling time, and is lightweight, computationally efficient, and easy to implement on top of arbitrary off-the-shelf models. Notably, in contrast to previous work, SymDiff typically does not require any neural network components that are intrinsically equivariant, avoiding the need for complex parameterizations and the use of higher-order geometric features. Instead, our method can leverage highly scalable modern architectures as drop-in replacements for these more constrained alternatives. We show that this additional flexibility yields significant empirical benefit on $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariant molecular generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of symmetrisation to generative modelling, suggesting its potential in this domain more generally.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06264">Think While You Generate: Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sulin Liu, Juno Nam, Andrew Campbell, Hannes St\"ark, Yilun Xu, Tommi Jaakkola, Rafael G\'omez-Bombarelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete diffusion has achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming or approaching autoregressive models on standard benchmarks. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising (DDPD), a novel framework that separates the generation process into two models: a planner and a denoiser. At inference time, the planner selects which positions to denoise next by identifying the most corrupted positions in need of denoising, including both initially corrupted and those requiring additional refinement. This plan-and-denoise approach enables more efficient reconstruction during generation by iteratively identifying and denoising corruptions in the optimal order. DDPD outperforms traditional denoiser-only mask diffusion methods, achieving superior results on language modeling benchmarks such as text8, OpenWebText, and token-based generation on ImageNet $256 \times 256$. Notably, in language modeling, DDPD significantly reduces the performance gap between diffusion-based and autoregressive methods in terms of generative perplexity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Beer, Pascal Weber, Lukas Miklautz, Collin Leiber, Walid Durani, Christian B\"ohm, Claudia Plant</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting arbitrarily shaped clusters in high-dimensional noisy data is challenging for current clustering methods. We introduce SHADE (Structure-preserving High-dimensional Analysis with Density-based Exploration), the first deep clustering algorithm that incorporates density-connectivity into its loss function. Similar to existing deep clustering algorithms, SHADE supports high-dimensional and large data sets with the expressive power of a deep autoencoder. In contrast to most existing deep clustering methods that rely on a centroid-based clustering objective, SHADE incorporates a novel loss function that captures density-connectivity. SHADE thereby learns a representation that enhances the separation of density-connected clusters. SHADE detects a stable clustering and noise points fully automatically without any user input. It outperforms existing methods in clustering quality, especially on data that contain non-Gaussian clusters, such as video data. Moreover, the embedded space of SHADE is suitable for visualization and interpretation of the clustering results as the individual shapes of the clusters are preserved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Huang, Yue Liao, Jianhui Liu, Ruifei He, Haoru Tan, Shiming Zhang, Hongsheng Li, Si Liu, Xiaojuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts large language models (MoE-LLMs) marks a significant step forward of language models, however, they encounter two critical challenges in practice: 1) expert parameters lead to considerable memory consumption and loading latency; and 2) the current activated experts are redundant, as many tokens may only require a single expert. Motivated by these issues, we investigate the MoE-LLMs and make two key observations: a) different experts exhibit varying behaviors on activation reconstruction error, routing scores, and activated frequencies, highlighting their differing importance, and b) not all tokens are equally important -- only a small subset is critical. Building on these insights, we propose MC-MoE, a training-free Mixture-Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which leverages the significance of both experts and tokens to achieve an extreme compression. First, to mitigate storage and loading overheads, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization, which formulates the adaptive bit-width allocation as a Linear Programming problem, where the objective function balances multi-factors reflecting the importance of each expert. Additionally, we develop Online Dynamic Pruning, which identifies important tokens to retain and dynamically select activated experts for other tokens during inference to optimize efficiency while maintaining performance. Our MC-MoE integrates static quantization and dynamic pruning to collaboratively achieve extreme compression for MoE-LLMs with less accuracy loss, ensuring an optimal trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, at 2.54 bits, MC-MoE compresses 76.6% of the model, with only a 3.8% average accuracy loss. During dynamic inference, we further reduce activated parameters by 15%, with a performance drop of less than 0.6%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kawisorn Kamtue, Jose M. F. Moura, Orathai Sangpetch</p>
<p>Abstract: Calculus of Variations is the mathematics of functional optimization, i.e., when the solutions are functions over a time interval. This is particularly important when the time interval is unknown like in minimum-time control problems, so that forward in time solutions are not possible. Calculus of Variations offers a robust framework for learning optimal control and inference. How can this framework be leveraged to design neural networks to solve challenges in control and inference? We propose the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle Neural Network (PMP-net) that is tailored to estimate control and inference solutions, in accordance with the necessary conditions outlined by Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. We assess PMP-net on two classic optimal control and inference problems: optimal linear filtering and minimum-time control. Our findings indicate that PMP-net can be effectively trained in an unsupervised manner to solve these problems without the need for ground-truth data, successfully deriving the classical "Kalman filter" and "bang-bang" control solution. This establishes a new approach for addressing general, possibly yet unsolved, optimal control problems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06287">Non-Halting Queries: Exploiting Fixed Points in LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghaith Hammouri, Kemal Derya, Berk Sunar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new vulnerability that exploits fixed points in autoregressive models and use it to craft queries that never halt, i.e. an LLM output that does not terminate. More precisely, for what we call non-halting queries, the LLM never samples the end-of-string token (<eos>). We rigorously analyze the conditions under which the non-halting anomaly presents itself. In particular, at temperature zero, we prove that if a repeating (cyclic) sequence of tokens is observed at the output beyond the context size, then the LLM does not halt.
  We demonstrate the non-halting anomaly in a number of experiments performed in base (unaligned) models where repeating tokens immediately lead to a non-halting cyclic behavior as predicted by the analysis. Further, we develop a simple recipe that takes the same fixed points observed in the base model and creates a prompt structure to target aligned models. We study the recipe behavior in bypassing alignment in a number of LLMs including GPT-4o, llama-3-8b-instruct, and gemma-2-9b-it where all models are forced into a non-halting state. Further, we demonstrate the recipe's success in sending most major models released over the past year into a non-halting state with the same simple prompt even at higher temperatures. Further, we study direct inversion based techniques to craft new short prompts to induce the non-halting state. Our experiments with the gradient search based inversion technique ARCA show that non-halting is prevalent across models and may be easily induced with a few input tokens.
  While its impact on the reliability of hosted systems can be mitigated by configuring a hard maximum token limit in the sampler, the non-halting anomaly still manages to break alignment. This underlines the need for further studies and stronger forms of alignment against non-halting anomalies.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06293">Accelerated Preference Optimization for Large Language Model Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiafan He, Huizhuo Yuan, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal tool for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), one of the most popular approaches, formulates RLHF as a policy optimization problem without explicitly estimating the reward function. It overcomes the stability and efficiency issues of two-step approaches, which typically involve first estimating the reward function and then optimizing the policy via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Since RLHF is essentially an optimization problem, and it is well-known that momentum techniques can accelerate optimization both theoretically and empirically, a natural question arises: Can RLHF be accelerated by momentum? This paper answers this question in the affirmative. In detail, we first show that the iterative preference optimization method can be viewed as a proximal point method. Based on this observation, we propose a general Accelerated Preference Optimization (APO) framework, which unifies many existing preference optimization algorithms and employs Nesterov's momentum technique to speed up the alignment of LLMs. Theoretically, we demonstrate that APO can achieve a faster convergence rate than the standard iterative preference optimization methods, including DPO and Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPPO). Empirically, we show the superiority of APO over DPO, iterative DPO, and other strong baselines for RLHF on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botong Zhang, Shuo Li, Osbert Bastani</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a promising strategy for quantifying the uncertainty of a predictive model; these algorithms modify the model to output sets of labels that are guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability. However, existing conformal prediction algorithms have largely targeted classification and regression settings, where the structure of the prediction set has a simple form as a level set of the scoring function. However, for complex structured outputs such as text generation, these prediction sets might include a large number of labels and therefore be hard for users to interpret. In this paper, we propose a general framework for conformal prediction in the structured prediction setting, that modifies existing conformal prediction algorithms to output structured prediction sets that implicitly represent sets of labels. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be applied in domains where the prediction sets can be represented as a set of nodes in a directed acyclic graph; for instance, for hierarchical labels such as image classification, a prediction set might be a small subset of coarse labels implicitly representing the prediction set of all their more fine-descendants. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used to construct prediction sets that satisfy a desired coverage guarantee in several domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Gorji, Andisheh Amrollahi, Andreas Krause</p>
<p>Abstract: SHAP values are a popular local feature-attribution method widely used in interpretable and explainable AI. We tackle the problem of efficiently computing these values. We cover both the model-agnostic (black-box) setting, where one only has query access to the model and also the case of (ensembles of) trees where one has access to the structure of the tree. For both the black-box and the tree setting we propose a two-stage approach for estimating SHAP values. Our algorithm's first step harnesses recent results showing that many real-world predictors have a spectral bias that allows us to either exactly represent (in the case of ensembles of decision trees), or efficiently approximate them (in the case of neural networks) using a compact Fourier representation. In the second step of the algorithm, we use the Fourier representation to exactly compute SHAP values. The second step is computationally very cheap because firstly, the representation is compact and secondly, we prove that there exists a closed-form expression for SHAP values for the Fourier basis functions. Furthermore, the expression we derive effectively linearizes the computation into a simple summation and is amenable to parallelization on multiple cores or a GPU. Since the function approximation (first step) is only done once, it allows us to produce Shapley values in an amortized way. We show speedups compared to relevant baseline methods equal levels of accuracy for both the tree and black-box settings. Moreover, this approach introduces a reliable and fine-grained continuous trade-off between computation and accuracy through the sparsity of the Fourier approximation, a feature previously unavailable in all black-box methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we tackle a challenging and extreme form of subpopulation shift, which is termed compositional shift. Under compositional shifts, some combinations of attributes are totally absent from the training distribution but present in the test distribution. We model the data with flexible additive energy distributions, where each energy term represents an attribute, and derive a simple alternative to empirical risk minimization termed compositional risk minimization (CRM). We first train an additive energy classifier to predict the multiple attributes and then adjust this classifier to tackle compositional shifts. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis of CRM, where we show that our proposal extrapolates to special affine hulls of seen attribute combinations. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets confirms the improved robustness of CRM compared to other methods from the literature designed to tackle various forms of subpopulation shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arash Tavakoli, Sina Ghiassian, Nemanja Raki\'cevi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that policy gradient methods are better suited to complex action spaces than action-value methods. However, foundational studies have shown equivalences between these paradigms in small and finite action spaces (O'Donoghue et al., 2017; Schulman et al., 2017a). This raises the question of why their computational applicability and performance diverge as the complexity of the action space increases. We hypothesize that the apparent superiority of policy gradients in such settings stems not from intrinsic qualities of the paradigm, but from universal principles that can also be applied to action-value methods to serve similar functionality. We identify three such principles and provide a framework for incorporating them into action-value methods. To support our hypothesis, we instantiate this framework in what we term QMLE, for Q-learning with maximum likelihood estimation. Our results show that QMLE can be applied to complex action spaces with a controllable computational cost that is comparable to that of policy gradient methods, all without using policy gradients. Furthermore, QMLE demonstrates strong performance on the DeepMind Control Suite, even when compared to the state-of-the-art methods such as DMPO and D4PG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Connor W. Magoon, Fengyu Yang, Noam Aigerman, Shahar Z. Kovalsky</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, many deep learning approaches have incorporated layers that solve optimization problems (e.g., linear, quadratic, and semidefinite programs). Integrating these optimization problems as differentiable layers requires computing the derivatives of the optimization problem's solution with respect to its objective and constraints. This has so far prevented the use of state-of-the-art black-box numerical solvers within neural networks, as they lack a differentiable interface. To address this issue for one of the most common convex optimization problems -- quadratic programming (QP) -- we introduce dQP, a modular framework that enables plug-and-play differentiation for any QP solver, allowing seamless integration into neural networks and bi-level optimization tasks. Our solution is based on the core theoretical insight that knowledge of the active constraint set at the QP optimum allows for explicit differentiation. This insight reveals a unique relationship between the computation of the solution and its derivative, enabling efficient differentiation of any solver, that only requires the primal solution. Our implementation, which will be made publicly available, interfaces with an existing framework that supports over 15 state-of-the-art QP solvers, providing each with a fully differentiable backbone for immediate use as a differentiable layer in learning setups. To demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of dQP, we evaluate it on a large benchmark dataset of QPs with varying structures. We compare dQP with existing differentiable QP methods, demonstrating its advantages across a range of problems, from challenging small and dense problems to large-scale sparse ones, including a novel bi-level geometry optimization problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Batched Bayesian optimization (BO) can accelerate molecular design by efficiently identifying top-performing compounds from a large chemical library. Existing acquisition strategies for batch design in BO aim to balance exploration and exploitation. This often involves optimizing non-additive batch acquisition functions, necessitating approximation via myopic construction and/or diversity heuristics. In this work, we propose an acquisition strategy for discrete optimization that is motivated by pure exploitation, qPO (multipoint Probability of Optimality). qPO maximizes the probability that the batch includes the true optimum, which is expressible as the sum over individual acquisition scores and thereby circumvents the combinatorial challenge of optimizing a batch acquisition function. We differentiate the proposed strategy from parallel Thompson sampling and discuss how it implicitly captures diversity. Finally, we apply our method to the model-guided exploration of large chemical libraries and provide empirical evidence that it performs better than or on par with state-of-the-art methods in batched Bayesian optimization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06339">Filtered Randomized Smoothing: A New Defense for Robust Modulation Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhan Zhang, Meiyu Zhong, Ravi Tandon, Marwan Krunz</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Network (DNN) based classifiers have recently been used for the modulation classification of RF signals. These classifiers have shown impressive performance gains relative to conventional methods, however, they are vulnerable to imperceptible (low-power) adversarial attacks. Some of the prominent defense approaches include adversarial training (AT) and randomized smoothing (RS). While AT increases robustness in general, it fails to provide resilience against previously unseen adaptive attacks. Other approaches, such as Randomized Smoothing (RS), which injects noise into the input, address this shortcoming by providing provable certified guarantees against arbitrary attacks, however, they tend to sacrifice accuracy.
  In this paper, we study the problem of designing robust DNN-based modulation classifiers that can provide provable defense against arbitrary attacks without significantly sacrificing accuracy. To this end, we first analyze the spectral content of commonly studied attacks on modulation classifiers for the benchmark RadioML dataset. We observe that spectral signatures of un-perturbed RF signals are highly localized, whereas attack signals tend to be spread out in frequency. To exploit this spectral heterogeneity, we propose Filtered Randomized Smoothing (FRS), a novel defense which combines spectral filtering together with randomized smoothing. FRS can be viewed as a strengthening of RS by leveraging the specificity (spectral Heterogeneity) inherent to the modulation classification problem. In addition to providing an approach to compute the certified accuracy of FRS, we also provide a comprehensive set of simulations on the RadioML dataset to show the effectiveness of FRS and show that it significantly outperforms existing defenses including AT and RS in terms of accuracy on both attacked and benign signals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ga\"el Gendron, Michael Witbrock, Gillian Dobbie</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks can obtain impressive performance on various tasks under the assumption that their training domain is identical to their target domain. Performance can drop dramatically when this assumption does not hold. One explanation for this discrepancy is the presence of spurious domain-specific correlations in the training data that the network exploits. Causal mechanisms, in the other hand, can be made invariant under distribution changes as they allow disentangling the factors of distribution underlying the data generation. Yet, learning causal mechanisms to improve out-of-distribution generalisation remains an under-explored area. We propose a Bayesian neural architecture that disentangles the learning of the the data distribution from the inference process mechanisms. We show theoretically and experimentally that our model approximates reasoning under causal interventions. We demonstrate the performance of our method, outperforming point estimate-counterparts, on out-of-distribution image recognition tasks where the data distribution acts as strong adversarial confounders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angelos Ragkousis, Sonali Parbhoo</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI models grow larger, the demand for accountability and interpretability has become increasingly critical for understanding their decision-making processes. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have gained attention for enhancing interpretability by mapping inputs to intermediate concepts before making final predictions. However, CBMs often suffer from information leakage, where additional input data, not captured by the concepts, is used to improve task performance, complicating the interpretation of downstream predictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for training both joint and sequential CBMs that allows us to identify and control leakage using decision trees. Our method quantifies leakage by comparing the decision paths of hard CBMs with their soft, leaky counterparts. Specifically, we show that soft leaky CBMs extend the decision paths of hard CBMs, particularly in cases where concept information is incomplete. Using this insight, we develop a technique to better inspect and manage leakage, isolating the subsets of data most affected by this. Through synthetic and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that controlling leakage in this way not only improves task accuracy but also yields more informative and transparent explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Zhang, Junda Su, Oscar Wu, Zhaozhuo Xu, Anshumali Shrivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Compressive adaptation approaches, such as QLoRA, are widely popular alternatives for reducing memory requirements during fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) while producing models capable of handling various downstream tasks. The key idea is to employ a "two-tower" architecture: compressing pre-trained LLM parameters into compact representations and fine-tuning the additive full-precision adapter, which typically has few tunable parameters in low-rank format. However, the strict algebraic assumptions, such as low-rank assumption, and the complexity of composing two-tower architectures are some of the known shortcomings, resulting in a poor accuracy-efficiency trade-off. In response to these known limitations, we propose SpaLLM (Sketched Parameter Adaptation of LLMs), a novel compressive adaptation approach for LLMs. This method is also the first to illustrate parameter-sharing compression methods for LLM fine-tuning, which, unlike QLoRA, are free from strict low-rank algebraic assumptions on adapters. Furthermore, our proposal unifies model compression and adaptation into a single, streamlined process, eliminating the need for two-tower architectures. SpaLLM sketches pre-trained LLM weights into lookup tables and directly fine-tunes the values in these tables. This approach simplifies LLMs' compressive adaptation workflow, potentially improves multi-user serving efficiency, and delivers significantly better accuracy for both natural language understanding and generation tasks. Moreover, by avoiding the "two-tower" architecture, our framework only requires one compressed matrix multiplication per layer during inference, demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijie Huang, Wanjia Zhao, Jingdong Gao, Ziniu Hu, Xiao Luo, Yadi Cao, Yuanzhou Chen, Yizhou Sun, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning complex physical dynamics purely from data is challenging due to the intrinsic properties of systems to be satisfied. Incorporating physics-informed priors, such as in Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs), achieves high-precision modeling for energy-conservative systems. However, real-world systems often deviate from strict energy conservation and follow different physical priors. To address this, we present a framework that achieves high-precision modeling for a wide range of dynamical systems from the numerical aspect, by enforcing Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS) via a novel regularization term. It helps preserve energies for conservative systems while serving as a strong inductive bias for non-conservative, reversible systems. While TRS is a domain-specific physical prior, we present the first theoretical proof that TRS loss can universally improve modeling accuracy by minimizing higher-order Taylor terms in ODE integration, which is numerically beneficial to various systems regardless of their properties, even for irreversible systems. By integrating the TRS loss within neural ordinary differential equation models, the proposed model TREAT demonstrates superior performance on diverse physical systems. It achieves a significant 11.5% MSE improvement in a challenging chaotic triple-pendulum scenario, underscoring TREAT's broad applicability and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhishuai Guo, Tianbao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning faces challenges due to the heterogeneity in data volumes and distributions at different clients, which can compromise model generalization ability to various distributions. Existing approaches to address this issue based on group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) often lead to high communication and sample complexity. To this end, this work introduces algorithms tailored for communication-efficient Federated Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (FGDRO). Our contributions are threefold: Firstly, we introduce the FGDRO-CVaR algorithm, which optimizes the average top-K losses while reducing communication complexity to $O(1/\epsilon^4)$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the desired precision level. Secondly, our FGDRO-KL algorithm is crafted to optimize KL regularized FGDRO, cutting communication complexity to $O(1/\epsilon^3)$. Lastly, we propose FGDRO-KL-Adam to utilize Adam-type local updates in FGDRO-KL, which not only maintains a communication cost of $O(1/\epsilon^3)$ but also shows potential to surpass SGD-type local steps in practical applications. The effectiveness of our algorithms has been demonstrated on a variety of real-world tasks, including natural language processing and computer vision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning train neural networks by levergaing data from heterogeneous sources such as images and text. Yet, many current multimodal learning architectures cannot generalize to an arbitrary number of modalities and need to be hand-constructed. We propose AutoBIND, a novel contrastive learning framework that can learn representations from an arbitrary number of modalites through graph optimization. We evaluate AutoBIND on Alzhiemer's disease detection because it has real-world medical applicability and it contains a broad range of data modalities. We show that AutoBIND outperforms previous methods on this task, highlighting the generalizablility of the approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew X. Burns, Qingyuan Hou, Michael C. Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Analog dynamical accelerators (DXs) are a growing sub-field in computer architecture research, offering order-of-magnitude gains in power efficiency and latency over traditional digital methods in several machine learning, optimization, and sampling tasks. However, limited-capacity accelerators require hybrid analog/digital algorithms to solve real-world problems, commonly using large-neighborhood local search (LNLS) frameworks. Unlike fully digital algorithms, hybrid LNLS has no non-asymptotic convergence guarantees and no principled hyperparameter selection schemes, particularly limiting cross-device training and inference.
  In this work, we provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for hybrid LNLS by reducing to block Langevin Diffusion (BLD) algorithms. Adapting tools from classical sampling theory, we prove exponential KL-divergence convergence for randomized and cyclic block selection strategies using ideal DXs. With finite device variation, we provide explicit bounds on the 2-Wasserstein bias in terms of step duration, noise strength, and function parameters. Our BLD model provides a key link between established theory and novel computing platforms, and our theoretical results provide a closed-form expression linking device variation, algorithm hyperparameters, and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aku Kammonen, Anamika Pandey, Erik von Schwerin, Ra\'ul Tempone</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced adaptive random Fourier features (ARFF) training algorithm for shallow neural networks, building upon the work introduced in "Adaptive Random Fourier Features with Metropolis Sampling", Kammonen et al., Foundations of Data Science, 2(3):309--332, 2020. This improved method uses a particle filter type resampling technique to stabilize the training process and reduce sensitivity to parameter choices. With resampling, the Metropolis test may also be omitted, reducing the number of hyperparameters and reducing the computational cost per iteration, compared to ARFF. We present comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed algorithm in function regression tasks, both as a standalone method and as a pre-training step before gradient-based optimization, here Adam. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to a simple image regression problem, showcasing its utility in sampling frequencies for the random Fourier features (RFF) layer of coordinate-based multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). In this context, we use the proposed algorithm to sample the parameters of the RFF layer in an automated manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Ferguson, Yu-hsuan Chen, Yiming Chen, Andrew Gillman, James Hardin, Levent Burak Kara</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine-learned surrogate models to accelerate lengthy computer simulations are becoming increasingly important as engineers look to streamline the product design cycle. In many cases, these approaches offer the ability to predict relevant quantities throughout a geometry, but place constraints on the form of the input data. In a world of diverse data types, a preferred approach would not restrict the input to a particular structure. In this paper, we propose Topology-Agnostic Graph U-Net (TAG U-Net), a graph convolutional network that can be trained to input any mesh or graph structure and output a prediction of a target scalar field at each node. The model constructs coarsened versions of each input graph and performs a set of convolution and pooling operations to predict the node-wise outputs on the original graph. By training on a diverse set of shapes, the model can make strong predictions, even for shapes unlike those seen during training. A 3-D additive manufacturing dataset is presented, containing Laser Powder Bed Fusion simulation results for thousands of parts. The model is demonstrated on this dataset, and it performs well, predicting both 2-D and 3-D scalar fields with a median R-squared > 0.85 on test geometries. Code and datasets are available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingyu Lin, Yuxing Huang, Wenqin Liu, Haoran Deng, Ignavier Ng, Kun Zhang, Mingming Gong, Yi-An Ma, Biwei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world data often violates the equal-variance assumption (homoscedasticity), making it essential to account for heteroscedastic noise in causal discovery. In this work, we explore heteroscedastic symmetric noise models (HSNMs), where the effect $Y$ is modeled as $Y = f(X) + \sigma(X)N$, with $X$ as the cause and $N$ as independent noise following a symmetric distribution. We introduce a novel criterion for identifying HSNMs based on the skewness of the score (i.e., the gradient of the log density) of the data distribution. This criterion establishes a computationally tractable measurement that is zero in the causal direction but nonzero in the anticausal direction, enabling the causal direction discovery. We extend this skewness-based criterion to the multivariate setting and propose SkewScore, an algorithm that handles heteroscedastic noise without requiring the extraction of exogenous noise. We also conduct a case study on the robustness of SkewScore in a bivariate model with a latent confounder, providing theoretical insights into its performance. Empirical studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaan Pakala, Bryce Graw, Dawon Ahn, Tam Dinh, Mehnaz Tabassum Mahin, Vassilis Tsotras, Jia Chen, Evangelos E. Papalexakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization is an essential component in many data science pipelines and typically entails exhaustive time and resource-consuming computations in order to explore the combinatorial search space. Similar to this problem, other key operations in data science pipelines exhibit the exact same properties. Important examples are: neural architecture search, where the goal is to identify the best design choices for a neural network, and query cardinality estimation, where given different predicate values for a SQL query the goal is to estimate the size of the output. In this paper, we abstract away those essential components of data science pipelines and we model them as instances of tensor completion, where each variable of the search space corresponds to one mode of the tensor, and the goal is to identify all missing entries of the tensor, corresponding to all combinations of variable values, starting from a very small sample of observed entries. In order to do so, we first conduct a thorough experimental evaluation of existing state-of-the-art tensor completion techniques and introduce domain-inspired adaptations (such as smoothness across the discretized variable space) and an ensemble technique which is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance. We extensively evaluate existing and proposed methods in a number of datasets generated corresponding to (a) hyperparameter optimization for non-neural network models, (b) neural architecture search, and (c) variants of query cardinality estimation, demonstrating the effectiveness of tensor completion as a tool for automating data science pipelines. Furthermore, we release our generated datasets and code in order to provide benchmarks for future work on this topic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xavier Mootoo, Alan A. D\'iaz-Montiel, Milad Lankarany, Hina Tabassum</p>
<p>Abstract: While the majority of time series classification research has focused on modeling fixed-length sequences, variable-length time series classification (VTSC) remains critical in healthcare, where sequence length may vary among patients and events. To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{S}$tochastic $\textbf{S}$parse $\textbf{S}$ampling (SSS), a novel VTSC framework developed for medical time series. SSS manages variable-length sequences by sparsely sampling fixed windows to compute local predictions, which are then aggregated and calibrated to form a global prediction. We apply SSS to the task of seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization, a critical VTSC problem requiring identification of seizure-inducing brain regions from variable-length electrophysiological time series. We evaluate our method on the Epilepsy iEEG Multicenter Dataset, a heterogeneous collection of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings obtained from four independent medical centers. SSS demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across most medical centers, and superior performance on all out-of-distribution (OOD) unseen medical centers. Additionally, SSS naturally provides post-hoc insights into local signal characteristics related to the SOZ, by visualizing temporally averaged local predictions throughout the signal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael J. Kenney, Katerina G. Malollari, Sergei V. Kalinin, Maxim Ziatdinov</p>
<p>Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are a key energy storage technology driving revolutions in mobile electronics, electric vehicles and renewable energy storage. Capacity retention is a vital performance measure that is frequently utilized to assess whether these batteries have approached their end-of-life. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful tool for predicting capacity degradation based on past data, and, potentially, prior physical knowledge, but the degree to which an ML prediction can be trusted is of significant practical importance in situations where consequential decisions must be made based on battery state of health. This study explores the efficacy of fully Bayesian machine learning in forecasting battery health with the quantification of uncertainty in its predictions. Specifically, we implemented three probabilistic ML approaches and evaluated the accuracy of their predictions and uncertainty estimates: a standard Gaussian process (GP), a structured Gaussian process (sGP), and a fully Bayesian neural network (BNN). In typical applications of GP and sGP, their hyperparameters are learned from a single sample while, in contrast, BNNs are typically pre-trained on an existing dataset to learn the weight distributions before being used for inference. This difference in methodology gives the BNN an advantage in learning global trends in a dataset and makes BNNs a good choice when training data is available. However, we show that pre-training can also be leveraged for GP and sGP approaches to learn the prior distributions of the hyperparameters and that in the case of the pre-trained sGP, similar accuracy and improved uncertainty estimation compared to the BNN can be achieved. This approach offers a framework for a broad range of probabilistic machine learning scenarios where past data is available and can be used to learn priors for (hyper)parameters of probabilistic ML models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fairness in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models is becoming critically important, especially as decisions made by these systems impact diverse groups. In education, a vital sector for all countries, the widespread application of AI/ML systems raises specific concerns regarding fairness. Current research predominantly focuses on fairness for individual sensitive features, which limits the comprehensiveness of fairness assessments. This paper introduces FAIREDU, a novel and effective method designed to improve fairness across multiple sensitive features. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate FAIREDU effectiveness in enhancing fairness without compromising model performance. The results demonstrate that FAIREDU addresses intersectionality across features such as gender, race, age, and other sensitive features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with minimal effect on model accuracy. The paper also explores potential future research directions to enhance further the method robustness and applicability to various machine-learning models and datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06424">Restructuring Vector Quantization with the Rotation Trick</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Fifty, Ronald G. Junkins, Dennis Duan, Aniketh Iger, Jerry W. Liu, Ehsan Amid, Sebastian Thrun, Christopher R\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs) are designed to compress a continuous input to a discrete latent space and reconstruct it with minimal distortion. They operate by maintaining a set of vectors -- often referred to as the codebook -- and quantizing each encoder output to the nearest vector in the codebook. However, as vector quantization is non-differentiable, the gradient to the encoder flows around the vector quantization layer rather than through it in a straight-through approximation. This approximation may be undesirable as all information from the vector quantization operation is lost. In this work, we propose a way to propagate gradients through the vector quantization layer of VQ-VAEs. We smoothly transform each encoder output into its corresponding codebook vector via a rotation and rescaling linear transformation that is treated as a constant during backpropagation. As a result, the relative magnitude and angle between encoder output and codebook vector becomes encoded into the gradient as it propagates through the vector quantization layer and back to the encoder. Across 11 different VQ-VAE training paradigms, we find this restructuring improves reconstruction metrics, codebook utilization, and quantization error.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruijia Niu, Dongxia Wu, Rose Yu, Yi-An Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: From common-sense reasoning to domain-specific tasks, parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT) methods for large language models (LLMs) have showcased significant performance improvements on downstream tasks. However, fine-tuned LLMs often struggle with overconfidence in uncertain predictions, particularly due to sparse training data. This overconfidence reflects poor epistemic uncertainty calibration, which arises from limitations in the model's ability to generalize with limited data. Existing PEFT uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs focus on the post fine-tuning stage and thus have limited capability in calibrating epistemic uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose Functional-Level Uncertainty Quantification for Calibrated Fine-Tuning (UQ4CT), which captures and calibrates functional-level epistemic uncertainty during the fine-tuning stage via a mixture-of-expert framework. We show that UQ4CT reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by more than $25\%$ while maintaining high accuracy across $5$ benchmarks. Furthermore, UQ4CT maintains superior ECE performance with high accuracy under distribution shift, showcasing improved generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeman Li, Xinwei Zhang, Peilin Zhong, Yuan Deng, Meisam Razaviyayn, Vahab Mirrokni</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning language models (LMs) with the Adam optimizer often demands excessive memory, limiting accessibility. The "in-place" version of Stochastic Gradient Descent (IP-SGD) and Memory-Efficient Zeroth-order Optimizer (MeZO) have been proposed to address this. However, IP-SGD still requires substantial memory, and MeZO suffers from slow convergence and degraded final performance due to its zeroth-order nature. This paper introduces Addax, a novel method that improves both memory efficiency and performance of IP-SGD by integrating it with MeZO. Specifically, Addax computes zeroth- or first-order gradients of data points in the minibatch based on their memory consumption, combining these gradient estimates to update directions. By computing zeroth-order gradients for data points that require more memory and first-order gradients for others, Addax overcomes the slow convergence of MeZO and the excessive memory requirement of IP-SGD. Additionally, the zeroth-order gradient acts as a regularizer for the first-order gradient, further enhancing the model's final performance. Theoretically, we establish the convergence of Addax under mild assumptions, demonstrating faster convergence and less restrictive hyper-parameter choices than MeZO. Our experiments with diverse LMs and tasks show that Addax consistently outperforms MeZO regarding accuracy and convergence speed while having a comparable memory footprint. When fine-tuning OPT-13B with one A100 GPU, on average, Addax outperforms MeZO in accuracy/F1 score by 14% and runs 15x faster while using memory similar to MeZO. In our experiments on the larger OPT-30B model, on average, Addax outperforms MeZO in terms of accuracy/F1 score by >16 and runs 30x faster on a single H100 GPU. Moreover, Addax surpasses the performance of standard fine-tuning approaches, such as IP-SGD and Adam, in most tasks with significantly less memory requirement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingu Kang, Dongseok Lee, Woojin Cho, Jaehyeon Park, Kookjin Lee, Anthony Gruber, Youngjoon Hong, Noseong Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have shown that even trained with noisy prior data, they can generalize effectively to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) and pre-training techniques. Motivated by this, we explore whether a similar approach can be applied to scientific foundation models (SFMs). Our methodology is structured as follows: (i) we collect low-cost physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based approximated prior data in the form of solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) constructed through an arbitrary linear combination of mathematical dictionaries; (ii) we utilize Transformer architectures with self and cross-attention mechanisms to predict PDE solutions without knowledge of the governing equations in a zero-shot setting; (iii) we provide experimental evidence on the one-dimensional convection-diffusion-reaction equation, which demonstrate that pre-training remains robust even with approximated prior data, with only marginal impacts on test accuracy. Notably, this finding opens the path to pre-training SFMs with realistic, low-cost data instead of (or in conjunction with) numerical high-cost data. These results support the conjecture that SFMs can improve in a manner similar to LLMs, where fully cleaning the vast set of sentences crawled from the Internet is nearly impossible.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is becoming a promising paradigm to achieve the "right to be forgotten", where the training trace of any chosen data points could be eliminated, while maintaining the model utility on general testing samples after unlearning. With the advancement of forgetting research, many fundamental open questions remain unanswered: do different samples exhibit varying levels of difficulty in being forgotten? Further, does the sequence in which samples are forgotten, determined by their respective difficulty levels, influence the performance of forgetting algorithms? In this paper, we identify key factor affecting unlearning difficulty and the performance of unlearning algorithms. We find that samples with higher privacy risks are more likely to be unlearning, indicating that the unlearning difficulty varies among different samples which motives a more precise unlearning mode. Built upon this insight, we propose a general unlearning framework, dubbed RSU, which consists of Ranking module and SeqUnlearn module.</p>

<p>Abstract: In climate science, models for global warming and weather prediction face significant challenges due to the limited availability of high-quality data and the difficulty in obtaining it, making data efficiency crucial. In the past few years, Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) models have gained tremendous traction as they can be trained in a data-efficient manner, making them highly suitable for real-world climate applications. Despite this, very little attention has been paid to chaotic climate system modeling utilizing SciML methods. In this paper, we have integrated SciML methods into foundational weather models, where we have enhanced large-scale climate predictions with a physics-informed approach that achieves high accuracy with reduced data. We successfully demonstrate that by combining the interpretability of physical climate models with the computational power of neural networks, SciML models can prove to be a reliable tool for modeling climate. This indicates a shift from the traditional black box-based machine learning modeling of climate systems to physics-informed decision-making, leading to effective climate policy implementation.</p>

<p>Abstract: To keep pace with the rapid advancements in design complexity within modern computing systems, directed graph representation learning (DGRL) has become crucial, particularly for encoding circuit netlists, computational graphs, and developing surrogate models for hardware performance prediction. However, DGRL remains relatively unexplored, especially in the hardware domain, mainly due to the lack of comprehensive and user-friendly benchmarks. This study presents a novel benchmark comprising five hardware design datasets and 13 prediction tasks spanning various levels of circuit abstraction. We evaluate 21 DGRL models, employing diverse graph neural networks and graph transformers (GTs) as backbones, enhanced by positional encodings (PEs) tailored for directed graphs. Our results highlight that bidirected (BI) message passing neural networks (MPNNs) and robust PEs significantly enhance model performance. Notably, the top-performing models include PE-enhanced GTs interleaved with BI-MPNN layers and BI-Graph Isomorphism Network, both surpassing baselines across the 13 tasks. Additionally, our investigation into out-of-distribution (OOD) performance emphasizes the urgent need to improve OOD generalization in DGRL models. This benchmark, implemented with a modular codebase, streamlines the evaluation of DGRL models for both hardware and ML practitioners</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06474">Flipping-based Policy for Chance-Constrained Markov Decision Processes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Shen, Shuo Jiang, Akifumi Wachi, Kaumune Hashimoto, Sebastien Gros</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for many real-world decision-making problems where ensuring safety is a critical necessity. In safe RL research, while expected cumulative safety constraints (ECSCs) are typically the first choices, chance constraints are often more pragmatic for incorporating safety under uncertainties. This paper proposes a \textit{flipping-based policy} for Chance-Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CCMDPs). The flipping-based policy selects the next action by tossing a potentially distorted coin between two action candidates. The probability of the flip and the two action candidates vary depending on the state. We establish a Bellman equation for CCMDPs and further prove the existence of a flipping-based policy within the optimal solution sets. Since solving the problem with joint chance constraints is challenging in practice, we then prove that joint chance constraints can be approximated into Expected Cumulative Safety Constraints (ECSCs) and that there exists a flipping-based policy in the optimal solution sets for constrained MDPs with ECSCs. As a specific instance of practical implementations, we present a framework for adapting constrained policy optimization to train a flipping-based policy. This framework can be applied to other safe RL algorithms. We demonstrate that the flipping-based policy can improve the performance of the existing safe RL algorithms under the same limits of safety constraints on Safety Gym benchmarks.</p>

While being more utility-preserving and efficient, current approximate unlearning methods are not applicable in the zero-glance privacy setting, where the deleted samples cannot be accessed during unlearning due to immediate deletion requested by regulations. Besides, these approximate methods, which try to directly perturb model parameters still involve high privacy concerns in practice. To fill the gap, we propose Transferable Condensation Graph Unlearning (TCGU), a data-centric solution to zero-glance graph unlearning. Specifically, we first design a two-level alignment strategy to pre-condense the original graph into a small yet utility-preserving dataset. Upon receiving an unlearning request, we fine-tune the pre-condensed data with a low-rank plugin, to directly align its distribution with the remaining graph, thus efficiently revoking the information of deleted data without accessing them. A novel similarity distribution matching approach and a discrimination regularizer are proposed to effectively transfer condensed data and preserve its utility in GNN training, respectively. Finally, we retrain the GNN on the transferred condensed data. Extensive experiments on 6 benchmark datasets demonstrate that TCGU can achieve superior performance in terms of model utility, unlearning efficiency, and unlearning efficacy than existing GU methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinglun Li, Miao Zhang, Mengzhu Wang, Quanjun Yin, Li Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) surpasses Centralized Federated Learning (CFL) in terms of faster training, privacy preservation, and light communication, making it a promising alternative in the field of federated learning. However, DFL still exhibits significant disparities with CFL in terms of generalization ability such as rarely theoretical understanding and degraded empirical performance due to severe inconsistency. In this paper, we enhance the consistency of DFL by developing an opposite lookahead enhancement technique (Ole), yielding OledFL to optimize the initialization of each client in each communication round, thus significantly improving both the generalization and convergence speed. Moreover, we rigorously establish its convergence rate in non-convex setting and characterize its generalization bound through uniform stability, which provides concrete reasons why OledFL can achieve both the fast convergence speed and high generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets with Dirichlet and Pathological distributions illustrate that our OledFL can achieve up to 5\% performance improvement and 8$\times$ speedup, compared to the most popular DFedAvg optimizer in DFL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianqing Zhang, Yang Liu, Yang Hua, Jian Cao, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data and model heterogeneity are two core issues in Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL). In scenarios with heterogeneous model architectures, aggregating model parameters becomes infeasible, leading to the use of prototypes (i.e., class representative feature vectors) for aggregation and guidance. However, they still experience a mismatch between the extra guiding objective and the client's original local objective when aligned with global prototypes. Thus, we propose a Federated Learning-to-Guide (FedL2G) method that adaptively learns to guide local training in a federated manner and ensures the extra guidance is beneficial to clients' original tasks. With theoretical guarantees, FedL2G efficiently implements the learning-to-guide process using only first-order derivatives w.r.t. model parameters and achieves a non-convex convergence rate of O(1/T). We conduct extensive experiments on two data heterogeneity and six model heterogeneity settings using 14 heterogeneous model architectures (e.g., CNNs and ViTs) to demonstrate FedL2G's superior performance compared to six counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Shen, Chenhao Zhang, Sijie Fu, Chenghui Zhou, Newell Washburn, Barnab\'as P\'oczos</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in the conditional generation of novel molecules. These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyao Wang, Linfeng Song, Ye Tian, Dian Yu, Baolin Peng, Haitao Mi, Furong Huang, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Techniques such as SFT or DPO have enabled LLMs to distill high-quality behaviors from MCTS, improving their reasoning performance. However, existing distillation methods underutilize the rich trajectory information generated by MCTS, limiting the potential for improvements in LLM reasoning. In this paper, we propose AlphaLLM-CPL, a novel pairwise training framework that enables LLMs to self-improve through MCTS behavior distillation. AlphaLLM-CPL efficiently leverages MCTS trajectories via two key innovations: (1) AlphaLLM-CPL constructs stepwise trajectory pairs from child nodes sharing the same parent in the search tree, providing step-level information for more effective MCTS behavior distillation. (2) AlphaLLM-CPL introduces curriculum preference learning, dynamically adjusting the training sequence of trajectory pairs in each offline training epoch to prioritize critical learning steps and mitigate overfitting. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that AlphaLLM-CPL significantly outperforms previous MCTS behavior distillation methods, substantially boosting the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiashi Gao, Ziwei Wang, Xiangyu Zhao, Xin Yao, Xuetao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL), integrating group fairness mechanisms, allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model that makes unbiased decisions for different populations grouped by sensitive attributes (e.g., gender and race). Due to its distributed nature, previous studies have demonstrated that FL systems are vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. However, these studies primarily focus on perturbing accuracy, leaving a critical question unexplored: Can an attacker bypass the group fairness mechanisms in FL and manipulate the global model to be biased? The motivations for such an attack vary; an attacker might seek higher accuracy, yet fairness considerations typically limit the accuracy of the global model or aim to cause ethical disruption. To address this question, we design a novel form of attack in FL, termed Profit-driven Fairness Attack (PFATTACK), which aims not to degrade global model accuracy but to bypass fairness mechanisms. Our fundamental insight is that group fairness seeks to weaken the dependence of outputs on input attributes related to sensitive information. In the proposed PFATTACK, an attacker can recover this dependence through local fine-tuning across various sensitive groups, thereby creating a biased yet accuracy-preserving malicious model and injecting it into FL through model replacement. Compared to attacks targeting accuracy, PFATTACK is more stealthy. The malicious model in PFATTACK exhibits subtle parameter variations relative to the original global model, making it robust against detection and filtering by Byzantine-resilient aggregations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted for four fair FL frameworks and three Byzantine-resilient aggregations against model poisoning, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealth of PFATTACK in bypassing group fairness mechanisms in FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathilde Papillon, Guillermo Bern\'ardez, Claudio Battiloro, Nina Miolane</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in learning from relational datasets, processing node and edge features in a way that preserves the symmetries of the graph domain. However, many complex systems--such as biological or social networks--involve multiway complex interactions that are more naturally represented by higher-order topological spaces. The emerging field of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) aims to accommodate and leverage these higher-order structures. Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks (CCNNs), fairly general TDL models, have been shown to be more expressive and better performing than GNNs. However, differently from the graph deep learning ecosystem, TDL lacks a principled and standardized framework for easily defining new architectures, restricting its accessibility and applicability. To address this issue, we introduce Generalized CCNNs (GCCNs), a novel simple yet powerful family of TDL models that can be used to systematically transform any (graph) neural network into its TDL counterpart. We prove that GCCNs generalize and subsume CCNNs, while extensive experiments on a diverse class of GCCNs show that these architectures consistently match or outperform CCNNs, often with less model complexity. In an effort to accelerate and democratize TDL, we introduce TopoTune, a lightweight software that allows practitioners to define, build, and train GCCNs with unprecedented flexibility and ease.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) is crucial for identifying abnormal entities within networks, garnering significant attention across various fields. Traditional unsupervised methods, which decode encoded latent representations of unlabeled data with a reconstruction focus, often fail to capture critical discriminative content, leading to suboptimal anomaly detection. To address these challenges, we present a Diffusion-based Graph Anomaly Detector (DiffGAD). At the heart of DiffGAD is a novel latent space learning paradigm, meticulously designed to enhance its proficiency by guiding it with discriminative content. This innovative approach leverages diffusion sampling to infuse the latent space with discriminative content and introduces a content-preservation mechanism that retains valuable information across different scales, significantly improving its adeptness at identifying anomalies with limited time and space complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of DiffGAD, conducted on six real-world and large-scale datasets with various metrics, demonstrated its exceptional performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Xu, Wenqi Shao, Mingyu Ding, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) hardware (HW) accelerators have achieved great success in improving DNNs' performance and efficiency. One key reason is dataflow in executing a DNN layer, including on-chip data partitioning, computation parallelism, and scheduling policy, which have large impacts on latency and energy consumption. Unlike prior works that required considerable efforts from HW engineers to design suitable dataflows for different DNNs, this work proposes an efficient data-centric approach, named Dataflow Code Propagation (DCP), to automatically find the optimal dataflow for DNN layers in seconds without human effort. It has several attractive benefits that prior arts do not have. (i) We translate the HW dataflow configuration into a code representation in a unified dataflow coding space, which can be optimized by backpropagating gradients given a DNN layer or network. (ii) DCP learns a neural predictor to efficiently update the dataflow codes towards the desired gradient directions to minimize various optimization objectives e.g., latency and energy. (iii) It can be easily generalized to unseen HW configurations in a zero-shot or few-shot learning manner. For example, without using additional training data, DCP surpasses the GAMMA method that performs a full search using thousands of samples. Extensive experiments on several representative models such as MobileNet, ResNet, and ViT show that DCP outperforms its counterparts in various settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of weather forecasting, traditional models often grapple with discretization errors and time-dependent source discrepancies, which limit their predictive performance. In this paper, we present WeatherODE, a novel one-stage, physics-driven ordinary differential equation (ODE) model designed to enhance weather forecasting accuracy. By leveraging wave equation theory and integrating a time-dependent source model, WeatherODE effectively addresses the challenges associated with time-discretization error and dynamic atmospheric processes. Moreover, we design a CNN-ViT-CNN sandwich structure, facilitating efficient learning dynamics tailored for distinct yet interrelated tasks with varying optimization biases in advection equation estimation. Through rigorous experiments, WeatherODE demonstrates superior performance in both global and regional weather forecasting tasks, outperforming recent state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins of over 40.0\% and 31.8\% in root mean square error (RMSE), respectively.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06561">Efficient and Robust Knowledge Distillation from A Stronger Teacher Based on Correlation Matching</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Niu, Yingchao Wang, Guohui Cai, Hanpo Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a pivotal technique for neural network compression and performance enhancement. Most KD methods aim to transfer dark knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss. However, the student performance improvements achieved through KD exhibit diminishing marginal returns, where a stronger teacher model does not necessarily lead to a proportionally stronger student model. To address this issue, we empirically find that the KL-based KD method may implicitly change the inter-class relationships learned by the student model, resulting in a more complex and ambiguous decision boundary, which in turn reduces the model's accuracy and generalization ability. Therefore, this study argues that the student model should learn not only the probability values from the teacher's output but also the relative ranking of classes, and proposes a novel Correlation Matching Knowledge Distillation (CMKD) method that combines the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients-based KD loss to achieve more efficient and robust distillation from a stronger teacher model. Moreover, considering that samples vary in difficulty, CMKD dynamically adjusts the weights of the Pearson-based loss and Spearman-based loss. CMKD is simple yet practical, and extensive experiments demonstrate that it can consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance on CIRAR-100 and ImageNet, and adapts well to various teacher architectures, sizes, and other KD methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Varshney, Mert Pilanci</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the complexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such as distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates fine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often necessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to preserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires fully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient network compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique that efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating intermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate activations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a label-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original model without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple standard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method can outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises significant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on edge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show that convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations from a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable to their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the intersection of convex optimization and deep learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional information theory provides a valuable foundation for Reinforcement Learning, particularly through representation learning and entropy maximization for agent exploration. However, existing methods primarily concentrate on modeling the uncertainty associated with RL's random variables, neglecting the inherent structure within the state and action spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel Structural Information principles-based Effective Exploration framework, namely SI2E. Structural mutual information between two variables is defined to address the single-variable limitation in structural information, and an innovative embedding principle is presented to capture dynamics-relevant state-action representations. The SI2E analyzes value differences in the agent's policy between state-action pairs and minimizes structural entropy to derive the hierarchical state-action structure, referred to as the encoding tree. Under this tree structure, value-conditional structural entropy is defined and maximized to design an intrinsic reward mechanism that avoids redundant transitions and promotes enhanced coverage in the state-action space. Theoretical connections are established between SI2E and classical information-theoretic methodologies, highlighting our framework's rationality and advantage. Comprehensive evaluations in the MiniGrid, MetaWorld, and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks demonstrate that SI2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art exploration baselines regarding final performance and sample efficiency, with maximum improvements of 37.63% and 60.25%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Lei, Xuetao Zhang, Zifeng Zhuang, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: A novel class of advanced algorithms, termed Goal-Conditioned Weighted Supervised Learning (GCWSL), has recently emerged to tackle the challenges posed by sparse rewards in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL). GCWSL consistently delivers strong performance across a diverse set of goal-reaching tasks due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and stability. However, GCWSL methods lack a crucial capability known as trajectory stitching, which is essential for learning optimal policies when faced with unseen skills during testing. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced when the replay buffer is predominantly filled with sub-optimal trajectories. In contrast, traditional TD-based RL methods, such as Q-learning, which utilize Dynamic Programming, do not face this issue but often experience instability due to the inherent difficulties in value function approximation. In this paper, we propose Q-learning Weighted Supervised Learning (Q-WSL), a novel framework designed to overcome the limitations of GCWSL by incorporating the strengths of Dynamic Programming found in Q-learning. Q-WSL leverages Dynamic Programming results to output the optimal action of (state, goal) pairs across different trajectories within the replay buffer. This approach synergizes the strengths of both Q-learning and GCWSL, effectively mitigating their respective weaknesses and enhancing overall performance. Empirical evaluations on challenging goal-reaching tasks demonstrate that Q-WSL surpasses other goal-conditioned approaches in terms of both performance and sample efficiency. Additionally, Q-WSL exhibits notable robustness in environments characterized by binary reward structures and environmental stochasticity.</p>

According to the embedding theory, dynamical systems and time series can be mutually transformed using observation functions and physical reconstruction techniques. Based on this, we propose Embedding Duality Theory, where the parameterized embedding layer essentially provides a linear estimation of the non-linear time series dynamics. This theory enables us to bypass the parameterized embedding layer and directly employ physical reconstruction techniques to acquire a data embedding representation. Utilizing physical priors results in a 10X reduction in parameters, a 3X increase in speed, and maximum performance boosts of 18% in expert, 22% in few-shot, and 53\% in zero-shot tasks without any hyper-parameter tuning.

<p>Abstract: Time series analysis is widely used in many fields such as power energy, economics, and transportation, including different tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, etc. Missing values are widely observed in these tasks, and often leading to unpredictable negative effects on existing methods, hindering their further application. In response to this situation, existing time series imputation methods mainly focus on restoring sequences based on their data characteristics, while ignoring the performance of the restored sequences in downstream tasks. Considering different requirements of downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting), this paper proposes an efficient downstream task-oriented time series imputation evaluation approach. By combining time series imputation with neural network models used for downstream tasks, the gain of different imputation strategies on downstream tasks is estimated without retraining, and the most favorable imputation value for downstream tasks is given by combining different imputation strategies according to the estimated gain.</p>

<p>Abstract: When optimizing transportation systems, anticipating traffic flows is a central element. Yet, computing such traffic equilibria remains computationally expensive. Against this background, we introduce a novel combinatorial optimization augmented neural network architecture that allows for fast and accurate traffic flow predictions. We propose WardropNet, a neural network that combines classical layers with a subsequent equilibrium layer: the first ones inform the latter by predicting the parameterization of the equilibrium problem's latency functions. Using supervised learning we minimize the difference between the actual traffic flow and the predicted output. We show how to leverage a Bregman divergence fitting the geometry of the equilibria, which allows for end-to-end learning. WardropNet outperforms pure learning-based approaches in predicting traffic equilibria for realistic and stylized traffic scenarios. On realistic scenarios, WardropNet improves on average for time-invariant predictions by up to 72% and for time-variant predictions by up to 23% over pure learning-based approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the characterization of equivariant linear layers for representations of permutations and related groups. Unlike traditional approaches, which address these problems using parameter-sharing, we consider an alternative methodology based on irreducible representations and Schur's lemma. Using this methodology, we obtain an alternative derivation for existing models like DeepSets, 2-IGN graph equivariant networks, and Deep Weight Space (DWS) networks. The derivation for DWS networks is significantly simpler than that of previous results.
  Next, we extend our approach to unaligned symmetric sets, where equivariance to the wreath product of groups is required. Previous works have addressed this problem in a rather restrictive setting, in which almost all wreath equivariant layers are Siamese. In contrast, we give a full characterization of layers in this case and show that there is a vast number of additional non-Siamese layers in some settings. We also show empirically that these additional non-Siamese layers can improve performance in tasks like graph anomaly detection, weight space alignment, and learning Wasserstein distances.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Tu, Dan Li, Bingxin Lin, Zibin Zheng, See-Kiong Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlike images and natural language tokens, time series data is highly semantically sparse, resulting in labor-intensive label annotations. Unsupervised and Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation (UDA and SSDA) have demonstrated efficiency in addressing this issue by utilizing pre-labeled source data to train on unlabeled or partially labeled target data. However, in domain adaptation methods designed for downstream classification tasks, directly adapting labeled source samples with unlabelled target samples often results in similar distributions across various classes, thereby compromising the performance of the target classification task.
  To tackle this challenge, we proposed a Global-Local Alignment Domain Adaptation (GLA-DA) method for multivariate time series data. Data from two domains were initially encoded to align in an intermediate feature space adversarially, achieving Global Feature Alignment (GFA). Subsequently, GLA-DA leveraged the consistency between similarity-based and deep learning-based models to assign pseudo labels to unlabeled target data. This process aims to preserve differences among data with distinct labels by aligning the samples with the same class labels together, achieving Local Class Alignment (LCA). We implemented GLA-DA in both UDA and SSDA scenarios, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments on various public datasets. Ablation experiments underscored the significance of key components within GLA-DA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Shukla, Sai Vemprala, Aditya Kusupati, Ashish Kapoor</p>
<p>Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba2 are a promising alternative to Transformers, with faster theoretical training and inference times -- especially for long context lengths. Recent work on Matryoshka Representation Learning -- and its application to Transformer backbones in works like MatFormer -- showed how to introduce nested granularities of smaller submodels in one universal elastic model. In this work, we present MatMamba: a state space model which combines Matryoshka-style learning with Mamba2, by modifying the block to contain nested dimensions to enable joint training and adaptive inference. MatMamba allows for efficient and adaptive deployment across various model sizes. We train a single large MatMamba model and are able to get a number of smaller nested models for free -- while maintaining or improving upon the performance of a baseline smaller model trained from scratch. We train language and image models at a variety of parameter sizes from 35M to 1.4B. Our results on ImageNet and FineWeb show that MatMamba models scale comparably to Transformers, while having more efficient inference characteristics. This makes MatMamba a practically viable option for deploying large-scale models in an elastic way based on the available inference compute.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caglar Demir, N'Dah Jean Kouagou, Arnab Sharma, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, knowledge graph embedding models have been successfully applied in the transductive setting to tackle various challenging tasks including link prediction, and query answering. Yet, the transductive setting does not allow for reasoning over unseen entities, relations, let alone numerical or non-numerical literals. Although increasing efforts are put into exploring inductive scenarios, inference over unseen entities, relations, and literals has yet to come. This limitation prohibits the existing methods from handling real-world dynamic knowledge graphs involving heterogeneous information about the world. Here, we propose a remedy to this limitation. We propose the attentive byte-pair encoding layer (BytE) to construct a triple embedding from a sequence of byte-pair encoded subword units of entities and relations. Compared to the conventional setting, BytE leads to massive feature reuse via weight tying, since it forces a knowledge graph embedding model to learn embeddings for subword units instead of entities and relations directly. Consequently, the size of the embedding matrices are not anymore bound to the unique number of entities and relations of a knowledge graph. Experimental results show that BytE improves the link prediction performance of 4 knowledge graph embedding models on datasets where the syntactic representations of triples are semantically meaningful. However, benefits of training a knowledge graph embedding model with BytE dissipate on knowledge graphs where entities and relations are represented with plain numbers or URIs. We provide an open source implementation of BytE to foster reproducible research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06746">Cluster-wise Graph Transformer with Dual-granularity Kernelized Attention</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Huang, Yunchong Song, Jiayue Zhou, Zhouhan Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of graph learning, there is a category of methods that conceptualize graphs as hierarchical structures, utilizing node clustering to capture broader structural information. While generally effective, these methods often rely on a fixed graph coarsening routine, leading to overly homogeneous cluster representations and loss of node-level information. In this paper, we envision the graph as a network of interconnected node sets without compressing each cluster into a single embedding. To enable effective information transfer among these node sets, we propose the Node-to-Cluster Attention (N2C-Attn) mechanism. N2C-Attn incorporates techniques from Multiple Kernel Learning into the kernelized attention framework, effectively capturing information at both node and cluster levels. We then devise an efficient form for N2C-Attn using the cluster-wise message-passing framework, achieving linear time complexity. We further analyze how N2C-Attn combines bi-level feature maps of queries and keys, demonstrating its capability to merge dual-granularity information. The resulting architecture, Cluster-wise Graph Transformer (Cluster-GT), which uses node clusters as tokens and employs our proposed N2C-Attn module, shows superior performance on various graph-level tasks.

<p>Abstract: In this study, we present a novel Survival Analysis algorithm designed to efficiently handle large-scale longitudinal data. Our approach draws inspiration from Reinforcement Learning principles, particularly the Deep Q-Network paradigm, extending Temporal Learning concepts to Survival Regression. A central idea in our method is temporal consistency, a hypothesis that past and future outcomes in the data evolve smoothly over time. Our framework uniquely incorporates temporal consistency into large datasets by providing a stable training signal that captures long-term temporal relationships and ensures reliable updates. Additionally, the method supports arbitrarily complex architectures, enabling the modeling of intricate temporal dependencies, and allows for end-to-end training. Through numerous experiments we provide empirical evidence demonstrating our framework's ability to exploit temporal consistency across datasets of varying sizes. Moreover, our algorithm outperforms benchmarks on datasets with long sequences, demonstrating its ability to capture long-term patterns. Finally, ablation studies show how our method enhances training stability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joanna Sliwa, Frank Schneider, Nathanael Bosch, Agustinus Kristiadi, Philipp Hennig</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently learning a sequence of related tasks, such as in continual learning, poses a significant challenge for neural nets due to the delicate trade-off between catastrophic forgetting and loss of plasticity. We address this challenge with a grounded framework for sequentially learning related tasks based on Bayesian inference. Specifically, we treat the model's parameters as a nonlinear Gaussian state-space model and perform efficient inference using Gaussian filtering and smoothing. This general formalism subsumes existing continual learning approaches, while also offering a clearer conceptual understanding of its components. Leveraging Laplace approximations during filtering, we construct Gaussian posterior measures on the weight space of a neural network for each task. We use it as an efficient regularizer by exploiting the structure of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix (GGN) to construct diagonal plus low-rank approximations. The dynamics model allows targeted control of the learning process and the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, such as modeling the type of shift between tasks. Additionally, using Bayesian approximate smoothing can enhance the performance of task-specific models without needing to re-access any data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Hu, Hengxiang Zhang, Hongxin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Over-parameterized models are typically vulnerable to membership inference attacks, which aim to determine whether a specific sample is included in the training of a given model. Previous Weight regularizations (e.g., L1 regularization) typically impose uniform penalties on all parameters, leading to a suboptimal tradeoff between model utility and privacy. In this work, we first show that only a small fraction of parameters substantially impact the privacy risk. In light of this, we propose Privacy-aware Sparsity Tuning (PAST), a simple fix to the L1 Regularization, by employing adaptive penalties to different parameters. Our key idea behind PAST is to promote sparsity in parameters that significantly contribute to privacy leakage. In particular, we construct the adaptive weight for each parameter based on its privacy sensitivity, i.e., the gradient of the loss gap with respect to the parameter. Using PAST, the network shrinks the loss gap between members and non-members, leading to strong resistance to privacy attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PAST, achieving a state-of-the-art balance in the privacy-utility trade-off.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Egor Kraev, Baran Koseoglu, Luca Traverso, Mohammed Topiwalla</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature selection is an essential process in machine learning, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. It helps reduce the complexity of machine learning models, improve performance, mitigate overfitting, and decrease computation time. This paper presents a novel feature selection framework, shap-select. The framework conducts a linear or logistic regression of the target on the Shapley values of the features, on the validation set, and uses the signs and significance levels of the regression coefficients to implement an efficient heuristic for feature selection in tabular regression and classification tasks. We evaluate shap-select on the Kaggle credit card fraud dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to established methods such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), HISEL (a mutual information-based feature selection method), Boruta and a simpler Shapley value-based method. Our findings show that shap-select combines interpretability, computational efficiency, and performance, offering a robust solution for feature selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Mao, Yani Zhang, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural work certification has established itself as a crucial tool for ensuring the robustness of neural networks. Certification methods typically rely on convex relaxations of the feasible output set to provide sound bounds. However, complete certification requires exact bounds, which strongly limits the expressivity of ReLU networks: even for the simple ``$\max$'' function in $\mathbb{R}^2$, there does not exist a ReLU network that expresses this function and can be exactly bounded by single-neuron relaxation methods. This raises the question whether there exists a convex relaxation that can provide exact bounds for general continuous piecewise linear functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In this work, we answer this question affirmatively by showing that (layer-wise) multi-neuron relaxation provides complete certification for general ReLU networks. Based on this novel result, we show that the expressivity of ReLU networks is no longer limited under multi-neuron relaxation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first positive result on the completeness of convex relaxations, shedding light on the practice of certified robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lise Le Boudec, Emmanuel de Bezenac, Louis Serrano, Ramon Daniel Regueiro-Espino, Yuan Yin, Patrick Gallinari</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning often faces optimization challenges due to the complexity of solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which involve exploring large solution spaces, require numerous iterations, and can lead to unstable training. These challenges arise particularly from the ill-conditioning of the optimization problem, caused by the differential terms in the loss function. To address these issues, we propose learning a solver, i.e., solving PDEs using a physics-informed iterative algorithm trained on data. Our method learns to condition a gradient descent algorithm that automatically adapts to each PDE instance, significantly accelerating and stabilizing the optimization process and enabling faster convergence of physics-aware models. Furthermore, while traditional physics-informed methods solve for a single PDE instance, our approach addresses parametric PDEs. Specifically, our method integrates the physical loss gradient with the PDE parameters to solve over a distribution of PDE parameters, including coefficients, initial conditions, or boundary conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through empirical experiments on multiple datasets, comparing training and test-time optimization performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shima Rabiei, Sandipan Mishra, Santiago Paternain</p>
<p>Abstract: This work considers the problem of transfer learning in the context of reinforcement learning. Specifically, we consider training a policy in a reduced order system and deploying it in the full state system. The motivation for this training strategy is that running simulations in the full-state system may take excessive time if the dynamics are complex. While transfer learning alleviates the computational issue, the transfer guarantees depend on the discrepancy between the two systems. In this work, we consider a class of cascade dynamical systems, where the dynamics of a subset of the state-space influence the rest of the states but not vice-versa. The reinforcement learning policy learns in a model that ignores the dynamics of these states and treats them as commanded inputs. In the full-state system, these dynamics are handled using a classic controller (e.g., a PID). These systems have vast applications in the control literature and their structure allows us to provide transfer guarantees that depend on the stability of the inner loop controller. Numerical experiments on a quadrotor support the theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Borjan Geshkovski, Hugo Koubbi, Yury Polyanskiy, Philippe Rigollet</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the self-attention model - an interacting particle system on the unit sphere, which serves as a toy model for Transformers, the deep neural network architecture behind the recent successes of large language models. We prove the appearance of dynamic metastability conjectured in [GLPR23] - although particles collapse to a single cluster in infinite time, they remain trapped near a configuration of several clusters for an exponentially long period of time. By leveraging a gradient flow interpretation of the system, we also connect our result to an overarching framework of slow motion of gradient flows proposed by Otto and Reznikoff [OR07] in the context of coarsening and the Allen-Cahn equation. We finally probe the dynamics beyond the exponentially long period of metastability, and illustrate that, under an appropriate time-rescaling, the energy reaches its global maximum in finite time and has a staircase profile, with trajectories manifesting saddle-to-saddle-like behavior, reminiscent of recent works in the analysis of training dynamics via gradient descent for two-layer neural networks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06848">Forgetting Through Transforming: Enabling Federated Unlearning via Class-Aware Representation Transformation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Guo, Zhen Tian, Minghao Yao, Yong Qi, Saiyu Qi, Yun Li, Jin Song Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FU) enables clients to selectively remove the influence of specific data from a trained federated learning model, addressing privacy concerns and regulatory requirements. However, existing FU methods often struggle to balance effective erasure with model utility preservation, especially for class-level unlearning in non-IID settings. We propose Federated Unlearning via Class-aware Representation Transformation (FUCRT), a novel method that achieves unlearning through class-aware representation transformation. FUCRT employs two key components: (1) a transformation class selection strategy to identify optimal forgetting directions, and (2) a transformation alignment technique using dual class-aware contrastive learning to ensure consistent transformations across clients. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate FUCRT's superior performance in terms of erasure guarantee, model utility preservation, and efficiency. FUCRT achieves complete (100\%) erasure of unlearning classes while maintaining or improving performance on remaining classes, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across both IID and Non-IID settings. Analysis of the representation space reveals FUCRT's ability to effectively merge unlearning class representations with the transformation class from remaining classes, closely mimicking the model retrained from scratch.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model ensemble adversarial attack has become a powerful method for generating transferable adversarial examples that can target even unknown models, but its theoretical foundation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we provide early theoretical insights that serve as a roadmap for advancing model ensemble adversarial attack. We first define transferability error to measure the error in adversarial transferability, alongside concepts of diversity and empirical model ensemble Rademacher complexity. We then decompose the transferability error into vulnerability, diversity, and a constant, which rigidly explains the origin of transferability error in model ensemble attack: the vulnerability of an adversarial example to ensemble components, and the diversity of ensemble components. Furthermore, we apply the latest mathematical tools in information theory to bound the transferability error using complexity and generalization terms, contributing to three practical guidelines for reducing transferability error: (1) incorporating more surrogate models, (2) increasing their diversity, and (3) reducing their complexity in cases of overfitting. Finally, extensive experiments with 54 models validate our theoretical framework, representing a significant step forward in understanding transferable model ensemble adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitrii Avdiukhin, Michael Dinitz, Chenglin Fan, Grigory Yaroslavtsev</p>
<p>Abstract: Private optimization is a topic of major interest in machine learning, with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) playing a key role in both theory and practice. Furthermore, DP-SGD is known to be a powerful tool in contexts beyond privacy, including robustness, machine unlearning, etc. Existing analyses of DP-SGD either make relatively strong assumptions (e.g., Lipschitz continuity of the loss function, or even convexity) or prove only first-order convergence (and thus might end at a saddle point in the non-convex setting). At the same time, there has been progress in proving second-order convergence of the non-private version of ``noisy SGD'', as well as progress in designing algorithms that are more complex than DP-SGD and do guarantee second-order convergence. We revisit DP-SGD and show that ``noise is all you need'': the noise necessary for privacy already implies second-order convergence under the standard smoothness assumptions, even for non-Lipschitz loss functions. Hence, we get second-order convergence essentially for free: DP-SGD, the workhorse of modern private optimization, under minimal assumptions can be used to find a second-order stationary point.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spiking Graph Networks (SGNs) have garnered significant attraction from both researchers and industry due to their ability to address energy consumption challenges in graph classification. However, SGNs are only effective for in-distribution data and cannot tackle out-of-distribution data. In this paper, we first propose the domain adaptation problem in SGNs, and introduce a novel framework named Degree-aware Spiking Graph Domain Adaptation for Classification. The proposed DeSGDA addresses the spiking graph domain adaptation problem by three aspects: node degree-aware personalized spiking representation, adversarial feature distribution alignment, and pseudo-label distillation. First, we introduce the personalized spiking representation method for generating degree-dependent spiking signals. Specifically, the threshold of triggering a spike is determined by the node degree, allowing this personalized approach to capture more expressive information for classification. Then, we propose the graph feature distribution alignment module that is adversarially trained using membrane potential against a domain discriminator. Such an alignment module can efficiently maintain high performance and low energy consumption in the case of inconsistent distribution. Additionally, we extract consistent predictions across two spaces to create reliable pseudo-labels, effectively leveraging unlabeled data to enhance graph classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed DeSGDA compared with competitive baselines.</p>

We obtain the minimax optimal rates of the problem in most parameter regimes. An elbow effect of the optimal rates at $p=2$ is clearly identified. To show the optimal rates, we first design estimation protocols to achieve them. The key ingredient of these protocols is to introduce adaptive refinement mechanisms, which first generate rough estimate by partial information and then establish refined estimate in subsequent steps guided by the rough estimate. The protocols leverage successive refinement, sample compression and thresholding methods to achieve the optimal rates in different parameter regimes. The optimality of the protocols is shown by deriving compatible minimax lower bounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhao Sun, Yuhao Mao, Mark Niklas M\"uller, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a popular approach for providing certified robustness guarantees against adversarial attacks, and has become a very active area of research. Over the past years, the average certified radius (ACR) has emerged as the single most important metric for comparing methods and tracking progress in the field. However, in this work, we show that ACR is an exceptionally poor metric for evaluating robustness guarantees provided by randomized smoothing. We theoretically show not only that a trivial classifier can have arbitrarily large ACR, but also that ACR is much more sensitive to improvements on easy samples than on hard ones. Empirically, we confirm that existing training strategies that improve ACR reduce the model's robustness on hard samples. Further, we show that by focusing on easy samples, we can effectively replicate the increase in ACR. We develop strategies, including explicitly discarding hard samples, reweighing the dataset with certified radius, and extreme optimization for easy samples, to achieve state-of-the-art ACR, although these strategies ignore robustness for the general data distribution. Overall, our results suggest that ACR has introduced a strong undesired bias to the field, and better metrics are required to holistically evaluate randomized smoothing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Thanks to the high potential for profit, trading has become increasingly attractive to investors as the cryptocurrency and stock markets rapidly expand. However, because financial markets are intricate and dynamic, accurately predicting prices remains a significant challenge. The volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market makes it even harder for traders and investors to make decisions. This study presents a machine learning model based on classification to forecast the direction of the cryptocurrency market, i.e., whether prices will increase or decrease. The model is trained using historical data and important technical indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence, the Relative Strength Index, and Bollinger Bands. We illustrate our approach with an empirical study of the closing price of Bitcoin. Several simulations, including a confusion matrix and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, are used to assess the model's performance, and the results show a buy/sell signal accuracy of over 92%. These findings demonstrate how machine learning models can assist investors and traders of cryptocurrencies in making wise/informed decisions in a very volatile market.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijie Hu, Tianhao Huang, Lu Yu, Wanyu Lin, Tianhang Zheng, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, attention mechanisms have garnered increasing attention in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Transformers (GTs). It is not only due to the commendable boost in performance they offer but also its capacity to provide a more lucid rationale for model behaviors, which are often viewed as inscrutable. However, Attention-based GNNs have demonstrated instability in interpretability when subjected to various sources of perturbations during both training and testing phases, including factors like additional edges or nodes. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by introducing a novel notion called Faithful Graph Attention-based Interpretation (FGAI). In particular, FGAI has four crucial properties regarding stability and sensitivity to interpretation and final output distribution. Built upon this notion, we propose an efficient methodology for obtaining FGAI, which can be viewed as an ad hoc modification to the canonical Attention-based GNNs. To validate our proposed solution, we introduce two novel metrics tailored for graph interpretation assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that FGAI exhibits superior stability and preserves the interpretability of attention under various forms of perturbations and randomness, which makes FGAI a more faithful and reliable explanation tool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junbo Jacob Lian</p>
<p>Abstract: In traditional boosting algorithms, the focus on misclassified training samples emphasizes their importance based on difficulty during the learning process. While using a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a weak learner in an AdaBoost framework can enhance model performance by concentrating on error samples, this approach introduces significant challenges. Specifically, SVMs, characterized by their stability and robustness, may require destabilization to fit the boosting paradigm, which in turn can constrain performance due to reliance on the weighted results from preceding iterations. To address these challenges, we propose the Support Vector Boosting Machine (SVBM), which integrates a novel subsampling process with SVM algorithms and residual connection techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Fiorini, Giulia M. Bovolenta, Stefano Coniglio, Michele Ciavotta, Pietro Morerio, Michele Parrinello, Alessio Del Bue</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs and hypergraphs provide powerful abstractions for modeling interactions among a set of entities of interest and have been attracting a growing interest in the literature thanks to many successful applications in several fields. In particular, they are rapidly expanding in domains such as chemistry and biology, especially in the areas of drug discovery and molecule generation. One of the areas witnessing the fasted growth is the chemical reactions field, where chemical reactions can be naturally encoded as directed hyperedges of a hypergraph. In this paper, we address the chemical reaction classification problem by introducing the notation of a Directed Line Graph (DGL) associated with a given directed hypergraph. On top of it, we build the Directed Line Graph Network (DLGNet), the first spectral-based Graph Neural Network (GNN) expressly designed to operate on a hypergraph via its DLG transformation. The foundation of DLGNet is a novel Hermitian matrix, the Directed Line Graph Laplacian, which compactly encodes the directionality of the interactions taking place within the directed hyperedges of the hypergraph thanks to the DLG representation. The Directed Line Graph Laplacian enjoys many desirable properties, including admitting an eigenvalue decomposition and being positive semidefinite, which make it well-suited for its adoption within a spectral-based GNN. Through extensive experiments on chemical reaction datasets, we show that DGLNet significantly outperforms the existing approaches, achieving on a collection of real-world datasets an average relative-percentage-difference improvement of 33.01%, with a maximum improvement of 37.71%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Bao, Zhichen Zeng, Zhining Liu, Hanghang Tong, Jingrui He</p>
<p>Abstract: Powerful as they are, graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to be vulnerable to distribution shifts. Recently, test-time adaptation (TTA) has attracted attention due to its ability to adapt a pre-trained model to a target domain without re-accessing the source domain. However, existing TTA algorithms are primarily designed for attribute shifts in vision tasks, where samples are independent. These methods perform poorly on graph data that experience structure shifts, where node connectivity differs between source and target graphs. We attribute this performance gap to the distinct impact of node attribute shifts versus graph structure shifts: the latter significantly degrades the quality of node representations and blurs the boundaries between different node categories. To address structure shifts in graphs, we propose AdaRC, an innovative framework designed for effective and efficient adaptation to structure shifts by adjusting the hop-aggregation parameters in GNNs. To enhance the representation quality, we design a prediction-informed clustering loss to encourage the formation of distinct clusters for different node categories. Additionally, AdaRC seamlessly integrates with existing TTA algorithms, allowing it to handle attribute shifts effectively while improving overall performance under combined structure and attribute shifts. We validate the effectiveness of AdaRC on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its robustness across various combinations of structure and attribute shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Lan, Philip Torr, Austin Meek, Ashkan Khakzar, David Krueger, Fazl Barez</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate feature universality in large language models (LLMs), a research field that aims to understand how different models similarly represent concepts in the latent spaces of their intermediate layers. Demonstrating feature universality allows discoveries about latent representations to generalize across several models. However, comparing features across LLMs is challenging due to polysemanticity, in which individual neurons often correspond to multiple features rather than distinct ones. This makes it difficult to disentangle and match features across different models. To address this issue, we employ a method known as dictionary learning by using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to transform LLM activations into more interpretable spaces spanned by neurons corresponding to individual features. After matching feature neurons across models via activation correlation, we apply representational space similarity metrics like Singular Value Canonical Correlation Analysis to analyze these SAE features across different LLMs. Our experiments reveal significant similarities in SAE feature spaces across various LLMs, providing new evidence for feature universality.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the use of diffusion models as neural density estimators. The current approach to this problem involves converting the generative process to a smooth flow, known as the Probability Flow ODE. The log density at a given sample can be obtained by solving the ODE with a black-box solver. We introduce a new, highly parallelizable method that computes log densities without the need to solve a flow. Our approach is based on estimating a path integral by Monte Carlo, in a manner identical to the simulation-free training of diffusion models. We also study how different training parameters affect the accuracy of the density calculation, and offer insights into how these models can be made more scalable and efficient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Butakov, Alexander Sememenko, Alexander Tolmachev, Andrey Gladkov, Marina Munkhoeva, Alexey Frolov</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep InfoMax (DIM) is a well-established method for self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) based on maximization of the mutual information between the input and the output of a deep neural network encoder. Despite the DIM and contrastive SSRL in general being well-explored, the task of learning representations conforming to a specific distribution (i.e., distribution matching, DM) is still under-addressed. Motivated by the importance of DM to several downstream tasks (including generative modeling, disentanglement, outliers detection and other), we enhance DIM to enable automatic matching of learned representations to a selected prior distribution. To achieve this, we propose injecting an independent noise into the normalized outputs of the encoder, while keeping the same InfoMax training objective. We show that such modification allows for learning uniformly and normally distributed representations, as well as representations of other absolutely continuous distributions. Our approach is tested on various downstream tasks. The results indicate a moderate trade-off between the performance on the downstream tasks and quality of DM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leticia Mattos Da Silva, Silvia Sell\'an, Justin Solomon</p>
<p>Abstract: Resampling from a target measure whose density is unknown is a fundamental problem in mathematical statistics and machine learning. A setting that dominates the machine learning literature consists of learning a map from an easy-to-sample prior, such as the Gaussian distribution, to a target measure. Under this model, samples from the prior are pushed forward to generate a new sample on the target measure, which is often difficult to sample from directly. In this paper, we propose a new model for conditional resampling called mirror Schr\"odinger bridges. Our key observation is that solving the Schr\"odinger bridge problem between a distribution and itself provides a natural way to produce new samples from conditional distributions, giving in-distribution variations of an input data point. We show how to efficiently solve this largely overlooked version of the Schr\"odinger bridge problem. We prove that our proposed method leads to significant algorithmic simplifications over existing alternatives, in addition to providing control over in-distribution variation. Empirically, we demonstrate how these benefits can be leveraged to produce proximal samples in a number of application domains.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07013">Causal Representation Learning in Temporal Data via Single-Parent Decoding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Philippe Brouillard, S\'ebastien Lachapelle, Julia Kaltenborn, Yaniv Gurwicz, Dhanya Sridhar, Alexandre Drouin, Peer Nowack, Jakob Runge, David Rolnick</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific research often seeks to understand the causal structure underlying high-level variables in a system. For example, climate scientists study how phenomena, such as El Ni\~no, affect other climate processes at remote locations across the globe. However, scientists typically collect low-level measurements, such as geographically distributed temperature readings. From these, one needs to learn both a mapping to causally-relevant latent variables, such as a high-level representation of the El Ni\~no phenomenon and other processes, as well as the causal model over them. The challenge is that this task, called causal representation learning, is highly underdetermined from observational data alone, requiring other constraints during learning to resolve the indeterminacies. In this work, we consider a temporal model with a sparsity assumption, namely single-parent decoding: each observed low-level variable is only affected by a single latent variable. Such an assumption is reasonable in many scientific applications that require finding groups of low-level variables, such as extracting regions from geographically gridded measurement data in climate research or capturing brain regions from neural activity data. We demonstrate the identifiability of the resulting model and propose a differentiable method, Causal Discovery with Single-parent Decoding (CDSD), that simultaneously learns the underlying latents and a causal graph over them. We assess the validity of our theoretical results using simulated data and showcase the practical validity of our method in an application to real-world data from the climate science field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian G. Gruber, Francis Bach</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a mean-squared error-based risk that enables the comparison and optimization of estimators of squared calibration errors in practical settings. Improving the calibration of classifiers is crucial for enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of machine learning models, especially in sensitive decision-making scenarios. Although various calibration (error) estimators exist in the current literature, there is a lack of guidance on selecting the appropriate estimator and tuning its hyperparameters. By leveraging the bilinear structure of squared calibration errors, we reformulate calibration estimation as a regression problem with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input pairs. This reformulation allows us to quantify the performance of different estimators even for the most challenging calibration criterion, known as canonical calibration. Our approach advocates for a training-validation-testing pipeline when estimating a calibration error on an evaluation dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline by optimizing existing calibration estimators and comparing them with novel kernel ridge regression-based estimators on standard image classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengtao Jian, Kai Yang, Yang Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization in machine learning is a burgeoning area of study. Its primary goal is to enhance the adaptability and resilience of machine learning models when faced with new, unseen, and potentially adversarial data that significantly diverges from their original training datasets. In this paper, we investigate time series OOD generalization via pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). We first propose a novel \textbf{T}ri-level learning framework for \textbf{T}ime \textbf{S}eries \textbf{O}OD generalization, termed TTSO, which considers both sample-level and group-level uncertainties. This formula offers a fresh theoretic perspective for formulating and analyzing OOD generalization problem. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis to justify this method is well motivated. We then develop a stratified localization algorithm tailored for this tri-level optimization problem, theoretically demonstrating the guaranteed convergence of the proposed algorithm. Our analysis also reveals that the iteration complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-stationary point is bounded by O($\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$). Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of heterogeneous data distributions in cross-silo federated learning by introducing a novel algorithm, which we term Cross-silo Robust Clustered Federated Learning (CS-RCFL). Our approach leverages the Wasserstein distance to construct ambiguity sets around each client's empirical distribution that capture possible distribution shifts in the local data, enabling evaluation of worst-case model performance. We then propose a model-agnostic integer fractional program to determine the optimal distributionally robust clustering of clients into coalitions so that possible biases in the local models caused by statistically heterogeneous client datasets are avoided, and analyze our method for linear and logistic regression models. Finally, we discuss a federated learning protocol that ensures the privacy of client distributions, a critical consideration, for instance, when clients are healthcare institutions. We evaluate our algorithm on synthetic and real-world healthcare data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the performance of transformers as a function of the number of repetitions of training examples with algorithmically generated datasets. On three problems of mathematics: the greatest common divisor, modular multiplication, and matrix eigenvalues, we show that for a fixed number of training steps, models trained on smaller sets of repeated examples outperform models trained on larger sets of single-use examples. We also demonstrate that two-set training - repeated use of a small random subset of examples, along normal sampling on the rest of the training set - provides for faster learning and better performance. This highlights that the benefits of repetition can outweigh those of data diversity. These datasets and problems provide a controlled setting to shed light on the still poorly understood interplay between generalization and memorization in deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sujoy Bhore, Devdan Dey, Satyam Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: VC-dimension and $\varepsilon$-nets are key concepts in Statistical Learning Theory. Intuitively, VC-dimension is a measure of the size of a class of sets. The famous $\varepsilon$-net theorem, a fundamental result in Discrete Geometry, asserts that if the VC-dimension of a set system is bounded, then a small sample exists that intersects all sufficiently large sets.
  In online learning scenarios where data arrives sequentially, the VC-dimension helps to bound the complexity of the set system, and $\varepsilon$-nets ensure the selection of a small representative set. This sampling framework is crucial in various domains, including spatial data analysis, motion planning in dynamic environments, optimization of sensor networks, and feature extraction in computer vision, among others. Motivated by these applications, we study the online $\varepsilon$-net problem for geometric concepts with bounded VC-dimension. While the offline version of this problem has been extensively studied, surprisingly, there are no known theoretical results for the online version to date. We present the first deterministic online algorithm with an optimal competitive ratio for intervals in $\mathbb{R}$. Next, we give a randomized online algorithm with a near-optimal competitive ratio for axis-aligned boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d\le 3$. Furthermore, we introduce a novel technique to analyze similar-sized objects of constant description complexity in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which may be of independent interest. Next, we focus on the continuous version of this problem, where ranges of the set system are geometric concepts in $\mathbb{R}^d$ arriving in an online manner, but the universe is the entire space, and the objective is to choose a small sample that intersects all the ranges.</p>

<p>Abstract: VRAM requirements for transformer models scale quadratically with context length due to the self-attention mechanism. In this paper we modify the decoder-only transformer, replacing self-attention with InAttention, which scales linearly with context length during inference by having tokens attend only to initial states. Benchmarking shows that InAttention significantly reduces VRAM usage during inference, enabling handling of long sequences on consumer GPUs. We corroborate that fine-tuning extends context length efficiently, improving performance on long sequences without high training costs. InAttention offers a scalable solution for long-range dependencies in transformer models, paving the way for further optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Schmied, Fabian Paischer, Vihang Patil, Markus Hofmarcher, Razvan Pascanu, Sepp Hochreiter</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a model to learn a new task by observing a few exemplars in its context. While prevalent in NLP, this capability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings. Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the agent's context. Given that complex environments typically lead to long episodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple environments with short episodes. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT). RA-DT employs an external memory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only sub-trajectories relevant for the current situation. The retrieval component in RA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic. We evaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics simulations, and procedurally-generated video games. On grid-worlds, RA-DT outperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length. Furthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on complex environments and discuss future directions. To facilitate future research, we release datasets for four of the considered environments.</p>

Our learning-to-retrieve algorithm optimizes the retriever to select example nodes that maximize LLM performance on graph.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Rezaei, Mohammad Sabokrou</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge when learning new classes. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue. However, rehearsal-based learning, which retains samples from previous classes, typically achieves good performance but tends to memorize specific instances, struggling with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization. This often leads to high forgetting rates and poor generalization. Surprisingly, the OOD generalization capabilities of these methods have been largely unexplored. In this paper, we highlight this issue and propose a simple yet effective strategy inspired by contrastive learning and data-centric principles to address it. We introduce Adaptive Contrastive Replay (ACR), a method that employs dual optimization to simultaneously train both the encoder and the classifier. ACR adaptively populates the replay buffer with misclassified samples while ensuring a balanced representation of classes and tasks. By refining the decision boundary in this way, ACR achieves a balance between stability and plasticity. Our method significantly outperforms previous approaches in terms of OOD generalization, achieving an improvement of 13.41\% on Split CIFAR-100, 9.91\% on Split Mini-ImageNet, and 5.98\% on Split Tiny-ImageNet.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, training data attribution (TDA) methods have emerged as a promising direction for the interpretability of neural networks. While research around TDA is thriving, limited effort has been dedicated to the evaluation of attributions. Similar to the development of evaluation metrics for traditional feature attribution approaches, several standalone metrics have been proposed to evaluate the quality of TDA methods across various contexts. However, the lack of a unified framework that allows for systematic comparison limits trust in TDA methods and stunts their widespread adoption. To address this research gap, we introduce Quanda, a Python toolkit designed to facilitate the evaluation of TDA methods. Beyond offering a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, Quanda provides a uniform interface for seamless integration with existing TDA implementations across different repositories, thus enabling systematic benchmarking. The toolkit is user-friendly, thoroughly tested, well-documented, and available as an open-source library on PyPi and under https://github.com/dilyabareeva/quanda.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Paischer, Lukas Hauzenberger, Thomas Schmied, Benedikt Alkin, Marc Peter Deisenroth, Sepp Hochreiter</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned on a downstream task for a specific application. The most successful and most commonly used fine-tuning method is to update the pre-trained weights via a low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoRA introduces new weight matrices that are usually initialized at random with a uniform rank distribution across model weights. Recent works focus on weight-driven initialization or learning of adaptive ranks during training. Both approaches have only been investigated in isolation, resulting in slow convergence or a uniform rank distribution, in turn leading to sub-optimal performance. We propose to enhance LoRA by initializing the new weights in a data-driven manner by computing singular value decomposition on minibatches of activation vectors. Then, we initialize the LoRA matrices with the obtained right-singular vectors and re-distribute ranks among all weight matrices to explain the maximal amount of variance and continue the standard LoRA fine-tuning procedure. This results in our new method Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA). We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks ranging from language generation and understanding to image classification and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and attains the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pingzhi Li, Prateek Yadav, Jaehong Yoon, Jie Peng, Yi-Lin Sung, Mohit Bansal, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation of fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to particular domains. This has enabled the creation of powerful and adaptive routing-based "Model MoErging" methods with the goal of using expert modules to create an aggregate system with improved performance or generalization. However, existing MoErging methods often prioritize generalization to unseen tasks at the expense of performance on held-in tasks, which limits its practical applicability in real-world deployment scenarios. We observe that current token-level routing mechanisms neglect the global semantic context of the input task. This token-wise independence hinders effective expert selection for held-in tasks, as routing decisions fail to incorporate the semantic properties of the task. To address this, we propose, Global and Local Instruction Driven Expert Router (GLIDER) that integrates a multi-scale routing mechanism, encompassing a semantic global router and a learned local router. The global router leverages LLM's advanced reasoning capabilities for semantic-related contexts to enhance expert selection. Given the input query and LLM, the router generates semantic task instructions that guide the retrieval of the most relevant experts across all layers. This global guidance is complemented by a local router that facilitates token-level routing decisions within each module, enabling finer control and enhanced performance on unseen tasks. Our experiments using T5-based models for T0 and FLAN tasks demonstrate that GLIDER achieves substantially improved held-in performance while maintaining strong generalization on held-out tasks. We also perform ablations experiments to dive deeper into the components of GLIDER. Our experiments highlight the importance of our multi-scale routing that leverages LLM-driven semantic reasoning for MoErging methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anas Al-lahham, Muhammad Zaigham Zaheer, Nurbek Tastan, Karthik Nandakumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised (US) video anomaly detection (VAD) in surveillance applications is gaining more popularity recently due to its practical real-world applications. As surveillance videos are privacy sensitive and the availability of large-scale video data may enable better US-VAD systems, collaborative learning can be highly rewarding in this setting. However, due to the extremely challenging nature of the US-VAD task, where learning is carried out without any annotations, privacy-preserving collaborative learning of US-VAD systems has not been studied yet. In this paper, we propose a new baseline for anomaly detection capable of localizing anomalous events in complex surveillance videos in a fully unsupervised fashion without any labels on a privacy-preserving participant-based distributed training configuration. Additionally, we propose three new evaluation protocols to benchmark anomaly detection approaches on various scenarios of collaborations and data availability. Based on these protocols, we modify existing VAD datasets to extensively evaluate our approach as well as existing US SOTA methods on two large-scale datasets including UCF-Crime and XD-Violence. All proposed evaluation protocols, dataset splits, and codes are available here: https://github.com/AnasEmad11/CLAP</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengjie Xu, Lingxi Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising class of targeted cancer therapeutics, but the design and optimization of their cytotoxic payloads remain challenging. This study introduces DumplingGNN, a novel hybrid Graph Neural Network architecture specifically designed for predicting ADC payload activity based on chemical structure. By integrating Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE layers, DumplingGNN effectively captures multi-scale molecular features and leverages both 2D topological and 3D structural information. We evaluate DumplingGNN on a comprehensive ADC payload dataset focusing on DNA Topoisomerase I inhibitors, as well as on multiple public benchmarks from MoleculeNet. DumplingGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including BBBP (96.4\% ROC-AUC), ToxCast (78.2\% ROC-AUC), and PCBA (88.87\% ROC-AUC). On our specialized ADC payload dataset, it demonstrates exceptional accuracy (91.48\%), sensitivity (95.08\%), and specificity (97.54\%). Ablation studies confirm the synergistic effects of the hybrid architecture and the critical role of 3D structural information in enhancing predictive accuracy. The model's strong interpretability, enabled by attention mechanisms, provides valuable insights into structure-activity relationships. DumplingGNN represents a significant advancement in molecular property prediction, with particular promise for accelerating the design and optimization of ADC payloads in targeted cancer therapy development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous materials, crucial in various engineering applications, exhibit complex multiscale behavior, which challenges the effectiveness of traditional computational methods. In this work, we introduce the Micromechanics Transformer ({\em Micrometer}), an artificial intelligence (AI) framework for predicting the mechanical response of heterogeneous materials, bridging the gap between advanced data-driven methods and complex solid mechanics problems. Trained on a large-scale high-resolution dataset of 2D fiber-reinforced composites, Micrometer can achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting microscale strain fields across a wide range of microstructures, material properties under any loading conditions and We demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of Micrometer through applications in computational homogenization and multiscale modeling, where Micrometer achieves 1\% error in predicting macroscale stress fields while reducing computational time by up to two orders of magnitude compared to conventional numerical solvers. We further showcase the adaptability of the proposed model through transfer learning experiments on new materials with limited data, highlighting its potential to tackle diverse scenarios in mechanical analysis of solid materials. Our work represents a significant step towards AI-driven innovation in computational solid mechanics, addressing the limitations of traditional numerical methods and paving the way for more efficient simulations of heterogeneous materials across various industrial applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ching-Chun Chang, Kai Gao, Shuying Xu, Anastasia Kordoni, Christopher Leckie, Isao Echizen</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural backdoors represent insidious cybersecurity loopholes that render learning machinery vulnerable to unauthorised manipulations, potentially enabling the weaponisation of artificial intelligence with catastrophic consequences. A backdoor attack involves the clandestine infiltration of a trigger during the learning process, metaphorically analogous to hypnopaedia, where ideas are implanted into a subject's subconscious mind under the state of hypnosis or unconsciousness. When activated by a sensory stimulus, the trigger evokes conditioned reflex that directs a machine to mount a predetermined response. In this study, we propose a cybernetic framework for constant surveillance of backdoors threats, driven by the dynamic nature of untrustworthy data sources. We develop a self-aware unlearning mechanism to autonomously detach a machine's behaviour from the backdoor trigger. Through reverse engineering and statistical inference, we detect deceptive patterns and estimate the likelihood of backdoor infection. We employ model inversion to elicit artificial mental imagery, using stochastic processes to disrupt optimisation pathways and avoid convergent but potentially flawed patterns. This is followed by hypothesis analysis, which estimates the likelihood of each potentially malicious pattern being the true trigger and infers the probability of infection. The primary objective of this study is to maintain a stable state of equilibrium between knowledge fidelity and backdoor vulnerability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lauren Nicole DeLong, Yojana Gadiya, Paola Galdi, Jacques D. Fleuriot, Daniel Domingo-Fern\'andez</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) artificial intelligence describes the combination of logic or rule-based techniques with neural networks. Compared to neural approaches, NeSy methods often possess enhanced interpretability, which is particularly promising for biomedical applications like drug discovery. However, since interpretability is broadly defined, there are no clear guidelines for assessing the biological plausibility of model interpretations. To assess interpretability in the context of drug discovery, we devise a novel prediction task, called drug mechanism-of-action (MoA) deconvolution, with an associated, tailored knowledge graph (KG), MoA-net. We then develop the MoA Retrieval System (MARS), a NeSy approach for drug discovery which leverages logical rules with learned rule weights. Using this interpretable feature alongside domain knowledge, we find that MARS and other NeSy approaches on KGs are susceptible to reasoning shortcuts, in which the prediction of true labels is driven by "degree-bias" rather than the domain-based rules. Subsequently, we demonstrate ways to identify and mitigate this. Thereafter, MARS achieves performance on par with current state-of-the-art models while producing model interpretations aligned with known MoAs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose AutoDAN-Turbo, a black-box jailbreak method that can automatically discover as many jailbreak strategies as possible from scratch, without any human intervention or predefined scopes (e.g., specified candidate strategies), and use them for red-teaming. As a result, AutoDAN-Turbo can significantly outperform baseline methods, achieving a 74.3% higher average attack success rate on public benchmarks. Notably, AutoDAN-Turbo achieves an 88.5 attack success rate on GPT-4-1106-turbo. In addition, AutoDAN-Turbo is a unified framework that can incorporate existing human-designed jailbreak strategies in a plug-and-play manner. By integrating human-designed strategies, AutoDAN-Turbo can even achieve a higher attack success rate of 93.4 on GPT-4-1106-turbo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jean-Eudes Ayilo (MULTISPEECH), Mostafa Sadeghi (MULTISPEECH), Romain Serizel (MULTISPEECH), Xavier Alameda-Pineda (ROBOTLEARN)</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised audiovisual speech enhancement (AVSE) approach that combines a diffusion-based audio-visual speech generative model with a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) noise model. First, the diffusion model is pre-trained on clean speech conditioned on corresponding video data to simulate the speech generative distribution. This pre-trained model is then paired with the NMF-based noise model to iteratively estimate clean speech. Specifically, a diffusion-based posterior sampling approach is implemented within the reverse diffusion process, where after each iteration, a speech estimate is obtained and used to update the noise parameters. Experimental results confirm that the proposed AVSE approach not only outperforms its audio-only counterpart but also generalizes better than a recent supervisedgenerative AVSE method. Additionally, the new inference algorithm offers a better balance between inference speed and performance compared to the previous diffusion-based method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanyu Zhuang (LTCI, IP Paris, S2A, IDS), Geoffroy Peeters (LTCI, IP Paris, S2A, IDS), Ga\"el Richard (S2A, IDS, LTCI, IP Paris)</p>
<p>Abstract: The Prototypical Network (ProtoNet) has emerged as a popular choice in Few-shot Learning (FSL) scenarios due to its remarkable performance and straightforward implementation. Building upon such success, we first propose a simple (yet novel) method to fine-tune a ProtoNet on the (labeled) support set of the test episode of a C-way-K-shot test episode (without using the query set which is only used for evaluation). We then propose an algorithmic framework that combines ProtoNet with optimization-based FSL algorithms (MAML and Meta-Curvature) to work with such a fine-tuning method. Since optimization-based algorithms endow the target learner model with the ability to fast adaption to only a few samples, we utilize ProtoNet as the target model to enhance its fine-tuning performance with the help of a specifically designed episodic fine-tuning strategy. The experimental results confirm that our proposed models, MAML-Proto and MC-Proto, combined with our unique fine-tuning method, outperform regular ProtoNet by a large margin in few-shot audio classification tasks on the ESC-50 and Speech Commands v2 datasets. We note that although we have only applied our model to the audio domain, it is a general method and can be easily extended to other domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maksym Szemer, Szymon Buchaniec, Tomasz Prokop, Grzegorz Brus</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a potent computational tool for expediting research and development in solid oxide fuel cell electrodes. The effective application of machine learning for performance prediction requires transforming electrode microstructure into a format compatible with artificial neural networks. Input data may range from a comprehensive digital material representation of the electrode to a selected set of microstructural parameters. The chosen representation significantly influences the performance and results of the network. Here, we show a novel approach utilizing persistence representation derived from computational topology. Using 500 microstructures and current-voltage characteristics obtained with 3D first-principles simulations, we have prepared an artificial neural network model that can replicate current-voltage characteristics of unseen microstructures based on their persistent image representation. The artificial neural network can accurately predict the polarization curve of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes. The presented method incorporates complex microstructural information from the digital material representation while requiring substantially less computational resources (preprocessing and prediction time approximately 1 min) compared to our high-fidelity simulations (simulation time approximately 1 hour) to obtain a single current-potential characteristic for one microstructure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rodrigo Moreira, Rodolfo S. Villaca, Moises R. N. Ribeiro, Joberto S. B. Martins, Joao Henrique Correa, Tereza C. Carvalho, Flavio de Oliveira Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Network Slicing (NS) has transformed the landscape of resource sharing in networks, offering flexibility to support services and applications with highly variable requirements in areas such as the next-generation 5G/6G mobile networks (NGMN), vehicular networks, industrial Internet of Things (IoT), and verticals. Although significant research and experimentation have driven the development of network slicing, existing architectures often fall short in intrinsic architectural intelligent security capabilities. This paper proposes an architecture-intelligent security mechanism to improve the NS solutions. We idealized a security-native architecture that deploys intelligent microservices as federated agents based on machine learning, providing intra-slice and architectural operation security for the Slicing Future Internet Infrastructures (SFI2) reference architecture. It is noteworthy that federated learning approaches match the highly distributed modern microservice-based architectures, thus providing a unifying and scalable design choice for NS platforms addressing both service and security. Using ML-Agents and Security Agents, our approach identified Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and intrusion attacks within the slice using generic and non-intrusive telemetry records, achieving an average accuracy of approximately $95.60\%$ in the network slicing architecture and $99.99\%$ for the deployed slice -- intra-slice. This result demonstrates the potential for leveraging architectural operational security and introduces a promising new research direction for network slicing architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fadi Alharbi, Aleksandar Vakanski, Boyu Zhang, Murtada K. Elbashir, Mohanad Mohammed</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-omics data is increasingly being utilized to advance computational methods for cancer classification. However, multi-omics data integration poses significant challenges due to the high dimensionality, data complexity, and distinct characteristics of various omics types. This study addresses these challenges and evaluates three graph neural network architectures for multi-omics (MO) integration based on graph-convolutional networks (GCN), graph-attention networks (GAT), and graph-transformer networks (GTN) for classifying 31 cancer types and normal tissues. To address the high-dimensionality of multi-omics data, we employed LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression for feature selection, leading to the creation of LASSO-MOGCN, LASSO-MOGAT, and LASSO-MOTGN models. Graph structures for the networks were constructed using gene correlation matrices and protein-protein interaction networks for multi-omics integration of messenger-RNA, micro-RNA, and DNA methylation data. Such data integration enables the networks to dynamically focus on important relationships between biological entities, improving both model performance and interpretability. Among the models, LASSO-MOGAT with a correlation-based graph structure achieved state-of-the-art accuracy (95.9%) and outperformed the LASSO-MOGCN and LASSO-MOTGN models in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings demonstrate that integrating multi-omics data in graph-based architectures enhances cancer classification performance by uncovering distinct molecular patterns that contribute to a better understanding of cancer biology and potential biomarkers for disease progression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suchit Basineni</p>
<p>Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs), including hurricanes and typhoons, cause significant property damage and result in fatalities, making it crucial to understand the factors driving extreme TCs. The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences TC formation through tropospheric vorticity, wind shear, and atmospheric circulations. Apart from atmospheric changes, oceans influence activity through sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and deep ocean heat content. These Atlantic SSTs determine the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which indicates SST variability in the Atlantic. This research focuses on ENSO, AMO, and SSTs impact on the strength and frequency of TCs in the North Atlantic Basin. AMO and SST anomalies are increasing at an alarming rate, but it remains unclear how their dynamics will influence future TC behavior. I used observational cyclone track data from 1950 to 2023, the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), and NOAAs Extended Reconstructed SST V5 (ERSST). I found that Increasing SSTs over the past decade indicate stronger TCs, while warm phase AMO periods correspond with higher TC frequency. Meanwhile, a greater frequency of landfalling TCs can be attributed to La Nina or ENSO-neutral, with El Nino decreasing the frequency of landfalling TCs. Such relationships suggest that as the seasonal predictability of ENSO and SSTs improve, seasonal TC forecasts may improve.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nigar Karimova</p>
<p>Abstract: The research investigates how the application of a machine-learning random forest model improves the accuracy and precision of a Delphi model. The context of the research is Azerbaijani SMEs and the data for the study has been obtained from a financial institution which had gathered it from the enterprises (as there is no public data on local SMEs, it was not practical to verify the data independently). The research used accuracy, precision, recall and F-1 scores for both models to compare them and run the algorithms in Python. The findings showed that accuracy, precision, recall and F- 1 all improve considerably (from 0.69 to 0.83, from 0.65 to 0.81, from 0.56 to 0.77 and from 0.58 to 0.79, respectively). The implications are that by applying AI models in credit risk modeling, financial institutions can improve the accuracy of identifying potential defaulters which would reduce their credit risk. In addition, an unfair rejection of credit access for SMEs would also go down having a significant contribution to an economic growth in the economy. Finally, such ethical issues as transparency of algorithms and biases in historical data should be taken on board while making decisions based on AI algorithms in order to reduce mechanical dependence on algorithms that cannot be justified in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring the security of released large language models (LLMs) poses a significant dilemma, as existing mechanisms either compromise ownership rights or raise data privacy concerns. To address this dilemma, we introduce TaylorMLP to protect the ownership of released LLMs and prevent their abuse. Specifically, TaylorMLP preserves the ownership of LLMs by transforming the weights of LLMs into parameters of Taylor-series. Instead of releasing the original weights, developers can release the Taylor-series parameters with users, thereby ensuring the security of LLMs. Moreover, TaylorMLP can prevent abuse of LLMs by adjusting the generation speed. It can induce low-speed token generation for the protected LLMs by increasing the terms in the Taylor-series. This intentional delay helps LLM developers prevent potential large-scale unauthorized uses of their models. Empirical experiments across five datasets and three LLM architectures demonstrate that TaylorMLP induces over 4x increase in latency, producing the tokens precisely matched with original LLMs. Subsequent defensive experiments further confirm that TaylorMLP effectively prevents users from reconstructing the weight values based on downstream datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Healthcare has witnessed an increased digitalization in the post-COVID world. Technologies such as the medical internet of things and wearable devices are generating a plethora of data available on the cloud anytime from anywhere. This data can be analyzed using advanced artificial intelligence techniques for diagnosis, prognosis, or even treatment of disease. This advancement comes with a major risk to protecting and securing protected health information (PHI). The prevailing regulations for preserving PHI are neither comprehensive nor easy to implement. The study first identifies twenty activities crucial for privacy and security, then categorizes them into five homogeneous categories namely: $\complement_1$ (Policy and Compliance Management), $\complement_2$ (Employee Training and Awareness), $\complement_3$ (Data Protection and Privacy Control), $\complement_4$ (Monitoring and Response), and $\complement_5$ (Technology and Infrastructure Security) and prioritizes these categories to provide a framework for the implementation of privacy and security in a wise manner. The framework utilized the Delphi Method to identify activities, criteria for categorization, and prioritization. Categorization is based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and prioritization is performed using a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The outcomes conclude that $\complement_3$ activities should be given first preference in implementation and followed by $\complement_1$ and $\complement_2$ activities. Finally, $\complement_4$ and $\complement_5$ should be implemented. The prioritized view of identified clustered healthcare activities related to security and privacy, are useful for healthcare policymakers and healthcare informatics professionals.</p>

In particular, with TA3, human-in-the-loop (HITL) enables human-steered attack simulation and visualization-assisted attack impact evaluation. While the current version of TA3 focuses on testing decision tree models against adversarial attacks based on the One Pixel Attack Method, it demonstrates the importance of HITL in ML testing and the potential application of HITL to the ML testing workflows for other types of ML models and other types of adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bart van Laatum, Eldert J. van Henten, Sjoerd Boersma</p>
<p>Abstract: Controlling greenhouse crop production systems is a complex task due to uncertain and non-linear dynamics between crops, indoor and outdoor climate, and economics. The declining number of skilled growers necessitates the development of autonomous greenhouse control systems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach that can learn a control policy to automate greenhouse management. RL optimises a control policy through interactions with a model of the greenhouse while guided by an economic-based reward function. However, its application to real-world systems is limited due to discrepancies between models and real-world dynamics. Moreover, RL controllers may struggle to maintain state constraints while optimising the primary objective, especially when models inadequately capture the adverse effects of constraint violations on crop growth. Also, the generalisation to novel states, for example, due to unseen weather trajectories, is underexplored in RL-based greenhouse control. This work addresses these challenges through three key contributions. First, we present GreenLight-Gym, the first open-source environment designed for training and evaluating RL algorithms on the state-of-the-art greenhouse model GreenLight. GreenLight-Gym enables the community to benchmark RL-based control methodologies. Second, we compare two reward-shaping approaches, using either a multiplicative or additive penalty, to enforce state boundaries. The additive penalty achieves more stable training while better adhering to state constraints, while the multiplicative penalty yields marginally higher profits. Finally, we evaluate RL performance on a disjoint training and testing weather dataset, demonstrating improved generalisation to unseen conditions. Our environment and experiment scripts are open-sourced, facilitating innovative research on learning-based greenhouse control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yamin Li, Ange Lou, Ziyuan Xu, Shengchao Zhang, Shiyu Wang, Dario J. Englot, Soheil Kolouri, Daniel Moyer, Roza G. Bayrak, Catie Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an indispensable tool in modern neuroscience, providing a non-invasive window into whole-brain dynamics at millimeter-scale spatial resolution. However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and significantly advancing the integration of these two modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kacper Sowka, Vasile Palade, Xiaorui Jiang, Hesam Jadidbonab</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the use of a pre-trained language model and siamese network to discern sibling relationships between text-based cybersecurity vulnerability data. The ultimate purpose of the approach presented in this paper is towards the construction of hierarchical attack models based on a set of text descriptions characterising potential/observed vulnerabilities in a given system. Due to the nature of the data, and the uncertainty sensitive environment in which the problem is presented, a practically oriented soft computing approach is necessary. Therefore, a key focus of this work is to investigate practical questions surrounding the reliability of predicted links towards the construction of such models, to which end conceptual and practical challenges and solutions associated with the proposed approach are outlined, such as dataset complexity and stability of predictions. Accordingly, the contributions of this paper focus on producing neural networks using a pre-trained language model for predicting sibling relationships between cybersecurity vulnerabilities, then outlining how to apply this capability towards the generation of hierarchical attack models. In addition, two data sampling mechanisms for tackling data complexity, and a consensus mechanism for reducing the amount of false positive predictions are outlined. Each of these approaches is compared and contrasted using empirical results from three sets of cybersecurity data to determine their effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Monea, Antoine Bosselut, Kiant\'e Brantley, Yoav Artzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn new tasks through in-context supervised learning (i.e., ICL). This work studies if this ability extends to in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), where models are not given gold labels in context, but only their past predictions and rewards. We show that a naive application of ICRL fails miserably, and identify the root cause as a fundamental deficiency at exploration, which leads to quick model degeneration. We propose an algorithm to address this deficiency by increasing test-time compute, as well as a compute-bound approximation. We use several challenging classification tasks to empirically show that our ICRL algorithms lead to effective learning from rewards alone, and analyze the characteristics of this ability and our methods. Overall, our results reveal remarkable ICRL abilities in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadush Hailu Gebrerufael, Anil Kumar Tiwari, Gaurav Neupane</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal deep metric learning is crucial for effectively capturing diverse representations in tasks such as face verification, fine-grained object recognition, and product search. Traditional approaches to metric learning, whether based on distance or margin metrics, primarily emphasize class separation, often overlooking the intra-class distribution essential for multi-modal feature learning. In this context, we propose a novel loss function called Density-Aware Adaptive Margin Loss(DAAL), which preserves the density distribution of embeddings while encouraging the formation of adaptive sub-clusters within each class. By employing an adaptive line strategy, DAAL not only enhances intra-class variance but also ensures robust inter-class separation, facilitating effective multi-modal representation. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark fine-grained datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DAAL, underscoring its potential in advancing retrieval applications and multi-modal deep metric learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: In an earlier work by a subset of the present authors, the method of the so-called neural deflation was introduced towards identifying a complete set of functionally independent conservation laws of a nonlinear dynamical system. Here, we extend by a significant step this proposal. Instead of using the explicit knowledge of the underlying equations of motion, we develop the method directly from system trajectories. This is crucial towards enhancing the practical implementation of the method in scenarios where solely data reflecting discrete snapshots of the system are available. We showcase the results of the method and the number of associated conservation laws obtained in a diverse range of examples including 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators, the Toda lattice, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice and the Calogero-Moser system.</p>

<p>Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder and anxiety disorders affect millions globally, contributing significantly to the burden of mental health issues. Early screening is crucial for effective intervention, as timely identification of mental health issues can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be valuable for improving the screening of mental disorders, enabling early intervention and better treatment outcomes. AI-driven screening can leverage the analysis of multiple data sources, including facial features in digital images. However, existing methods often rely on controlled environments or specialized equipment, limiting their broad applicability. This study explores the potential of AI models for ubiquitous depression-anxiety screening given face-centric selfies. The investigation focuses on high-risk pregnant patients, a population that is particularly vulnerable to mental health issues. To cope with limited training data resulting from our clinical setup, pre-trained models were utilized in two different approaches: fine-tuning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) originally designed for facial expression recognition and employing vision-language models (VLMs) for zero-shot analysis of facial expressions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed VLM-based method significantly outperforms CNNs, achieving an accuracy of 77.6% and an F1-score of 56.0%. Although there is significant room for improvement, the results suggest that VLMs can be a promising approach for mental health screening, especially in scenarios with limited data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sizhe Chen, Arman Zharmagambetov, Saeed Mahloujifar, Kamalika Chaudhuri, Chuan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern software systems, interfacing between the user and the internet to assist with tasks that require advanced language understanding. To accomplish these tasks, the LLM often uses external data sources such as user documents, web retrieval, results from API calls, etc. This opens up new avenues for attackers to manipulate the LLM via prompt injection. Adversarial prompts can be carefully crafted and injected into external data sources to override the user's intended instruction and instead execute a malicious instruction. Prompt injection attacks constitute a major threat to LLM security, making the design and implementation of practical countermeasures of paramount importance. To this end, we show that alignment can be a powerful tool to make LLMs more robust against prompt injection. Our method -- SecAlign -- first builds an alignment dataset by simulating prompt injection attacks and constructing pairs of desirable and undesirable responses. Then, we apply existing alignment techniques to fine-tune the LLM to be robust against these simulated attacks. Our experiments show that SecAlign robustifies the LLM substantially with a negligible hurt on model utility. Moreover, SecAlign's protection generalizes to strong attacks unseen in training. Specifically, the success rate of state-of-the-art GCG-based prompt injections drops from 56% to 2% in Mistral-7B after our alignment process.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayesha Vermani, Josue Nassar, Hyungju Jeon, Matthew Dowling, Il Memming Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning shared structure across environments facilitates rapid learning and adaptive behavior in neural systems. This has been widely demonstrated and applied in machine learning to train models that are capable of generalizing to novel settings. However, there has been limited work exploiting the shared structure in neural activity during similar tasks for learning latent dynamics from neural recordings. Existing approaches are designed to infer dynamics from a single dataset and cannot be readily adapted to account for statistical heterogeneities across recordings. In this work, we hypothesize that similar tasks admit a corresponding family of related solutions and propose a novel approach for meta-learning this solution space from task-related neural activity of trained animals. Specifically, we capture the variabilities across recordings on a low-dimensional manifold which concisely parametrizes this family of dynamics, thereby facilitating rapid learning of latent dynamics given new recordings. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on few-shot reconstruction and forecasting of synthetic dynamical systems, and neural recordings from the motor cortex during different arm reaching tasks.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05465">On the Expressive Power of Tree-Structured Probabilistic Circuits</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lang Yin, Han Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) have emerged as a powerful framework to compactly represent probability distributions for efficient and exact probabilistic inference. It has been shown that PCs with a general directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure can be understood as a mixture of exponentially (in its height) many components, each of which is a product distribution over univariate marginals. However, existing structure learning algorithms for PCs often generate tree-structured circuits or use tree-structured circuits as intermediate steps to compress them into DAG-structured circuits. This leads to the intriguing question of whether there exists an exponential gap between DAGs and trees for the PC structure. In this paper, we provide a negative answer to this conjecture by proving that, for $n$ variables, there exists a sub-exponential upper bound $n^{O(\log n)}$ on the size of an equivalent tree computing the same probability distribution. On the other hand, we also show that given a depth restriction on the tree, there is a super-polynomial separation between tree and DAG-structured PCs. Our work takes an important step towards understanding the expressive power of tree-structured PCs, and our techniques may be of independent interest in the study of structure learning algorithms for PCs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Helena L\"ofstr\"om, Tuwe L\"ofstr\"om, Johan Hallberg Szabadvary</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses a significant gap in explainable AI: the necessity of interpreting epistemic uncertainty in model explanations. Although current methods mainly focus on explaining predictions, with some including uncertainty, they fail to provide guidance on how to reduce the inherent uncertainty in these predictions. To overcome this challenge, we introduce new types of explanations that specifically target epistemic uncertainty. These include ensured explanations, which highlight feature modifications that can reduce uncertainty, and categorisation of uncertain explanations counter-potential, semi-potential, and super-potential which explore alternative scenarios. Our work emphasises that epistemic uncertainty adds a crucial dimension to explanation quality, demanding evaluation based not only on prediction probability but also on uncertainty reduction. We introduce a new metric, ensured ranking, designed to help users identify the most reliable explanations by balancing trade-offs between uncertainty, probability, and competing alternative explanations. Furthermore, we extend the Calibrated Explanations method, incorporating tools that visualise how changes in feature values impact epistemic uncertainty. This enhancement provides deeper insights into model behaviour, promoting increased interpretability and appropriate trust in scenarios involving uncertain predictions.</p>

We address this limitation by introducing Residual KAN, which incorporates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) within the CNN framework as a residual component. Our approach uses Chebyshev polynomials as the basis for KAN convolutions that enables more expressive and adaptive feature representations while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed RKAN blocks, when integrated into established architectures such as ResNet and DenseNet, offer consistent improvements over the baseline models on various well-known benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the potential of RKAN to enhance the capabilities of deep CNNs in visual data.</p>

<p>Abstract: When acting as a privacy-enhancing technology, synthetic data generation (SDG) aims to maintain a resemblance to the real data while excluding personally-identifiable information. Many SDG algorithms provide robust differential privacy (DP) guarantees to this end. However, we show that the strongest class of SDG algorithms--those that preserve \textit{marginal probabilities}, or similar statistics, from the underlying data--leak information about individuals that can be recovered more efficiently than previously understood. We demonstrate this by presenting a novel membership inference attack, MAMA-MIA, and evaluate it against three seminal DP SDG algorithms: MST, PrivBayes, and Private-GSD. MAMA-MIA leverages knowledge of which SDG algorithm was used, allowing it to learn information about the hidden data more accurately, and orders-of-magnitude faster, than other leading attacks. We use MAMA-MIA to lend insight into existing SDG vulnerabilities. Our approach went on to win the first SNAKE (SaNitization Algorithm under attacK ... $\varepsilon$) competition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Moorthy, Volkan Isler</p>
<p>Abstract: The capability to learn latent representations plays a key role in the effectiveness of recent machine learning methods. An active frontier in representation learning is understanding representations for combinatorial structures which may not admit well-behaved local neighborhoods or distance functions. For example, for polygons, slightly perturbing vertex locations might lead to significant changes in their combinatorial structure and may even lead to invalid polygons. In this paper, we investigate representations to capture the underlying combinatorial structures of polygons. Specifically, we study the open problem of Visibility Reconstruction: Given a visibility graph G, construct a polygon P whose visibility graph is G.
  We introduce VisDiff, a novel diffusion-based approach to reconstruct a polygon from its given visibility graph G. Our method first estimates the signed distance function (SDF) of P from G. Afterwards, it extracts ordered vertex locations that have the pairwise visibility relationship given by the edges of G. Our main insight is that going through the SDF significantly improves learning for reconstruction. In order to train VisDiff, we make two main contributions: (1) We design novel loss components for computing the visibility in a differentiable manner and (2) create a carefully curated dataset. We use this dataset to benchmark our method and achieve 21% improvement in F1-Score over standard methods. We also demonstrate effective generalization to out-of-distribution polygon types and show that learning a generative model allows us to sample the set of polygons with a given visibility graph. Finally, we extend our method to the related combinatorial problem of reconstruction from a triangulation. We achieve 95% classification accuracy of triangulation edges and a 4% improvement in Chamfer distance compared to current architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Lin, Ce Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical information design models (e.g., Bayesian persuasion and cheap talk) require players to have perfect knowledge of the prior distribution of the state of the world. Our paper studies repeated persuasion problems in which the information designer does not know the prior. The information designer learns to design signaling schemes from repeated interactions with the receiver. We design learning algorithms for the information designer to achieve no regret compared to using the optimal signaling scheme with known prior, under two models of the receiver's decision-making. (1) The first model assumes that the receiver knows the prior and can perform posterior update and best respond to signals. In this model, we design a learning algorithm for the information designer with $O(\log T)$ regret in the general case, and another algorithm with $\Theta(\log \log T)$ regret in the case where the receiver has only two actions. (2) The second model assumes that the receiver does not know the prior and employs a no-regret learning algorithm to take actions. We show that the information designer can achieve regret $O(\sqrt{\mathrm{rReg}(T) T})$, where $\mathrm{rReg}(T)=o(T)$ is an upper bound on the receiver's learning regret. Our work thus provides a learning foundation for the problem of information design with unknown prior.</p>

<p>Abstract: Coding theory plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and reliability across various domains, from communication to computation and storage systems. However, its reliance on trust assumptions for data recovery poses significant challenges, particularly in emerging decentralized systems where trust is scarce. To address this, the game of coding framework was introduced, offering insights into strategies for data recovery within incentive-oriented environments. The focus of the earliest version of the game of coding was limited to scenarios involving only two nodes. This paper investigates the implications of increasing the number of nodes in the game of coding framework, particularly focusing on scenarios with one honest node and multiple adversarial nodes. We demonstrate that despite the increased flexibility for the adversary with an increasing number of adversarial nodes, having more power is not beneficial for the adversary and is not detrimental to the data collector, making this scheme sybil-resistant. Furthermore, we outline optimal strategies for the data collector in terms of accepting or rejecting the inputs, and characterize the optimal noise distribution for the adversary.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given n experiment subjects with potentially heterogeneous covariates and two possible treatments, namely active treatment and control, this paper addresses the fundamental question of determining the optimal accuracy in estimating the treatment effect. Furthermore, we propose an experimental design that approaches this optimal accuracy, giving a (non-asymptotic) answer to this fundamental yet still open question. The methodological contribution is listed as following. First, we establish an idealized optimal estimator with minimal variance as benchmark, and then demonstrate that adaptive experiment is necessary to achieve near-optimal estimation accuracy. Secondly, by incorporating the concept of doubly robust method into sequential experimental design, we frame the optimal estimation problem as an online bandit learning problem, bridging the two fields of statistical estimation and bandit learning. Using tools and ideas from both bandit algorithm design and adaptive statistical estimation, we propose a general low switching adaptive experiment framework, which could be a generic research paradigm for a wide range of adaptive experimental design. Through information-theoretic lower bound combined with Bayes risk analysis, we demonstrate the optimality of our proposed experiment. Numerical result indicates that the estimation accuracy approaches optimal with as few as two or three policy updates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Being prompted to engage in reasoning has emerged as a core technique for using large language models (LLMs), deploying additional inference-time compute to improve task performance. However, as LLMs increase in both size and adoption, inference costs are correspondingly becoming increasingly burdensome. How, then, might we optimize reasoning's cost-performance tradeoff? This work introduces a novel approach based on computational models of metareasoning used in cognitive science, training LLMs to selectively use intermediate reasoning steps only when necessary. We first develop a reward function that incorporates the Value of Computation by penalizing unnecessary reasoning, then use this reward function with Expert Iteration to train the LLM. Compared to few-shot chain-of-thought prompting and STaR, our method significantly reduces inference costs (20-37\% fewer tokens generated across three models) while maintaining task performance across diverse datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Zhu, Dmitriy Bespalov, Liwen You, Ninad Kulkarni, Yanjun Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Toxicity text detectors can be vulnerable to adversarial examples - small perturbations to input text that fool the systems into wrong detection. Existing attack algorithms are time-consuming and often produce invalid or ambiguous adversarial examples, making them less useful for evaluating or improving real-world toxicity content moderators. This paper proposes an annotation pipeline for quality control of generated toxic adversarial examples (TAE). We design model-based automated annotation and human-based quality verification to assess the quality requirements of TAE. Successful TAE should fool a target toxicity model into making benign predictions, be grammatically reasonable, appear natural like human-generated text, and exhibit semantic toxicity. When applying these requirements to more than 20 state-of-the-art (SOTA) TAE attack recipes, we find many invalid samples from a total of 940k raw TAE attack generations. We then utilize the proposed pipeline to filter and curate a high-quality TAE dataset we call TaeBench (of size 264k). Empirically, we demonstrate that TaeBench can effectively transfer-attack SOTA toxicity content moderation models and services.

<p><b>Authors:</b> F{\i}rat \"Oncel, Matthias Bethge, Beyza Ermis, Mirco Ravanelli, Cem Subakan, \c{C}a\u{g}atay Y{\i}ld{\i}z</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last decade, the generalization and adaptation abilities of deep learning models were typically evaluated on fixed training and test distributions. Contrary to traditional deep learning, large language models (LLMs) are (i) even more overparameterized, (ii) trained on unlabeled text corpora curated from the Internet with minimal human intervention, and (iii) trained in an online fashion. These stark contrasts prevent researchers from transferring lessons learned on model generalization and adaptation in deep learning contexts to LLMs. To this end, our short paper introduces empirical observations that aim to shed light on further training of already pretrained language models. Specifically, we demonstrate that training a model on a text domain could degrade its perplexity on the test portion of the same domain. We observe with our subsequent analysis that the performance degradation is positively correlated with the similarity between the additional and the original pretraining dataset of the LLM. Our further token-level perplexity observations reveals that the perplexity degradation is due to a handful of tokens that are not informative about the domain. We hope these findings will guide us in determining when to adapt a model vs when to rely on its foundational capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilin Xiao, Hongming Zhang, Tao Ge, Siru Ouyang, Vicente Ordonez, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding has proven to be an efficient solution to large language model (LLM) inference, where the small drafter predicts future tokens at a low cost, and the target model is leveraged to verify them in parallel. However, most existing works still draft tokens auto-regressively to maintain sequential dependency in language modeling, which we consider a huge computational burden in speculative decoding. We present ParallelSpec, an alternative to auto-regressive drafting strategies in state-of-the-art speculative decoding approaches. In contrast to auto-regressive drafting in the speculative stage, we train a parallel drafter to serve as an efficient speculative model. ParallelSpec learns to efficiently predict multiple future tokens in parallel using a single model, and it can be integrated into any speculative decoding framework that requires aligning the output distributions of the drafter and the target model with minimal training cost. Experimental results show that ParallelSpec accelerates baseline methods in latency up to 62% on text generation benchmarks from different domains, and it achieves 2.84X overall speedup on the Llama-2-13B model using third-party evaluation criteria.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Pattie, Arvind Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision trees are powerful for predictive modeling but often suffer from high variance when modeling continuous relationships. While algorithms like Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) excel at capturing such continuous relationships, they perform poorly when modeling discontinuities. To address the limitations of both approaches, we introduce Spline-based Multivariate Adaptive Regression Trees (SMART), which uses a decision tree to identify subsets of data with distinct continuous relationships and then leverages MARS to fit these relationships independently. Unlike other methods that rely on the tree structure to model interaction and higher-order terms, SMART leverages MARS's native ability to handle these terms, allowing the tree to focus solely on identifying discontinuities in the relationship. We test SMART on various datasets, demonstrating its improvement over state-of-the-art methods in such cases. Additionally, we provide an open-source implementation of our method to be used by practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byoungwoo Park, Hyungi Lee, Juho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as healthcare, climate, and economics, are often collected as irregular time series, which poses challenges for accurate modeling. In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM employs amortized inference to decouple representation learning from the latent dynamics. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Rajib Khan Musa, Yichen Qian, Jie Peng, David Cereceda</p>
<p>Abstract: Finding Minimum Energy Configurations (MECs) is essential in fields such as physics, chemistry, and materials science, as they represent the most stable states of the systems. In particular, identifying such MECs in multi-component alloys considered candidate PFMs is key because it determines the most stable arrangement of atoms within the alloy, directly influencing its phase stability, structural integrity, and thermo-mechanical properties. However, since the search space grows exponentially with the number of atoms considered, obtaining such MECs using computationally expensive first-principles DFT calculations often results in a cumbersome task. To escape the above compromise between physical fidelity and computational efficiency, we have developed a novel physics-based data-driven approach that combines Monte Carlo sampling, first-principles DFT calculations, and Machine Learning to accelerate the discovery of MECs in multi-component alloys. More specifically, we have leveraged well-established Cluster Expansion (CE) techniques with Local Outlier Factor models to establish strategies that enhance the reliability of the CE method. In this work, we demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed approach for the particular case of a tungsten-based quaternary high-entropy alloy. However, the method is applicable to other types of alloys and enables a wide range of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyi Mai, Zhenyu Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: The assumption of Gaussian or Gaussian mixture data has been extensively exploited in a long series of precise performance analyses of machine learning (ML) methods, on large datasets having comparably numerous samples and features. To relax this restrictive assumption, subsequent efforts have been devoted to establish "Gaussian equivalent principles" by studying scenarios of Gaussian universality where the asymptotic performance of ML methods on non-Gaussian data remains unchanged when replaced with Gaussian data having the same mean and covariance. Beyond the realm of Gaussian universality, there are few exact results on how the data distribution affects the learning performance.
  In this article, we provide a precise high-dimensional characterization of empirical risk minimization, for classification under a general mixture data setting of linear factor models that extends Gaussian mixtures. The Gaussian universality is shown to break down under this setting, in the sense that the asymptotic learning performance depends on the data distribution beyond the class means and covariances. To clarify the limitations of Gaussian universality in classification of mixture data and to understand the impact of its breakdown, we specify conditions for Gaussian universality and discuss their implications for the choice of loss function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yice Cao, Chenchen Liu, Zhenhua Wu, Wenxin Yao, Liu Xiong, Jie Chen, Zhixiang Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: As remote sensing imaging technology continues to advance and evolve, processing high-resolution and diversified satellite imagery to improve segmentation accuracy and enhance interpretation efficiency emerg as a pivotal area of investigation within the realm of remote sensing. Although segmentation algorithms based on CNNs and Transformers achieve significant progress in performance, balancing segmentation accuracy and computational complexity remains challenging, limiting their wide application in practical tasks. To address this, this paper introduces state space model (SSM) and proposes a novel hybrid semantic segmentation network based on vision Mamba (CVMH-UNet). This method designs a cross-scanning visual state space block (CVSSBlock) that uses cross 2D scanning (CS2D) to fully capture global information from multiple directions, while by incorporating convolutional neural network branches to overcome the constraints of Vision Mamba (VMamba) in acquiring local information, this approach facilitates a comprehensive analysis of both global and local features. Furthermore, to address the issue of limited discriminative power and the difficulty in achieving detailed fusion with direct skip connections, a multi-frequency multi-scale feature fusion block (MFMSBlock) is designed. This module introduces multi-frequency information through 2D discrete cosine transform (2D DCT) to enhance information utilization and provides additional scale local detail information through point-wise convolution branches. Finally, it aggregates multi-scale information along the channel dimension, achieving refined feature fusion. Findings from experiments conducted on renowned datasets of remote sensing imagery demonstrate that proposed CVMH-UNet achieves superior segmentation performance while maintaining low computational complexity, outperforming surpassing current leading-edge segmentation algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guhan Chen, Yicheng Li, Qian Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims to discuss the impact of random initialization of neural networks in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory, which is ignored by most recent works in the NTK theory. It is well known that as the network's width tends to infinity, the neural network with random initialization converges to a Gaussian process $f^{\mathrm{GP}}$, which takes values in $L^{2}(\mathcal{X})$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is the domain of the data. In contrast, to adopt the traditional theory of kernel regression, most recent works introduced a special mirrored architecture and a mirrored (random) initialization to ensure the network's output is identically zero at initialization. Therefore, it remains a question whether the conventional setting and mirrored initialization would make wide neural networks exhibit different generalization capabilities. In this paper, we first show that the training dynamics of the gradient flow of neural networks with random initialization converge uniformly to that of the corresponding NTK regression with random initialization $f^{\mathrm{GP}}$. We then show that $\mathbf{P}(f^{\mathrm{GP}} \in [\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{NT}}]^{s}) = 1$ for any $s < \frac{3}{d+1}$ and $\mathbf{P}(f^{\mathrm{GP}} \in [\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{NT}}]^{s}) = 0$ for any $s \geq \frac{3}{d+1}$, where $[\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{NT}}]^{s}$ is the real interpolation space of the RKHS $\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{NT}}$ associated with the NTK. Consequently, the generalization error of the wide neural network trained by gradient descent is $\Omega(n^{-\frac{3}{d+3}})$, and it still suffers from the curse of dimensionality. On one hand, the result highlights the benefits of mirror initialization. On the other hand, it implies that NTK theory may not fully explain the superior performance of neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyuan Chang, Yue Du, Guanglin Huang, Qiwei Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the identification and the estimation for matrix time series CP-factor models. Unlike the generalized eigenanalysis-based method of Chang et al. (2023) which requires the two factor loading matrices to be full-ranked, the newly proposed estimation can handle rank-deficient factor loading matrices. The estimation procedure consists of the spectral decomposition of several matrices and a matrix joint diagonalization algorithm, resulting in low computational cost. The theoretical guarantee established without the stationarity assumption shows that the proposed estimation exhibits a faster convergence rate than that of Chang et al. (2023). In fact the new estimator is free from the adverse impact of any eigen-gaps, unlike most eigenanalysis-based methods such as that of Chang et al. (2023). Furthermore, in terms of the error rates of the estimation, the proposed procedure is equivalent to handling a vector time series of dimension $\max(p,q)$ instead of $p \times q$, where $(p, q)$ are the dimensions of the matrix time series concerned. We have achieved this without assuming the "near orthogonality" of the loadings under various incoherence conditions often imposed in the CP-decomposition literature, see Han and Zhang (2022), Han et al. (2024) and the references within. Illustration with both simulated and real matrix time series data shows the usefulness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Serin Yang, Taesung Kwon, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation, especially in terms of keyframe interpolation. However, current image-to-video diffusion models, while powerful in generating videos from a single conditioning frame, need adaptation for two-frame (start & end) conditioned generation, which is essential for effective bounded interpolation. Unfortunately, existing approaches that fuse temporally forward and backward paths in parallel often suffer from off-manifold issues, leading to artifacts or requiring multiple iterative re-noising steps. In this work, we introduce a novel, bidirectional sampling strategy to address these off-manifold issues without requiring extensive re-noising or fine-tuning. Our method employs sequential sampling along both forward and backward paths, conditioned on the start and end frames, respectively, ensuring more coherent and on-manifold generation of intermediate frames. Additionally, we incorporate advanced guidance techniques, CFG++ and DDS, to further enhance the interpolation process. By integrating these, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently generating high-quality, smooth videos between keyframes. On a single 3090 GPU, our method can interpolate 25 frames at 1024 x 576 resolution in just 195 seconds, establishing it as a leading solution for keyframe interpolation.</p>

<p>Abstract: As text-to-image diffusion models become advanced enough for commercial applications, there is also increasing concern about their potential for malicious and harmful use. Model unlearning has been proposed to mitigate the concerns by removing undesired and potentially harmful information from the pre-trained model. So far, the success of unlearning is mainly measured by whether the unlearned model can generate a target concept while maintaining image quality. However, unlearning is typically tested under limited scenarios, and the side effects of unlearning have barely been studied in the current literature. In this work, we thoroughly analyze unlearning under various scenarios with five key aspects. Our investigation reveals that every method has side effects or limitations, especially in more complex and realistic situations. By releasing our comprehensive evaluation framework with the source codes and artifacts, we hope to inspire further research in this area, leading to more reliable and effective unlearning methods.</p>

We establish a sample complexity bound that matches the i.i.d. parametric rate up to logarithmic factors for a broad class of systems, extending previous works that considered only first-order dependencies. Our findings reveal a learning-without-mixing phenomenon, indicating that learning long-context linear autoregressive models is not hindered by slow mixing properties potentially associated with extended context windows. Additionally, we extend these results to (i) shared low-rank representations, where rank-regularized estimators improve rates with respect to dimensionality, and (ii) misspecified context lengths in strictly stable systems, where shorter contexts offer statistical advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhou Gu, Nikki Lijing Kuang, Yi-An Ma, Zhao Song, Lichen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a $d$-dimensional log-concave distribution $\pi(\theta) \propto \exp(-f(\theta))$ for $L$-Lipschitz $f$, constrained to a convex body with an efficiently computable self-concordant barrier function, contained in a ball of radius $R$ with a $w$-warm start.
  We propose a \emph{robust} sampling framework that computes spectral approximations to the Hessian of the barrier functions in each iteration. We prove that for polytopes that are described by $n$ hyperplanes, sampling with the Lee-Sidford barrier function mixes within $\widetilde O((d^2+dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps with a per step cost of $\widetilde O(nd^{\omega-1})$, where $\omega\approx 2.37$ is the fast matrix multiplication exponent. Compared to the prior work of Mangoubi and Vishnoi, our approach gives faster mixing time as we are able to design a generalized soft-threshold Dikin walk beyond log-barrier.
  We further extend our result to show how to sample from a $d$-dimensional spectrahedron, the constrained set of a semidefinite program, specified by the set $\{x\in \mathbb{R}^d: \sum_{i=1}^d x_i A_i \succeq C \}$ where $A_1,\ldots,A_d, C$ are $n\times n$ real symmetric matrices. We design a walk that mixes in $\widetilde O((nd+dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps with a per iteration cost of $\widetilde O(n^\omega+n^2d^{3\omega-5})$. We improve the mixing time bound of prior best Dikin walk due to Narayanan and Rakhlin that mixes in $\widetilde O((n^2d^3+n^2dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on video-and-language tasks, such as video question answering. However, most existing Video LLMs neglect temporal information in video data, leading to struggles with temporal-aware video understanding. To address this gap, we propose a Time Gating Video LLM (TG-Vid) designed to enhance temporal modeling through a novel Time Gating module (TG). The TG module employs a time gating mechanism on its sub-modules, comprising gating spatial attention, gating temporal attention, and gating MLP. This architecture enables our model to achieve a robust understanding of temporal information within videos. Extensive evaluation of temporal-sensitive video benchmarks (i.e., MVBench, TempCompass, and NExT-QA) demonstrates that our TG-Vid model significantly outperforms the existing Video LLMs. Further, comprehensive ablation studies validate that the performance gains are attributed to the designs of our TG module.

To overcome this, we introduce AutoFusion, an innovative framework that fuses distinct model parameters(with the same architecture) for multi-task learning without pre-trained checkpoints. Using an unsupervised, end-to-end approach, AutoFusion dynamically permutes model parameters at each layer, optimizing the combination through a loss-minimization process that does not require labeled data. We validate AutoFusion's effectiveness through experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance over established methods like Weight Interpolation, Git Re-Basin, and ZipIt. Our framework offers a scalable and flexible solution for model integration, positioning it as a powerful tool for future research and practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenyon Ng, Susan Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational inference in Bayesian deep learning often involves computing the gradient of an expectation that lacks a closed-form solution. In these cases, pathwise and score-function gradient estimators are the most common approaches. The pathwise estimator is often favoured for its substantially lower variance compared to the score-function estimator, which typically requires variance reduction techniques. However, recent research suggests that even pathwise gradient estimators could benefit from variance reduction. In this work, we review existing control-variates-based variance reduction methods for pathwise gradient estimators to assess their effectiveness. Notably, these methods often rely on integrand approximations and are applicable only to simple variational families. To address this limitation, we propose applying zero-variance control variates to pathwise gradient estimators. This approach offers the advantage of requiring minimal assumptions about the variational distribution, other than being able to sample from it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenyon Ng, Chris van der Heide, Liam Hodgkinson, Susan Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The Cold Posterior Effect (CPE) is a phenomenon in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL), where tempering the posterior to a cold temperature often improves the predictive performance of the posterior predictive distribution (PPD). Although the term `CPE' suggests colder temperatures are inherently better, the BDL community increasingly recognizes that this is not always the case. Despite this, there remains no systematic method for finding the optimal temperature beyond grid search. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach to select the temperature that maximizes test log-predictive density, treating the temperature as a model parameter and estimating it directly from the data. We empirically demonstrate that our method performs comparably to grid search, at a fraction of the cost, across both regression and classification tasks. Finally, we highlight the differing perspectives on CPE between the BDL and Generalized Bayes communities: while the former primarily focuses on predictive performance of the PPD, the latter emphasizes calibrated uncertainty and robustness to model misspecification; these distinct objectives lead to different temperature preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-Hung Yeh, Kuang-Huei Lee, Jun-Cheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with user preferences has been a key challenge. Existing methods for aligning diffusion models either require retraining or are limited to differentiable reward functions. To address these limitations, we propose a stochastic optimization approach, dubbed Demon, to guide the denoising process at inference time without backpropagation through reward functions or model retraining. Our approach works by controlling noise distribution in denoising steps to concentrate density on regions corresponding to high rewards through stochastic optimization. We provide comprehensive theoretical and empirical evidence to support and validate our approach, including experiments that use non-differentiable sources of rewards such as Visual-Language Model (VLM) APIs and human judgements. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first inference-time, backpropagation-free preference alignment method for diffusion models. Our method can be easily integrated with existing diffusion models without further training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Lizzio Bosco, Beatrice Portelli, Giuseppe Serra</p>
<p>Abstract: Image processing is one of the most promising applications for quantum machine learning (QML). Quanvolutional Neural Networks with non-trainable parameters are the preferred solution to run on current and near future quantum devices. The typical input preprocessing pipeline for quanvolutional layers comprises of four steps: optional input binary quantization, encoding classical data into quantum states, processing the data to obtain the final quantum states, decoding quantum states back to classical outputs. In this paper we propose two ways to enhance the efficiency of quanvolutional models. First, we propose a flexible data quantization approach with memoization, applicable to any encoding method. This allows us to increase the number of quantization levels to retain more information or lower them to reduce the amount of circuit executions. Second, we introduce a new integrated encoding strategy, which combines the encoding and processing steps in a single circuit. This method allows great flexibility on several architectural parameters (e.g., number of qubits, filter size, and circuit depth) making them adjustable to quantum hardware requirements. We compare our proposed integrated model with a classical convolutional neural network and the well-known rotational encoding method, on two different classification tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed model encoding exhibits a comparable or superior performance to the other models while requiring fewer quantum resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Sakunkoo, Annabella Sakunkoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Songs have been found to profoundly impact human emotions, with lyrics having significant power to stimulate emotional changes in the audience. There is a scarcity of large, high quality in-domain datasets for lyrics-based song emotion classification (Edmonds and Sedoc, 2021; Zhou, 2022). It has been noted that in-domain training datasets are often difficult to acquire (Zhang and Miao, 2023) and that label acquisition is often limited by cost, time, and other factors (Azad et al., 2018). We examine the novel usage of a large out-of-domain dataset as a creative solution to the challenge of training data scarcity in the emotional classification of song lyrics. We find that CNN models trained on a large Reddit comments dataset achieve satisfactory performance and generalizability to lyrical emotion classification, thus giving insights into and a promising possibility in leveraging large, publicly available out-of-domain datasets for domains whose in-domain data are lacking or costly to acquire.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renat Sergazinov, Elizabeth Chun, Valeriya Rogovchenko, Nathaniel Fernandes, Nicholas Kasman, Irina Gaynanova</p>
<p>Abstract: The rising rates of diabetes necessitate innovative methods for its management. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are small medical devices that measure blood glucose levels at regular intervals providing insights into daily patterns of glucose variation. Forecasting of glucose trajectories based on CGM data holds the potential to substantially improve diabetes management, by both refining artificial pancreas systems and enabling individuals to make adjustments based on predictions to maintain optimal glycemic range.Despite numerous methods proposed for CGM-based glucose trajectory prediction, these methods are typically evaluated on small, private datasets, impeding reproducibility, further research, and practical adoption. The absence of standardized prediction tasks and systematic comparisons between methods has led to uncoordinated research efforts, obstructing the identification of optimal tools for tackling specific challenges. As a result, only a limited number of prediction methods have been implemented in clinical practice.
  To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive resource that provides (1) a consolidated repository of curated publicly available CGM datasets to foster reproducibility and accessibility; (2) a standardized task list to unify research objectives and facilitate coordinated efforts; (3) a set of benchmark models with established baseline performance, enabling the research community to objectively gauge new methods' efficacy; and (4) a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors for model development. We anticipate these resources to propel collaborative research endeavors in the critical domain of CGM-based glucose predictions. {Our code is available online at github.com/IrinaStatsLab/GlucoBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Yuan, Guohao Cai, Zhenhua Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task ranking models have become essential for modern real-world recommendation systems. While most recommendation researches focus on designing sophisticated models for specific scenarios, achieving performance improvement for multi-task ranking models across various scenarios still remains a significant challenge. Training all tasks naively can result in inconsistent learning, highlighting the need for the development of multi-task optimization (MTO) methods to tackle this challenge. Conventional methods assume that the optimal joint gradient on shared parameters leads to optimal parameter updates. However, the actual update on model parameters may deviates significantly from gradients when using momentum based optimizers such as Adam, and we design and execute statistical experiments to support the observation. In this paper, we propose a novel Parameter Update Balancing algorithm for multi-task optimization, denoted as PUB. In contrast to traditional MTO method which are based on gradient level tasks fusion or loss level tasks fusion, PUB is the first work to optimize multiple tasks through parameter update balancing. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark multi-task ranking datasets demonstrate that PUB consistently improves several multi-task backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, experiments on benchmark computer vision datasets show the great potential of PUB in various multi-task learning scenarios. Furthermore, we deployed our method for an industrial evaluation on the real-world commercial platform, HUAWEI AppGallery, where PUB significantly enhances the online multi-task ranking model, efficiently managing the primary traffic of a crucial channel.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Gottard, Vanessa Verrina, Sabrina Giordano</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era where artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms increasingly impact human life, it is crucial to develop models that account for potential discrimination in their predictions. This paper tackles this problem by introducing a new classification tree algorithm using a novel splitting criterion that incorporates fairness adjustments into the tree-building process. The proposed method integrates a fairness-aware impurity measure that balances predictive accuracy with fairness across protected groups. By ensuring that each splitting node considers both the gain in classification error and the fairness, our algorithm encourages splits that mitigate discrimination. Importantly, in penalizing unfair splits, we account for the uncertainty in the fairness metric by utilizing its confidence interval instead of relying on its point estimate. Experimental results on benchmark and synthetic datasets illustrate that our method effectively reduces discriminatory predictions compared to traditional classification trees, without significant loss in overall accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyao Yu, Yixiang Qiu, Hao Fang, Bin Chen, Sijin Yu, Bin Wang, Shu-Tao Xia, Ke Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model Inversion Attacks (MIAs) aim at recovering privacy-sensitive training data from the knowledge encoded in the released machine learning models. Recent advances in the MIA field have significantly enhanced the attack performance under multiple scenarios, posing serious privacy risks of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, the development of defense strategies against MIAs is relatively backward to resist the latest MIAs and existing defenses fail to achieve further trade-off between model utility and model robustness. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis from the perspective of intrinsic vulnerabilities of MIAs, comprehensively uncovering the weaknesses inherent in the basic pipeline, which are partially investigated in the previous defenses. Building upon these new insights, we propose a robust defense mechanism, integrating Confidence Adaptation and Low-Rank compression(CALoR). Our method includes a novel robustness-enhanced classification loss specially-designed for model inversion defenses and reveals the extraordinary effectiveness of compressing the classification header. With CALoR, we can mislead the optimization objective, reduce the leaked information and impede the backpropagation of MIAs, thus mitigating the risk of privacy leakage. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense performance against MIAs and exhibits superior generalization to existing defenses across various scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study EgalMAB, an egalitarian assignment problem in the context of stochastic multi-armed bandits. In EgalMAB, an agent is tasked with assigning a set of users to arms. At each time step, the agent must assign exactly one arm to each user such that no two users are assigned to the same arm. Subsequently, each user obtains a reward drawn from the unknown reward distribution associated with its assigned arm. The agent's objective is to maximize the minimum expected cumulative reward among all users over a fixed horizon. This problem has applications in areas such as fairness in job and resource allocations, among others. We design and analyze a UCB-based policy EgalUCB and establish upper bounds on the cumulative regret. In complement, we establish an almost-matching policy-independent impossibility result.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxiong Tong, Mingjia Yin, Hao Wang, Qiushi Pan, Defu Lian, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-domain Recommendation systems leverage multi-domain user interactions to improve performance, especially in sparse data or new user scenarios. However, CDR faces challenges such as effectively capturing user preferences and avoiding negative transfer. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-view Disentangled and Adaptive Preference Learning (MDAP) framework. Our MDAP framework uses a multiview encoder to capture diverse user preferences. The framework includes a gated decoder that adaptively combines embeddings from different views to generate a comprehensive user representation. By disentangling representations and allowing adaptive feature selection, our model enhances adaptability and effectiveness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CDR and single-domain models, providing more accurate recommendations and deeper insights into user behavior across different domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michel Pohl, Mitsuru Uesaka, Hiroyuki Takahashi, Kazuyuki Demachi, Ritu Bhusal Chhatkuli</p>
<p>Abstract: Lung radiotherapy treatment systems are subject to a latency that leads to uncertainty in the estimated tumor location and high irradiation of healthy tissue. This work addresses future frame prediction in chest dynamic MRI sequences to compensate for that delay using RNNs trained with online learning algorithms. The latter enable networks to mitigate irregular movements, as they update synaptic weights with each new training example. Experiments were conducted using four publicly available 2D thoracic cine-MRI sequences. PCA decomposes the time-varying deformation vector field (DVF), computed with the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm, into static deformation fields and low-dimensional time-dependent weights. We compare various algorithms to forecast the latter: linear regression, least mean squares (LMS), and RNNs trained with real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), unbiased online recurrent optimization, decoupled neural interfaces and sparse 1-step approximation (SnAp-1). That enables estimating the future DVFs and, in turn, the next frames by warping the initial image. Linear regression led to the lowest mean DVF error at a horizon h = 0.32s (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made), equal to 1.30mm, followed by SnAp-1 and RTRL, whose error increased from 1.37mm to 1.44mm as h increased from 0.62s to 2.20s. Similarly, the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of LMS decreased from 0.904 to 0.898 as h increased from 0.31s to 1.57s and was the highest among the algorithms compared for the latter horizons. SnAp-1 attained the highest SSIM for h $\geq$ 1.88s, with values of less than 0.898. The predicted images look similar to the original ones, and the highest errors occurred at challenging areas such as the diaphragm boundary at the end-of-inhale phase, where motion variability is more prominent, and regions where out-of-plane motion was more prevalent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enrico Ventura, Beatrice Achilli, Gianluigi Silvestri, Carlo Lucibello, Luca Ambrogioni</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the latent geometry of generative diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis. To this purpose, we analyze the spectrum of eigenvalues (and singular values) of the Jacobian of the score function, whose discontinuities (gaps) reveal the presence and dimensionality of distinct sub-manifolds. Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral distributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional assumptions and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra estimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three distinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a manifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution internal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes orthogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of the data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an elegant explanation on why generative diffusion models are not affected by the manifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the internal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time points during generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Jin, Zhicheng Sun, Ningyuan Li, Kun Xu, Kun Xu, Hao Jiang, Nan Zhuang, Quzhe Huang, Yang Song, Yadong Mu, Zhouchen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Video generation requires modeling a vast spatiotemporal space, which demands significant computational resources and data usage. To reduce the complexity, the prevailing approaches employ a cascaded architecture to avoid direct training with full resolution. Despite reducing computational demands, the separate optimization of each sub-stage hinders knowledge sharing and sacrifices flexibility. This work introduces a unified pyramidal flow matching algorithm. It reinterprets the original denoising trajectory as a series of pyramid stages, where only the final stage operates at the full resolution, thereby enabling more efficient video generative modeling. Through our sophisticated design, the flows of different pyramid stages can be interlinked to maintain continuity. Moreover, we craft autoregressive video generation with a temporal pyramid to compress the full-resolution history. The entire framework can be optimized in an end-to-end manner and with a single unified Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method supports generating high-quality 5-second (up to 10-second) videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS within 20.7k A100 GPU training hours.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Jin, Jinsung Yoon, Jiawei Han, Sercan O. Arik</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) empowers large language models (LLMs) to utilize external knowledge sources. The increasing capacity of LLMs to process longer input sequences opens up avenues for providing more retrieved information, to potentially enhance the quality of generated outputs. It is plausible to assume that a larger retrieval set would contain more relevant information (higher recall), that might result in improved performance. However, our empirical findings demonstrate that for many long-context LLMs, the quality of generated output initially improves first, but then subsequently declines as the number of retrieved passages increases. This paper investigates this phenomenon, identifying the detrimental impact of retrieved "hard negatives" as a key contributor. To mitigate this and enhance the robustness of long-context LLM-based RAG, we propose both training-free and training-based approaches. We first showcase the effectiveness of retrieval reordering as a simple yet powerful training-free optimization. Furthermore, we explore training-based methods, specifically RAG-specific implicit LLM fine-tuning and RAG-oriented fine-tuning with intermediate reasoning, demonstrating their capacity for substantial performance gains. Finally, we conduct a systematic analysis of design choices for these training-based methods, including data distribution, retriever selection, and training context length.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Malard, Michel Olvera, St\'ephane Lathuiliere, Slim Essid</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models have fueled progress in image captioning. These models, fine-tuned on vast image datasets, exhibit a deep understanding of semantic concepts. In this work, we show that this ability can be re-purposed for audio captioning, where the joint image-language decoder can be leveraged to describe auditory content associated with image sequences within videos featuring audiovisual content. This can be achieved via multimodal alignment. Yet, this multimodal alignment task is non-trivial due to the inherent disparity between audible and visible elements in real-world videos. Moreover, multimodal representation learning often relies on contrastive learning, facing the challenge of the so-called modality gap which hinders smooth integration between modalities. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology for bridging the audiovisual modality gap by matching the distributions of tokens produced by an audio backbone and those of an image captioner. Our approach aligns the audio token distribution with that of the image tokens, enabling the model to perform zero-shot audio captioning in an unsupervised fashion while keeping the initial image captioning component unaltered. This alignment allows for the use of either audio or audiovisual input by combining or substituting the image encoder with the aligned audio encoder. Our method achieves significantly improved performances in zero-shot audio captioning, compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAM) have been successfully applied to high dimensional data analysis. However, most existing methods cannot simultaneously estimate the link function, the component functions and the variable interaction. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new sparse additive model, named generalized sparse additive model with unknown link function (GSAMUL), in which the component functions are estimated by B-spline basis and the unknown link function is estimated by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network. Furthermore, $\ell_{2,1}$-norm regularizer is used for variable selection. The proposed GSAMUL can realize both variable selection and hidden interaction. We integrate this estimation into a bilevel optimization problem, where the data is split into training set and validation set. In theory, we provide the guarantees about the convergence of the approximate procedure. In applications, experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real world data sets consistently validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many recent developments for robots to represent environments have focused on photorealistic reconstructions. This paper particularly focuses on generating sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent state-of-the-art neural audio compression models have progressively adopted residual vector quantization (RVQ). Despite this success, these models employ a fixed number of codebooks per frame, which can be suboptimal in terms of rate-distortion tradeoff, particularly in scenarios with simple input audio, such as silence. To address this limitation, we propose variable bitrate RVQ (VRVQ) for audio codecs, which allows for more efficient coding by adapting the number of codebooks used per frame. Furthermore, we propose a gradient estimation method for the non-differentiable masking operation that transforms from the importance map to the binary importance mask, improving model training via a straight-through estimator. We demonstrate that the proposed training framework achieves superior results compared to the baseline method and shows further improvement when applied to the current state-of-the-art codec.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Kirchhof, James Thornton, Pierre Ablin, Louis B\'ethune, Eugene Ndiaye, Marco Cuturi</p>
<p>Abstract: The increased adoption of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has triggered concerns on their reliability. Such models are now closely scrutinized under the lens of various metrics, notably calibration, fairness, or compute efficiency. We focus in this work on two issues that arise when deploying these models: a lack of diversity when prompting images, and a tendency to recreate images from the training set. To solve both problems, we propose a method that coaxes the sampled trajectories of pretrained diffusion models to land on images that fall outside of a reference set. We achieve this by adding repellency terms to the diffusion SDE throughout the generation trajectory, which are triggered whenever the path is expected to land too closely to an image in the shielded reference set. Our method is sparse in the sense that these repellency terms are zero and inactive most of the time, and even more so towards the end of the generation trajectory. Our method, named SPELL for sparse repellency, can be used either with a static reference set that contains protected images, or dynamically, by updating the set at each timestep with the expected images concurrently generated within a batch. We show that adding SPELL to popular diffusion models improves their diversity while impacting their FID only marginally, and performs comparatively better than other recent training-free diversity methods. We also demonstrate how SPELL can ensure a shielded generation away from a very large set of protected images by considering all 1.2M images from ImageNet as the protected set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Mulrooney, Austin J. Brockmeier</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the neural response to natural images in the visual cortex requires extracting relevant features from the images and relating those feature to the observed responses. In this work, we optimize the feature extraction in order to maximize the information shared between the image features and the neural response across voxels in a given region of interest (ROI) extracted from the BOLD signal measured by fMRI. We adapt contrastive learning (CL) to fine-tune a convolutional neural network, which was pretrained for image classification, such that a mapping of a given image's features are more similar to the corresponding fMRI response than to the responses to other images. We exploit the recently released Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al., 2022) as organized for the Algonauts Project (Gifford et al., 2023), which contains the high-resolution fMRI responses of eight subjects to tens of thousands of naturalistic images. We show that CL fine-tuning creates feature extraction models that enable higher encoding accuracy in early visual ROIs as compared to both the pretrained network and a baseline approach that uses a regression loss at the output of the network to tune it for fMRI response encoding. We investigate inter-subject transfer of the CL fine-tuned models, including subjects from another, lower-resolution dataset (Gong et al., 2023). We also pool subjects for fine-tuning to further improve the encoding performance. Finally, we examine the performance of the fine-tuned models on common image classification tasks, explore the landscape of ROI-specific models by applying dimensionality reduction on the Bhattacharya dissimilarity matrix created using the predictions on those tasks (Mao et al., 2024), and investigate lateralization of the processing for early visual ROIs using salience maps of the classifiers built on the CL-tuned models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Esteban Garces Arias, Meimingwei Li, Christian Heumann, Matthias A{\ss}enmacher</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding strategies for large language models (LLMs) are a critical but often underexplored aspect of text generation tasks. Since LLMs produce probability distributions over the entire vocabulary, various decoding methods have been developed to transform these probabilities into coherent and fluent text, each with its own set of hyperparameters. In this study, we present a large-scale, comprehensive analysis of how hyperparameter selection affects text quality in open-ended text generation across multiple LLMs, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Through an extensive sensitivity analysis, we provide practical guidelines for hyperparameter tuning and demonstrate the substantial influence of these choices on text quality. Using three established datasets, spanning factual domains (e.g., news) and creative domains (e.g., fiction), we show that hyperparameter tuning significantly impacts generation quality, though its effects vary across models and tasks. We offer in-depth insights into these effects, supported by both human evaluations and a synthesis of widely-used automatic evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhant Ray, Xi Jiang, Jack Luo, Nick Feamster, Junchen Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S), as an emerging router-queue management technique, has seen steady deployment in the industry. An L4S-enabled router assigns each packet to the queue based on the packet header marking. Currently, L4S employs per-flow queue selection, i.e. all packets of a flow are marked the same way and thus use the same queues, even though each packet is marked separately. However, this may hurt tail latency and latency-sensitive applications because transient congestion and queue buildups may only affect a fraction of packets in a flow.
  We present SwiftQueue, a new L4S queue-selection strategy in which a sender uses a novel per-packet latency predictor to pinpoint which packets likely have latency spikes or drops. The insight is that many packet-level latency variations result from complex interactions among recent packets at shared router queues. Yet, these intricate packet-level latency patterns are hard to learn efficiently by traditional models. Instead, SwiftQueue uses a custom Transformer, which is well-studied for its expressiveness on sequential patterns, to predict the next packet's latency based on the latencies of recently received ACKs. Based on the predicted latency of each outgoing packet, SwiftQueue's sender dynamically marks the L4S packet header to assign packets to potentially different queues, even within the same flow. Using real network traces, we show that SwiftQueue is 45-65% more accurate in predicting latency and its variations than state-of-art methods. Based on its latency prediction, SwiftQueue reduces the tail latency for L4S-enabled flows by 36-45%, compared with the existing L4S queue-selection method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electron density prediction stands as a cornerstone challenge in molecular systems, pivotal for various applications such as understanding molecular interactions and conducting precise quantum mechanical calculations. However, the scaling of density functional theory (DFT) calculations is prohibitively expensive. Machine learning methods provide an alternative, offering efficiency and accuracy. We introduce a novel SE(3)-equivariant architecture, drawing inspiration from Slater-Type Orbitals (STO), to learn representations of molecular electronic structures. Our approach offers an alternative functional form for learned orbital-like molecular representation. We showcase the effectiveness of our method by achieving SOTA prediction accuracy of molecular electron density with 30-70\% improvement over other work on Molecular Dynamics data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present GR-2, a state-of-the-art generalist robot agent for versatile and generalizable robot manipulation. GR-2 is first pre-trained on a vast number of Internet videos to capture the dynamics of the world. This large-scale pre-training, involving 38 million video clips and over 50 billion tokens, equips GR-2 with the ability to generalize across a wide range of robotic tasks and environments during subsequent policy learning. Following this, GR-2 is fine-tuned for both video generation and action prediction using robot trajectories. It exhibits impressive multi-task learning capabilities, achieving an average success rate of 97.7% across more than 100 tasks. Moreover, GR-2 demonstrates exceptional generalization to new, previously unseen scenarios, including novel backgrounds, environments, objects, and tasks. Notably, GR-2 scales effectively with model size, underscoring its potential for continued growth and application. Project page: \url{https://gr2-manipulation.github.io}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Deng, Kevin Bello, Pradeep Ravikumar, Bryon Aragam</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing approaches to differentiable structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rely on strong identifiability assumptions in order to guarantee that global minimizers of the acyclicity-constrained optimization problem identifies the true DAG. Moreover, it has been observed empirically that the optimizer may exploit undesirable artifacts in the loss function. We explain and remedy these issues by studying the behavior of differentiable acyclicity-constrained programs under general likelihoods with multiple global minimizers. By carefully regularizing the likelihood, it is possible to identify the sparsest model in the Markov equivalence class, even in the absence of an identifiable parametrization. We first study the Gaussian case in detail, showing how proper regularization of the likelihood defines a score that identifies the sparsest model. Assuming faithfulness, it also recovers the Markov equivalence class. These results are then generalized to general models and likelihoods, where the same claims hold. These theoretical results are validated empirically, showing how this can be done using standard gradient-based optimizers, thus paving the way for differentiable structure learning under general models and losses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Milsom, Ben Anson, Laurence Aitchison</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work developed convolutional deep kernel machines, achieving 92.7% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 using a ResNet-inspired architecture, which is SOTA for kernel methods. However, this still lags behind neural networks, which easily achieve over 94% test accuracy with similar architectures. In this work we introduce several modifications to improve the convolutional deep kernel machine's generalisation, including stochastic kernel regularisation, which adds noise to the learned Gram matrices during training. The resulting model achieves 94.5% test accuracy on CIFAR-10. This finding has important theoretical and practical implications, as it demonstrates that the ability to perform well on complex tasks like image classification is not unique to neural networks. Instead, other approaches including deep kernel methods can achieve excellent performance on such tasks, as long as they have the capacity to learn representations from data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quang Anh Nguyen, Nadi Tomeh, Mustapha Lebbah, Thierry Charnois, Hanene Azzag, Santiago Cordoba Mu\~noz</p>
<p>Abstract: With the continuous development of pre-trained language models, prompt-based training becomes a well-adopted paradigm that drastically improves the exploitation of models for many natural language processing tasks. Prompting also shows great performance compared to traditional fine-tuning when adapted to zero-shot or few-shot scenarios where the number of annotated data is limited. In this framework, the role of verbalizers is essential, as an interpretation from masked word distributions into output predictions. In this work, we propose \acrshort{mave}, an approach for verbalizer construction by enrichment of class labels using neighborhood relation in the embedding space of words for the text classification task. In addition, we elaborate a benchmarking procedure to evaluate typical baselines of verbalizers for document classification in few-shot learning contexts. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results while using significantly fewer resources. We show that our approach is particularly effective in cases with extremely limited supervision data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Steinke, Milad Nasr, Arun Ganesh, Borja Balle, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Matthew Jagielski, Jamie Hayes, Abhradeep Guha Thakurta, Adam Smith, Andreas Terzis</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a simple heuristic privacy analysis of noisy clipped stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) in the setting where only the last iterate is released and the intermediate iterates remain hidden. Namely, our heuristic assumes a linear structure for the model.
  We show experimentally that our heuristic is predictive of the outcome of privacy auditing applied to various training procedures. Thus it can be used prior to training as a rough estimate of the final privacy leakage. We also probe the limitations of our heuristic by providing some artificial counterexamples where it underestimates the privacy leakage.
  The standard composition-based privacy analysis of DP-SGD effectively assumes that the adversary has access to all intermediate iterates, which is often unrealistic. However, this analysis remains the state of the art in practice. While our heuristic does not replace a rigorous privacy analysis, it illustrates the large gap between the best theoretical upper bounds and the privacy auditing lower bounds and sets a target for further work to improve the theoretical privacy analyses. We also empirically support our heuristic and show existing privacy auditing attacks are bounded by our heuristic analysis in both vision and language tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio M. Sudoso, Daniel Aloise</p>
<p>Abstract: The minimum sum-of-squares clustering problem (MSSC), also known as $k$-means clustering, refers to the problem of partitioning $n$ data points into $k$ clusters, with the objective of minimizing the total sum of squared Euclidean distances between each point and the center of its assigned cluster. We propose an efficient algorithm for solving large-scale MSSC instances, which combines column generation (CG) with dynamic constraint aggregation (DCA) to effectively reduce the number of constraints considered in the CG master problem. DCA was originally conceived to reduce degeneracy in set partitioning problems by utilizing an aggregated restricted master problem obtained from a partition of the set partitioning constraints into disjoint clusters. In this work, we explore the use of DCA within a CG algorithm for MSSC exact solution. Our method is fine-tuned by a series of ablation studies on DCA design choices, and is demonstrated to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art exact approaches available in the literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadas Abraham, Barak Gahtan, Adir Kobovich, Orian Leitersdorf, Alex M. Bronstein, Eitan Yaakobi</p>
<p>Abstract: The emerging field of DNA storage employs strands of DNA bases (A/T/C/G) as a storage medium for digital information to enable massive density and durability. The DNA storage pipeline includes: (1) encoding the raw data into sequences of DNA bases; (2) synthesizing the sequences as DNA \textit{strands} that are stored over time as an unordered set; (3) sequencing the DNA strands to generate DNA \textit{reads}; and (4) deducing the original data. The DNA synthesis and sequencing stages each generate several independent error-prone duplicates of each strand which are then utilized in the final stage to reconstruct the best estimate for the original strand. Specifically, the reads are first \textit{clustered} into groups likely originating from the same strand (based on their similarity to each other), and then each group approximates the strand that led to the reads of that group. This work improves the DNA clustering stage by embedding it as part of the DNA sequencing. Traditional DNA storage solutions begin after the DNA sequencing process generates discrete DNA reads (A/T/C/G), yet we identify that there is untapped potential in using the raw signals generated by the Nanopore DNA sequencing machine before they are discretized into bases, a process known as \textit{basecalling}, which is done using a deep neural network. We propose a deep neural network that clusters these signals directly, demonstrating superior accuracy, and reduced computation times compared to current approaches that cluster after basecalling.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the growing importance of customer service in contemporary business, recognizing the intents behind service dialogues has become essential for the strategic success of enterprises. However, the nature of dialogue data varies significantly across different scenarios, and implementing an intent parser for a specific domain often involves tedious feature engineering and a heavy workload of data labeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Neural-Bayesian Program Learning model named Dialogue-Intent Parser (DI-Parser), which specializes in intent parsing under data-hungry settings and offers promising performance improvements. DI-Parser effectively utilizes data from multiple sources in a "Learning to Learn" manner and harnesses the "wisdom of the crowd" through few-shot learning capabilities on human-annotated datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that DI-Parser outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models and offers practical advantages for industrial-scale applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Barbero, Alex Vitvitskyi, Christos Perivolaropoulos, Razvan Pascanu, Petar Veli\v{c}kovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Positional Encodings (PEs) are a critical component of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), providing the attention mechanism with important sequence-position information. One of the most popular types of encoding used today in LLMs are Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE), that rotate the queries and keys based on their relative distance. A common belief is that RoPE is useful because it helps to decay token dependency as relative distance increases. In this work, we argue that this is unlikely to be the core reason. We study the internals of a trained Gemma 7B model to understand how RoPE is being used at a mechanical level. We find that Gemma learns to use RoPE to construct robust "positional" attention patterns by exploiting the highest frequencies. We also find that, in general, Gemma greatly prefers to use the lowest frequencies of RoPE, which we suspect are used to carry semantic information. We mathematically prove interesting behaviours of RoPE and conduct experiments to verify our findings, proposing a modification of RoPE that fixes some highlighted issues and improves performance. We believe that this work represents an interesting step in better understanding PEs in LLMs, which we believe holds crucial value for scaling LLMs to large sizes and context lengths.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in mapping genomic DNA sequences to associated readouts (e.g., protein-DNA binding). Beyond prediction, the goal of these networks is to reveal to scientists the underlying motifs (and their syntax) which drive genome regulation. Traditional methods that extract motifs from convolutional filters suffer from the uninterpretable dispersion of information across filters and layers. Other methods which rely on importance scores can be unstable and unreliable. Instead, we designed a novel mechanistically interpretable architecture for regulatory genomics, where motifs and their syntax are directly encoded and readable from the learned weights and activations. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence of our architecture's full expressivity, while still being highly interpretable. Through several experiments, we show that our architecture excels in de novo motif discovery and motif instance calling, is robust to variable sequence contexts, and enables fully interpretable generation of novel functional sequences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaid Khan, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Jaemin Cho, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: The process of creating training data to teach models is currently driven by humans, who manually analyze model weaknesses and plan how to create data that improves a student model. Recent approaches using LLMs as annotators reduce human effort, but still require humans to interpret feedback from evaluations and control the LLM to produce data the student needs. Automating this labor-intensive process by creating autonomous data generation agents - or teachers - is desirable, but requires environments that can simulate the feedback-driven, iterative, closed loop of data creation. To enable rapid and scalable testing for such agents and their modules, we introduce DataEnvGym, a testbed of teacher environments for data generation agents. DataEnvGym frames data generation as a sequential decision-making task, involving an agent consisting of a data generation policy (which generates a plan for creating training data) and a data generation engine (which transforms the plan into data), inside an environment that provides student feedback. The agent's goal is to improve student performance. Students are iteratively trained and evaluated on generated data, with their feedback (in the form of errors or weak skills) being reported to the agent after each iteration. DataEnvGym includes multiple teacher environment instantiations across 3 levels of structure in the state representation and action space. More structured environments are based on inferred skills and offer more interpretability and curriculum control. We support 3 diverse tasks (math, code, and VQA) and test multiple students and teachers. Example agents in our teaching environments can iteratively improve students across tasks and settings. Moreover, we show that environments teach different skill levels and test variants of key modules, pointing to future work in improving data generation agents, engines, and feedback mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: A machine-learnable variational scheme using Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBFs) is presented and used to approximate linear problems on bounded and unbounded domains. In contrast to standard mesh-free methods, which use GRBFs to discretize strong-form differential equations, this work exploits the relationship between integrals of GRBFs, their derivatives, and polynomial moments to produce exact quadrature formulae which enable weak-form expressions. Combined with trainable GRBF means and covariances, this leads to a flexible, generalized Galerkin variational framework which is applied in the infinite-domain setting where the scheme is conforming, as well as the bounded-domain setting where it is not. Error rates for the proposed GRBF scheme are derived in each case, and examples are presented demonstrating utility of this approach as a surrogate modeling technique.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose RelitLRM, a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for generating high-quality Gaussian splatting representations of 3D objects under novel illuminations from sparse (4-8) posed images captured under unknown static lighting. Unlike prior inverse rendering methods requiring dense captures and slow optimization, often causing artifacts like incorrect highlights or shadow baking, RelitLRM adopts a feed-forward transformer-based model with a novel combination of a geometry reconstructor and a relightable appearance generator based on diffusion. The model is trained end-to-end on synthetic multi-view renderings of objects under varying known illuminations. This architecture design enables to effectively decompose geometry and appearance, resolve the ambiguity between material and lighting, and capture the multi-modal distribution of shadows and specularity in the relit appearance. We show our sparse-view feed-forward RelitLRM offers competitive relighting results to state-of-the-art dense-view optimization-based baselines while being significantly faster.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Will Dorrell, Kyle Hsu, Luke Hollingsworth, Jin Hwa Lee, Jiajun Wu, Chelsea Finn, Peter E Latham, Tim EJ Behrens, James CR Whittington</p>
<p>Abstract: Why do biological and artificial neurons sometimes modularise, each encoding a single meaningful variable, and sometimes entangle their representation of many variables? In this work, we develop a theory of when biologically inspired representations -- those that are nonnegative and energy efficient -- modularise with respect to source variables (sources). We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on a sample of sources that determine whether the neurons in an optimal biologically-inspired linear autoencoder modularise. Our theory applies to any dataset, extending far beyond the case of statistical independence studied in previous work. Rather, we show that sources modularise if their support is "sufficiently spread". From this theory, we extract and validate predictions in a variety of empirical studies on how data distribution affects modularisation in nonlinear feedforward and recurrent neural networks trained on supervised and unsupervised tasks. Furthermore, we apply these ideas to neuroscience data. First, we explain why two studies that recorded prefrontal activity in working memory tasks conflict on whether memories are encoded in orthogonal subspaces: the support of the sources differed due to a critical discrepancy in experimental protocol. Second, we use similar arguments to understand why preparatory and potent subspaces in RNN models of motor cortex are only sometimes orthogonal. Third, we study spatial and reward information mixing in entorhinal recordings, and show our theory matches data better than previous work. And fourth, we suggest a suite of surprising settings in which neurons can be (or appear) mixed selective, without requiring complex nonlinear readouts as in traditional theories. In sum, our theory prescribes precise conditions on when neural activities modularise, providing tools for inducing and elucidating modular representations in brains and machines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision and language assistants have enabled new capabilities for interpreting natural images. These approaches have recently been adapted to earth observation data, but they are only able to handle single image inputs, limiting their use for many real-world tasks. In this work, we develop a new vision and language assistant called TEOChat that can engage in conversations about temporal sequences of earth observation data. To train TEOChat, we curate an instruction-following dataset composed of many single image and temporal tasks including building change and damage assessment, semantic change detection, and temporal scene classification. We show that TEOChat can perform a wide variety of spatial and temporal reasoning tasks, substantially outperforming previous vision and language assistants, and even achieving comparable or better performance than specialist models trained to perform these specific tasks. Furthermore, TEOChat achieves impressive zero-shot performance on a change detection and change question answering dataset, outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on multiple temporal tasks, and exhibits stronger single image capabilities than a comparable single EO image instruction-following model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinong Oliver Wang, Eileen Li, Jinqi Luo, Zhaoning Wang, Fernando De la Torre</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring model explainability and robustness is essential for reliable deployment of deep vision systems. Current methods for evaluating robustness rely on collecting and annotating extensive test sets. While this is common practice, the process is labor-intensive and expensive with no guarantee of sufficient coverage across attributes of interest. Recently, model diagnosis frameworks have emerged leveraging user inputs (e.g., text) to assess the vulnerability of the model. However, such dependence on human can introduce bias and limitation given the domain knowledge of particular users. This paper proposes Unsupervised Model Diagnosis (UMO), that leverages generative models to produce semantic counterfactual explanations without any user guidance. Given a differentiable computer vision model (i.e., the target model), UMO optimizes for the most counterfactual directions in a generative latent space. Our approach identifies and visualizes changes in semantics, and then matches these changes to attributes from wide-ranging text sources, such as dictionaries or language models. We validate the framework on multiple vision tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation, keypoint detection). Extensive experiments show that our unsupervised discovery of semantic directions can correctly highlight spurious correlations and visualize the failure mode of target models without any human intervention.</p>

We formulate our design to minimize the dimensionality of scores while satisfying the objectives. We give algorithms to design scores, which are provably minimal under mild assumptions on the structure of performance metrics. This framework draws motivation from real-world practices in hospital rating systems, where misaligned scores and performance metrics lead to unintended consequences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoxiu Wei, Mingchao Liang, Florian Meyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in robotics, autonomous driving, and maritime surveillance. Traditional work on MOT is model-based and aims to establish algorithms in the framework of sequential Bayesian estimation. More recent methods are fully data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. The two approaches have demonstrated advantages in certain scenarios. In particular, in problems where plenty of labeled data for the training of neural networks is available, data-driven MOT tends to have advantages compared to traditional methods. A natural thought is whether a general and efficient framework can integrate the two approaches. This paper advances a recently introduced hybrid model-based and data-driven method called neural-enhanced belief propagation (NEBP). Compared to existing work on NEBP for MOT, it introduces a novel neural architecture that can improve data association and new object initialization, two critical aspects of MOT. The proposed tracking method is leading the nuScenes LiDAR-only tracking challenge at the time of submission of this paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Gast, Dheeraj Narasimha</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the discrete time infinite horizon average reward restless markovian bandit (RMAB) problem. We propose a \emph{model predictive control} based non-stationary policy with a rolling computational horizon $\tau$. At each time-slot, this policy solves a $\tau$ horizon linear program whose first control value is kept as a control for the RMAB. Our solution requires minimal assumptions and quantifies the loss in optimality in terms of $\tau$ and the number of arms, $N$. We show that its sub-optimality gap is $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ in general, and $\exp(-\Omega(N))$ under a local-stability condition. Our proof is based on a framework from dynamic control known as \emph{dissipativity}. Our solution easy to implement and performs very well in practice when compared to the state of the art. Further, both our solution and our proof methodology can easily be generalized to more general constrained MDP settings and should thus, be of great interest to the burgeoning RMAB community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuqi Chen, Qixuan Zhou, Yahong Yang, Yang Xiang, Tao Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network-based methods have emerged as powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in scientific and engineering applications, particularly when handling complex domains or incorporating empirical data. These methods leverage neural networks as basis functions to approximate PDE solutions. However, training such networks can be challenging, often resulting in limited accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the training dynamics of neural network-based PDE solvers with a focus on the impact of initialization techniques. We assess training difficulty by analyzing the eigenvalue distribution of the kernel and apply the concept of effective rank to quantify this difficulty, where a larger effective rank correlates with faster convergence of the training error. Building upon this, we discover through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments that two initialization techniques, partition of unity (PoU) and variance scaling (VS), enhance the effective rank, thereby accelerating the convergence of training error. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments using popular PDE-solving frameworks, such as PINN, Deep Ritz, and the operator learning framework DeepOnet, confirm that these initialization techniques consistently speed up convergence, in line with our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mkululi Sikosana, Oluwaseun Ajao, Sean Maudsley-Barton</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in detecting COVID-19-related misinformation on online social networks (OSNs), aiming to develop more effective tools for countering the spread of health misinformation during the pan-demic. The study trained and tested various ML classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), DL models (CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN+LSTM), and pretrained language models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on the "COVID19-FNIR DATASET". These models were evaluated for accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, and ROC, and used preprocessing techniques like stemming and lemmatization. The results showed SVM performed well, achieving a 94.41% F1-score. DL models with Word2Vec embeddings exceeded 98% in all performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision & ROC). The CNN+LSTM hybrid models also exceeded 98% across performance metrics, outperforming pretrained models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa. Our study concludes that DL and hybrid DL models are more effective than conventional ML algorithms for detecting COVID-19 misinformation on OSNs. The findings highlight the importance of advanced neural network approaches and large-scale pretraining in misinformation detection. Future research should optimize these models for various misinformation types and adapt to changing OSNs, aiding in combating health misinformation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current evaluation practices in speech-driven gesture generation lack standardisation and focus on aspects that are easy to measure over aspects that actually matter. This leads to a situation where it is impossible to know what is the state of the art, or to know which method works better for which purpose when comparing two publications. In this position paper, we review and give details on issues with existing gesture-generation evaluation, and present a novel proposal for remedying them. Specifically, we announce an upcoming living leaderboard to benchmark progress in conversational motion synthesis. Unlike earlier gesture-generation challenges, the leaderboard will be updated with large-scale user studies of new gesture-generation systems multiple times per year, and systems on the leaderboard can be submitted to any publication venue that their authors prefer. By evolving the leaderboard evaluation data and tasks over time, the effort can keep driving progress towards the most important end goals identified by the community. We actively seek community involvement across the entire evaluation pipeline: from data and tasks for the evaluation, via tooling, to the systems evaluated. In other words, our proposal will not only make it easier for researchers to perform good evaluations, but their collective input and contributions will also help drive the future of gesture-generation research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krishna Aswani, Huilin Lu, Pranav Patankar, Priya Dhalwani, Iris Tan, Jayant Ganeshmohan, Simon Lacasse</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in prompt engineering strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Discover, have demonstrated significant potential in improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompting strategies rely on single or fixed set of static seed reasoning modules like \emph{"think step by step"} or \emph{"break down this problem"} intended to simulate human approach to problem-solving. This constraint limits the flexibility of models in tackling diverse problems effectively. In this paper, we introduce Auto-Evolve, a novel framework that enables LLMs to self-create dynamic reasoning modules and downstream action plan, resulting in significant improvements over current SOTA methods. We evaluate Auto-Evolve on the challenging BigBench-Hard (BBH) dataset with Claude 2.0, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and GPT 4, where it consistently outperforms the SOTA prompt strategies. Auto-Evolve outperforms CoT by up to 10.4\% and on an average by 7\% across these four models. Our framework introduces two innovations: a) Auto-Evolve dynamically generates reasoning modules for each task while aligning with human reasoning paradigm, thus eliminating the need for predefined templates. b) We introduce an iterative refinement component, that incrementally refines instruction guidance for LLMs and helps boost performance by average 2.8\% compared to doing it in a single step.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph K. Chege, Arie Yeredor, Martin Haardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Obtaining a reliable estimate of the joint probability mass function (PMF) of a set of random variables from observed data is a significant objective in statistical signal processing and machine learning. Modelling the joint PMF as a tensor that admits a low-rank canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) has enabled the development of efficient PMF estimation algorithms. However, these algorithms require the rank (model order) of the tensor to be specified beforehand. In real-world applications, the true rank is unknown. Therefore, an appropriate rank is usually selected from a candidate set either by observing validation errors or by computing various likelihood-based information criteria, a procedure which is computationally expensive for large datasets. This paper presents a novel Bayesian framework for estimating the joint PMF and automatically inferring its rank from observed data. We specify a Bayesian PMF estimation model and employ appropriate prior distributions for the model parameters, allowing for tuning-free rank inference via a single training run. We then derive a deterministic solution based on variational inference (VI) to approximate the posterior distributions of various model parameters. Additionally, we develop a scalable version of the VI-based approach by leveraging stochastic variational inference (SVI) to arrive at an efficient algorithm whose complexity scales sublinearly with the size of the dataset. Numerical experiments involving both synthetic data and real movie recommendation data illustrate the advantages of our VI and SVI-based methods in terms of estimation accuracy, automatic rank detection, and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoran Zhang, Yongxiang Li, Zijian Kan, Keyuan Cheng, Lijie Hu, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The locate-then-edit paradigm has shown significant promise for knowledge editing (KE) in Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous methods perform well on single-hop fact recall tasks, they consistently struggle with multi-hop factual recall tasks involving newly edited knowledge. In this paper, leveraging tools in mechanistic interpretability, we first identify that in multi-hop tasks, LLMs tend to retrieve implicit subject knowledge from deeper MLP layers, unlike single-hop tasks, which rely on earlier layers. This distinction explains the poor performance of current methods in multi-hop queries, as they primarily focus on editing shallow layers, leaving deeper layers unchanged. To address this, we propose IFMET, a novel locate-then-edit KE approach designed to edit both shallow and deep MLP layers. IFMET employs multi-hop editing prompts and supplementary sets to locate and modify knowledge across different reasoning stages. Experimental results demonstrate that IFMET significantly improves performance on multi-hop factual recall tasks, effectively overcoming the limitations of previous locate-then-edit methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humanitarian organizations can enhance their effectiveness by analyzing data to discover trends, gather aggregated insights, manage their security risks, support decision-making, and inform advocacy and funding proposals. However, data about violent incidents with direct impact and relevance for humanitarian aid operations is not readily available. An automatic data collection and NLP-backed classification framework aligned with humanitarian perspectives can help bridge this gap. In this paper, we present HumVI - a dataset comprising news articles in three languages (English, French, Arabic) containing instances of different types of violent incidents categorized by the humanitarian sector they impact, e.g., aid security, education, food security, health, and protection. Reliable labels were obtained for the dataset by partnering with a data-backed humanitarian organization, Insecurity Insight. We provide multiple benchmarks for the dataset, employing various deep learning architectures and techniques, including data augmentation and mask loss, to address different task-related challenges, e.g., domain expansion.

<p>Abstract: This paper delves into the interplay between vision backbones and optimizers, unvealing an inter-dependent phenomenon termed \textit{\textbf{b}ackbone-\textbf{o}ptimizer \textbf{c}oupling \textbf{b}ias} (BOCB). We observe that canonical CNNs, such as VGG and ResNet, exhibit a marked co-dependency with SGD families, while recent architectures like ViTs and ConvNeXt share a tight coupling with the adaptive learning rate ones. We further show that BOCB can be introduced by both optimizers and certain backbone designs and may significantly impact the pre-training and downstream fine-tuning of vision models. Through in-depth empirical analysis, we summarize takeaways on recommended optimizers and insights into robust vision backbone architectures. We hope this work can inspire the community to question long-held assumptions on backbones and optimizers, stimulate further explorations, and thereby contribute to more robust vision systems.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06376">Riemannian Optimization for Non-convex Euclidean Distance Geometry with Global Recovery Guarantees</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandler Smith, HanQin Cai, Abiy Tasissa</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of determining the configuration of points from partial distance information, known as the Euclidean Distance Geometry (EDG) problem, is fundamental to many tasks in the applied sciences. In this paper, we propose two algorithms grounded in the Riemannian optimization framework to address the EDG problem. Our approach formulates the problem as a low-rank matrix completion task over the Gram matrix, using partial measurements represented as expansion coefficients of the Gram matrix in a non-orthogonal basis. For the first algorithm, under a uniform sampling with replacement model for the observed distance entries, we demonstrate that, with high probability, a Riemannian gradient-like algorithm on the manifold of rank-$r$ matrices converges linearly to the true solution, given initialization via a one-step hard thresholding. This holds provided the number of samples, $m$, satisfies $m \geq \mathcal{O}(n^{7/4}r^2 \log(n))$. With a more refined initialization, achieved through resampled Riemannian gradient-like descent, we further improve this bound to $m \geq \mathcal{O}(nr^2 \log(n))$. Our analysis for the first algorithm leverages a non-self-adjoint operator and depends on deriving eigenvalue bounds for an inner product matrix of restricted basis matrices, leveraging sparsity properties for tighter guarantees than previously established. The second algorithm introduces a self-adjoint surrogate for the sampling operator. This algorithm demonstrates strong numerical performance on both synthetic and real data. Furthermore, we show that optimizing over manifolds of higher-than-rank-$r$ matrices yields superior numerical results, consistent with recent literature on overparameterization in the EDG problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weigutian Ou, Helmut B\"olcskei</p>
<p>Abstract: Covering numbers of families of (deep) ReLU networks have been used to characterize their approximation-theoretic performance, upper-bound the prediction error they incur in nonparametric regression, and quantify their classification capacity. These results are based on covering number upper bounds obtained through the explicit construction of coverings. Lower bounds on covering numbers do not seem to be available in the literature. The present paper fills this gap by deriving tight (up to a multiplicative constant) lower and upper bounds on the covering numbers of fully-connected networks with bounded weights, sparse networks with bounded weights, and fully-connected networks with quantized weights. Thanks to the tightness of the bounds, a fundamental understanding of the impact of sparsity, quantization, bounded vs. unbounded weights, and network output truncation can be developed. Furthermore, the bounds allow to characterize the fundamental limits of neural network transformation, including network compression, and lead to sharp upper bounds on the prediction error in nonparametric regression through deep networks. Specifically, we can remove a $\log^6(n)$-factor in the best-known sample complexity rate in the estimation of Lipschitz functions through deep networks thereby establishing optimality. Finally, we identify a systematic relation between optimal nonparametric regression and optimal approximation through deep networks, unifying numerous results in the literature and uncovering general underlying principles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adverse weather conditions pose a significant challenge to the widespread adoption of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by impacting sensors like LiDARs and cameras. Even though Collaborative Perception (CP) improves AV perception in difficult conditions, existing CP datasets lack adverse weather conditions. To address this, we introduce Adver-City, the first open-source synthetic CP dataset focused on adverse weather conditions. Simulated in CARLA with OpenCDA, it contains over 24 thousand frames, over 890 thousand annotations, and 110 unique scenarios across six different weather conditions: clear weather, soft rain, heavy rain, fog, foggy heavy rain and, for the first time in a synthetic CP dataset, glare. It has six object categories including pedestrians and cyclists, and uses data from vehicles and roadside units featuring LiDARs, RGB and semantic segmentation cameras, GNSS, and IMUs. Its scenarios, based on real crash reports, depict the most relevant road configurations for adverse weather and poor visibility conditions, varying in object density, with both dense and sparse scenes, allowing for novel testing conditions of CP models. Benchmarks run on the dataset show that weather conditions created challenging conditions for perception models, reducing multi-modal object detection performance by up to 19%, while object density affected LiDAR-based detection by up to 29%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ga\"el Gendron, Jo\v{z}e M. Ro\v{z}anec, Michael Witbrock, Gillian Dobbie</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal structure discovery methods are commonly applied to structured data where the causal variables are known and where statistical testing can be used to assess the causal relationships. By contrast, recovering a causal structure from unstructured natural language data such as news articles contains numerous challenges due to the absence of known variables or counterfactual data to estimate the causal links. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in this direction but also exhibit limitations. This work investigates LLM's abilities to build causal graphs from text documents and perform counterfactual causal inference. We propose an end-to-end causal structure discovery and causal inference method from natural language: we first use an LLM to extract the instantiated causal variables from text data and build a causal graph. We merge causal graphs from multiple data sources to represent the most exhaustive set of causes possible. We then conduct counterfactual inference on the estimated graph. The causal graph conditioning allows reduction of LLM biases and better represents the causal estimands. We use our method to show that the limitations of LLMs in counterfactual causal reasoning come from prediction errors and propose directions to mitigate them. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on real-world news articles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucheng Yang, Jingjie Li, Kassem Fawaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Pedestrian heading tracking enables applications in pedestrian navigation, traffic safety, and accessibility. Previous works, using inertial sensor fusion or machine learning, are limited in that they assume the phone is fixed in specific orientations, hindering their generalizability. We propose a new heading tracking algorithm, the Orientation-Heading Alignment (OHA), which leverages a key insight: people tend to carry smartphones in certain ways due to habits, such as swinging them while walking. For each smartphone attitude during this motion, OHA maps the smartphone orientation to the pedestrian heading and learns such mappings efficiently from coarse headings and smartphone orientations. To anchor our algorithm in a practical scenario, we apply OHA to a challenging task: predicting when pedestrians are about to cross the road to improve road user safety. In particular, using 755 hours of walking data collected since 2020 from 60 individuals, we develop a lightweight model that operates in real-time on commodity devices to predict road crossings. Our evaluation shows that OHA achieves 3.4 times smaller heading errors across nine scenarios than existing methods. Furthermore, OHA enables the early and accurate detection of pedestrian crossing behavior, issuing crossing alerts 0.35 seconds, on average, before pedestrians enter the road range.</p>

Our work compiles several datasets from Twitter and Reddit for both conflicts in a before and after separation with an aim of predicting a future state of social media for avoidance. More specifically, we show that: (1) there is a noticeable difference in social media discussion leading up to and following a conflict and (2) social media discourse on platforms like Twitter and Reddit is useful in identifying future conflicts before they arise. Our results show that through the use of advanced NLP techniques (both supervised and unsupervised) toxicity and other attributes about language before and after a conflict is predictable with a low error of nearly 1.2 percent for both conflicts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stress is a common feeling in daily life, but it can affect mental well-being in some situations, the development of robust detection models is imperative. This study introduces a methodical approach to the stress identification in code-mixed texts for Dravidian languages. The challenge encompassed two datasets, targeting Tamil and Telugu languages respectively. This proposal underscores the importance of using uncleaned text as a benchmark to refine future classification methodologies, incorporating diverse preprocessing techniques. Random Forest algorithm was used, featuring three textual representations: TF-IDF, Uni-grams of words, and a composite of (1+2+3)-Grams of characters. The approach achieved a good performance for both linguistic categories, achieving a Macro F1-score of 0.734 in Tamil and 0.727 in Telugu, overpassing results achieved with different complex techniques such as FastText and Transformer models. The results underscore the value of uncleaned data for mental state detection and the challenges classifying code-mixed texts for stress, indicating the potential for improved performance through cleaning data, other preprocessing techniques, or more complex models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction following is a key capability for LLMs. However, recent studies have shown that LLMs often struggle with instructions containing multiple constraints (e.g. a request to create a social media post "in a funny tone" with "no hashtag"). Despite this, most evaluations focus solely on synthetic data. To address this, we introduce RealInstruct, the first benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to follow real-world multi-constrained instructions by leveraging queries real users asked AI assistants. We also investigate model-based evaluation as a cost-effective alternative to human annotation for this task. Our findings reveal that even the proprietary GPT-4 model fails to meet at least one constraint on over 21% of instructions, highlighting the limitations of state-of-the-art models. To address the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models, we propose the Decompose, Critique and Refine (DeCRIM) self-correction pipeline, which enhances LLMs' ability to follow constraints. DeCRIM works by decomposing the original instruction into a list of constraints and using a Critic model to decide when and where the LLM's response needs refinement. Our results show that DeCRIM improves Mistral's performance by 7.3% on RealInstruct and 8.0% on IFEval even with weak feedback. Moreover, we demonstrate that with strong feedback, open-source LLMs with DeCRIM can outperform GPT-4 on both benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this note we analyze the performance of a simple root-finding algorithm in uniform attachment trees. The leaf-stripping algorithm recursively removes all leaves of the tree for a carefully chosen number of rounds. We show that, with probability $1 - \epsilon$, the set of remaining vertices contains the root and has a size only depending on $\epsilon$ but not on the size of the tree.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leo McKee-Reid, Christoph Str\"ater, Maria Angelica Martinez, Joe Needham, Mikita Balesni</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous work has shown that training "helpful-only" LLMs with reinforcement learning on a curriculum of gameable environments can lead models to generalize to egregious specification gaming, such as editing their own reward function or modifying task checklists to appear more successful. We show that gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, o1-preview, and o1-mini - frontier models trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest - can engage in specification gaming without training on a curriculum of tasks, purely from in-context iterative reflection (which we call in-context reinforcement learning, "ICRL"). We also show that using ICRL to generate highly-rewarded outputs for expert iteration (compared to the standard expert iteration reinforcement learning algorithm) may increase gpt-4o-mini's propensity to learn specification-gaming policies, generalizing (in very rare cases) to the most egregious strategy where gpt-4o-mini edits its own reward function. Our results point toward the strong ability of in-context reflection to discover rare specification-gaming strategies that models might not exhibit zero-shot or with normal training, highlighting the need for caution when relying on alignment of LLMs in zero-shot settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of deep learning models used for calculating user representations presents significant challenges, particularly with limited computational resources and strict service-level agreements (SLAs). Previous research efforts have focused on optimizing model inference but have overlooked a critical question: is it necessary to perform user model inference for every ad request in large-scale social networks? To address this question and these challenges, we first analyze user access patterns at Meta and find that most user model inferences occur within a short timeframe. T his observation reveals a triangular relationship among model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs. Building on this insight, we designed, implemented, and evaluated ERCache, an efficient and robust caching framework for large-scale user representations in ads recommendation systems on social networks. ERCache categorizes cache into direct and failover types and applies customized settings and eviction policies for each model, effectively balancing model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs, even considering the staleness introduced by caching. ERCache has been deployed at Meta for over six months, supporting more than 30 ranking models while efficiently conserving computational resources and complying with service SLA requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has been instrumental in advancing state-of-the-art natural language processing applications. Training LLMs with billions of parameters and trillions of tokens require sophisticated distributed systems that enable composing and comparing several state-of-the-art techniques in order to efficiently scale across thousands of accelerators. However, existing solutions are complex, scattered across multiple libraries/repositories, lack interoperability, and are cumbersome to maintain. Thus, curating and empirically comparing training recipes require non-trivial engineering effort.
  This paper introduces TorchTitan, an open-source, PyTorch-native distributed training system that unifies state-of-the-art techniques, streamlining integration and reducing overhead. TorchTitan enables 3D parallelism in a modular manner with elastic scaling, providing comprehensive logging, checkpointing, and debugging tools for production-ready training. It also incorporates hardware-software co-designed solutions, leveraging features like Float8 training and SymmetricMemory. As a flexible test bed, TorchTitan facilitates custom recipe curation and comparison, allowing us to develop optimized training recipes for Llama 3.1 and provide guidance on selecting techniques for maximum efficiency based on our experiences.
  We thoroughly assess TorchTitan on the Llama 3.1 family of LLMs, spanning 8 billion to 405 billion parameters, and showcase its exceptional performance, modular composability, and elastic scalability. By stacking training optimizations, we demonstrate accelerations of 65.08% with 1D parallelism at the 128-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 8B), an additional 12.59% with 2D parallelism at the 256-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 70B), and an additional 30% with 3D parallelism at the 512-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 405B) on NVIDIA H100 GPUs over optimized baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maharshi Gor, Hal Daum\'e III, Tianyi Zhou, Jordan Boyd-Graber</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) have led to claims of AI surpassing humans in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as textual understanding and reasoning. This work investigates these assertions by introducing CAIMIRA, a novel framework rooted in item response theory (IRT) that enables quantitative assessment and comparison of problem-solving abilities of question-answering (QA) agents: humans and AI systems. Through analysis of over 300,000 responses from ~70 AI systems and 155 humans across thousands of quiz questions, CAIMIRA uncovers distinct proficiency patterns in knowledge domains and reasoning skills. Humans outperform AI systems in knowledge-grounded abductive and conceptual reasoning, while state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA show superior performance on targeted information retrieval and fact-based reasoning, particularly when information gaps are well-defined and addressable through pattern matching or data retrieval. These findings highlight the need for future QA tasks to focus on questions that challenge not only higher-order reasoning and scientific thinking, but also demand nuanced linguistic interpretation and cross-contextual knowledge application, helping advance AI developments that better emulate or complement human cognitive abilities in real-world problem-solving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxiao Sun, Chongkun Zhao, Sharath Koorathota, Paul Sajda</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural biomarkers that can classify or predict disease are of broad interest to the neurological and psychiatric communities. Such biomarkers can be informative of disease state or treatment efficacy, even before there are changes in symptoms and/or behavior. This work investigates EEG-estimated functional connectivity (FC) as a Parkinson's Disease (PD) biomarker. Specifically, we investigate FC mediated via neural oscillations and consider such activity during the Simons conflict task. This task yields sensory-motor conflict, and one might expect differences in behavior between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs). In addition to considering spatially focused approaches, such as FC, as a biomarker, we also consider temporal biomarkers, which are more sensitive to ongoing changes in neural activity. We find that FC, estimated from delta (1-4Hz) and theta (4-7Hz) oscillations, yields spatial FC patterns significantly better at distinguishing PD from HC than temporal features or behavior. This study reinforces that FC in spectral bands is informative of differences in brain-wide processes and can serve as a biomarker distinguishing normal brain function from that seen in disease.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Xu, Victor S. Sheng</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly sophisticated, they raise significant security concerns, including the creation of fake news and academic misuse. Most detectors for identifying model-generated text are limited by their reliance on variance in perplexity and burstiness, and they require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we proposed a watermarking method embedding a specific watermark into the text during its generation by LLMs, based on a pre-defined signal pattern. This technique not only ensures the watermark's invisibility to humans but also maintains the quality and grammatical integrity of model-generated text. We utilize LLMs and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for token probability computation and detection of the signal watermark. The unique application of signal processing principles within the realm of text generation by LLMs allows for subtle yet effective embedding of watermarks, which do not compromise the quality or coherence of the generated text. Our method has been empirically validated across multiple LLMs, consistently maintaining high detection accuracy, even with variations in temperature settings during text generation. In the experiment of distinguishing between human-written and watermarked text, our method achieved an AUROC score of 0.97, significantly outperforming existing methods like GPTZero, which scored 0.64. The watermark's resilience to various attacking scenarios further confirms its robustness, addressing significant challenges in model-generated text authentication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jen-Yuan Huang, Haofan Wang, Qixun Wang, Xu Bai, Hao Ai, Peng Xing, Jen-Tse Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Handling test-time unknown degradation is the major challenge in Blind Image Restoration (BIR), necessitating high model generalization. An effective strategy is to incorporate prior knowledge, either from human input or generative model. In this paper, we introduce Instant-reference Image Restoration (InstantIR), a novel diffusion-based BIR method which dynamically adjusts generation condition during inference. We first extract a compact representation of the input via a pre-trained vision encoder. At each generation step, this representation is used to decode current diffusion latent and instantiate it in the generative prior. The degraded image is then encoded with this reference, providing robust generation condition. We observe the variance of generative references fluctuate with degradation intensity, which we further leverage as an indicator for developing a sampling algorithm adaptive to input quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate InstantIR achieves state-of-the-art performance and offering outstanding visual quality. Through modulating generative references with textual description, InstantIR can restore extreme degradation and additionally feature creative restoration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongbin Liu, Youzheng Chen, Arun Narayanan, Athula Balachandran, Pedro J. Moreno, Lun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) systems, particularly those with voice cloning capabilities, have made voice impersonation readily accessible, raising ethical and legal concerns due to potential misuse for malicious activities like misinformation campaigns and fraud. While synthetic speech detectors (SSDs) exist to combat this, they are vulnerable to ``test domain shift", exhibiting decreased performance when audio is altered through transcoding, playback, or background noise. This vulnerability is further exacerbated by deliberate manipulation of synthetic speech aimed at deceiving detectors. This work presents the first systematic study of such active malicious attacks against state-of-the-art open-source SSDs. White-box attacks, black-box attacks, and their transferability are studied from both attack effectiveness and stealthiness, using both hardcoded metrics and human ratings. The results highlight the urgent need for more robust detection methods in the face of evolving adversarial threats.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning-based unlearning methods prevail for preventing targeted harmful, sensitive, or copyrighted information within large language models while preserving overall capabilities. However, the true effectiveness of these methods is unclear. In this paper, we delve into the limitations of fine-tuning-based unlearning through activation patching and parameter restoration experiments. Our findings reveal that these methods alter the model's knowledge retrieval process, rather than genuinely erasing the problematic knowledge embedded in the model parameters. Furthermore, behavioral tests demonstrate that the unlearning mechanisms inevitably impact the global behavior of the models, affecting unrelated knowledge or capabilities. Our work advocates the development of more resilient unlearning techniques for truly erasing knowledge. Our code is released at https://github.com/yihuaihong/Dissecting-FT-Unlearning.</p>

<p>Abstract: To use generative question-and-answering (QA) systems for decision-making and in any critical application, these systems need to provide well-calibrated confidence scores that reflect the correctness of their answers. Existing calibration methods aim to ensure that the confidence score is on average indicative of the likelihood that the answer is correct. We argue, however, that this standard (average-case) notion of calibration is difficult to interpret for decision-making in generative QA. To address this, we generalize the standard notion of average calibration and introduce $\beta$-calibration, which ensures calibration holds across different question-and-answer groups. We then propose discretized posthoc calibration schemes for achieving $\beta$-calibration.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose M^3Bench, a new benchmark for whole-body motion generation for mobile manipulation tasks. Given a 3D scene context, M^3Bench requires an embodied agent to understand its configuration, environmental constraints and task objectives, then generate coordinated whole-body motion trajectories for object rearrangement tasks. M^3Bench features 30k object rearrangement tasks across 119 diverse scenes, providing expert demonstrations generated by our newly developed M^3BenchMaker. This automatic data generation tool produces coordinated whole-body motion trajectories from high-level task instructions, requiring only basic scene and robot information. Our benchmark incorporates various task splits to assess generalization across different dimensions and leverages realistic physics simulation for trajectory evaluation. Through extensive experimental analyses, we reveal that state-of-the-art models still struggle with coordinated base-arm motion while adhering to environment-context and task-specific constraints, highlighting the need to develop new models that address this gap. Through M^3Bench, we aim to facilitate future robotics research towards more adaptive and capable mobile manipulation in diverse, real-world environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Wang, Chaohu Liu, Yanqiu Qu, Haoyu Cao, Deqiang Jiang, Linli Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) integrate visual information into large language models, showcasing remarkable multi-modal conversational capabilities. However, the visual modules introduces new challenges in terms of robustness for LVLMs, as attackers can craft adversarial images that are visually clean but may mislead the model to generate incorrect answers. In general, LVLMs rely on vision encoders to transform images into visual tokens, which are crucial for the language models to perceive image contents effectively. Therefore, we are curious about one question: Can LVLMs still generate correct responses when the encoded visual tokens are attacked and disrupting the visual information? To this end, we propose a non-targeted attack method referred to as VT-Attack (Visual Tokens Attack), which constructs adversarial examples from multiple perspectives, with the goal of comprehensively disrupting feature representations and inherent relationships as well as the semantic properties of visual tokens output by image encoders. Using only access to the image encoder in the proposed attack, the generated adversarial examples exhibit transferability across diverse LVLMs utilizing the same image encoder and generality across different tasks. Extensive experiments validate the superior attack performance of the VT-Attack over baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in attacking LVLMs with image encoders, which in turn can provide guidance on the robustness of LVLMs, particularly in terms of the stability of the visual feature space.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce PII-Scope, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate state-of-the-art methodologies for PII extraction attacks targeting LLMs across diverse threat settings. Our study provides a deeper understanding of these attacks by uncovering several hyperparameters (e.g., demonstration selection) crucial to their effectiveness. Building on this understanding, we extend our study to more realistic attack scenarios, exploring PII attacks that employ advanced adversarial strategies, including repeated and diverse querying, and leveraging iterative learning for continual PII extraction. Through extensive experimentation, our results reveal a notable underestimation of PII leakage in existing single-query attacks. In fact, we show that with sophisticated adversarial capabilities and a limited query budget, PII extraction rates can increase by up to fivefold when targeting the pretrained model. Moreover, we evaluate PII leakage on finetuned models, showing that they are more vulnerable to leakage than pretrained models. Overall, our work establishes a rigorous empirical benchmark for PII extraction attacks in realistic threat scenarios and provides a strong foundation for developing effective mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advent of aerial image datasets, dense stereo matching has gained tremendous progress. This work analyses dense stereo correspondence analysis on aerial images using different techniques. Traditional methods, optimization based methods and learning based methods have been implemented and compared here for aerial images. For traditional methods, we implemented the architecture of Stereo SGBM while using different cost functions to get an understanding of their performance on aerial datasets. Analysis of most of the methods in standard datasets has shown good performance, however in case of aerial dataset, not much benchmarking is available. Visual qualitative and quantitative analysis has been carried out for two stereo aerial datasets in order to compare different cost functions and techniques for the purpose of depth estimation from stereo images. Using existing pre-trained models, recent learning based architectures have also been tested on stereo pairs along with different cost functions in SGBM. The outputs and given ground truth are compared using MSE, SSIM and other error metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite width two layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron model we show that, depending on the value of the margin and the constrained density, there is a line separating a phase in which the distribution of overlaps of typical states does not possess a gap from one in which it does. Our results show that the hypothesis underlying some recently developed theorems claiming that Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms are able to reach capacity, does not hold in general. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity both in cases where there is and there is not a non-overlap gap phase for the typical states. This, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Cao, Cheng Zhang, Pedro Gimenes, Jianqiao Lu, Jianyi Cheng, Yiren Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven effective in reducing the computational requirements for running inference on these models. In this study, we focus on a straightforward question: When aiming for a specific accuracy or perplexity target for low-precision quantization, how many high-precision numbers or calculations are required to preserve as we scale LLMs to larger sizes? We first introduce a critical metric named the quantization ratio, which compares the number of parameters quantized to low-precision arithmetic against the total parameter count. Through extensive and carefully controlled experiments across different model families, arithmetic types, and quantization granularities (e.g. layer-wise, matmul-wise), we identify two central phenomenons. 1) The larger the models, the better they can preserve performance with an increased quantization ratio, as measured by perplexity in pre-training tasks or accuracy in downstream tasks. 2) The finer the granularity of mixed-precision quantization (e.g., matmul-wise), the more the model can increase the quantization ratio. We believe these observed phenomena offer valuable insights for future AI hardware design and the development of advanced Efficient AI algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models have recently become a popular research direction within computational pathology. They are intended to be general-purpose feature extractors, promising to achieve good performance on a range of downstream tasks. Real-world pathology image data does however exhibit considerable variability. Foundation models should be robust to these variations and other distribution shifts which might be encountered in practice. We evaluate two computational pathology foundation models: UNI (trained on more than 100,000 whole-slide images) and CONCH (trained on more than 1.1 million image-caption pairs), by utilizing them as feature extractors within prostate cancer grading models. We find that while UNI and CONCH perform well relative to baselines, the absolute performance can still be far from satisfactory in certain settings. The fact that foundation models have been trained on large and varied datasets does not guarantee that downstream models always will be robust to common distribution shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinfeng Zhu, Jiaze Cao, Yuanzhi Cai, Lei Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud semantic segmentation, the process of classifying each point into predefined categories, is essential for 3D scene understanding. While image-based segmentation is widely adopted due to its maturity, methods relying solely on RGB information often suffer from degraded performance due to color inaccuracies. Recent advancements have incorporated additional features such as intensity and geometric information, yet RGB channels continue to negatively impact segmentation accuracy when errors in colorization occur. Despite this, previous studies have not rigorously quantified the effects of erroneous colorization on segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical approach to evaluate the impact of inaccurate RGB information on image-based point cloud segmentation. We categorize RGB inaccuracies into two types: incorrect color information and similar color information. Our results demonstrate that both types of color inaccuracies significantly degrade segmentation accuracy, with similar color errors particularly affecting the extraction of geometric features. These findings highlight the critical need to reassess the role of RGB information in point cloud segmentation and its implications for future algorithm design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Ashman, Cristiana Diaconu, Eric Langezaal, Adrian Weller, Richard E. Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Many important problems require modelling large-scale spatio-temporal datasets, with one prevalent example being weather forecasting. Recently, transformer-based approaches have shown great promise in a range of weather forecasting problems. However, these have mostly focused on gridded data sources, neglecting the wealth of unstructured, off-the-grid data from observational measurements such as those at weather stations. A promising family of models suitable for such tasks are neural processes (NPs), notably the family of transformer neural processes (TNPs). Although TNPs have shown promise on small spatio-temporal datasets, they are unable to scale to the quantities of data used by state-of-the-art weather and climate models. This limitation stems from their lack of efficient attention mechanisms. We address this shortcoming through the introduction of gridded pseudo-token TNPs which employ specialised encoders and decoders to handle unstructured observations and utilise a processor containing gridded pseudo-tokens that leverage efficient attention mechanisms. Our method consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines on various synthetic and real-world regression tasks involving large-scale data, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. The real-life experiments are performed on weather data, demonstrating the potential of our approach to bring performance and computational benefits when applied at scale in a weather modelling pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi Gong, Hang Yu, Cong Liao, Bingchang Liu, Chaoyu Chen, Jianguo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) benefits the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) by providing a single model with improved performance and generalization ability across tasks, presenting a resource-efficient alternative to developing separate models for each task. Yet, existing MTL strategies for LLMs often fall short by either being computationally intensive or failing to ensure simultaneous task convergence. This paper presents CoBa, a new MTL approach designed to effectively manage task convergence balance with minimal computational overhead. Utilizing Relative Convergence Scores (RCS), Absolute Convergence Scores (ACS), and a Divergence Factor (DF), CoBa dynamically adjusts task weights during the training process, ensuring that the validation loss of all tasks progress towards convergence at an even pace while mitigating the issue of individual task divergence. The results of our experiments involving three disparate datasets underscore that this approach not only fosters equilibrium in task improvement but enhances the LLMs' performance by up to 13% relative to the second-best baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hari Prabhat Gupta, Rahul Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Forest fires pose a significant threat to the environment, human life, and property. Early detection and response are crucial to mitigating the impact of these disasters. However, traditional forest fire detection methods are often hindered by our reliability on manual observation and satellite imagery with low spatial resolution. This paper emphasizes the role of transfer learning in enhancing forest fire detection in India, particularly in overcoming data collection challenges and improving model accuracy across various regions. We compare traditional learning methods with transfer learning, focusing on the unique challenges posed by regional differences in terrain, climate, and vegetation. Transfer learning can be categorized into several types based on the similarity between the source and target tasks, as well as the type of knowledge transferred. One key method is utilizing pre-trained models for efficient transfer learning, which significantly reduces the need for extensive labeled data. We outline the transfer learning process, demonstrating how researchers can adapt pre-trained models like MobileNetV2 for specific tasks such as forest fire detection. Finally, we present experimental results from training and evaluating a deep learning model using the Uttarakhand forest fire dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of transfer learning in this context.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a method, which allows efficient and safe approximation of model predictive controllers using kernel interpolation. Since the computational complexity of the approximating function scales linearly with the number of data points, we propose to use a scoring function which chooses the most promising data. To further reduce the complexity of the approximation, we restrict our considerations to the set of closed-loop reachable states. That is, the approximating function only has to be accurate within this set. This makes our method especially suited for systems, where the set of initial conditions is small. In order to guarantee safety and high performance of the designed approximated controller, we use reachability analysis based on Monte Carlo methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Ashtari, Kevin B. Stevenson, David Sing, Mercedes Lopez-Morales, Munazza K. Alam, Nikolay K. Nikolov, Thomas M. Evans-Soma</p>
<p>Abstract: Producing optimized and accurate transmission spectra of exoplanets from telescope data has traditionally been a manual and labor-intensive procedure. Here we present the results of the first attempt to improve and standardize this procedure using artificial intelligence (AI) based processing of light curves and spectroscopic data from transiting exoplanets observed with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument. We implement an AI-based parameter optimizer that autonomously operates the Eureka pipeline to produce homogeneous transmission spectra of publicly available HST WFC3 datasets, spanning exoplanet types from hot Jupiters to sub-Neptunes. Surveying 43 exoplanets with temperatures between 280 and 2580 Kelvin, we confirm modeled relationships between the amplitude of the water band at 1.4um in hot Jupiters and their equilibrium temperatures. We also identify a similar, novel trend in Neptune/sub-Neptune atmospheres, but shifted to cooler temperatures. Excitingly, a planet mass versus equilibrium temperature diagram reveals a "Clear Sky Corridor," where planets between 700 and 1700 Kelvin (depending on the mass) show stronger 1.4um H2O band measurements. This novel trend points to metallicity as a potentially important driver of aerosol formation. As we unveil and include these new discoveries into our understanding of aerosol formation, we enter a thrilling future for the study of exoplanet atmospheres. With HST sculpting this foundational understanding for aerosol formation in various exoplanet types, ranging from Jupiters to sub-Neptunes, we present a compelling platform for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to discover similar atmospheric trends for more planets across a broader wavelength range.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Narjes Benameur, Ramzi Mahmoudi, Mohamed Deriche, Amira fayouka, Imene Masmoudi, Nessrine Zoghlami</p>
<p>Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most important clinical parameter of cardiovascular function. The accuracy in estimating this parameter is highly dependent upon the precise segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) structure at the end diastole and systole phases. Therefore, it is crucial to develop robust algorithms for the precise segmentation of the heart structure during different phases. Methodology: In this work, an improved 3D UNet model is introduced to segment the myocardium and LV, while excluding papillary muscles, as per the recommendation of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance. For the practical testing of the proposed framework, a total of 8,400 cardiac MRI images were collected and analysed from the military hospital in Tunis (HMPIT), as well as the popular ACDC public dataset. As performance metrics, we used the Dice coefficient and the F1 score for validation/testing of the LV and the myocardium segmentation. Results: The data was split into 70%, 10%, and 20% for training, validation, and testing, respectively. It is worth noting that the proposed segmentation model was tested across three axis views: basal, medio basal and apical at two different cardiac phases: end diastole and end systole instances. The experimental results showed a Dice index of 0.965 and 0.945, and an F1 score of 0.801 and 0.799, at the end diastolic and systolic phases, respectively. Additionally, clinical evaluation outcomes revealed a significant difference in the LVEF and other clinical parameters when the papillary muscles were included or excluded.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Deriche, Mohammad Marufur</p>
<p>Abstract: In clinical procedures, precise localization of the target area is an essential step for clinical diagnosis and screening. For many diagnostic applications, lung segmentation of chest X-ray images is an essential first step that significantly reduces the image size to speed up the subsequent analysis. One of the primary difficulties with this task is segmenting the lung regions covered by dense abnormalities also known as opacities due to diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis. SAM has astonishing generalization capabilities for category agnostic segmentation. In this study we propose an algorithm to improve zero shot performance of SAM on lung region segmentation task by automatic prompt selection. Two separate UNet models were trained, one for predicting lung segments and another for heart segment. Though these predictions lack fine details around the edges, they provide positive and negative points as prompt for SAM. Using proposed prompting method zero shot performance of SAM is evaluated on two benchmark datasets. ViT-l version of the model achieved slightly better performance compared to other two versions, ViTh and ViTb. It yields an average Dice score of 95.5 percent and 94.9 percent on hold out data for two datasets respectively. Though, for most of the images, SAM did outstanding segmentation, its prediction was way off for some of the images. After careful inspection it is found that all of these images either had extreme abnormality or distorted shape. Unlike most of the research performed so far on lung segmentation from CXR images using SAM, this study proposes a fully automated prompt selection process only from the input image. Our finding indicates that using pretrained models for prompt selection can utilize SAM impressive generalization capability to its full extent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mutian He, Philip N. Garner</p>
<p>Abstract: Architectures such as Linformer and Mamba have recently emerged as competitive linear time replacements for transformers. However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a safety modulator actor-critic (SMAC) method to address safety constraint and overestimation mitigation in model-free safe reinforcement learning (RL). A safety modulator is developed to satisfy safety constraints by modulating actions, allowing the policy to ignore safety constraint and focus on maximizing reward. Additionally, a distributional critic with a theoretical update rule for SMAC is proposed to mitigate the overestimation of Q-values with safety constraints. Both simulation and real-world scenarios experiments on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) hovering confirm that the SMAC can effectively maintain safety constraints and outperform mainstream baseline algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a variant of the Shapley value, the group Shapley value, to interpret counterfactual simulations in structural economic models by quantifying the importance of different components. Our framework compares two sets of parameters, partitioned into multiple groups, and applying group Shapley value decomposition yields unique additive contributions to the changes between these sets. The relative contributions sum to one, enabling us to generate an importance table that is as easily interpretable as a regression table. The group Shapley value can be characterized as the solution to a constrained weighted least squares problem. Using this property, we develop robust decomposition methods to address scenarios where inputs for the group Shapley value are missing. We first apply our methodology to a simple Roy model and then illustrate its usefulness by revisiting two published papers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avik Pal, Max van Spengler, Guido Maria D'Amely di Melendugno, Alessandro Flaborea, Fabio Galasso, Pascal Mettes</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-text representation learning forms a cornerstone in vision-language models, where pairs of images and textual descriptions are contrastively aligned in a shared embedding space. Since visual and textual concepts are naturally hierarchical, recent work has shown that hyperbolic space can serve as a high-potential manifold to learn vision-language representation with strong downstream performance. In this work, for the first time we show how to fully leverage the innate hierarchical nature of hyperbolic embeddings by looking beyond individual image-text pairs. We propose Compositional Entailment Learning for hyperbolic vision-language models. The idea is that an image is not only described by a sentence but is itself a composition of multiple object boxes, each with their own textual description. Such information can be obtained freely by extracting nouns from sentences and using openly available localized grounding models. We show how to hierarchically organize images, image boxes, and their textual descriptions through contrastive and entailment-based objectives. Empirical evaluation on a hyperbolic vision-language model trained with millions of image-text pairs shows that the proposed compositional learning approach outperforms conventional Euclidean CLIP learning, as well as recent hyperbolic alternatives, with better zero-shot and retrieval generalization and clearly stronger hierarchical performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajdeep Haldar, Yue Xing, Qifan Song, Guang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have shown theoretically and empirically that redundant data dimensions are a source of adversarial vulnerability. However, the inverse doesn't seem to hold in practice; employing dimension-reduction techniques doesn't exhibit robustness as expected. In this work, we consider classification tasks and characterize the data distribution as a low-dimensional manifold, with high/low variance features defining the on/off manifold direction. We argue that clean training experiences poor convergence in the off-manifold direction caused by the ill-conditioning in widely used first-order optimizers like gradient descent. The poor convergence then acts as a source of adversarial vulnerability when the dataset is inseparable in the on-manifold direction. We provide theoretical results for logistic regression and a 2-layer linear network on the considered data distribution. Furthermore, we advocate using second-order methods that are immune to ill-conditioning and lead to better robustness. We perform experiments and exhibit tremendous robustness improvements in clean training through long training and the employment of second-order methods, corroborating our framework. Additionally, we find the inclusion of batch-norm layers hinders such robustness gains. We attribute this to differing implicit biases between traditional and batch-normalized neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Lalande, Elizabeth Tasker, Kenji Doya</p>
<p>Abstract: The exoplanet archive is an incredible resource of information on the properties of discovered extrasolar planets, but statistical analysis has been limited by the number of missing values. One of the most informative bulk properties is planet mass, which is particularly challenging to measure with more than 70\% of discovered planets with no measured value. We compare the capabilities of five different machine learning algorithms that can utilize multidimensional incomplete datasets to estimate missing properties for imputing planet mass. The results are compared when using a partial subset of the archive with a complete set of six planet properties, and where all planet discoveries are leveraged in an incomplete set of six and eight planet properties. We find that imputation results improve with more data even when the additional data is incomplete, and allows a mass prediction for any planet regardless of which properties are known. Our favored algorithm is the newly developed $k$NN$\times$KDE, which can return a probability distribution for the imputed properties. The shape of this distribution can indicate the algorithm's level of confidence, and also inform on the underlying demographics of the exoplanet population. We demonstrate how the distributions can be interpreted with a series of examples for planets where the discovery was made with either the transit method, or radial velocity method. Finally, we test the generative capability of the $k$NN$\times$KDE to create a large synthetic population of planets based on the archive, and identify potential categories of planets from groups of properties in the multidimensional space. All codes are Open Source.</p>

<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision. They can be used not only for conventional digital image material to recognize patterns, but also for feature extraction from digital imagery representing spectral and rhythm features extracted from time-domain digital audio signals for the acoustic classification of sounds. Different spectral and rhythm feature representations like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams are investigated in terms of the audio classification performance using a deep convolutional neural network. It can be clearly shown that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) perform significantly better then the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio classification tasks using deep CNNs. The experiments were carried out with the aid of the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihyun Yu, Sangkyung Kwak, Huiwon Jang, Jongheon Jeong, Jonathan Huang, Jinwoo Shin, Saining Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the denoising process in (generative) diffusion models can induce meaningful (discriminative) representations inside the model, though the quality of these representations still lags behind those learned through recent self-supervised learning methods. We argue that one main bottleneck in training large-scale diffusion models for generation lies in effectively learning these representations. Moreover, training can be made easier by incorporating high-quality external visual representations, rather than relying solely on the diffusion models to learn them independently. We study this by introducing a straightforward regularization called REPresentation Alignment (REPA), which aligns the projections of noisy input hidden states in denoising networks with clean image representations obtained from external, pretrained visual encoders. The results are striking: our simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality when applied to popular diffusion and flow-based transformers, such as DiTs and SiTs. For instance, our method can speed up SiT training by over 17.5$\times$, matching the performance (without classifier-free guidance) of a SiT-XL model trained for 7M steps in less than 400K steps. In terms of final generation quality, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results of FID=1.42 using classifier-free guidance with the guidance interval.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces ELMO, a real-time upsampling motion capture framework designed for a single LiDAR sensor. Modeled as a conditional autoregressive transformer-based upsampling motion generator, ELMO achieves 60 fps motion capture from a 20 fps LiDAR point cloud sequence. The key feature of ELMO is the coupling of the self-attention mechanism with thoughtfully designed embedding modules for motion and point clouds, significantly elevating the motion quality. To facilitate accurate motion capture, we develop a one-time skeleton calibration model capable of predicting user skeleton offsets from a single-frame point cloud. Additionally, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique utilizing a LiDAR simulator, which enhances global root tracking to improve environmental understanding. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we compare ELMO with state-of-the-art methods in both image-based and point cloud-based motion capture. We further conduct an ablation study to validate our design principles. ELMO's fast inference time makes it well-suited for real-time applications, exemplified in our demo video featuring live streaming and interactive gaming scenarios. Furthermore, we contribute a high-quality LiDAR-mocap synchronized dataset comprising 20 different subjects performing a range of motions, which can serve as a valuable resource for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haining Yu, Yizhou Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: We present unexpected findings from a large-scale benchmark study evaluating Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation algorithms. By running 16 modern CATE models across 43,200 datasets, we find that: (a) 62\% of CATE estimates have a higher Mean Squared Error (MSE) than a trivial zero-effect predictor, rendering them ineffective; (b) in datasets with at least one useful CATE estimate, 80\% still have higher MSE than a constant-effect model; and (c) Orthogonality-based models outperform other models only 30\% of the time, despite widespread optimism about their performance. These findings expose significant limitations in current CATE models and suggest ample opportunities for further research.
  Our findings stem from a novel application of \textit{observational sampling}, originally developed to evaluate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimates from observational methods with experiment data. To adapt observational sampling for CATE evaluation, we introduce a statistical parameter, $Q$, equal to MSE minus a constant and preserves the ranking of models by their MSE. We then derive a family of sample statistics, collectively called $\hat{Q}$, that can be computed from real-world data. We prove that $\hat{Q}$ is a consistent estimator of $Q$ under mild technical conditions. When used in observational sampling, $\hat{Q}$ is unbiased and asymptotically selects the model with the smallest MSE. To ensure the benchmark reflects real-world heterogeneity, we handpick datasets where outcomes come from field rather than simulation. By combining the new observational sampling method, new statistics, and real-world datasets, the benchmark provides a unique perspective on CATE estimator performance and uncover gaps in capturing real-world heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weichuan Wang, Zhaoyi Li, Defu Lian, Chen Ma, Linqi Song, Ying Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized the NLP field, while they still fall short in some specific down-stream tasks. In the work, we focus on utilizing LLMs to perform machine translation, where we observe that two patterns of errors frequently occur and drastically affect the translation quality: language mismatch and repetition. The work sets out to explore the potential for mitigating these two issues by leveraging model editing methods, e.g., by locating Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons or something that are responsible for the errors and deactivating them in the inference time. We find that directly applying such methods either limited effect on the targeted errors or has significant negative side-effect on the general translation quality, indicating that the located components may also be crucial for ensuring machine translation with LLMs on the rails. To this end, we propose to refine the located components by fetching the intersection of the locating results under different language settings, filtering out the aforementioned information that is irrelevant to targeted errors. The experiment results empirically demonstrate that our methods can effectively reduce the language mismatch and repetition ratios and meanwhile enhance or keep the general translation quality in most cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Liu, Kejian Shi, Alexander R. Fabbri, Yilun Zhao, Peifeng Wang, Chien-Sheng Wu, Shafiq Joty, Arman Cohan</p>
<p>Abstract: The automatic evaluation of instruction following typically involves using large language models (LLMs) to assess response quality. However, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation of these LLM-based evaluators across two dimensions: the base LLMs and the evaluation protocols. Therefore, we present a thorough meta-evaluation of instruction following, including 25 base LLMs and 15 recently proposed evaluation protocols, on 4 human-annotated datasets, assessing the evaluation accuracy of the LLM-evaluators. Our evaluation allows us to identify the best-performing base LLMs and evaluation protocols with a high degree of robustness. Moreover, our large-scale evaluation reveals: (1) Base LLM performance ranking remains largely consistent across evaluation protocols, with less capable LLMs showing greater improvement from protocol enhancements; (2) Robust evaluation of evaluation protocols requires many base LLMs with varying capability levels, as protocol effectiveness can depend on the base LLM used; (3) Evaluation results on different datasets are not always consistent, so a rigorous evaluation requires multiple datasets with distinctive features. We release our meta-evaluation suite ReIFE, which provides the codebase and evaluation result collection for more than 500 LLM-evaluator configurations, to support future research in instruction-following evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Jere, Lizhong Zheng, Karim Said, Lingjia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning is making a profound impact in the physical layer of wireless communications. Despite exhibiting outstanding empirical performance in tasks such as MIMO receive processing, the reasons behind the demonstrated superior performance improvement remain largely unclear. In this work, we advance the field of Explainable AI (xAI) in the physical layer of wireless communications utilizing signal processing principles. Specifically, we focus on the task of MIMO-OFDM receive processing (e.g., symbol detection) using reservoir computing (RC), a framework within recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which outperforms both conventional and other learning-based MIMO detectors. Our analysis provides a signal processing-based, first-principles understanding of the corresponding operation of the RC. Building on this fundamental understanding, we are able to systematically incorporate the domain knowledge of wireless systems (e.g., channel statistics) into the design of the underlying RNN by directly configuring the untrained RNN weights for MIMO-OFDM symbol detection. The introduced RNN weight configuration has been validated through extensive simulations demonstrating significant performance improvements. This establishes a foundation for explainable RC-based architectures in MIMO-OFDM receive processing and provides a roadmap for incorporating domain knowledge into the design of neural networks for NextG systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonglin Yang, Wanhao Liu, Ben Gao, Tong Xie, Yuqiang Li, Wanli Ouyang, Soujanya Poria, Erik Cambria, Dongzhan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific discovery contributes largely to human society's prosperity, and recent progress shows that LLMs could potentially catalyze this process. However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate this central research question: Can LLMs automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research hypotheses given only a chemistry research background (consisting of a research question and/or a background survey), without limitation on the domain of the research question? After extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we propose an assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted from a research background and several inspirations. With this key insight, we break the central question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief, they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them higher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of 51 chemistry papers published in Nature, Science, or a similar level in 2024 (all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided by chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis, given only the background and a large randomly selected chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We also develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption, consisting of three stages reflecting the three smaller questions. The proposed method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground truth ones, covering the main innovations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Gomes, Jannis Kueck, Mara Mattes, Martin Spindler, Alexey Zaytsev</p>
<p>Abstract: Collusion is a complex phenomenon in which companies secretly collaborate to engage in fraudulent practices. This paper presents an innovative methodology for detecting and predicting collusion patterns in different national markets using neural networks (NNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs are particularly well suited to this task because they can exploit the inherent network structures present in collusion and many other economic problems. Our approach consists of two phases: In Phase I, we develop and train models on individual market datasets from Japan, the United States, two regions in Switzerland, Italy, and Brazil, focusing on predicting collusion in single markets. In Phase II, we extend the models' applicability through zero-shot learning, employing a transfer learning approach that can detect collusion in markets in which training data is unavailable. This phase also incorporates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to evaluate the models' performance on unseen datasets from other countries and regions. In our empirical study, we show that GNNs outperform NNs in detecting complex collusive patterns. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on preventing collusion and optimizing detection methodologies, providing valuable guidance on the use of NNs and GNNs in economic applications to enhance market fairness and economic welfare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ebube Alor, Ahmad Abdellatif, SayedHassan Khatoonabadi, Emad Shihab</p>
<p>Abstract: Software engineering (SE) chatbots are increasingly gaining attention for their role in enhancing development processes. At the core of chatbots are the Natural Language Understanding platforms (NLUs), which enable them to comprehend and respond to user queries. Before deploying NLUs, there is a need to train them with labeled data. However, acquiring such labeled data for SE chatbots is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets. This challenge arises because training SE chatbots requires specialized vocabulary and phrases not found in typical language datasets. Consequently, chatbot developers often resort to manually annotating user queries to gather the data necessary for training effective chatbots, a process that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Previous studies propose approaches to support chatbot practitioners in annotating users' posed queries. However, these approaches require human intervention to generate rules, called labeling functions (LFs), that identify and categorize user queries based on specific patterns in the data. To address this issue, we propose an approach to automatically generate LFs by extracting patterns from labeled user queries. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the queries of four diverse SE datasets (namely AskGit, MSA, Ask Ubuntu, and Stack Overflow) and measure the performance improvement gained from training the NLU on the queries labeled by the generated LFs. We find that the generated LFs effectively label data with AUC scores of up to 85.3%, and NLU's performance improvement of up to 27.2% across the studied datasets. Furthermore, our results show that the number of LFs used to generate LFs affects the labeling performance. We believe that our approach can save time and resources in labeling users' queries, allowing practitioners to focus on core chatbot functionalities.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, a new classification model based on covariance matrices is built in order to classify buried objects. The inputs of the proposed models are the hyperbola thumbnails obtained with a classical Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) system. These thumbnails are entered in the first layers of a classical CNN which results in a covariance matrix by using the outputs of the convolutional filters. Next, the covariance matrix is given to a network composed of specific layers to classify Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. We show in a large database that our approach outperform shallow networks designed for GPR data and conventional CNNs typically used in computer vision applications, particularly when the number of training data decreases and in the presence of mislabeled data. We also illustrate the interest of our models when training data and test sets are obtained from different weather modes or considerations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Tigunova, Thomas Ricatte, Ghadir Eraisha</p>
<p>Abstract: Getting a good understanding of the customer intent is essential in e-commerce search engines. In particular, associating the correct product type to a search query plays a vital role in surfacing correct products to the customers. Query product type classification (Q2PT) is a particularly challenging task because search queries are short and ambiguous, the number of existing product categories is extremely large, spanning thousands of values. Moreover, international marketplaces face additional challenges, such as language and dialect diversity and cultural differences, influencing the interpretation of the query. In this work we focus on Q2PT prediction in the global multilocale e-commerce markets. The common approach of training Q2PT models for each locale separately shows significant performance drops in low-resource stores. Moreover, this method does not allow for a smooth expansion to a new country, requiring to collect the data and train a new locale-specific Q2PT model from scratch. To tackle this, we propose to use transfer learning from the highresource to the low-resource locales, to achieve global parity of Q2PT performance. We benchmark the per-locale Q2PT model against the unified one, which shares the training data and model structure across all worldwide stores. Additionally, we compare locale-aware and locale-agnostic Q2PT models, showing the task dependency on the country-specific traits. We conduct extensive quantiative and qualitative analysis of Q2PT models on the large-scale e-commerce dataset across 20 worldwide locales, which shows that unified locale-aware Q2PT model has superior performance over the alternatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangyu Teng, Yang Liu, Jing Liu, Liang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the e-commerce industry has seen a rapid increase in the demand for advanced AI-driven customer service solutions. Traditional cloud-based models face limitations in terms of latency, personalized services, and privacy concerns. Furthermore, end devices often lack the computational resources to deploy large AI models effectively. In this paper, we propose an innovative End-Cloud Collaboration (ECC) framework for advanced AI customer service in e-commerce. This framework integrates the advantages of large cloud models and mid/small-sized end models by deeply exploring the generalization potential of cloud models and effectively utilizing the computing power resources of terminal chips, alleviating the strain on computing resources to some extent. Specifically, the large cloud model acts as a teacher, guiding and promoting the learning of the end model, which significantly reduces the end model's reliance on large-scale, high-quality data and thereby addresses the data bottleneck in traditional end model training, offering a new paradigm for the rapid deployment of industry applications. Additionally, we introduce an online evolutive learning strategy that enables the end model to continuously iterate and upgrade based on guidance from the cloud model and real-time user feedback. This strategy ensures that the model can flexibly adapt to the rapid changes in application scenarios while avoiding the uploading of sensitive information by performing local fine-tuning, achieving the dual goals of privacy protection and personalized service. %We make systematic contributions to the customized model fine-tuning methods in the e-commerce domain. To conclude, we implement in-depth corpus collection (e.g., data organization, cleaning, and preprocessing) and train an ECC-based industry-specific model for e-commerce customer service.</p>

<p>Abstract: Managing complex disaster risks requires interdisciplinary efforts. Breaking down silos between law, social sciences, and natural sciences is critical for all processes of disaster risk reduction. This enables adaptive systems for the rapid evolution of AI technology, which has significantly impacted the intersection of law and natural environments. Exploring how AI influences legal frameworks and environmental management, while also examining how legal and environmental considerations can confine AI within the socioeconomic domain, is essential.
  From a co-production review perspective, drawing on insights from lawyers, social scientists, and environmental scientists, principles for responsible data mining are proposed based on safety, transparency, fairness, accountability, and contestability. This discussion offers a blueprint for interdisciplinary collaboration to create adaptive law systems based on AI integration of knowledge from environmental and social sciences. Discrepancies in the use of language between environmental scientists and decision-makers in terms of usefulness and accuracy hamper how AI can be used based on the principles of legal considerations for a safe, trustworthy, and contestable disaster management framework.
  When social networks are useful for mitigating disaster risks based on AI, the legal implications related to privacy and liability of the outcomes of disaster management must be considered. Fair and accountable principles emphasise environmental considerations and foster socioeconomic discussions related to public engagement. AI also has an important role to play in education, bringing together the next generations of law, social sciences, and natural sciences to work on interdisciplinary solutions in harmony.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07128">Neural Differential Appearance Equations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Liu, Tobias Ritschel</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a method to reproduce dynamic appearance textures with space-stationary but time-varying visual statistics. While most previous work decomposes dynamic textures into static appearance and motion, we focus on dynamic appearance that results not from motion but variations of fundamental properties, such as rusting, decaying, melting, and weathering. To this end, we adopt the neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to learn the underlying dynamics of appearance from a target exemplar. We simulate the ODE in two phases. At the "warm-up" phase, the ODE diffuses a random noise to an initial state. We then constrain the further evolution of this ODE to replicate the evolution of visual feature statistics in the exemplar during the generation phase. The particular innovation of this work is the neural ODE achieving both denoising and evolution for dynamics synthesis, with a proposed temporal training scheme. We study both relightable (BRDF) and non-relightable (RGB) appearance models. For both we introduce new pilot datasets, allowing, for the first time, to study such phenomena: For RGB we provide 22 dynamic textures acquired from free online sources; For BRDFs, we further acquire a dataset of 21 flash-lit videos of time-varying materials, enabled by a simple-to-construct setup. Our experiments show that our method consistently yields realistic and coherent results, whereas prior works falter under pronounced temporal appearance variations. A user study confirms our approach is preferred to previous work for such exemplars.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Xu, Xin Zhou, Molin Wang, Boya Zhang, Wenhao Jiang, Francine Laden, Helen H. Suh, Adam A. Szpiro, Donna Spiegelman, Zuoheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: One way to quantify exposure to air pollution and its constituents in epidemiologic studies is to use an individual's nearest monitor. This strategy results in potential inaccuracy in the actual personal exposure, introducing bias in estimating the health effects of air pollution and its constituents, especially when evaluating the causal effects of correlated multi-pollutant constituents measured with correlated error. This paper addresses estimation and inference for the causal effect of one constituent in the presence of other PM2.5 constituents, accounting for measurement error and correlations. We used a linear regression calibration model, fitted with generalized estimating equations in an external validation study, and extended a double/debiased machine learning (DML) approach to correct for measurement error and estimate the effect of interest in the main study. We demonstrated that the DML estimator with regression calibration is consistent and derived its asymptotic variance. Simulations showed that the proposed estimator reduced bias and attained nominal coverage probability across most simulation settings. We applied this method to assess the causal effects of PM2.5 constituents on cognitive function in the Nurses' Health Study and identified two PM2.5 constituents, Br and Mn, that showed a negative causal effect on cognitive function after measurement error correction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaosen Zheng, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Jing Jiang, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic LLM benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard-Auto, and MT-Bench, have become popular for evaluating language models due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared to human evaluation. Achieving high win rates on these benchmarks can significantly boost the promotional impact of newly released language models. This promotional benefit may motivate tricks, such as manipulating model output length or style to game win rates, even though several mechanisms have been developed to control length and disentangle style to reduce gameability. Nonetheless, we show that even a "null model" that always outputs a constant response (irrelevant to input instructions) can cheat automatic benchmarks and achieve top-ranked win rates: an 86.5% LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0; an 83.0 score on Arena-Hard-Auto; and a 9.55 score on MT-Bench. Moreover, the crafted cheating outputs are transferable because we assume that the instructions of these benchmarks (e.g., 805 samples of AlpacaEval 2.0) are private and cannot be accessed. While our experiments are primarily proof-of-concept, an adversary could use LLMs to generate more imperceptible cheating responses, unethically benefiting from high win rates and promotional impact. Our findings call for the development of anti-cheating mechanisms for reliable automatic benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Cheating-LLM-Benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a model for diagnosing Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Our approach integrates brain connectivity data from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI), employing graph neural networks (GNNs) for fused graph classification. To improve diagnostic accuracy, we introduce a loss function that maximizes inter-class and minimizes intra-class margins. We also analyze network node centrality, calculating degree, subgraph, and eigenvector centralities on a bimodal fused brain graph to identify pathological regions linked to ASD. Two non-parametric tests assess the statistical significance of these centralities between ASD patients and healthy controls. Our results reveal consistency between the tests, yet the identified regions differ significantly across centralities, suggesting distinct physiological interpretations. These findings enhance our understanding of ASD's neurobiological basis and offer new directions for clinical diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stock trend forecasting, a challenging problem in the financial domain, involves ex-tensive data and related indicators. Relying solely on empirical analysis often yields unsustainable and ineffective results. Machine learning researchers have demonstrated that the application of random forest algorithm can enhance predictions in this context, playing a crucial auxiliary role in forecasting stock trends. This study introduces a new approach to stock market prediction by integrating sentiment analysis using FinGPT generative AI model with the traditional Random Forest model. The proposed technique aims to optimize the accuracy of stock price forecasts by leveraging the nuanced understanding of financial sentiments provided by FinGPT. We present a new methodology called "Sentiment-Augmented Random Forest" (SARF), which in-corporates sentiment features into the Random Forest framework. Our experiments demonstrate that SARF outperforms conventional Random Forest and LSTM models with an average accuracy improvement of 9.23% and lower prediction errors in pre-dicting stock market movements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingfa Chen, Xinrong Zhang, Shengding Hu, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: One essential advantage of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) over transformer-based language models is their linear computational complexity concerning the sequence length, which makes them much faster in handling long sequences during inference. However, most publicly available RNNs (e.g., Mamba and RWKV) are trained on sequences with less than 10K tokens, and their effectiveness in longer contexts remains largely unsatisfying so far. In this paper, we study the cause of the inability to process long context for RNNs and suggest critical mitigations. We examine two practical concerns when applying state-of-the-art RNNs to long contexts: (1) the inability to extrapolate to inputs longer than the training length and (2) the upper bound of memory capacity. Addressing the first concern, we first investigate *state collapse* (SC), a phenomenon that causes severe performance degradation on sequence lengths not encountered during training. With controlled experiments, we attribute this to overfitting due to the recurrent state being overparameterized for the training length. For the second concern, we train a series of Mamba-2 models on long documents to empirically estimate the recurrent state capacity in language modeling and passkey retrieval. Then, three SC mitigation methods are proposed to improve Mamba-2's length generalizability, allowing the model to process more than 1M tokens without SC. We also find that the recurrent state capacity in passkey retrieval scales exponentially to the state size, and we empirically train a Mamba-2 370M with near-perfect passkey retrieval accuracy on 256K context length. This suggests a promising future for RNN-based long-context modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Clement Neo, Luke Ong, Philip Torr, Mor Geva, David Krueger, Fazl Barez</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are powerful tools for processing and understanding text and images. We study the processing of visual tokens in the language model component of LLaVA, a prominent VLM. Our approach focuses on analyzing the localization of object information, the evolution of visual token representations across layers, and the mechanism of integrating visual information for predictions. Through ablation studies, we demonstrated that object identification accuracy drops by over 70\% when object-specific tokens are removed. We observed that visual token representations become increasingly interpretable in the vocabulary space across layers, suggesting an alignment with textual tokens corresponding to image content. Finally, we found that the model extracts object information from these refined representations at the last token position for prediction, mirroring the process in text-only language models for factual association tasks. These findings provide crucial insights into how VLMs process and integrate visual information, bridging the gap between our understanding of language and vision models, and paving the way for more interpretable and controllable multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Wen, Mengyuan Liu, Songtao Wu, Beichen Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeleton-based multi-entity action recognition is a challenging task aiming to identify interactive actions or group activities involving multiple diverse entities. Existing models for individuals often fall short in this task due to the inherent distribution discrepancies among entity skeletons, leading to suboptimal backbone optimization. To this end, we introduce a Convex Hull Adaptive Shift based multi-Entity action recognition method (CHASE), which mitigates inter-entity distribution gaps and unbiases subsequent backbones. Specifically, CHASE comprises a learnable parameterized network and an auxiliary objective. The parameterized network achieves plausible, sample-adaptive repositioning of skeleton sequences through two key components. First, the Implicit Convex Hull Constrained Adaptive Shift ensures that the new origin of the coordinate system is within the skeleton convex hull. Second, the Coefficient Learning Block provides a lightweight parameterization of the mapping from skeleton sequences to their specific coefficients in convex combinations. Moreover, to guide the optimization of this network for discrepancy minimization, we propose the Mini-batch Pair-wise Maximum Mean Discrepancy as the additional objective. CHASE operates as a sample-adaptive normalization method to mitigate inter-entity distribution discrepancies, thereby reducing data bias and improving the subsequent classifier's multi-entity action recognition performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Jin, Ziqi Pang, Bingjun Guo, Yu-Xiong Wang, Jiaxuan You, Jiawei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we approach an overlooked yet critical task Graph2Image: generating images from multimodal attributed graphs (MMAGs). This task poses significant challenges due to the explosion in graph size, dependencies among graph entities, and the need for controllability in graph conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model called InstructG2I. InstructG2I first exploits the graph structure and multimodal information to conduct informative neighbor sampling by combining personalized page rank and re-ranking based on vision-language features. Then, a Graph-QFormer encoder adaptively encodes the graph nodes into an auxiliary set of graph prompts to guide the denoising process of diffusion. Finally, we propose graph classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable generation by varying the strength of graph guidance and multiple connected edges to a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyu Fan, Jiancheng Liu, Licong Lin, Jinghan Jia, Ruiqi Zhang, Song Mei, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences and associated model capabilities (e.g., copyrighted data or harmful content generation) while preserving essential model utilities, without the need for retraining from scratch. Despite the growing need for LLM unlearning, a principled optimization framework remains lacking. To this end, we revisit the state-of-the-art approach, negative preference optimization (NPO), and identify the issue of reference model bias, which could undermine NPO's effectiveness, particularly when unlearning forget data of varying difficulty. Given that, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that 'simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We also provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages, supported by analysis using mixtures of Markov chains. Furthermore, we present extensive experiments validating SimNPO's superiority over existing unlearning baselines in benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, and robustness against relearning attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyi Xiao, Yixin Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex logical query answering (CLQA) is a challenging task that involves finding answer entities for complex logical queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Previous research has explored the use of pre-trained knowledge graph completion (KGC) models, which can predict the missing facts in KGs, to answer complex logical queries. However, KGC models are typically evaluated using ranking evaluation metrics, which may result in values of predictions of KGC models that are not well-calibrated. In this paper, we propose a method for calibrating KGC models, namely CKGC, which enables KGC models to adapt to answering complex logical queries. Notably, CKGC is lightweight and effective. The adaptation function is simple, allowing the model to quickly converge during the adaptation process. The core concept of CKGC is to map the values of predictions of KGC models to the range [0, 1], ensuring that values associated with true facts are close to 1, while values linked to false facts are close to 0. Through experiments on three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed calibration method can significantly boost model performance in the CLQA task. Moreover, our approach can enhance the performance of CLQA while preserving the ranking evaluation metrics of KGC models. The code is available at https://github.com/changyi7231/CKGC.</p>

<p>Abstract: We aim to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for embodied decision making. While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil X. Bhattasali, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Lerrel Pinto, Grace W. Lindsay</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based approaches to quadruped locomotion commonly adopt generic policy architectures like fully connected MLPs. As such architectures contain few inductive biases, it is common in practice to incorporate priors in the form of rewards, training curricula, imitation data, or trajectory generators. In nature, animals are born with priors in the form of their nervous system's architecture, which has been shaped by evolution to confer innate ability and efficient learning. For instance, a horse can walk within hours of birth and can quickly improve with practice. Such architectural priors can also be useful in ANN architectures for AI. In this work, we explore the advantages of a biologically inspired ANN architecture for quadruped locomotion based on neural circuits in the limbs and spinal cord of mammals. Our architecture achieves good initial performance and comparable final performance to MLPs, while using less data and orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Our architecture also exhibits better generalization to task variations, even admitting deployment on a physical robot without standard sim-to-real methods. This work shows that neural circuits can provide valuable architectural priors for locomotion and encourages future work in other sensorimotor skills.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Wang, Xingchen Wan, Ruoxi Sun, Jiefeng Chen, Sercan \"O. Ar{\i}k</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while effective in integrating external knowledge to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be undermined by imperfect retrieval, which may introduce irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Despite its importance, previous studies have rarely explored the behavior of RAG through joint analysis on how errors from imperfect retrieval attribute and propagate, and how potential conflicts arise between the LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. We find that imperfect retrieval augmentation might be inevitable and quite harmful, through controlled analysis under realistic conditions. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To render LLMs resilient to imperfect retrieval, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach that adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments using Gemini and Claude demonstrate that Astute RAG significantly outperforms previous robustness-enhanced RAG methods. Notably, Astute RAG is the only approach that matches or exceeds the performance of LLMs without RAG under worst-case scenarios. Further analysis reveals that Astute RAG effectively resolves knowledge conflicts, improving the reliability and trustworthiness of RAG systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research aims to comprehensively explore building a multimodal foundation model for egocentric video understanding. To achieve this goal, we work on three fronts. First, as there is a lack of QA data for egocentric video understanding, we develop a data engine that efficiently generates 7M high-quality QA samples for egocentric videos ranging from 30 seconds to one hour long, based on human-annotated data. This is currently the largest egocentric QA dataset. Second, we contribute a challenging egocentric QA benchmark with 629 videos and 7,026 questions to evaluate the models' ability in recognizing and memorizing visual details across videos of varying lengths. We introduce a new de-biasing evaluation method to help mitigate the unavoidable language bias present in the models being evaluated. Third, we propose a specialized multimodal architecture featuring a novel "Memory Pointer Prompting" mechanism. This design includes a global glimpse step to gain an overarching understanding of the entire video and identify key visual information, followed by a fallback step that utilizes the key visual information to generate responses. This enables the model to more effectively comprehend extended video content. With the data, benchmark, and model, we successfully build MM-Ego, an egocentric multimodal LLM that shows powerful performance on egocentric video understanding.</p>

Real-time recurrent learning is a causal alternative, but it is highly inefficient. Recently, e-prop was proposed as a causal, local, and efficient practical alternative to these algorithms, providing an approximation of the exact gradient by radically pruning the recurrent dependencies carried over time. Here, we derive RTRL from BPTT using a detailed notation bringing intuition and clarification to how they are connected. Furthermore, we frame e-prop within in the picture, formalising what it approximates. Finally, we derive a family of algorithms of which e-prop is a special case.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a unified representation of the most popular neural network activation functions. Adopting Mittag-Leffler functions of fractional calculus, we propose a flexible and compact functional form that is able to interpolate between various activation functions and mitigate common problems in training neural networks such as vanishing and exploding gradients. The presented gated representation extends the scope of fixed-shape activation functions to their adaptive counterparts whose shape can be learnt from the training data. The derivatives of the proposed functional form can also be expressed in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions making it a suitable candidate for gradient-based backpropagation algorithms. By training multiple neural networks of different complexities on various datasets with different sizes, we demonstrate that adopting a unified gated representation of activation functions offers a promising and affordable alternative to individual built-in implementations of activation functions in conventional machine learning frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: A novel Policy Gradient (PG) algorithm, called $\textit{Matryoshka Policy Gradient}$ (MPG), is introduced and studied, in the context of fixed-horizon max-entropy reinforcement learning, where an agent aims at maximizing entropy bonuses additional to its cumulative rewards. In the linear function approximation setting with softmax policies, we prove uniqueness and characterize the optimal policy of the entropy regularized objective, together with global convergence of MPG. These results are proved in the case of continuous state and action space. MPG is intuitive, theoretically sound and we furthermore show that the optimal policy of the infinite horizon max-entropy objective can be approximated arbitrarily well by the optimal policy of the MPG framework. Finally, we provide a criterion for global optimality when the policy is parametrized by a neural network in terms of the neural tangent kernel at convergence. As a proof of concept, we evaluate numerically MPG on standard test benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Chen, Hao Tan, Tao Wang, Tianrun Shen, Tong Lu, Qiuying Peng, Cheng Cheng, Yue Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel transformer architecture for graph representation learning. The core insight of our method is to fully consider the information propagation among nodes and edges in a graph when building the attention module in the transformer blocks. Specifically, we propose a new attention mechanism called Graph Propagation Attention (GPA). It explicitly passes the information among nodes and edges in three ways, i.e. node-to-node, node-to-edge, and edge-to-node, which is essential for learning graph-structured data. On this basis, we design an effective transformer architecture named Graph Propagation Transformer (GPTrans) to further help learn graph data. We verify the performance of GPTrans in a wide range of graph learning experiments on several benchmark datasets. These results show that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art transformer-based graph models with better performance. The code will be released at https://github.com/czczup/GPTrans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Zhou, Shengbo Gong, Xuanze Chen, Chenxuan Xie, Shanqing Yu, Qi Xuan, Xiaoniu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable advances in graph-oriented tasks. However, real-world graphs invariably contain a certain proportion of heterophilous nodes, challenging the homophily assumption of traditional GNNs and hindering their performance. Most existing studies continue to design generic models with shared weights between heterophilous and homophilous nodes. Despite the incorporation of high-order messages or multi-channel architectures, these efforts often fall short. A minority of studies attempt to train different node groups separately but suffer from inappropriate separation metrics and low efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a new metric, termed Neighborhood Confusion (NC), to facilitate a more reliable separation of nodes. We observe that node groups with different levels of NC values exhibit certain differences in intra-group accuracy and visualized embeddings. These pave the way for Neighborhood Confusion-guided Graph Convolutional Network (NCGCN), in which nodes are grouped by their NC values and accept intra-group weight sharing and message passing. Extensive experiments on both homophilous and heterophilous benchmarks demonstrate that our framework can effectively separate nodes and yield significant performance improvement compared to the latest methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wensong Bai, Chao Zhang, Yichao Fu, Peilin Zhao, Hui Qian, Bin Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first fully push-forward-based distributional reinforcement learning algorithm, named PACER, which consists of a distributional critic, a stochastic actor and a sample-based encourager. Specifically, the push-forward operator is leveraged in both the critic and actor to model the return distributions and stochastic policies respectively, enabling them with equal modeling capability and thus enhancing the synergetic performance. Since it is infeasible to obtain the density function of the push-forward policies, novel sample-based regularizers are integrated in the encourager to incentivize efficient exploration and alleviate the risk of trapping into local optima. Moreover, a sample-based stochastic utility value policy gradient is established for the push-forward policy update, which circumvents the explicit demand of the policy density function in existing REINFORCE-based stochastic policy gradient. As a result, PACER fully utilizes the modeling capability of the push-forward operator and is able to explore a broader class of the policy space, compared with limited policy classes used in existing distributional actor critic algorithms (i.e. Gaussians). We validate the critical role of each component in our algorithm with extensive empirical studies. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over the state-of-the-art.</p>

Identifying businesses that are likely to experience financial distress is a crucial task in the fields of finance and risk management. Whenever a business experiences serious challenges keeping its operations going and meeting its financial responsibilities, it is said to be in financial distress.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal, Muhammad Mubashar, Kaizheng Wang, Keivan Shariatmadar, Fabio Cuzzolin</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains where robustness against adversarial attacks is crucial and erroneous predictions could lead to potentially catastrophic consequences. This highlights the need for learning systems to be equipped with the means to determine a model's confidence in its prediction and the epistemic uncertainty associated with it, 'to know when a model does not know'. In this paper, we propose a novel Random-Set Neural Network (RS-NN) for classification. RS-NN predicts belief functions rather than probability vectors over a set of classes using the mathematics of random sets, i.e., distributions over the power set of the sample space. RS-NN encodes the 'epistemic' uncertainty induced in machine learning by limited training sets via the size of the credal sets associated with the predicted belief functions. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian (LB-BNN, BNN-R) and Ensemble (ENN) methods in a classical evaluation setting in terms of performance, uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution (OoD) detection on several benchmarks (CIFAR-10 vs SVHN/Intel-Image, MNIST vs FMNIST/KMNIST, ImageNet vs ImageNet-O) and scales effectively to large-scale architectures such as WideResNet-28-10, VGG16, Inception V3, EfficientNetB2, and ViT-Base.</p>

<p>Abstract: Any autonomous controller will be unsafe in some situations. The ability to quantitatively identify when these unsafe situations are about to occur is crucial for drawing timely human oversight in, e.g., freight transportation applications. In this work, we demonstrate that the true criticality of an agent's situation can be robustly defined as the mean reduction in reward given some number of random actions. Proxy criticality metrics that are computable in real-time (i.e., without actually simulating the effects of random actions) can be compared to the true criticality, and we show how to leverage these proxy metrics to generate safety margins, which directly tie the consequences of potentially incorrect actions to an anticipated loss in overall performance. We evaluate our approach on learned policies from APE-X and A3C within an Atari environment, and demonstrate how safety margins decrease as agents approach failure states. The integration of safety margins into programs for monitoring deployed agents allows for the real-time identification of potentially catastrophic situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiwei Di, Heyang Zhao, Jiafan He, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the agent aims to learn the optimal policy based on the data collected by a behavior policy, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. While offline RL with linear function approximation has been extensively studied with optimal results achieved under certain assumptions, many works shift their interest to offline RL with non-linear function approximation. However, limited works on offline RL with non-linear function approximation have instance-dependent regret guarantees. In this paper, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm, dubbed Pessimistic Nonlinear Least-Square Value Iteration (PNLSVI), for offline RL with non-linear function approximation. Our algorithmic design comprises three innovative components: (1) a variance-based weighted regression scheme that can be applied to a wide range of function classes, (2) a subroutine for variance estimation, and (3) a planning phase that utilizes a pessimistic value iteration approach. Our algorithm enjoys a regret bound that has a tight dependency on the function class complexity and achieves minimax optimal instance-dependent regret when specialized to linear function approximation. Our work extends the previous instance-dependent results within simpler function classes, such as linear and differentiable function to a more general framework.</p>

Our theory and numerical experiments showcase the adaptivity of this approach to unknown non-stationarity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Fan, Xiaodan Li, Cen Chen, Wenmeng Zhou, Yaliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: A prevailing belief in attack and defense community is that the higher flatness of adversarial examples enables their better cross-model transferability, leading to a growing interest in employing sharpness-aware minimization and its variants. However, the theoretical relationship between the transferability of adversarial examples and their flatness has not been well established, making the belief questionable. To bridge this gap, we embark on a theoretical investigation and, for the first time, derive a theoretical bound for the transferability of adversarial examples with few practical assumptions. Our analysis challenges this belief by demonstrating that the increased flatness of adversarial examples does not necessarily guarantee improved transferability. Moreover, building upon the theoretical analysis, we propose TPA, a Theoretically Provable Attack that optimizes a surrogate of the derived bound to craft adversarial examples. Extensive experiments across widely used benchmark datasets and various real-world applications show that TPA can craft more transferable adversarial examples compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We hope that these results can recalibrate preconceived impressions within the community and facilitate the development of stronger adversarial attack and defense mechanisms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitris Bertsimas, Yu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new formulation of robust regression by integrating all realizations of the uncertainty set and taking an averaged approach to obtain the optimal solution for the ordinary least squares regression problem. We show that this formulation recovers ridge regression exactly and establishes the missing link between robust optimization and the mean squared error approaches for existing regression problems. We further demonstrate that the condition of this equivalence relies on the geometric properties of the defined uncertainty set. We provide exact, closed-form, in some cases, analytical solutions to the equivalent regularization strength under uncertainty sets induced by $\ell_p$ norm, Schatten $p$-norm, and general polytopes. We then show in synthetic datasets with different levels of uncertainties, a consistent improvement of the averaged formulation over the existing worst-case formulation in out-of-sample performance. In real-world regression problems obtained from UCI datasets, similar improvements are seen in the out-of-sample datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thien Le, Luana Ruiz, Stefanie Jegelka</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale graph machine learning is challenging as the complexity of learning models scales with the graph size. Subsampling the graph is a viable alternative, but sampling on graphs is nontrivial as graphs are non-Euclidean. Existing graph sampling techniques require not only computing the spectra of large matrices but also repeating these computations when the graph changes, e.g., grows. In this paper, we introduce a signal sampling theory for a type of graph limit -- the graphon. We prove a Poincar\'e inequality for graphon signals and show that complements of node subsets satisfying this inequality are unique sampling sets for Paley-Wiener spaces of graphon signals. Exploiting connections with spectral clustering and Gaussian elimination, we prove that such sampling sets are consistent in the sense that unique sampling sets on a convergent graph sequence converge to unique sampling sets on the graphon. We then propose a related graphon signal sampling algorithm for large graphs, and demonstrate its good empirical performance on graph machine learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Bruno, Ying Zhang, Dong-Young Lim, \"Omer Deniz Akyildiz, Sotirios Sabanis</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide full theoretical guarantees for the convergence behaviour of diffusion-based generative models under the assumption of strongly log-concave data distributions while our approximating class of functions used for score estimation is made of Lipschitz continuous functions avoiding any Lipschitzness assumption on the score function. We demonstrate via a motivating example, sampling from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean, the powerfulness of our approach. In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm.
  Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information. This approach yields the best known convergence rate for our sampling algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> D. M. Bot, J. Peeters, J. Liesenborgs, J. Aerts</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering algorithms are often used to find subpopulations in exploratory data analysis workflows. Not only the clusters themselves, but also their shape can represent meaningful subpopulations. In this paper, we present FLASC, an algorithm that detects branches within clusters to identify such subpopulations. FLASC builds upon HDBSCAN*, a state-of-the-art density-based clustering algorithm, and detects branches in a post-processing step that describes within-cluster connectivity. Two variants of the algorithm are presented, which trade computational cost for noise robustness. We show that both variants scale similarly to HDBSCAN* in terms of computational cost and provide stable outputs using synthetic data sets, resulting in an efficient flare-sensitive clustering algorithm. In addition, we demonstrate the benefit of branch-detection on two real-world data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suman Sapkota, Binod Bhattarai</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of multiple neural architectures like CNNs, Transformers, and MLP-Mixers motivated us to look for similarities and differences between them. We found that these architectures can be interpreted through the lens of a general concept of dimension mixing.Research on coupling flows and the butterfly transform shows that partial and hierarchical signal mixing schemes are sufficient for efficient and expressive function approximation. In this work, we study group-wise sparse, non-linear, multi-layered and learnable mixing schemes of inputs and find that they are complementary to many standard neural architectures. Following our observations and drawing inspiration from the Fast Fourier Transform, we generalize Butterfly Structure to use non-linear mixer function allowing for MLP as mixing function called Butterfly MLP. We were also able to sparsely mix along sequence dimension for Transformer-based architectures called Butterfly Attention. Experiments on CIFAR and LRA datasets demonstrate that the proposed Non-Linear Butterfly Mixers are efficient and scale well when the host architectures are used as mixing function. Additionally, we propose Patch-Only MLP-Mixer for processing spatial 2D signals demonstrating a different dimension mixing strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kasra Borazjani, Naji Khosravan, Leslie Ying, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) for cancer staging through medical image analysis has gained substantial interest across medical disciplines. When accompanied by the innovative federated learning (FL) framework, ML techniques can further overcome privacy concerns related to patient data exposure. Given the frequent presence of diverse data modalities within patient records, leveraging FL in a multi-modal learning framework holds considerable promise for cancer staging.
  However, existing works on multi-modal FL often presume that all data-collecting institutions have access to all data modalities. This oversimplified approach neglects institutions that have access to only a portion of data modalities within the system. In this work, we introduce a novel FL architecture designed to accommodate not only the heterogeneity of data samples, but also the inherent heterogeneity/non-uniformity of data modalities across institutions. We shed light on the challenges associated with varying convergence speeds observed across different data modalities within our FL system. Subsequently, we propose a solution to tackle these challenges by devising a distributed gradient blending and proximity-aware client weighting strategy tailored for multi-modal FL. To show the superiority of our method, we conduct experiments using The Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA) datalake considering different cancer types and three modalities of data: mRNA sequences, histopathological image data, and clinical information. Our results further unveil the impact and severity of class-based vs type-based heterogeneity across institutions on the model performance, which widens the perspective to the notion of data heterogeneity in multi-modal FL literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toni J. B. Liu, Nicolas Boull\'e, Rapha\"el Sarfati, Christopher J. Earls</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are surprisingly effective at performing zero-shot tasks, including time-series forecasting. However, understanding the mechanisms behind such capabilities remains highly challenging due to the complexity of the models. We study LLMs' ability to extrapolate the behavior of dynamical systems whose evolution is governed by principles of physical interest. Our results show that LLaMA 2, a language model trained primarily on texts, achieves accurate predictions of dynamical system time series without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Moreover, the accuracy of the learned physical rules increases with the length of the input context window, revealing an in-context version of neural scaling law. Along the way, we present a flexible and efficient algorithm for extracting probability density functions of multi-digit numbers directly from LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Dominici, Pietro Barbiero, Francesco Giannini, Martin Gjoreski, Giuseppe Marra, Marc Langheinrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Current deep learning models are not designed to simultaneously address three fundamental questions: predict class labels to solve a given classification task (the "What?"), simulate changes in the situation to evaluate how this impacts class predictions (the "How?"), and imagine how the scenario should change to result in different class predictions (the "Why not?"). The inability to answer these questions represents a crucial gap in deploying reliable AI agents, calibrating human trust, and improving human-machine interaction. To bridge this gap, we introduce CounterFactual Concept Bottleneck Models (CF-CBMs), a class of models designed to efficiently address the above queries all at once without the need to run post-hoc searches. Our experimental results demonstrate that CF-CBMs: achieve classification accuracy comparable to black-box models and existing CBMs ("What?"), rely on fewer important concepts leading to simpler explanations ("How?"), and produce interpretable, concept-based counterfactuals ("Why not?"). Additionally, we show that training the counterfactual generator jointly with the CBM leads to two key improvements: (i) it alters the model's decision-making process, making the model rely on fewer important concepts (leading to simpler explanations), and (ii) it significantly increases the causal effect of concept interventions on class predictions, making the model more responsive to these changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlin Wu, Jiongxiao Wang, Chaowei Xiao, Chenguang Wang, Ning Zhang, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning reward models from pairwise comparisons is a fundamental component in a number of domains, including autonomous control, conversational agents, and recommendation systems, as part of a broad goal of aligning automated decisions with user preferences. These approaches entail collecting preference information from people, with feedback often provided anonymously. Since preferences are subjective, there is no gold standard to compare against; yet, reliance of high-impact systems on preference learning creates a strong motivation for malicious actors to skew data collected in this fashion to their ends. We investigate the nature and extent of this vulnerability by considering an attacker who can flip a small subset of preference comparisons to either promote or demote a target outcome. We propose two classes of algorithmic approaches for these attacks: a gradient-based framework, and several variants of rank-by-distance methods. Next, we evaluate the efficacy of best attacks in both these classes in successfully achieving malicious goals on datasets from three domains: autonomous control, recommendation system, and textual prompt-response preference learning. We find that the best attacks are often highly successful, achieving in the most extreme case 100\% success rate with only 0.3\% of the data poisoned. However, \emph{which} attack is best can vary significantly across domains. In addition, we observe that the simpler and more scalable rank-by-distance approaches are often competitive with, and on occasion significantly outperform, gradient-based methods. Finally, we show that state-of-the-art defenses against other classes of poisoning attacks exhibit limited efficacy in our setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhitong Xu, Haitao Wang, Jeff M Phillips, Shandian Zhe</p>
<p>Abstract: A longstanding belief holds that Bayesian Optimization (BO) with standard Gaussian processes (GP) -- referred to as standard BO -- underperforms in high-dimensional optimization problems. While this belief seems plausible, it lacks both robust empirical evidence and theoretical justification. To address this gap, we present a systematic investigation. First, through a comprehensive evaluation across eleven widely used benchmarks, we found that while the popular Square Exponential (SE) kernel often leads to poor performance, using Matern kernels enables standard BO to consistently achieve top-tier results, frequently surpassing methods specifically designed for high-dimensional optimization. Second, our theoretical analysis reveals that the SE kernels failure primarily stems from improper initialization of the length-scale parameters, which are commonly used in practice but can cause gradient vanishing in training. We provide a probabilistic bound to characterize this issue, showing that Matern kernels are less susceptible and can robustly handle much higher dimensions. Third, we propose a simple robust initialization strategy that dramatically improves the performance of the SE kernel, bringing it close to state of the art methods, without requiring any additional priors or regularization. We prove another probabilistic bound that demonstrates how the gradient vanishing issue can be effectively mitigated with our method. Our findings advocate for a re-evaluation of standard BOs potential in high-dimensional settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huajun Xi, Jianguo Huang, Kangdao Liu, Lei Feng, Hongxin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction, as an emerging uncertainty qualification technique, constructs prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true label with pre-defined probability. Previous works often employ temperature scaling to calibrate the classifier, assuming that confidence calibration can benefit conformal prediction. In this work, we empirically show that current confidence calibration methods (e.g., temperature scaling) normally lead to larger prediction sets in adaptive conformal prediction. Theoretically, we prove that a prediction with higher confidence could result in a smaller prediction set on expectation. Inspired by the analysis, we propose $Conformal$ $Temperature$ $Scaling$ (ConfTS), a variant of temperature scaling that aims to improve the efficiency of adaptive conformal prediction. Specifically, ConfTS optimizes the temperature value by minimizing the gap between the threshold and the non-conformity score of the ground truth for a held-out validation dataset. In this way, the temperature value obtained would lead to an optimal set of high efficiency without violating the marginal coverage property. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance adaptive conformal prediction methods in both efficiency and conditional coverage, reducing the average size of APS and RAPS by nearly 50$\%$ on ImageNet at error rate $\alpha=0.1$.</p>

<p>Abstract: The distributional simplicity bias (DSB) posits that neural networks learn low-order moments of the data distribution first, before moving on to higher-order correlations. In this work, we present compelling new evidence for the DSB by showing that networks automatically learn to perform well on maximum-entropy distributions whose low-order statistics match those of the training set early in training, then lose this ability later. We also extend the DSB to discrete domains by proving an equivalence between token $n$-gram frequencies and the moments of embedding vectors, and by finding empirical evidence for the bias in LLMs. Finally we use optimal transport methods to surgically edit the low-order statistics of one class to match those of another, and show that early-training networks treat the edited samples as if they were drawn from the target class.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyu Jiang, Zhenlong Liu, Zejian Xie, Songxin Zhang, Bingyi Jing, Hongxin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The ever-increasing fine-tuning cost of large-scale pre-trained models gives rise to the importance of dataset pruning, which aims to reduce dataset size while maintaining task performance. However, existing dataset pruning methods require training on the entire dataset, which is impractical for large-scale pre-trained models. In this paper, we propose a straightforward, novel, and training-free hardness score named Distorting-based Learning Complexity (DLC), to identify informative images and instructions from the downstream dataset efficiently. Our method is motivated by the observation that easy samples learned faster can also be learned with fewer parameters. Specifically, we define the Learning Complexity to quantify sample hardness and utilize a lightweight weights masking process for fast estimation, instead of the costly SGD optimization. Based on DLC, we further design a flexible under-sampling with randomness (dubbed FlexRand), replacing the top-K strategy, to alleviate the severe subset distribution shift. Extensive experiments with downstream image and instructions dataset pruning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. In the images pruning benchmark, DLC significantly reduces the pruning time by 35x while establishing state-of-the-art performance with FlexRand.</p>

To achieve this, we introduce PriMORL, a model-based RL algorithm with formal differential privacy guarantees. PriMORL first learns an ensemble of trajectory-level DP models of the environment from offline data. It then optimizes a policy on the penalized private model, without any further interaction with the system or access to the dataset. In addition to offering strong theoretical foundations, we demonstrate empirically that PriMORL enables the training of private RL agents on offline continuous control tasks with deep function approximations, whereas current methods are limited to simpler tabular and linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We furthermore outline the trade-offs involved in achieving privacy in this setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: We analyze the capabilities of Transformer language models in learning compositional discrete tasks. To this end, we evaluate training LLaMA models and prompting GPT-4 and Gemini on four tasks demanding to learn a composition of several discrete sub-tasks. On both training LLaMA models from scratch and prompting on GPT-4 and Gemini, we measure how well these models can reuse primitives observable in the sub-tasks to learn the composition task. Our results indicate that compositional learning in state-of-the-art Transformer language models is highly sample inefficient: LLaMA requires more data samples than relearning all sub-tasks from scratch to learn the compositional task; in-context prompting with few samples is unreliable and fails at executing the sub-tasks or correcting the errors in multi-round code generation. Further, by leveraging complexity theory, we support these findings with a theoretical analysis focused on the sample inefficiency of gradient descent in memorizing feedforward models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have established state-of-the-art benchmarks in the generation of molecules and novel drug candidates. Despite these successes, a significant gap persists between generative models and the utilization of extensive biomedical knowledge, often systematized within knowledge graphs, whose potential to inform and enhance generative processes has not been realized. In this paper, we present a novel approach that bridges this divide by developing a framework for knowledge-enhanced generative models called KARL. We develop a scalable methodology to extend the functionality of knowledge graphs while preserving semantic integrity, and incorporate this contextual information into a generative framework to guide a diffusion-based model. The integration of knowledge graph embeddings with our generative model furnishes a robust mechanism for producing novel drug candidates possessing specific characteristics while ensuring validity and synthesizability. KARL outperforms state-of-the-art generative models on both unconditional and targeted generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agus Hartoyo, Jan Argasi\'nski, Aleksandra Trenk, Kinga Przybylska, Anna B{\l}asiak, Alessandro Crimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Covariance and Hessian matrices have been analyzed separately in the literature for classification problems. However, integrating these matrices has the potential to enhance their combined power in improving classification performance. We present a novel approach that combines the eigenanalysis of a covariance matrix evaluated on a training set with a Hessian matrix evaluated on a deep learning model to achieve optimal class separability in binary classification tasks. Our approach is substantiated by formal proofs that establish its capability to maximize between-class mean distance (the concept of \textit{separation}) and minimize within-class variances (the concept of \textit{compactness}), which together define the two linear discriminant analysis (LDA) criteria, particularly under ideal data conditions such as isotropy around class means and dominant leading eigenvalues. By projecting data into the combined space of the most relevant eigendirections from both matrices, we achieve optimal class separability as per these LDA criteria. Empirical validation across neural and health datasets consistently supports our theoretical framework and demonstrates that our method outperforms established methods. Our method stands out by addressing both separation and compactness criteria, unlike PCA and the Hessian method, which predominantly emphasize one criterion each. This comprehensive approach captures intricate patterns and relationships, enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, through the utilization of both LDA criteria, our method outperforms LDA itself by leveraging higher-dimensional feature spaces, in accordance with Cover's theorem, which favors linear separability in higher dimensions. Additionally, our approach sheds light on complex DNN decision-making, rendering them comprehensible within a 2D space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reducing a graph while preserving its overall structure is an important problem with many applications. Typically, reduction approaches either remove edges (sparsification) or merge nodes (coarsening) in an unsupervised way with no specific downstream task in mind. In this paper, we present an approach for subsampling graph structures using an Ising model defined on either the nodes or edges and learning the external magnetic field of the Ising model using a graph neural network. Our approach is task-specific as it can learn how to reduce a graph for a specific downstream task in an end-to-end fashion. For this, the task's loss function does not have to be differentiable. We showcase the versatility of our approach on four distinct applications: image segmentation, explainability for graph classification, 3D shape sparsification, and sparse approximate matrix inverse determination.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) algorithms using Knowledge Distillation (KD) have received increasing attention due to their favorable properties with respect to privacy, non-i.i.d. data and communication cost. These methods depart from transmitting model parameters and instead communicate information about a learning task by sharing predictions on a public dataset. In this work, we study the performance of such approaches in the byzantine setting, where a subset of the clients act in an adversarial manner aiming to disrupt the learning process. We show that KD-based FL algorithms are remarkably resilient and analyze how byzantine clients can influence the learning process. Based on these insights, we introduce two new byzantine attacks and demonstrate their ability to break existing byzantine-resilient methods. Additionally, we propose a novel defence method which enhances the byzantine resilience of KD-based FL algorithms. Finally, we provide a general framework to obfuscate attacks, making them significantly harder to detect, thereby improving their effectiveness. Our findings serve as an important building block in the analysis of byzantine FL, contributing through the development of new attacks and new defence mechanisms, further advancing the robustness of KD-based FL algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedikt Alkin, Andreas F\"urst, Simon Schmid, Lukas Gruber, Markus Holzleitner, Johannes Brandstetter</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural operators, serving as physics surrogate models, have recently gained increased interest. With ever increasing problem complexity, the natural question arises: what is an efficient way to scale neural operators to larger and more complex simulations - most importantly by taking into account different types of simulation datasets. This is of special interest since, akin to their numerical counterparts, different techniques are used across applications, even if the underlying dynamics of the systems are similar. Whereas the flexibility of transformers has enabled unified architectures across domains, neural operators mostly follow a problem specific design, where GNNs are commonly used for Lagrangian simulations and grid-based models predominate Eulerian simulations. We introduce Universal Physics Transformers (UPTs), an efficient and unified learning paradigm for a wide range of spatio-temporal problems. UPTs operate without grid- or particle-based latent structures, enabling flexibility and scalability across meshes and particles. UPTs efficiently propagate dynamics in the latent space, emphasized by inverse encoding and decoding techniques. Finally, UPTs allow for queries of the latent space representation at any point in space-time. We demonstrate diverse applicability and efficacy of UPTs in mesh-based fluid simulations, and steady-state Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, and Lagrangian-based dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Beaglehole, Peter S\'uken\'ik, Marco Mondelli, Mikhail Belkin</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Collapse (DNC) refers to the surprisingly rigid structure of the data representations in the final layers of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Though the phenomenon has been measured in a variety of settings, its emergence is typically explained via data-agnostic approaches, such as the unconstrained features model. In this work, we introduce a data-dependent setting where DNC forms due to feature learning through the average gradient outer product (AGOP). The AGOP is defined with respect to a learned predictor and is equal to the uncentered covariance matrix of its input-output gradients averaged over the training dataset. The Deep Recursive Feature Machine (Deep RFM) is a method that constructs a neural network by iteratively mapping the data with the AGOP and applying an untrained random feature map. We demonstrate empirically that DNC occurs in Deep RFM across standard settings as a consequence of the projection with the AGOP matrix computed at each layer. Further, we theoretically explain DNC in Deep RFM in an asymptotic setting and as a result of kernel learning. We then provide evidence that this mechanism holds for neural networks more generally. In particular, we show that the right singular vectors and values of the weights can be responsible for the majority of within-class variability collapse for DNNs trained in the feature learning regime. As observed in recent work, this singular structure is highly correlated with that of the AGOP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran He, Chenjia Bai, Ling Pan, Weinan Zhang, Bin Zhao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning a generalist embodied agent capable of completing multiple tasks poses challenges, primarily stemming from the scarcity of action-labeled robotic datasets. In contrast, a vast amount of human videos exist, capturing intricate tasks and interactions with the physical world. Promising prospects arise for utilizing actionless human videos for pre-training and transferring the knowledge to facilitate robot policy learning through limited robot demonstrations. However, it remains a challenge due to the domain gap between humans and robots. Moreover, it is difficult to extract useful information representing the dynamic world from human videos, because of its noisy and multimodal data structure. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to tackle these challenges, which leverages a unified discrete diffusion to combine generative pre-training on human videos and policy fine-tuning on a small number of action-labeled robot videos. We start by compressing both human and robot videos into unified video tokens. In the pre-training stage, we employ a discrete diffusion model with a mask-and-replace diffusion strategy to predict future video tokens in the latent space. In the fine-tuning stage, we harness the imagined future videos to guide low-level action learning with a limited set of robot data. Experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-fidelity future videos for planning and enhances the fine-tuned policies compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches with superior performance.

<p>Abstract: Graph learning has become essential in various domains, including recommendation systems and social network analysis. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising techniques for encoding structural information and improving performance in tasks like link prediction and node classification. However, a key challenge remains: the difficulty of generalizing to unseen graph data with different properties. In this work, we propose a novel graph foundation model, called OpenGraph, to address this challenge. Our approach tackles several technical obstacles. Firstly, we enhance data augmentation using a large language model (LLM) to overcome data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Secondly, we introduce a unified graph tokenizer that enables the model to generalize effectively to diverse graph data, even when encountering unseen properties during training. Thirdly, our developed scalable graph transformer captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings. We release the model implementation at https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenGraph.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhan Cui, Prasenjit Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of big data and digital healthcare, Electronic Health Records (EHR) have become a rich source of information with the potential to improve patient care and medical research. In recent years, machine learning models have proliferated for analyzing EHR data to predict patients future health conditions. Among them, some studies advocate for multi-task learning (MTL) to jointly predict multiple target diseases for improving the prediction performance over single task learning. Nevertheless, current MTL frameworks for EHR data have significant limitations due to their heavy reliance on human experts to identify task groups for joint training and design model architectures. To reduce human intervention and improve the framework design, we propose an automated approach named AutoDP, which can search for the optimal configuration of task grouping and architectures simultaneously. To tackle the vast joint search space encompassing task combinations and architectures, we employ surrogate model-based optimization, enabling us to efficiently discover the optimal solution. Experimental results on real-world EHR data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed AutoDP framework. It achieves significant performance improvements over both hand-crafted and automated state-of-the-art methods, also maintains a feasible search cost at the same time.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose two hybrid quantum-inspired neural networks with residual and dense connections respectively for pattern recognition. We explain the concrete frameworks and illustrate the potential superiority to prevent gradient explosion of our hybrid models. A group of numerical experiments about generalization power shows that our hybrid models possess the same generalization power as the pure classical models with different noisy datasets utilized. More importantly, another group of numerical experiments of robustness demonstrates that our hybrid models outperform pure classical models notably in resistance to parameter attacks with various asymmetric noises. Also, an ablation study indicate that the recognition accuracy of our hybrid models is 2\%-3\% higher than that of the quantum neural network without residual or dense connection. Eventually, we discuss the application scenarios of our hybrid models by analyzing their computational complexities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filip Szatkowski, Fei Yang, Bart{\l}omiej Twardowski, Tomasz Trzci\'nski, Joost van de Weijer</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning is crucial for applications in dynamic environments, where machine learning models must adapt to changing data distributions while retaining knowledge of previous tasks. Despite significant advancements, catastrophic forgetting - where performance on earlier tasks degrades as new information is learned - remains a key challenge. In this work, we investigate the stability of intermediate neural network layers during continual learning and explore how auxiliary classifiers (ACs) can leverage this stability to improve performance. We show that early network layers remain more stable during learning, particularly for older tasks, and that ACs applied to these layers can outperform standard classifiers on past tasks. By integrating ACs into several continual learning algorithms, we demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvements on standard benchmarks. Additionally, we explore dynamic inference, showing that AC-augmented continual learning methods can reduce computational costs by up to 60\% while maintaining or exceeding the accuracy of standard methods. Our findings suggest that ACs offer a promising avenue for enhancing continual learning models, providing both improved performance and the ability to adapt the network computation in environments where such flexibility might be required.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motivated by the challenge of seamless cross-dataset transfer in EEG signal processing, this article presents an exploratory study on the use of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs). In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for transfer learning in various domains. However, its application to EEG signals remains largely unexplored. In this article, we introduce Signal-JEPA for representing EEG recordings which includes a novel domain-specific spatial block masking strategy and three novel architectures for downstream classification. The study is conducted on a 54 subjects dataset and the downstream performance of the models is evaluated on three different BCI paradigms: motor imagery, ERP and SSVEP. Our study provides preliminary evidence for the potential of JEPAs in EEG signal encoding. Notably, our results highlight the importance of spatial filtering for accurate downstream classification and reveal an influence of the length of the pre-training examples but not of the mask size on the downstream performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Gupta, Dev Sajnani, Gopala Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: ROME and MEMIT are largely believed to be two different model editing algorithms, with the major difference between them being the ability to perform batched edits. In this paper, we unify these two algorithms under a single conceptual umbrella, optimizing for the same goal, which we call the preservation-memorization objective. ROME uses an equality constraint to optimize this objective to perform one edit at a time, whereas MEMIT employs a more flexible least-square constraint that allows for batched edits. We generalize ROME and enable batched editing with equality constraint in the form of EMMET - an Equality-constrained Mass Model Editing algorithm for Transformers, a new batched memory-editing algorithm. EMMET can perform batched-edits up to a batch-size of 10,000, with very similar performance to MEMIT across multiple dimensions. With the introduction of EMMET, we truly unify ROME and MEMIT and show that both algorithms are equivalent in terms of their optimization objective, their abilities (singular and batched editing), their model editing performance and their limitations.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15267">Parametric PDE Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Differentiable L0-Sparse Polynomial Policies</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicol\`o Botteghi, Urban Fasel</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal control of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) is crucial in many applications in engineering and science. In recent years, the progress in scientific machine learning has opened up new frontiers for the control of parametric PDEs. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has the potential to solve high-dimensional and complex control problems in a large variety of applications. Most DRL methods rely on deep neural network (DNN) control policies. However, for many dynamical systems, DNN-based control policies tend to be over-parametrized, which means they need large amounts of training data, show limited robustness, and lack interpretability. In this work, we leverage dictionary learning and differentiable L$_0$ regularization to learn sparse, robust, and interpretable control policies for parametric PDEs. Our sparse policy architecture is agnostic to the DRL method and can be used in different policy-gradient and actor-critic DRL algorithms without changing their policy-optimization procedure. We test our approach on the challenging tasks of controlling parametric Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and convection-diffusion-reaction PDEs. We show that our method (1) outperforms baseline DNN-based DRL policies, (2) allows for the derivation of interpretable equations of the learned optimal control laws, and (3) generalizes to unseen parameters of the PDE without retraining the policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederico Metelo, Stevo Rackovi\'c, Pedro \'Akos Costa, Cl\'audia Soares</p>
<p>Abstract: Task offloading, crucial for balancing computational loads across devices in networks such as the Internet of Things, poses significant optimization challenges, including minimizing latency and energy usage under strict communication and storage constraints. While traditional optimization falls short in scalability; and heuristic approaches lack in achieving optimal outcomes, Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue by enabling the learning of optimal offloading strategies through iterative interactions. However, the efficacy of RL hinges on access to rich datasets and custom-tailored, realistic training environments. To address this, we introduce PeersimGym, an open-source, customizable simulation environment tailored for developing and optimizing task offloading strategies within computational networks. PeersimGym supports a wide range of network topologies and computational constraints and integrates a \textit{PettingZoo}-based interface for RL agent deployment in both solo and multi-agent setups. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of the environment through experiments with Deep Reinforcement Learning agents, showcasing the potential of RL-based approaches to significantly enhance offloading strategies in distributed computing settings. PeersimGym thus bridges the gap between theoretical RL models and their practical applications, paving the way for advancements in efficient task offloading methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoxiang Qin, Fuyuan Lyu, Wenhui Peng, Dingyang Geng, Ju Wang, Xing Tang, Sylvie Leroyer, Naiping Gao, Xue Liu, Liangzhu Leon Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In solving partial differential equations (PDEs), Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have exhibited notable effectiveness. However, FNO is observed to be ineffective with large Fourier kernels that parameterize more frequencies. Current solutions rely on setting small kernels, restricting FNO's ability to capture complex PDE data in real-world applications. This paper offers empirical insights into FNO's difficulty with large kernels through spectral analysis: FNO exhibits a unique Fourier parameterization bias, excelling at learning dominant frequencies in target data while struggling with non-dominant frequencies. To mitigate such a bias, we propose SpecB-FNO to enhance the capture of non-dominant frequencies by adopting additional residual modules to learn from the previous ones' prediction residuals iteratively. By effectively utilizing large Fourier kernels, SpecB-FNO achieves better prediction accuracy on diverse PDE applications, with an average improvement of 50%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinzhu Jin, Matthew B. Dwyer, P. Thomas Fletcher</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new technique to measure the feature dependency of neural network models. The motivation is to better understand a model by querying whether it is using information from human-understandable features, e.g., anatomical shape, volume, or image texture. Our method is based on the principle that if a model is dependent on a feature, then removal of that feature should significantly harm its performance. A targeted feature is "removed" by collapsing the dimension in the data distribution that corresponds to that feature. We perform this by moving data points along the feature dimension to a baseline feature value while staying on the data manifold, as estimated by a deep generative model. Then we observe how the model's performance changes on the modified test data set, with the target feature dimension removed. We test our method on deep neural network models trained on synthetic image data with known ground truth, an Alzheimer's disease prediction task using MRI and hippocampus segmentations from the OASIS-3 dataset, and a cell nuclei classification task using the Lizard dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent times, the research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has grown exponentially, predominantly focusing on models underpinned by the transformer architecture, as established by [1], and further developed through the decoder-only variations by [2]. Contemporary efforts in this field primarily aim to enhance model capabilities by scaling up both the architecture and data volumes utilized during training. However, the exploration into reduce these model sizes while preserving their efficacy remains scant. In this study, we introduce three modifications to the decoder-only transformer architecture, namely ParallelGPT (pgpt), LinearGPT (lgpt), and ConvGPT (cgpt). These variants demonstrate comparable performance to the conventional architecture in language generation, yet benefit from reduced model sizes and faster training processes. We open-source the model weights and the complete codebase for these implementation for further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evgenii Kortukov, Alexander Rubinstein, Elisa Nguyen, Seong Joon Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates many problems of fully parametric language models, such as temporal degradation, hallucinations, and lack of grounding. In RAG, the model's knowledge can be updated from documents provided in context. This leads to cases of conflict between the model's parametric knowledge and the contextual information, where the model may not always update its knowledge. Previous work studied context-memory knowledge conflicts by creating synthetic documents that contradict the model's correct parametric answers. We present a framework for studying such knowledge conflicts in a realistic setup. We update incorrect parametric knowledge using real conflicting documents. This reflects how knowledge conflicts arise in practice. In this realistic scenario, we find that knowledge updates fail less often than previously reported. In cases where the models still fail to update their answers, we find a parametric bias: the incorrect parametric answer appearing in context makes the knowledge update likelier to fail. These results suggest that the factual parametric knowledge of LLMs can negatively influence their reading abilities and behaviors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Sch\"one, Neeraj Mohan Sushma, Jingyue Zhuge, Christian Mayr, Anand Subramoney, David Kappel</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based sensors are well suited for real-time processing due to their fast response times and encoding of the sensory data as successive temporal differences. These and other valuable properties, such as a high dynamic range, are suppressed when the data is converted to a frame-based format. However, most current methods either collapse events into frames or cannot scale up when processing the event data directly event-by-event. In this work, we address the key challenges of scaling up event-by-event modeling of the long event streams emitted by such sensors, which is a particularly relevant problem for neuromorphic computing. While prior methods can process up to a few thousand time steps, our model, based on modern recurrent deep state-space models, scales to event streams of millions of events for both training and inference. We leverage their stable parameterization for learning long-range dependencies, parallelizability along the sequence dimension, and their ability to integrate asynchronous events effectively to scale them up to long event streams. We further augment these with novel event-centric techniques enabling our model to match or beat the state-of-the-art performance on several event stream benchmarks. In the Spiking Speech Commands task, we improve state-of-the-art by a large margin of 7.7% to 88.4%. On the DVS128-Gestures dataset, we achieve competitive results without using frames or convolutional neural networks. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to use fully event-based processing with purely recurrent networks to achieve state-of-the-art task performance in several event-based benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruva Karkada</p>
<p>Abstract: A central theme of the modern machine learning paradigm is that larger neural networks achieve better performance on a variety of metrics. Theoretical analyses of these overparameterized models have recently centered around studying very wide neural networks. In this tutorial, we provide a nonrigorous but illustrative derivation of the following fact: in order to train wide networks effectively, there is only one degree of freedom in choosing hyperparameters such as the learning rate and the size of the initial weights. This degree of freedom controls the richness of training behavior: at minimum, the wide network trains lazily like a kernel machine, and at maximum, it exhibits feature learning in the active $\mu$P regime. In this paper, we explain this richness scale, synthesize recent research results into a coherent whole, offer new perspectives and intuitions, and provide empirical evidence supporting our claims. In doing so, we hope to encourage further study of the richness scale, as it may be key to developing a scientific theory of feature learning in practical deep neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihui Dai, Chong Xiang, Tong Wu, Prateek Mittal</p>
<p>Abstract: Current research on defending against adversarial examples focuses primarily on achieving robustness against a single attack type such as $\ell_2$ or $\ell_{\infty}$-bounded attacks. However, the space of possible perturbations is much larger than considered by many existing defenses and is difficult to mathematically model, so the attacker can easily bypass the defense by using a type of attack that is not covered by the defense. In this position paper, we argue that in addition to robustness, we should also aim to develop defense algorithms that are adversarially resilient -- defense algorithms should specify a means to quickly adapt the defended model to be robust against new attacks. We provide a definition of adversarial resilience and outline considerations of designing an adversarially resilient defense. We then introduce a subproblem of adversarial resilience which we call continual adaptive robustness, in which the defender gains knowledge of the formulation of possible perturbation spaces over time and can then update their model based on this information. Additionally, we demonstrate the connection between continual adaptive robustness and previously studied problems of multiattack robustness and unforeseen attack robustness and outline open directions within these fields which can contribute to improving continual adaptive robustness and adversarial resilience.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) are propelling us toward artificial general intelligence with their remarkable emergent abilities and reasoning capabilities. However, the substantial computational and memory requirements limit the widespread adoption. Quantization, a key compression technique, can effectively mitigate these demands by compressing and accelerating LLMs, albeit with potential risks to accuracy. Numerous studies have aimed to minimize the accuracy loss associated with quantization. However, their quantization configurations vary from each other and cannot be fairly compared. In this paper, we present LLMC, a plug-and-play compression toolkit, to fairly and systematically explore the impact of quantization. LLMC integrates dozens of algorithms, models, and hardwares, offering high extensibility from integer to floating-point quantization, from LLM to vision-language (VLM) model, from fixed-bit to mixed precision, and from quantization to sparsification. Powered by this versatile toolkit, our benchmark covers three key aspects: calibration data, algorithms (three strategies), and data formats, providing novel insights and detailed analyses for further research and practical guidance for users.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chung-Hsuan Hu, Zheng Chen, Erik G. Larsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has received significant attention in recent years for its advantages in efficient training of machine learning models across distributed clients without disclosing user-sensitive data. Specifically, in federated edge learning (FEEL) systems, the time-varying nature of wireless channels introduces inevitable system dynamics in the communication process, thereby affecting training latency and energy consumption. In this work, we further consider a streaming data scenario where new training data samples are randomly generated over time at edge devices. Our goal is to develop a dynamic scheduling and resource allocation algorithm to address the inherent randomness in data arrivals and resource availability under long-term energy constraints. To achieve this, we formulate a stochastic network optimization problem and use the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework to obtain a dynamic resource management design. Our proposed algorithm makes adaptive decisions on device scheduling, computational capacity adjustment, and allocation of bandwidth and transmit power in every round. We provide convergence analysis for the considered setting with heterogeneous data and time-varying objective functions, which supports the rationale behind our proposed scheduling design. The effectiveness of our scheme is verified through simulation results, demonstrating improved learning performance and energy efficiency as compared to baseline schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin-Chun Li, Jin-Lin Tang, Bo Zhang, Lan Li, De-Chuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploring the loss landscape offers insights into the inherent principles of deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent work suggests an additional asymmetry of the valley beyond the flat and sharp ones, yet without thoroughly examining its causes or implications. Our study methodically explores the factors affecting the symmetry of DNN valleys, encompassing (1) the dataset, network architecture, initialization, and hyperparameters that influence the convergence point; and (2) the magnitude and direction of the noise for 1D visualization. Our major observation shows that the {\it degree of sign consistency} between the noise and the convergence point is a critical indicator of valley symmetry. Theoretical insights from the aspects of ReLU activation and softmax function could explain the interesting phenomenon. Our discovery propels novel understanding and applications in the scenario of Model Fusion: (1) the efficacy of interpolating separate models significantly correlates with their sign consistency ratio, and (2) imposing sign alignment during federated learning emerges as an innovative approach for model parameter alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingxiang Liu, Xu Liu, Chenghao Liu, Qingsong Wen, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlike natural language processing and computer vision, the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for time series forecasting is blocked due to data scarcity. While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Guo, Zhenglin Cheng, Xiaoying Tang, Tao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has been widely employed to enhance the efficiency of training and inference for Transformer-based foundational models, yielding promising results. However, the performance of SMoE heavily depends on the choice of hyper-parameters, such as the number of experts and the number of experts to be activated (referred to as top-k), resulting in significant computational overhead due to the extensive model training by searching over various hyper-parameter configurations. As a remedy, we introduce the Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DynMoE) technique. DynMoE incorporates (1) a novel gating method that enables each token to automatically determine the number of experts to activate. (2) An adaptive process automatically adjusts the number of experts during training. Extensive numerical results across Vision, Language, and Vision-Language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve competitive performance compared to GMoE for vision and language tasks, and MoE-LLaVA for vision-language tasks, while maintaining efficiency by activating fewer parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youssef Allouah, Rachid Guerraoui, Nirupam Gupta, Ahmed Jellouli, Geovani Rizk, John Stephan</p>
<p>Abstract: Byzantine-resilient distributed machine learning seeks to achieve robust learning performance in the presence of misbehaving or adversarial workers. While state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust distributed gradient descent (Robust-DGD) methods were proven theoretically optimal, their empirical success has often relied on pre-aggregation gradient clipping. However, the currently considered static clipping strategy exhibits mixed results: improving robustness against some attacks while being ineffective or detrimental against others. We address this gap by proposing a principled adaptive clipping strategy, termed Adaptive Robust Clipping (ARC). We show that ARC consistently enhances the empirical robustness of SOTA Robust-DGD methods, while preserving the theoretical robustness guarantees. Our analysis shows that ARC provably improves the asymptotic convergence guarantee of Robust-DGD in the case when the model is well-initialized. We validate this theoretical insight through an exhaustive set of experiments on benchmark image classification tasks. We observe that the improvement induced by ARC is more pronounced in highly heterogeneous and adversarial settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Engels, Eric J. Michaud, Isaac Liao, Wes Gurnee, Max Tegmark</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has proposed that language models perform computation by manipulating one-dimensional representations of concepts ("features") in activation space. In contrast, we explore whether some language model representations may be inherently multi-dimensional. We begin by developing a rigorous definition of irreducible multi-dimensional features based on whether they can be decomposed into either independent or non-co-occurring lower-dimensional features. Motivated by these definitions, we design a scalable method that uses sparse autoencoders to automatically find multi-dimensional features in GPT-2 and Mistral 7B. These auto-discovered features include strikingly interpretable examples, e.g. circular features representing days of the week and months of the year. We identify tasks where these exact circles are used to solve computational problems involving modular arithmetic in days of the week and months of the year. Next, we provide evidence that these circular features are indeed the fundamental unit of computation in these tasks with intervention experiments on Mistral 7B and Llama 3 8B. Finally, we find further circular representations by breaking down the hidden states for these tasks into interpretable components, and we examine the continuity of the days of the week feature in Mistral 7B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Gonon, L\'eon Zheng, Pascal Carrivain, Quoc-Tung Le</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper benchmarks and improves existing GPU matrix multiplication algorithms specialized for Kronecker-sparse matrices, whose sparsity patterns are described by Kronecker products. These matrices have recently gained popularity as replacements for dense matrices in neural networks because they preserve accuracy while using fewer parameters. We present the first energy and time benchmarks for the multiplication with such matrices, helping users identify scenarios where Kronecker-sparse matrices are more time- and energy-efficient than their dense counterparts. Our benchmark also reveals that specialized implementations spend up to 50% of their total runtime on memory rewriting operations. To address the challenge of reducing memory transfers, we introduce a new so-called tiling strategy adapted to the Kronecker-sparsity structure, which reduces reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We implement this tiling strategy in a new CUDA kernel that achieves a median speed-up of x1.4, while also cutting energy consumption by 15%. We further demonstrate the broader impact of our results by applying the new kernel to accelerate transformer inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhant Bhambri, Amrita Bhattacharjee, Durgesh Kalwar, Lin Guan, Huan Liu, Subbarao Kambhampati</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from sample inefficiency in sparse reward domains, and the problem is further pronounced in case of stochastic transitions. To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied approach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to an optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function for all desirable states in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is challenging, even for domain experts. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a magnitude of natural language tasks, we aim to answer the following question: `Can we obtain heuristics using LLMs for constructing a reward shaping function that can boost an RL agent's sample efficiency?' To this end, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to generate a plan for an abstraction of the underlying MDP. We further use this LLM-generated plan as a heuristic to construct the reward shaping signal for the downstream RL agent. By characterizing the type of abstraction based on the MDP horizon length, we analyze the quality of heuristics when generated using an LLM, with and without a verifier in the loop. Our experiments across multiple domains with varying horizon length and number of sub-goals from the BabyAI environment suite, Household, Mario, and, Minecraft domain, show 1) the advantages and limitations of querying LLMs with and without a verifier to generate a reward shaping heuristic, and, 2) a significant improvement in the sample efficiency of PPO, A2C, and Q-learning when guided by the LLM-generated heuristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qichao Shentu, Beibu Li, Kai Zhao, Yang Shu, Zhongwen Rao, Lujia Pan, Bin Yang, Chenjuan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Existing methods require training one specific model for each dataset, which exhibits limited generalization capability across different target datasets, hindering anomaly detection performance in various scenarios with scarce training data. Aiming at this problem, we propose constructing a general time series anomaly detection model, which is pre-trained on extensive multi-domain datasets and can subsequently apply to a multitude of downstream scenarios. The significant divergence of time series data across different domains presents two primary challenges in building such a general model: (1) meeting the diverse requirements of appropriate information bottlenecks tailored to different datasets in one unified model, and (2) enabling distinguishment between multiple normal and abnormal patterns, both are crucial for effective anomaly detection in various target scenarios. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a General time series anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders (DADA), which enables flexible selection of bottlenecks based on different data and explicitly enhances clear differentiation between normal and abnormal series. We conduct extensive experiments on nine target datasets from different domains. After pre-training on multi-domain data, DADA, serving as a zero-shot anomaly detector for these datasets, still achieves competitive or even superior results compared to those models tailored to each specific dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayan Guo, Yusen Huo, Zhilin Zhang, Tianyu Wang, Chuan Yu, Jian Xu, Yan Zhang, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Auto-bidding plays a crucial role in facilitating online advertising by automatically providing bids for advertisers. Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained popularity for auto-bidding. However, most current RL auto-bidding methods are modeled through the Markovian Decision Process (MDP), which assumes the Markovian state transition. This assumption restricts the ability to perform in long horizon scenarios and makes the model unstable when dealing with highly random online advertising environments. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), a novel paradigm for auto-bidding through generative modeling. In this paradigm, we propose DiffBid, a conditional diffusion modeling approach for bid generation. DiffBid directly models the correlation between the return and the entire trajectory, effectively avoiding error propagation across time steps in long horizons. Additionally, DiffBid offers a versatile approach for generating trajectories that maximize given targets while adhering to specific constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world dataset and online A/B test on Alibaba advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffBid, achieving 2.81% increase in GMV and 3.36% increase in ROI.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16391">When does compositional structure yield compositional generalization? A kernel theory</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Lippl, Kim Stachenfeld</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional generalization (the ability to respond correctly to novel combinations of familiar components) is thought to be a cornerstone of intelligent behavior. Compositionally structured (e.g. disentangled) representations are essential for this; however, the conditions under which they yield compositional generalization remain unclear. To address this gap, we present a general theory of compositional generalization in kernel models with fixed representations, a tractable framework for characterizing the impact of dataset statistics on generalization. We find that kernel models are constrained to adding up values assigned to each combination of components seen during training ("conjunction-wise additivity"). This imposes fundamental restrictions on the set of tasks these models can learn, in particular preventing them from transitively generalizing equivalence relations. Even for compositional tasks that kernel models can in principle learn, we identify novel failure modes in compositional generalization that arise from biases in the training data and affect important compositional building blocks such as symbolic addition and context dependence (memorization leak and shortcut bias). Finally, we empirically validate our theory, showing that it captures the behavior of deep neural networks (convolutional networks, residual networks, and Vision Transformers) trained on a set of compositional tasks with similarly structured data. Ultimately, this work provides a theoretical perspective on how statistical structure in the training data can affect compositional generalization, with implications for how to identify and remedy failure modes in deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Dominici, Pietro Barbiero, Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga, Alberto Termine, Martin Gjoreski, Giuseppe Marra, Marc Langheinrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal opacity denotes the difficulty in understanding the "hidden" causal structure underlying the decisions of deep neural network (DNN) models. This leads to the inability to rely on and verify state-of-the-art DNN-based systems, especially in high-stakes scenarios. For this reason, circumventing causal opacity in DNNs represents a key open challenge at the intersection of deep learning, interpretability, and causality. This work addresses this gap by introducing Causal Concept Graph Models (Causal CGMs), a class of interpretable models whose decision-making process is causally transparent by design. Our experiments show that Causal CGMs can: (i) match the generalisation performance of causally opaque models, (ii) enable human-in-the-loop corrections to mispredicted intermediate reasoning steps, boosting not just downstream accuracy after corrections but also the reliability of the explanations provided for specific instances, and (iii) support the analysis of interventional and counterfactual scenarios, thereby improving the model's causal interpretability and supporting the effective verification of its reliability and fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Wang, Yuying Qiu, Peng Chen, Kai Zhao, Yang Shu, Zhongwen Rao, Lujia Pan, Bin Yang, Chenjuan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing collection of time series data from various domains, there arises a strong demand for general time series forecasting models pre-trained on a large number of time-series datasets to support a variety of downstream prediction tasks. Enabling general time series forecasting faces two challenges: how to obtain unified representations from multi-domian time series data, and how to capture domain-specific features from time series data across various domains for adaptive transfer in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a Register Assisted General Time Series Forecasting Model with Decomposed Frequency Learning (ROSE), a novel pre-trained model for time series forecasting. ROSE employs Decomposed Frequency Learning for the pre-training task, which decomposes coupled semantic and periodic information in time series with frequency-based masking and reconstruction to obtain unified representations across domains. We also equip ROSE with a Time Series Register, which learns to generate a register codebook to capture domain-specific representations during pre-training and enhances domain-adaptive transfer by selecting related register tokens on downstream tasks. After pre-training on large-scale time series data, ROSE achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 8 real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, even in few-shot scenarios, it demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods trained with full data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhou, Yuezhou Ma, Haixu Wu, Haowen Wang, Mingsheng Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep models have recently emerged as a promising tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a few instances of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation with a limited set of coefficients. This limits the generalization of neural solvers to diverse PDEs, impeding them from being practical surrogate models for numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE Solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by training a novel Transformer model on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of purely scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and flexibly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive performance gains and favorable PDE generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Klaudia Ba{\l}azy, Mohammadreza Banaei, Karl Aberer, Jacek Tabor</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has underscored the need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) emerging as a popular solution. Although LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters, serving multiple (task or user-specific) LoRA modules on top of a base model still creates significant storage challenges. To address this, using theoretical derivation, we introduce LoRA-XS (Low-Rank Adaptation with eXtremely Small number of parameters), a novel low-rank adaptation method that considerably reduces the trainable parameters while showing superior or competitive performance. LoRA-XS achieves this by inserting a small, trainable r x r weight matrix between frozen low-rank matrices, which are constructed by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the original weight matrix. This lightweight matrix enables fine-tuning with drastically reduced storage requirements, making it feasible to deploy millions of personalized models while minimizing memory overhead. For instance, LoRA-XS achieves a remarkable reduction of trainable parameters by over 100x in 7B models compared to LoRA. Our evaluations across various benchmarks (including GLUE, GSM8K, MATH, and eight commonsense reasoning datasets) demonstrate that LoRA-XS performs competitively or better than LoRA and other recent methods like VeRA while being significantly more parameter efficient. We also provide an extensive ablation study on the importance of singular vectors in transformer weights, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms driving LoRA-XS's enhanced efficiency. These findings suggest that LoRA-XS is not only a storage-efficient alternative, but also a powerful tool for scaling and personalizing LLMs at unprecedented scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kelly W Zhang, Tiffany Tianhui Cai, Hongseok Namkoong, Daniel Russo</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world decision-making requires grappling with a perpetual lack of data as environments change; intelligent agents must comprehend uncertainty and actively gather information to resolve it. We propose a new framework for learning bandit algorithms from massive historical data, which we demonstrate in a cold-start recommendation problem. First, we use historical data to pretrain an autoregressive model to predict a sequence of repeated feedback/rewards (e.g., responses to news articles shown to different users over time). In learning to make accurate predictions, the model implicitly learns an informed prior based on rich action features (e.g., article headlines) and how to sharpen beliefs as more rewards are gathered (e.g., clicks as each article is recommended). At decision-time, we autoregressively sample (impute) an imagined sequence of rewards for each action, and choose the action with the largest average imputed reward. Far from a heuristic, our approach is an implementation of Thompson sampling (with a learned prior), a prominent active exploration algorithm. We prove our pretraining loss directly controls online decision-making performance, and we demonstrate our framework on a news recommendation task where we integrate end-to-end fine-tuning of a pretrained language model to process news article headline text to improve performance.</p>

In this work, we propose a data-driven, non-intrusive method that utilizes stochastic variational deep kernel learning (SVDKL) to discover low-dimensional latent spaces from data and a recurrent version of SVDKL for representing and predicting the evolution of latent dynamics. The proposed method is demonstrated with two challenging examples -- a double pendulum and a reaction-diffusion system. Results show that our framework is capable of (i) denoising and reconstructing measurements, (ii) learning compact representations of system states, (iii) predicting system evolution in low-dimensional latent spaces, and (iv) quantifying modeling uncertainties.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose an algebraic geometric framework to study the expressivity of linear activation neural networks. A particular quantity of neural networks that has been actively studied is the number of linear regions, which gives a quantification of the information capacity of the architecture. To study and evaluate information capacity and expressivity, we work in the setting of tropical geometry - a combinatorial and polyhedral variant of algebraic geometry - where there are known connections between tropical rational maps and feedforward neural networks. Our work builds on and expands this connection to capitalize on the rich theory of tropical geometry to characterize and study various architectural aspects of neural networks. Our contributions are threefold: we provide a novel tropical geometric approach to selecting sampling domains among linear regions; an algebraic result allowing for a guided restriction of the sampling domain for network architectures with symmetries; and a new open source OSCAR library to analyze neural networks symbolically using their tropical representations, where we present a new algorithm that computes the exact number of their linear regions. We provide a comprehensive set of proof-of-concept numerical experiments demonstrating the breadth of neural network architectures to which tropical geometric theory can be applied to reveal insights on expressivity characteristics of a network. Our work provides the foundations for the adaptation of both theory and existing software from computational tropical geometry and symbolic computation to neural networks and deep learning</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a self-supervised framework that learns population-level codes for arbitrary ensembles of neural recordings at scale. We address two key challenges in scaling models with neural time-series data: sparse and variable electrode distribution across subjects and datasets. The Population Transformer (PopT) stacks on top of pretrained representations and enhances downstream decoding by enabling learned aggregation of multiple spatially-sparse data channels. The pretrained PopT lowers the amount of data required for downstream decoding experiments, while increasing accuracy, even on held-out subjects and tasks. Compared to end-to-end methods, this approach is computationally lightweight and more interpretable, while still retaining competitive performance. We further show how our framework is generalizable to multiple time-series embeddings and neural data modalities. Beyond decoding, we interpret the pretrained PopT and fine-tuned models to show how they can be used to extract neuroscience insights from massive amounts of data. We release our code as well as a pretrained PopT to enable off-the-shelf improvements in multi-channel intracranial data decoding and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zun Wang, Chang Liu, Nianlong Zou, He Zhang, Xinran Wei, Lin Huang, Lijun Wu, Bin Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we introduce a unified neural network architecture, the Deep Equilibrium Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian (DEQH) model, which incorporates Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) for predicting Density Functional Theory (DFT) Hamiltonians. The DEQH model inherently captures the self-consistency nature of Hamiltonian, a critical aspect often overlooked by traditional machine learning approaches for Hamiltonian prediction. By employing DEQ within our model architecture, we circumvent the need for DFT calculations during the training phase to introduce the Hamiltonian's self-consistency, thus addressing computational bottlenecks associated with large or complex systems. We propose a versatile framework that combines DEQ with off-the-shelf machine learning models for predicting Hamiltonians. When benchmarked on the MD17 and QH9 datasets, DEQHNet, an instantiation of the DEQH framework, has demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Beyond a predictor, the DEQH model is a Hamiltonian solver, in the sense that it uses the fixed-point solving capability of the deep equilibrium model to iteratively solve for the Hamiltonian. Ablation studies of DEQHNet further elucidate the network's effectiveness, offering insights into the potential of DEQ-integrated networks for Hamiltonian learning. We open source our implementation at https://github.com/Zun-Wang/DEQHNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Lazzati, Mirco Mutti, Alberto Maria Metelli</p>
<p>Abstract: In online Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), the learner can collect samples about the dynamics of the environment to improve its estimate of the reward function. Since IRL suffers from identifiability issues, many theoretical works on online IRL focus on estimating the entire set of rewards that explain the demonstrations, named the feasible reward set. However, none of the algorithms available in the literature can scale to problems with large state spaces. In this paper, we focus on the online IRL problem in Linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We show that the structure offered by Linear MDPs is not sufficient for efficiently estimating the feasible set when the state space is large. As a consequence, we introduce the novel framework of rewards compatibility, which generalizes the notion of feasible set, and we develop CATY-IRL, a sample efficient algorithm whose complexity is independent of the cardinality of the state space in Linear MDPs. When restricted to the tabular setting, we demonstrate that CATY-IRL is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. As a by-product, we show that Reward-Free Exploration (RFE) enjoys the same worst-case rate, improving over the state-of-the-art lower bound. Finally, we devise a unifying framework for IRL and RFE that may be of independent interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dulhan Jayalath, Gilad Landau, Brendan Shillingford, Mark Woolrich, Oiwi Parker Jones</p>
<p>Abstract: The past few years have produced a series of spectacular advances in the decoding of speech from brain activity. The engine of these advances has been the acquisition of labelled data, with increasingly large datasets acquired from single subjects. However, participants exhibit individual differences, such as anatomy, and datasets use varied scanners and task designs. As a result, prior work has struggled to leverage data from multiple subjects, multiple datasets, multiple tasks, and unlabelled datasets. In turn, the field has not benefited from the rapidly growing number of open neural data repositories to exploit large-scale data and deep learning. This gap exists for all neural data, but especially for magnetoencephalography (MEG), where the scale of individual datasets has not yet caught up with other modalities. To address this, we develop a set of neuroscience-inspired self-supervised objectives, together with a neural architecture, for representation learning from heterogeneous and unlabelled neural recordings. Experimental results with MEG show that representations learned with these objectives scale with data, generalise across subjects, datasets, and tasks, outperform using the raw input representation, and even surpass comparable self-supervised approaches. In addition, we set new benchmarks for two foundational speech decoding tasks. Collectively, these methods now unlock the potential for training speech decoding models with orders of magnitude more existing data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biqing Qi, Yang Luo, Junqi Gao, Pengfei Li, Kai Tian, Zhiyuan Ma, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) have proven effective in numerous task scenarios but face significant security challenges due to Adversarial Perturbations (APs) in real-world deployments. Adversarial Training (AT) is a mainstream approach to enhancing Adversarial Robustness (AR) and has been validated on various traditional DNN architectures. However, its effectiveness in improving the AR of SSMs remains unclear. While many enhancements in SSM components, such as integrating Attention mechanisms and expanding to data-dependent SSM parameterizations, have brought significant gains in Standard Training (ST) settings, their potential benefits in AT remain unexplored. To investigate this, we evaluate existing structural variants of SSMs with AT to assess their AR performance. We observe that pure SSM structures struggle to benefit from AT, whereas incorporating Attention yields a markedly better trade-off between robustness and generalization for SSMs in AT compared to other components. Nonetheless, the integration of Attention also leads to Robust Overfitting (RO) issues. To understand these phenomena, we empirically and theoretically analyze the output error of SSMs under AP. We find that fixed-parameterized SSMs have output error bounds strictly related to their parameters, limiting their AT benefits, while input-dependent SSMs may face the problem of error explosion. Furthermore, we show that the Attention component effectively scales the output error of SSMs during training, enabling them to benefit more from AT, but at the cost of introducing RO due to its high model complexity. Inspired by this, we propose a simple and effective Adaptive Scaling (AdS) mechanism that brings AT performance close to Attention-integrated SSMs without introducing the issue of RO.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanuel Abbe, Samy Bengio, Aryo Lotfi, Colin Sandon, Omid Saremi</p>
<p>Abstract: Can Transformers predict new syllogisms by composing established ones? More generally, what type of targets can be learned by such models from scratch? Recent works show that Transformers can be Turing-complete in terms of expressivity, but this does not address the learnability objective. This paper puts forward the notion of 'globality degree' of a target distribution to capture when weak learning is efficiently achievable by regular Transformers, where the latter measures the least number of tokens required in addition to the tokens histogram to correlate nontrivially with the target. As shown experimentally and theoretically under additional assumptions, distributions with high globality cannot be learned efficiently. In particular, syllogisms cannot be composed on long chains. Furthermore, we show that (i) an agnostic scratchpad cannot help to break the globality barrier, (ii) an educated scratchpad can help if it breaks the globality at each step, however not all such scratchpads can generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, (iii) a notion of 'inductive scratchpad', that composes the prior information more efficiently, can both break the globality barrier and improve the OOD generalization. In particular, some inductive scratchpads can achieve length generalizations of up to 6x for some arithmetic tasks depending on the input formatting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michelle Pan, Mariah Schrum, Vivek Myers, Erdem B{\i}y{\i}k, Anca Dragan</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive brain stimulation can treat neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and post-stroke motor deficits by influencing abnormal neural activity. Because of patient heterogeneity, each patient requires a unique stimulation policy to achieve optimal neural responses. Model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) holds promise in learning effective policies for a variety of similar control tasks, but is limited in domains like brain stimulation by a need for numerous costly environment interactions. In this work we introduce Coprocessor Actor Critic, a novel, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach for learning neural coprocessor policies for brain stimulation. Our key insight is that coprocessor policy learning is a combination of learning how to act optimally in the world and learning how to induce optimal actions in the world through stimulation of an injured brain. We show that our approach overcomes the limitations of traditional MFRL methods in terms of sample efficiency and task success and outperforms baseline MBRL approaches in a neurologically realistic model of an injured brain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Pouliquen, Mathurin Massias, Titouan Vayer</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating matrices in the symmetric positive-definite (SPD) cone is of interest for many applications ranging from computer vision to graph learning. While there exist various convex optimization-based estimators, they remain limited in expressivity due to their model-based approach. The success of deep learning motivates the use of learning-based approaches to estimate SPD matrices with neural networks in a data-driven fashion. However, designing effective neural architectures for SPD learning is challenging, particularly when the task requires additional structural constraints, such as element-wise sparsity. Current approaches either do not ensure that the output meets all desired properties or lack expressivity. In this paper, we introduce SpodNet, a novel and generic learning module that guarantees SPD outputs and supports additional structural constraints. Notably, it solves the challenging task of learning jointly SPD and sparse matrices. Our experiments illustrate the versatility and relevance of SpodNet layers for such applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akhil Agnihotri, Rahul Jain, Deepak Ramachandran, Zheng Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is at the core of fine-tuning methods for generative AI models for language and images. Such feedback is often sought as rank or preference feedback from human raters, as opposed to eliciting scores since the latter tends to be noisy. On the other hand, RL theory and algorithms predominantly assume that a reward feedback is available. In particular, approaches for online learning that can be helpful in adaptive data collection via active learning cannot incorporate offline preference data. In this paper, we adopt a finite-armed linear bandit model as a prototypical model of online learning. We consider an offline preference dataset to be available generated by an expert of unknown 'competence'. We propose $\texttt{warmPref-PS}$, a posterior sampling algorithm for online learning that can be warm-started with an offline dataset with noisy preference feedback. We show that by modeling the 'competence' of the expert that generated it, we are able to use such a dataset most effectively. We support our claims with novel theoretical analysis of its Bayesian regret, as well as, extensive empirical evaluation of an approximate loss function that optimizes for infinitely many arms, and performs substantially better ($25$ to $50\%$ regret reduction) than baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyuan Hu, Yiwei Fu, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Virginia Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning is a promising approach to mitigate undesirable memorization of training data in LLMs. However, in this work we show that existing approaches for unlearning in LLMs are surprisingly susceptible to a simple set of targeted relearning attacks. With access to only a small and potentially loosely related set of data, we find that we can "jog" the memory of unlearned models to reverse the effects of unlearning. For example, we show that relearning on public medical articles can lead an unlearned LLM to output harmful knowledge about bioweapons, and relearning general wiki information about the book series Harry Potter can force the model to output verbatim memorized text. We formalize this unlearning-relearning pipeline, explore the attack across three popular unlearning benchmarks, and discuss future directions and guidelines that result from our study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Balazs, Martin Ehler, Daniel Haider</p>
<p>Abstract: Injectivity is the defining property of a mapping that ensures no information is lost and any input can be perfectly reconstructed from its output. By performing hard thresholding, the ReLU function naturally interferes with this property, making the injectivity analysis of ReLU-layers in neural networks a challenging yet intriguing task that has not yet been fully solved. This article establishes a frame theoretic perspective to approach this problem. The main objective is to develop the most general characterization of the injectivity behavior of ReLU-layers in terms of all three involved ingredients: (i) the weights, (ii) the bias, and (iii) the domain where the data is drawn from. Maintaining a focus on practical applications, we limit our attention to bounded domains and present two methods for numerically approximating a maximal bias for given weights and data domains. These methods provide sufficient conditions for the injectivity of a ReLU-layer on those domains and yield a novel practical methodology for studying the information loss in ReLU layers. Finally, we derive explicit reconstruction formulas based on the duality concept from frame theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Blot (LISN, CNRS), Anastasios N Angelopoulos (UC Berkeley), Michael I Jordan (UC Berkeley, Inria), Nicolas J-B Brunel (ENSIIE)</p>
<p>Abstract: Science and technology have a growing need for effective mechanisms that ensure reliable, controlled performance from black-box machine learning algorithms. These performance guarantees should ideally hold conditionally on the input-that is the performance guarantees should hold, at least approximately, no matter what the input. However, beyond stylized discrete groupings such as ethnicity and gender, the right notion of conditioning can be difficult to define. For example, in problems such as image segmentation, we want the uncertainty to reflect the intrinsic difficulty of the test sample, but this may be difficult to capture via a conditioning event. Building on the recent work of Gibbs et al. [2023], we propose a methodology for achieving approximate conditional control of statistical risks-the expected value of loss functions-by adapting to the difficulty of test samples. Our framework goes beyond traditional conditional risk control based on user-provided conditioning events to the algorithmic, data-driven determination of appropriate function classes for conditioning. We apply this framework to various regression and segmentation tasks, enabling finer-grained control over model performance and demonstrating that by continuously monitoring and adjusting these parameters, we can achieve superior precision compared to conventional risk-control methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Dierkes, Emma Cramer, Holger H. Hoos, Sebastian Trimpe</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been significant progress in deep reinforcement learning (RL) in recent years. Nevertheless, finding suitable hyperparameter configurations and reward functions remains challenging even for experts, and performance heavily relies on these design choices. Also, most RL research is conducted on known benchmarks where knowledge about these choices already exists. However, novel practical applications often pose complex tasks for which no prior knowledge about good hyperparameters and reward functions is available, thus necessitating their derivation from scratch. Prior work has examined automatically tuning either hyperparameters or reward functions individually. We demonstrate empirically that an RL algorithm's hyperparameter configurations and reward function are often mutually dependent, meaning neither can be fully optimised without appropriate values for the other. We then propose a methodology for the combined optimisation of hyperparameters and the reward function. Furthermore, we include a variance penalty as an optimisation objective to improve the stability of learned policies. We conducted extensive experiments using Proximal Policy Optimisation and Soft Actor-Critic on four environments. Our results show that combined optimisation significantly improves over baseline performance in half of the environments and achieves competitive performance in the others, with only a minor increase in computational costs. This suggests that combined optimisation should be best practice.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18695">Learning to Correct for QA Reasoning with Black-box LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyung Kim, Dongyoung Kim, Yiming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: An open challenge in recent machine learning is about how to improve the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in a black-box setting, i.e., without access to detailed information such as output token probabilities. Existing approaches either rely on accessibility (which is often unrealistic) or involve significantly increased train- and inference-time costs. This paper addresses those limitations or shortcomings by proposing a novel approach, namely CoBB (Correct for improving QA reasoning of Black-Box LLMs). It uses a trained adaptation model to perform a seq2seq mapping from the often-imperfect reasonings of the original black-box LLM to the correct or improved reasonings. Specifically, the adaptation model is initialized with a relatively small open-source LLM and adapted over a collection of sub-sampled training pairs. To select the representative pairs of correct and incorrect reasonings, we formulated the dataset construction as an optimization problem that minimizes the statistical divergence between the sampled subset and the entire collection, and solved it via a genetic algorithm. We then train the adaptation model over the sampled pairs by contrasting the likelihoods of correct and incorrect reasonings. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoBB significantly improves reasoning accuracy across various QA benchmarks, compared to the best-performing adaptation baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan L. Vo, Uyen Dang, Thu Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: As the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models expands into critical real-world applications, ensuring the explainability of these models becomes paramount, particularly in sensitive fields such as medicine and finance. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) remains a popular choice for classification due to its interpretable nature, derived from its capacity to model class distributions and enhance class separation through linear combinations of features. However, real-world datasets often suffer from incomplete data, posing substantial challenges for both classification accuracy and model interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust classification method, termed Weighted missing Linear Discriminant Analysis (WLDA), which extends LDA to handle datasets with missing values without the need for imputation. Our approach innovatively incorporates a weight matrix that penalizes missing entries, thereby refining parameter estimation directly on incomplete data. This methodology not only preserves the interpretability of LDA but also significantly enhances classification performance in scenarios plagued by missing data. We conduct an in-depth theoretical analysis to establish the properties of WLDA and thoroughly evaluate its explainability. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that WLDA consistently outperforms traditional methods, especially in challenging environments where missing values are prevalent in both training and test datasets. This advancement provides a critical tool for improving classification accuracy and maintaining model transparency in the face of incomplete data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonatan Sverdlov, Nadav Dym</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by applications in chemistry and other sciences, we study the expressive power of message-passing neural networks for geometric graphs, whose node features correspond to 3-dimensional positions. Recent work has shown that such models can separate \emph{generic} pairs of non-isomorphic geometric graphs, though they may fail to separate some rare and complicated instances. However, these results assume a fully connected graph, where each node possesses complete knowledge of all other nodes. In contrast, often, in application, every node only possesses knowledge of a small number of nearest neighbors.
  This paper shows that generic pairs of non-isomorphic geometric graphs can be separated by message-passing networks with rotation equivariant features as long as the underlying graph is connected. When only invariant intermediate features are allowed, generic separation is guaranteed for generically globally rigid graphs. We introduce a simple architecture, $\us$, which achieves our theoretical guarantees and compares favorably with alternative architecture on synthetic and chemical benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Walt Woods, Alexander Grushin, Simon Khan, Alvaro Velasquez</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-enabled capabilities are reaching the requisite level of maturity to be deployed in the real world, yet do not always make correct or safe decisions. One way of addressing these concerns is to leverage AI control systems alongside and in support of human decisions, relying on the AI control system in safe situations while calling on a human co-decider for critical situations. We extend a methodology for adversarial explanations (AE) to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning frameworks, including MuZero. Multiple improvements to the base agent architecture are proposed. We demonstrate how this technology has two applications: for intelligent decision tools and to enhance training / learning frameworks. In a decision support context, adversarial explanations help a user make the correct decision by highlighting those contextual factors that would need to change for a different AI-recommended decision. As another benefit of adversarial explanations, we show that the learned AI control system demonstrates robustness against adversarial tampering. Additionally, we supplement AE by introducing strategically similar autoencoders (SSAs) to help users identify and understand all salient factors being considered by the AI system. In a training / learning framework, this technology can improve both the AI's decisions and explanations through human interaction. Finally, to identify when AI decisions would most benefit from human oversight, we tie this combined system to our prior art on statistically verified analyses of the criticality of decisions at any point in time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Grosse, Ruotian Wu, Ahmad Rashid, Philipp Hennig, Pascal Poupart, Agustinus Kristiadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Tree search algorithms such as greedy and beam search are the standard when it comes to finding sequences of maximum likelihood in the decoding processes of large language models (LLMs). However, they are myopic since they do not take the complete root-to-leaf path into account. Moreover, they are agnostic to prior knowledge available about the process: For example, it does not consider that the objective being maximized is a probability and thereby has specific properties like being bound in the unit interval. Taking a probabilistic approach, we define prior beliefs over LLMs' transition probabilities and obtain posterior beliefs over the most promising paths in each iteration. These beliefs are useful for defining a sample-based, non-myopic acquisition function that allows for a more data-efficient exploration scheme than standard search algorithms on LLMs. Crucially, unlike expensive simulation-based non-myopic methods like the Monte Carlo tree search, our method only requires samples from the beliefs. Our formulation thus views LLM decoding as Bayesian optimization on trees. We discuss how to select the prior and the acquisition function, and demonstrate in experiments with various LLMs that our method achieves higher efficiency than recent baselines: Our method achieves the same or a higher likelihood while expanding fewer nodes.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the online saddle point problem, which involves a sequence of two-player time-varying convex-concave games. Considering the nonstationarity of the environment, we adopt the duality gap and the dynamic Nash equilibrium regret as performance metrics for algorithm design. We present three variants of the proximal point method: the Online Proximal Point Method (OPPM), the Optimistic OPPM (OptOPPM), and the OptOPPM with multiple predictors. Each algorithm guarantees upper bounds for both the duality gap and dynamic Nash equilibrium regret, achieving near-optimality when measured against the duality gap. Specifically, in certain benign environments, such as sequences of stationary payoff functions, these algorithms maintain a nearly constant metric bound. Experimental results further validate the effectiveness of these algorithms. Lastly, this paper discusses potential reliability concerns associated with using dynamic Nash equilibrium regret as a performance metric.

GRASS utilizes relative random walk probabilities (RRWP) encoding and a novel decomposed variant (D-RRWP) to efficiently capture structural information. It rewires the input graph by superimposing a random regular graph to enhance long-range information propagation. It also employs a novel additive attention mechanism tailored for graph-structured data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Yang, Yiwei Wang, Yinya Huang, Zhijiang Guo, Wei Shi, Xiongwei Han, Liang Feng, Linqi Song, Xiaodan Liang, Jing Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited their problem-solving abilities in mathematical reasoning. Solving realistic optimization (OPT) problems in application scenarios requires advanced and applied mathematics ability. However, current OPT benchmarks that merely solve linear programming are far from complex realistic situations. In this work, we propose OptiBench, a benchmark for End-to-end optimization problem-solving with human-readable inputs and outputs. OptiBench contains rich optimization problems, including linear and nonlinear programming with or without tabular data, which can comprehensively evaluate LLMs' solving ability. In our benchmark, LLMs are required to call a code solver to provide precise numerical answers. Furthermore, to alleviate the data scarcity for optimization problems, and to bridge the gap between open-source LLMs on a small scale (e.g., Llama-3-8b) and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), we further propose a data synthesis method namely ReSocratic. Unlike general data synthesis methods that proceed from questions to answers, \ReSocratic first incrementally synthesizes formatted optimization demonstration with mathematical formulations step by step and then back-translates the generated demonstrations into questions. Based on this, we synthesize the ReSocratic-29k dataset. We further conduct supervised fine-tuning with ReSocratic-29k on multiple open-source models. Experimental results show that ReSocratic-29k significantly improves the performance of open-source models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Zhang, Anshumali Shrivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown immense potential across various domains, but their high memory requirements and inference costs remain critical challenges for deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising technique to reduce memory requirements and decoding latency. However, recent accurate quantization methods often depend on specialized computations or custom data formats to achieve better model quality, which limits their compatibility with popular frameworks, as they require dedicated inference kernels tailored to specific hardware and software platforms, hindering wider adoption. Furthermore, many competitive methods have high resource requirements and computational overhead, making it challenging to scale them to hundreds of billions of parameters. In response to these challenges, we propose LeanQuant (Loss-error-aware Network Quantization), a novel quantization method that is accurate, versatile, and scalable. In the existing popular iterative loss-error-based quantization framework, we identify a critical limitation in prior methods: the min-max affine quantization grid fails to preserve model quality due to outliers in inverse Hessian diagonals. To overcome this fundamental issue, we propose learning loss-error-aware grids, instead of using non-adaptive min-max affine grids. Our approach not only produces quantized models that are more accurate but also generalizes to a wider range of quantization types, including affine and non-uniform quantization, enhancing compatibility with more frameworks. Extensive empirical evaluations on recent LLMs demonstrate that LeanQuant is highly accurate, comparing favorably against recent competitive baselines in model quality, and scalable, achieving very accurate quantization of Llama-3.1 405B, one of the largest open-source LLMs to date, using two Quadro RTX 8000-48GB GPUs in 21 hours.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Freya Behrens, Luca Biggio, Lenka Zdeborov\'a</p>
<p>Abstract: How do different architectural design choices influence the space of solutions that a transformer can implement and learn? How do different components interact with each other to shape the model's hypothesis space? We investigate these questions by characterizing the solutions simple transformer blocks can implement when challenged to solve the histogram task -- counting the occurrences of each item in an input sequence from a fixed vocabulary. Despite its apparent simplicity, this task exhibits a rich phenomenology: our analysis reveals a strong inter-dependence between the model's predictive performance and the vocabulary and embedding sizes, the token-mixing mechanism and the capacity of the feed-forward block. In this work, we characterize two different counting strategies that small transformers can implement theoretically: relation-based and inventory-based counting, the latter being less efficient in computation and memory. The emergence of either strategy is heavily influenced by subtle synergies among hyperparameters and components, and depends on seemingly minor architectural tweaks like the inclusion of softmax in the attention mechanism. By introspecting models trained on the histogram task, we verify the formation of both mechanisms in practice. Our findings highlight that even in simple settings, slight variations in model design can cause significant changes to the solutions a transformer learns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kareem Amin, Alex Bie, Weiwei Kong, Alexey Kurakin, Natalia Ponomareva, Umar Syed, Andreas Terzis, Sergei Vassilvitskii</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an approach for generating differentially private synthetic text using large language models (LLMs), via private prediction. In the private prediction framework, we only require the output synthetic data to satisfy differential privacy guarantees. This is in contrast to approaches that train a generative model on potentially sensitive user-supplied source data and seek to ensure the model itself is safe to release.
  We prompt a pretrained LLM with source data, but ensure that next-token predictions are made with differential privacy guarantees. Previous work in this paradigm reported generating a small number of examples (<10) at reasonable privacy levels, an amount of data that is useful only for downstream in-context learning or prompting. In contrast, we make changes that allow us to generate thousands of high-quality synthetic data points, greatly expanding the set of potential applications. Our improvements come from an improved privacy analysis and a better private selection mechanism, which makes use of the equivalence between the softmax layer for sampling tokens in LLMs and the exponential mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a novel use of public predictions via the sparse vector technique, in which we do not pay privacy costs for tokens that are predictable without sensitive data; we find this to be particularly effective for structured data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Kaushal, Tejas Vaidhya, Arnab Kumar Mondal, Tejas Pandey, Aaryan Bhagat, Irina Rish</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements in GPU computational power has outpaced memory capacity and bandwidth growth, creating bottlenecks in Large Language Model (LLM) inference. Post-training quantization is the leading method for addressing memory-related bottlenecks in LLM inference, but it suffers from significant performance degradation below 4-bit precision. This paper addresses these challenges by investigating the pretraining of low-bitwidth models specifically Ternary Language Models (TriLMs) as an alternative to traditional floating-point models (FloatLMs) and their post-training quantized versions (QuantLMs). We present Spectra LLM suite, the first open suite of LLMs spanning multiple bit-widths, including FloatLMs, QuantLMs, and TriLMs, ranging from 99M to 3.9B parameters trained on 300B tokens. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that TriLMs offer superior scaling behavior in terms of model size (in bits). Surprisingly, at scales exceeding one billion parameters, TriLMs consistently outperform their QuantLM and FloatLM counterparts for a given bit size across various benchmarks. Notably, the 3.9B parameter TriLM matches the performance of the FloatLM 3.9B across all benchmarks, despite having fewer bits than FloatLM 830M. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the feasibility and scalability of low-bitwidth language models, paving the way for the development of more efficient LLMs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spyros Rigas, Michalis Papachristou, Theofilos Papadopoulos, Fotios Anagnostopoulos, Georgios Alexandridis</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a robust framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by approximating their solutions via neural networks and imposing physics-based constraints on the loss function. Traditionally, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have been the neural network of choice, with significant progress made in optimizing their training. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were introduced as a viable alternative, with the potential of offering better interpretability and efficiency while requiring fewer parameters. In this paper, we present a fast JAX-based implementation of grid-dependent Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) for solving PDEs, achieving up to 84 times faster training times than the original KAN implementation. We propose an adaptive training scheme for PIKANs, introducing an adaptive state transition technique to avoid loss function peaks between grid extensions, and a methodology for designing PIKANs with alternative basis functions. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrate that the adaptive features significantly enhance solution accuracy, decreasing the L^2 error relative to the reference solution by up to 43.02%. For the studied PDEs, our methodology approaches or surpasses the results obtained from architectures that utilize up to 8.5 times more parameters, highlighting the potential of adaptive, grid-dependent PIKANs as a superior alternative in scientific and engineering applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy resources. Forecasting photovoltaic power generation is an important way to increase photovoltaic penetration. However, the difficulty in qualifying the uncertainty of PV power generation, especially during hazy weather, makes forecasting challenging. This paper proposes a novel model to address the issue. We introduce a modified entropy to qualify uncertainty during hazy weather while clustering and attention mechanisms are employed to reduce computational costs and enhance forecasting accuracy, respectively. Hyperparameters were adjusted using an optimization algorithm. Experiments on two datasets related to hazy weather demonstrate that our model significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to existing models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Tang, Ye Liu, Xukai Liu, Kai Zhang, Yanghai Zhang, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have led to the development of sophisticated models trained on extensive datasets, yet raising concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information. In response, regulatory measures such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven increasing interest in Machine Unlearning techniques, which enable models to selectively forget specific data entries. Early approaches primarily relied on pre-processing methods, while more recent research has shifted towards training-based unlearning techniques. Despite their effectiveness, most existing methods require access to the original training data, which is often inaccessible. Additionally, directly applying unlearning techniques bear the cost of undermining the model's expressive capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which consists of three core components: A Knowledge Unlearning Induction module designed to remove specific knowledge through an unlearning loss; A Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to preserve the model's expressive capabilities against the pure unlearning goal; And an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module that dynamically assess the unlearning extent on specific data pieces and make iterative update. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our ICU method in unlearning sensitive information while maintaining the model's overall performance, offering a promising solution for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peijie Dong, Lujun Li, Yuedong Zhong, Dayou Du, Ruibo Fan, Yuhan Chen, Zhenheng Tang, Qiang Wang, Wei Xue, Yike Guo, Xiaowen Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present the first structural binarization method for LLM compression to less than 1-bit precision. Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, their memory-bound nature during the inference stage hinders the adoption of resource-constrained devices. Reducing weights to 1-bit precision through binarization substantially enhances computational efficiency. We observe that some weights in binarized LLMs can be randomly flipped without significant performance degradation, suggesting the potential for further compression. To exploit this, our STBLLM employs an N:M sparsity technique to achieve structural binarization of the weights. Specifically, we introduce a novel Standardized Importance (SI) metric, which considers weight magnitude and input feature norm to more accurately assess weight significance. Then, we propose a layer-wise approach, allowing different layers of the LLM to be sparsified with varying N:M ratios, thereby balancing compression and accuracy. Furthermore, we implement a fine-grained grouping strategy for less important weights, applying distinct quantization schemes to sparse, intermediate, and dense regions. Finally, we design a specialized CUDA kernel to support structural binarization. We conduct extensive experiments on LLaMA-1/2/3, OPT family, and Mistral to evaluate the effectiveness of STBLLM. The results demonstrate that our approach performs better than other compressed binarization LLM methods while significantly reducing memory requirements.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11077">Characteristic Performance Study on Solving Oscillator ODEs via Soft-constrained Physics-informed Neural Network with Small Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai-liang Lu, Yu-meng Su, Zhuo Bi, Cheng Qiu, Wen-jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper compared physics-informed neural network (PINN), conventional neural network (NN) and traditional numerical discretization methods on solving differential equations (DEs) through literature investigation and experimental validation. We focused on the soft-constrained PINN approach and formalized its mathematical framework and computational flow for solving Ordinary DEs and Partial DEs (ODEs/PDEs). The working mechanism and its accuracy and efficiency were experimentally verified by solving typical linear and non-linear oscillator ODEs. We demonstrate that the DeepXDE-based implementation of PINN is not only light code and efficient in training, but also flexible across CPU/GPU platforms. PINN greatly reduces the need for labeled data: when the nonlinearity of the ODE is weak, a very small amount of supervised training data plus a few unsupervised collocation points are sufficient to predict the solution; in the minimalist case, only one or two training points (with initial values) are needed for first- or second-order ODEs, respectively. We also find that, with the aid of collocation points and the use of physical information, PINN has the ability to extrapolate data outside the time domain of the training set, and especially is robust to noisy data, thus with enhanced generalization capabilities. Training is accelerated when the gains obtained along with the reduction in the amount of data outweigh the delay caused by the increase in the loss function terms. The soft-constrained PINN can easily impose a physical law (e.g., conservation of energy) constraint by adding a regularization term to the total loss function, thus improving the solution performance to ODEs that obey this physical law. Furthermore, PINN can also be used for stiff ODEs, PDEs, and other types of DEs, and is becoming a favorable catalyst for the era of Digital Twins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianze Zheng, Ailun Wang, Xu Han, Yu Xia, Xingyuan Xu, Jiawei Zhan, Yu Liu, Yang Chen, Zhi Wang, Xiaojie Wu, Sheng Gong, Wen Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: A force field is a critical component in molecular dynamics simulations for computational drug discovery. It must achieve high accuracy within the constraints of molecular mechanics' (MM) limited functional forms, which offers high computational efficiency. With the rapid expansion of synthetically accessible chemical space, traditional look-up table approaches face significant challenges. In this study, we address this issue using a modern data-driven approach, developing ByteFF, an Amber-compatible force field for drug-like molecules. To create ByteFF, we generated an expansive and highly diverse molecular dataset at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/DZVP level of theory. This dataset includes 2.4 million optimized molecular fragment geometries with analytical Hessian matrices, along with 3.2 million torsion profiles. We then trained an edge-augmented, symmetry-preserving molecular graph neural network (GNN) on this dataset, employing a carefully optimized training strategy. Our model predicts all bonded and non-bonded MM force field parameters for drug-like molecules simultaneously across a broad chemical space. ByteFF demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets, excelling in predicting relaxed geometries, torsional energy profiles, and conformational energies and forces. Its exceptional accuracy and expansive chemical space coverage make ByteFF a valuable tool for multiple stages of computational drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. Akansha</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for predicting outcomes in graph-structured data. However, a notable limitation of GNNs is their inability to provide robust uncertainty estimates, which undermines their reliability in contexts where errors are costly. One way to address this issue is by providing prediction sets that contain the true label with a predefined probability margin. Our approach builds upon conformal prediction (CP), a framework that promises to construct statistically robust prediction sets or intervals. There are two primary challenges: first, given dependent data like graphs, it is unclear whether the critical assumption in CP - exchangeability - still holds when applied to node classification. Second, even if the exchangeability assumption is valid for conformalized link prediction, we need to ensure high efficiency, i.e., the resulting prediction set or the interval length is small enough to provide useful information. In this article, we propose a novel approach termed Robust Conformal Prediction for GNNs (RoCP-GNN), which integrates conformal prediction (CP) directly into the GNN training process. This method generates prediction sets, instead of just point predictions, that are valid at a user-defined confidence level, assuming only exchangeability. Our approach robustly predicts outcomes with any predictive GNN model while quantifying the uncertainty in predictions within the realm of graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL). Experimental results demonstrate that GNN models with size loss provide a statistically significant increase in performance. We validate our approach on standard graph benchmark datasets by coupling it with various state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification. The code will be made available after publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: With growing investigations into solving partial differential equations by physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), more accurate and efficient PINNs are required to meet the practical demands of scientific computing. One bottleneck of current PINNs is computing the high-order derivatives via automatic differentiation which often necessitates substantial computing resources. In this paper, we focus on removing the automatic differentiation of the spatial derivatives and propose a spectral-based neural network that substitutes the differential operator with a multiplication. Compared to the PINNs, our approach requires lower memory and shorter training time. Thanks to the exponential convergence of the spectral basis, our approach is more accurate. Moreover, to handle the different situations between physics domain and spectral domain, we provide two strategies to train networks by their spectral information. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, We validate the aforementioned merits of our proposed network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kezhou Ren, Meihan Jin, Huiming Liu, Yongxi Gong, Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cycling has gained global popularity for its health benefits and positive urban impacts. To effectively promote cycling, early studies have extensively investigated the relationship between cycling behaviors and environmental factors, especially cyclists' preferences when making route decisions. However, these studies often struggle to comprehensively describe detailed cycling procedures at a large scale due to data limitations, and they tend to overlook the complex nature of cyclists' preferences. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed to quantify and interpret cyclists' complicated visual preferences by leveraging maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning(MEDIRL)and explainable artificial intelligence(XAI). Implemented in Bantian Sub-district, Shenzhen, we adapt MEDIRL model for efficient estimation of cycling reward function by integrating dockless-bike-sharing(DBS) trajectory and street view images(SVIs), which serves as a representation of cyclists' preferences for street visual environments during routing. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MEDIRL in discovering cyclists' visual preferences. We find that cyclists focus on specific street visual elements when making route decisions, which can be summarized as their attention to safety, street enclosure, and cycling comfort. Further analysis reveals the complex nonlinear effects of street visual elements on cyclists' preferences, offering a cost-effective perspective on streetscapes design. Our proposed framework advances the understanding of individual cycling behaviors and provides actionable insights for urban planners to design bicycle-friendly streetscapes that prioritize cyclists' preferences.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement and increasing complexity of pretrained models, exemplified by CLIP, offer significant opportunities as well as challenges for Federated Learning (FL), a critical component of privacy-preserving artificial intelligence. This research delves into the intricacies of integrating large foundation models like CLIP within FL frameworks to enhance privacy, efficiency, and adaptability across heterogeneous data landscapes. It specifically addresses the challenges posed by non-IID data distributions, the computational and communication overheads of leveraging such complex models, and the skewed representation of classes within datasets. We propose TriplePlay, a framework that integrates CLIP as an adapter to enhance FL's adaptability and performance across diverse data distributions. This approach addresses the long-tail distribution challenge to ensure fairness while reducing resource demands through quantization and low-rank adaptation techniques.Our simulation results demonstrate that TriplePlay effectively decreases GPU usage costs and speeds up the learning process, achieving convergence with reduced communication overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher M. Ackerman</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation engineering is becoming increasingly popular as a means of online control of large language models (LLMs). In this work, I extend the idea of active steering with vectors that represent a behavioral direction of interest to tuning those vectors directly into the model, obviating the need for online control. First, I identify activation vectors related to honesty in an open-source LLM (Llama- 2-13b-chat). Next, I demonstrate that model output can be made more or less honest by adding positive or negative multiples of these vectors to residual stream activations during generation. Then, I show that a similar effect can be achieved by fine-tuning the vectors directly into the model, by use of a dual loss function based on the cosine similarity of residual stream activations to the vectors combined with a standard token-based loss ("representation tuning"). Finally, I compare the generations in response to honesty-probing prompts from the resulting models to those from models fine-tuned with a token-based loss alone, and to those from the untuned model subjected to online steering. Overall, fine-tuning the vectors into the models using the cosine similarity plus token loss showed a stronger effect than online steering, and generalized better than using the standard loss, suggesting the potential utility of this approach as a safety measure.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atrin Arya, Sana Ayromlou, Armin Saadat, Purang Abolmaesumi, Xiaoxiao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard deep learning-based classification approaches may not always be practical in real-world clinical applications, as they require a centralized collection of all samples. Federated learning (FL) provides a paradigm that can learn from distributed datasets across clients without requiring them to share data, which can help mitigate privacy and data ownership issues. In FL, sub-optimal convergence caused by data heterogeneity is common among data from different health centers due to the variety in data collection protocols and patient demographics across centers. Through experimentation in this study, we show that data heterogeneity leads to the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting during local training. We propose FedImpres which alleviates catastrophic forgetting by restoring synthetic data that represents the global information as federated impression. To achieve this, we distill the global model resulting from each communication round. Subsequently, we use the synthetic data alongside the local data to enhance the generalization of local training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the BloodMNIST and Retina datasets, which contain label imbalance and domain shift, with an improvement in classification accuracy of up to 20%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingwei Meng, Zongren Zou, J\'er\^ome Darbon, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The interplay between stochastic processes and optimal control has been extensively explored in the literature. With the recent surge in the use of diffusion models, stochastic processes have increasingly been applied to sample generation. This paper builds on the log transform, known as the Cole-Hopf transform in Brownian motion contexts, and extends it within a more abstract framework that includes a linear operator. Within this framework, we found that the well-known relationship between the Cole-Hopf transform and optimal transport is a particular instance where the linear operator acts as the infinitesimal generator of a stochastic process. We also introduce a novel scenario where the linear operator is the adjoint of the generator, linking to Bayesian inference under specific initial and terminal conditions. Leveraging this theoretical foundation, we develop a new algorithm, named the HJ-sampler, for Bayesian inference for the inverse problem of a stochastic differential equation with given terminal observations. The HJ-sampler involves two stages: (1) solving the viscous Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations, and (2) sampling from the associated stochastic optimal control problem. Our proposed algorithm naturally allows for flexibility in selecting the numerical solver for viscous HJ PDEs. We introduce two variants of the solver: the Riccati-HJ-sampler, based on the Riccati method, and the SGM-HJ-sampler, which utilizes diffusion models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed methods by applying them to solve Bayesian inverse problems involving various stochastic processes and prior distributions, including applications that address model misspecifications and quantifying model uncertainty.</p>

<p>Abstract: Feature-based methods are commonly used to explain model predictions, but these methods often implicitly assume that interpretable features are readily available. However, this is often not the case for high-dimensional data, and it can be hard even for domain experts to mathematically specify which features are important. Can we instead automatically extract collections or groups of features that are aligned with expert knowledge? To address this gap, we present FIX (Features Interpretable to eXperts), a benchmark for measuring how well a collection of features aligns with expert knowledge. In collaboration with domain experts, we propose FIXScore, a unified expert alignment measure applicable to diverse real-world settings across cosmology, psychology, and medicine domains in vision, language and time series data modalities. With FIXScore, we find that popular feature-based explanation methods have poor alignment with expert-specified knowledge, highlighting the need for new methods that can better identify features interpretable to experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Yan, Yaoting Jiang, Wenyi Liu, Didi Yi, Jianjun Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel spatiotemporal feature representation model designed to address the limitations of traditional methods in multidimensional time series (MTS) analysis. The proposed approach converts MTS into one-dimensional sequences of spatially evolving events, preserving the complex coupling relationships between dimensions. By employing a variable-length tuple mining method, key spatiotemporal features are extracted, enhancing the interpretability and accuracy of time series analysis. Unlike conventional models, this unsupervised method does not rely on large training datasets, making it adaptable across different domains. Experimental results from motion sequence classification validate the model's superior performance in capturing intricate patterns within the data. The proposed framework has significant potential for applications across various fields, including backend services for monitoring and optimizing IT infrastructure, medical diagnosis through continuous patient monitoring and health trend analysis, and internet businesses for tracking user behavior and forecasting sales. This work offers a new theoretical foundation and technical support for advancing time series data mining and its practical applications in human behavior recognition and other domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lyudong Jin, Ming Tang, Jiayu Pan, Meng Zhang, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of emerging real-time networked applications like cyber-physical systems (CPS), the Age of Information (AoI) has merged as a pivotal metric for evaluating the timeliness. To meet the high computational demands, such as those in intelligent manufacturing within CPS, mobile edge computing (MEC) presents a promising solution for optimizing computing and reducing AoI. In this work, we study the timeliness of computational-intensive updates and explores jointly optimize the task updating and offloading policies to minimize AoI. Specifically, we consider edge load dynamics and formulate a task scheduling problem to minimize the expected time-average AoI. The fractional objective introduced by AoI and the semi-Markov game nature of the problem render this challenge particularly difficult, with existing approaches not directly applicable. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework to fractional reinforcement learning (RL). We first introduce a fractional single-agent RL framework and prove its linear convergence. We then extend this to a fractional multi-agent RL framework with a convergence analysis. To tackle the challenge of asynchronous control in semi-Markov game, we further design an asynchronous model-free fractional multi-agent RL algorithm, where each device makes scheduling decisions with the hybrid action space without knowing the system dynamics and decisions of other devices. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms reduce the average AoI by up to 52.6% compared with the best baseline algorithm in our experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chrisantus Eze, Christopher Crick</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent works have focused on source-free UDA, where only target data is available. This is challenging as models rely on noisy pseudo-labels and struggle with distribution shifts. We propose Active Adversarial Alignment (A3), a novel framework combining self-supervised learning, adversarial training, and active learning for robust source-free UDA. A3 actively samples informative and diverse data using an acquisition function for training. It adapts models via adversarial losses and consistency regularization, aligning distributions without source data access. A3 advances source-free UDA through its synergistic integration of active and adversarial learning for effective domain alignment and noise reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueyang Liu, Lance Kennedy, Hossein Amiri, Andreas Z\"ufle</p>
<p>Abstract: Human trajectory anomaly detection has become increasingly important across a wide range of applications, including security surveillance and public health. However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laixi Shi, Jingchu Gai, Eric Mazumdar, Yuejie Chi, Adam Wierman</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are vulnerable to sim-to-real gaps. To address this, distributionally robust Markov games (RMGs) have been proposed to enhance robustness in MARL by optimizing the worst-case performance when game dynamics shift within a prescribed uncertainty set. Solving RMGs remains under-explored, from problem formulation to the development of sample-efficient algorithms. A notorious yet open challenge is if RMGs can escape the curse of multiagency, where the sample complexity scales exponentially with the number of agents. In this work, we propose a natural class of RMGs where the uncertainty set of each agent is shaped by both the environment and other agents' strategies in a best-response manner. We first establish the well-posedness of these RMGs by proving the existence of game-theoretic solutions such as robust Nash equilibria and coarse correlated equilibria (CCE). Assuming access to a generative model, we then introduce a sample-efficient algorithm for learning the CCE whose sample complexity scales polynomially with all relevant parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to break the curse of multiagency for RMGs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasin I. Tepeli, Joana P. Gon\c{c}alves</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness in machine learning seeks to mitigate model bias against individuals based on sensitive features such as sex or age, often caused by an uneven representation of the population in the training data due to selection bias. Notably, bias unascribed to sensitive features is challenging to identify and typically goes undiagnosed, despite its prominence in complex high-dimensional data from fields like computer vision and molecular biomedicine. Strategies to mitigate unidentified bias and evaluate mitigation methods are crucially needed, yet remain underexplored. We introduce: (i) Diverse Class-Aware Self-Training (DCAST), model-agnostic mitigation aware of class-specific bias, which promotes sample diversity to counter confirmation bias of conventional self-training while leveraging unlabeled samples for an improved representation of the underlying population; (ii) hierarchy bias, multivariate and class-aware bias induction without prior knowledge. Models learned with DCAST showed improved robustness to hierarchy and other biases across eleven datasets, against conventional self-training and six prominent domain adaptation techniques. Advantage was largest on multi-class classification, emphasizing DCAST as a promising strategy for fairer learning in different contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yooseok Lim, Sujee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Sensing technology has significantly advanced in automating systems that reflect human movement, particularly in robotics and healthcare, where it is used to automatically detect target movements. This study develops a method to automatically count exercise repetitions by analyzing IMU signals, with a focus on a universal exercise repetition counting task that counts all types of exercise movements, including novel exercises not seen during training, using a single model. Since peak patterns can vary significantly between different exercises as well as between individuals performing the same exercise, the model needs to learn a complex embedding space of sensor data to generalize effectively. To address this challenge,we propose a repetition counting technique utilizing a deep metric-based few-shot learning approach, designed to handle both existing and novel exercises. By redefining the counting task as a few-shot classification problem, the method is capable of detecting peak repetition patterns in exercises not seen during training. The approach employs a Siamese network with triplet loss, optimizing the embedding space to distinguish between peak and non-peak frames. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing an 86.8% probability of accurately counting ten or more repetitions within a single set across 28 different exercises. This performance highlights the model's ability to generalize across various exercise types, including those not present in the training data. Such robustness and adaptability make the system a strong candidate for real-time implementation in fitness and healthcare applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Cheng, Ruixi Qiao, Gang Xiong, Qinghai Miao, Yingwei Ma, Binhua Li, Yongbin Li, Yisheng Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: A significant aspiration of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop a generalist agent with high capabilities from large and heterogeneous datasets. However, prior approaches that scale offline RL either rely heavily on expert trajectories or struggle to generalize to diverse unseen tasks. Inspired by the excellent generalization of world model in conditional video generation, we explore the potential of image observation-based world model for scaling offline RL and enhancing generalization on novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce JOWA: Jointly-Optimized World-Action model, an offline model-based RL agent pretrained on multiple Atari games with 6 billion tokens data to learn general-purpose representation and decision-making ability. Our method jointly optimizes a world-action model through a shared transformer backbone, which stabilize temporal difference learning with large models during pretraining. Moreover, we propose a provably efficient and parallelizable planning algorithm to compensate for the Q-value estimation error and thus search out better policies. Experimental results indicate that our largest agent, with 150 million parameters, achieves 78.9% human-level performance on pretrained games using only 10% subsampled offline data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art large-scale offline RL baselines by 31.6% on averange. Furthermore, JOWA scales favorably with model capacity and can sample-efficiently transfer to novel games using only 5k offline fine-tuning data (approximately 4 trajectories) per game, demonstrating superior generalization.

<p>Abstract: Looped Transformers offer advantages in parameter efficiency and Turing completeness. However, their expressive power for function approximation and approximation rate remains underexplored. In this paper, we establish approximation rates of Looped Transformers by defining the concept of the modulus of continuity for sequence-to-sequence functions. This reveals a limitation specific to the looped architecture. That is, the analysis prompts us to incorporate scaling parameters for each loop, conditioned on timestep encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of loops enhances performance, with further gains achieved through the timestep encoding architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Chen, Xingjun Ma, Difan Zou, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: As diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are being employed as mainstream models for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), the study of their memorization of training data has attracted growing attention. Existing works in this direction aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn via memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for trustworthy application of GenAI. Existing works revealed that conditional DPMs are more prone to training data memorization than unconditional DPMs, and the motivated data extraction methods are mostly for conditional DPMs. However, these understandings are primarily empirical, and extracting training data from unconditional models has been found to be extremely challenging. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding of memorization in both conditional and unconditional DPMs under the assumption of model convergence. Our theoretical analysis indicates that extracting data from unconditional models can also be effective by constructing a proper surrogate condition. Based on this result, we propose a novel data extraction method named \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a time-dependent classifier trained on the generated data as a surrogate condition to extract training data from unconditional DPMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our SIDE can extract training data in challenging scenarios where previous methods fail, and it is, on average, over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niki Nezakati, Md Kaykobad Reza, Ameya Patil, Mashhour Solh, M. Salman Asif</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning seeks to combine data from multiple input sources to enhance the performance of different downstream tasks. In real-world scenarios, performance can degrade substantially if some input modalities are missing. Existing methods that can handle missing modalities involve custom training or adaptation steps for each input modality combination. These approaches are either tied to specific modalities or become computationally expensive as the number of input modalities increases. In this paper, we propose Masked Modality Projection (MMP), a method designed to train a single model that is robust to any missing modality scenario. We achieve this by randomly masking a subset of modalities during training and learning to project available input modalities to estimate the tokens for the masked modalities. This approach enables the model to effectively learn to leverage the information from the available modalities to compensate for the missing ones, enhancing missing modality robustness. We conduct a series of experiments with various baseline models and datasets to assess the effectiveness of this strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves robustness to different missing modality scenarios, outperforming existing methods designed for missing modalities or specific modality combinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Louis Serrano, Armand Kassa\"i Koupa\"i, Thomas X Wang, Pierre Erbacher, Patrick Gallinari</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) is challenging, as models must adapt to variations in parameters such as coefficients, forcing terms, and boundary conditions. Data-driven neural solvers either train on data sampled from the PDE parameters distribution in the hope that the model generalizes to new instances or rely on gradient-based adaptation and meta-learning to implicitly encode the dynamics from observations. This often comes with increased inference complexity. Inspired by the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we introduce Zebra, a novel generative auto-regressive transformer designed to solve parametric PDEs without requiring gradient adaptation at inference. By leveraging in-context information during both pre-training and inference, Zebra dynamically adapts to new tasks by conditioning on input sequences that incorporate context trajectories or preceding states. This approach enables Zebra to flexibly handle arbitrarily sized context inputs and supports uncertainty quantification through the sampling of multiple solution trajectories. We evaluate Zebra across a variety of challenging PDE scenarios, demonstrating its adaptability, robustness, and superior performance compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Hess, Stefan Feuerriegel</p>
<p>Abstract: Patient trajectories from electronic health records are widely used to predict potential outcomes of treatments over time, which then allows to personalize care. Yet, existing neural methods for this purpose have a key limitation: while some adjust for time-varying confounding, these methods assume that the time series are recorded in discrete time. In other words, they are constrained to settings where measurements and treatments are conducted at fixed time steps, even though this is unrealistic in medical practice. In this work, we aim to predict potential outcomes in continuous time. The latter is of direct practical relevance because it allows for modeling patient trajectories where measurements and treatments take place at arbitrary, irregular timestamps. We thus propose a new method called stabilized continuous time inverse propensity network (SCIP-Net). For this, we further derive stabilized inverse propensity weights for robust prediction of the potential outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, our SCIP-Net is the first neural method that performs proper adjustments for time-varying confounding in continuous time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Ye, Yizhou Zhang, Wei Yang, Lumingyuan Tang, Defu Cao, Jie Cai, Yan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent decades, there has been substantial advances in time series models and benchmarks across various individual tasks, such as time series forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection. Meanwhile, compositional reasoning in time series is prevalent in real-world applications (e.g., decision-making and compositional question answering) and is in great demand. Unlike simple tasks that primarily focus on predictive accuracy, compositional reasoning emphasizes the synthesis of diverse information from both time series data and various domain knowledge, making it distinct and extremely more challenging. In this paper, we introduce Compositional Time Series Reasoning, a new task of handling intricate multistep reasoning tasks from time series data. Specifically, this new task focuses on various question instances requiring structural and compositional reasoning abilities on time series data, such as decision-making and compositional question answering. As an initial attempt to tackle this novel task, we developed TS-Reasoner, a program-aided approach that utilizes large language model (LLM) to decompose a complex task into steps of programs that leverage existing time series models and numerical subroutines. Unlike existing reasoning work which only calls off-the-shelf modules, TS-Reasoner allows for the creation of custom modules and provides greater flexibility to incorporate domain knowledge as well as user-specified constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a comprehensive set of experiments. These promising results indicate potential opportunities in the new task of time series reasoning and highlight the need for further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning (GSSL) has emerged as a compelling framework for extracting informative representations from graph-structured data without extensive reliance on labeled inputs. In this study, we introduce Graph Interplay (GIP), an innovative and versatile approach that significantly enhances the performance equipped with various existing GSSL methods. To this end, GIP advocates direct graph-level communications by introducing random inter-graph edges within standard batches. Against GIP's simplicity, we further theoretically show that \textsc{GIP} essentially performs a principled manifold separation via combining inter-graph message passing and GSSL, bringing about more structured embedding manifolds and thus benefits a series of downstream tasks. Our empirical study demonstrates that GIP surpasses the performance of prevailing GSSL methods across multiple benchmarks by significant margins, highlighting its potential as a breakthrough approach. Besides, GIP can be readily integrated into a series of GSSL methods and consistently offers additional performance gain. This advancement not only amplifies the capability of GSSL but also potentially sets the stage for a novel graph learning paradigm in a broader sense.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is an important problem with applications in various domains such as fraud detection, pattern recognition or medical diagnosis. Several algorithms have been introduced using classical computing approaches. However, using quantum computing for solving anomaly detection problems in time series data is a widely unexplored research field.
  This paper explores the application of quantum autoencoders to time series anomaly detection. We investigate two primary techniques for classifying anomalies: (1) Analyzing the reconstruction error generated by the quantum autoencoder and (2) latent representation analysis. Our simulated experimental results, conducted across various ansaetze, demonstrate that quantum autoencoders consistently outperform classical deep learning-based autoencoders across multiple datasets. Specifically, quantum autoencoders achieve superior anomaly detection performance while utilizing 60-230 times fewer parameters and requiring five times fewer training iterations. In addition, we implement our quantum encoder on real quantum hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate that quantum autoencoders achieve anomaly detection performance on par with their simulated counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Atanasov, Alexandru Meterez, James B. Simon, Cengiz Pehlevan</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider neural networks (NNs) where the final layer is down-scaled by a fixed hyperparameter $\gamma$. Recent work has identified $\gamma$ as controlling the strength of feature learning. As $\gamma$ increases, network evolution changes from "lazy" kernel dynamics to "rich" feature-learning dynamics, with a host of associated benefits including improved performance on common tasks. In this work, we conduct a thorough empirical investigation of the effect of scaling $\gamma$ across a variety of models and datasets in the online training setting. We first examine the interaction of $\gamma$ with the learning rate $\eta$, identifying several scaling regimes in the $\gamma$-$\eta$ plane which we explain theoretically using a simple model. We find that the optimal learning rate $\eta^*$ scales non-trivially with $\gamma$. In particular, $\eta^* \propto \gamma^2$ when $\gamma \ll 1$ and $\eta^* \propto \gamma^{2/L}$ when $\gamma \gg 1$ for a feed-forward network of depth $L$. Using this optimal learning rate scaling, we proceed with an empirical study of the under-explored "ultra-rich" $\gamma \gg 1$ regime. We find that networks in this regime display characteristic loss curves, starting with a long plateau followed by a drop-off, sometimes followed by one or more additional staircase steps. We find networks of different large $\gamma$ values optimize along similar trajectories up to a reparameterization of time. We further find that optimal online performance is often found at large $\gamma$ and could be missed if this hyperparameter is not tuned. Our findings indicate that analytical study of the large-$\gamma$ limit may yield useful insights into the dynamics of representation learning in performant models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting time-dependent dynamics of complex systems governed by non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) with varying parameters and domains is a challenging task motivated by applications across various fields. We introduce a novel family of neural operators based on our Graph Fourier Neural Kernels, designed to learn solution generators for nonlinear PDEs in which the highest-order term is diffusive, across multiple domains and parameters. G-FuNK combines components that are parameter- and domain-adapted with others that are not. The domain-adapted components are constructed using a weighted graph on the discretized domain, where the graph Laplacian approximates the highest-order diffusive term, ensuring boundary condition compliance and capturing the parameter and domain-specific behavior. Meanwhile, the learned components transfer across domains and parameters using our variant Fourier Neural Operators. This approach naturally embeds geometric and directional information, improving generalization to new test domains without need for retraining the network. To handle temporal dynamics, our method incorporates an integrated ODE solver to predict the evolution of the system. Experiments show G-FuNK's capability to accurately approximate heat, reaction diffusion, and cardiac electrophysiology equations across various geometries and anisotropic diffusivity fields. G-FuNK achieves low relative errors on unseen domains and fiber fields, significantly accelerating predictions compared to traditional finite-element solvers.</p>

However, urban environments are constantly evolving, and current model evaluations are often limited to traffic scenarios and use data mainly collected only a few weeks after training period to evaluate model performance. The generalization ability of these models remains largely unexplored. To address this, we propose a Spatiotemporal Out-of-Distribution (ST-OOD) benchmark, which comprises six urban scenario: bike-sharing, 311 services, pedestrian counts, traffic speed, traffic flow, ride-hailing demand, and bike-sharing, each with in-distribution (same year) and out-of-distribution (next years) settings. We extensively evaluate state-of-the-art spatiotemporal models and find that their performance degrades significantly in out-of-distribution settings, with most models performing even worse than a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Our findings suggest that current leading methods tend to over-rely on parameters to overfit training data, which may lead to good performance on in-distribution data but often results in poor generalization. We also investigated whether dropout could mitigate the negative effects of overfitting. Our results showed that a slight dropout rate could significantly improve generalization performance on most datasets, with minimal impact on in-distribution performance. However, balancing in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance remains a challenging problem. We hope that the proposed benchmark will encourage further research on this critical issue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elvis Dohmatob, Yunzhen Feng, Arjun Subramonian, Julia Kempe</p>
<p>Abstract: Within the scaling laws paradigm, which underpins the training of large neural networks like ChatGPT and Llama, we consider a supervised regression setting and establish the existance of a strong form of the model collapse phenomenon, a critical performance degradation due to synthetic data in the training corpus. Our results show that even the smallest fraction of synthetic data (e.g., as little as 1\% of the total training dataset) can still lead to model collapse: larger and larger training sets do not enhance performance. We further investigate whether increasing model size, an approach aligned with current trends in training large language models, exacerbates or mitigates model collapse. In a simplified regime where neural networks are approximated via random projections of tunable size, we both theoretically and empirically show that larger models can amplify model collapse. Interestingly, our theory also indicates that, beyond the interpolation threshold (which can be extremely high for very large datasets), larger models may mitigate the collapse, although they do not entirely prevent it. Our theoretical findings are empirically verified through experiments on language models and feed-forward neural networks for images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Irene Cannistraci, Emanuele Rodol\`a, Bastian Rieck</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn similar internal representations, both across different models and within their own layers. While inter-network similarities have enabled techniques such as model stitching and merging, intra-network similarities present new opportunities for designing more efficient architectures. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of these internal similarities across different layers in diverse neural architectures, showing that similarity patterns emerge independently of the datataset used. We introduce a simple metric, Block Redundancy, to detect redundant blocks, providing a foundation for future architectural optimization methods. Building on this, we propose Redundant Blocks Approximation (RBA), a general framework that identifies and approximates one or more redundant computational blocks using simpler transformations. We show that the transformation $\mathcal{T}$ between two representations can be efficiently computed in closed-form, and it is enough to replace the redundant blocks from the network. RBA reduces model parameters and time complexity while maintaining good performance. We validate our method on classification tasks in the vision domain using a variety of pretrained foundational models and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Sansone, Tim Lebailly, Tinne Tuytelaars</p>
<p>Abstract: We identify sufficient conditions to avoid known failure modes, including representation, dimensional, cluster and intracluster collapses, occurring in non-contrastive self-supervised learning. Based on these findings, we propose a principled design for the projector and loss function. We theoretically demonstrate that this design introduces an inductive bias that promotes learning representations that are both decorrelated and clustered without explicit enforcing these properties and leading to improved generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution that achieves robust training with respect to these failure modes while guaranteeing enhanced generalization performance in downstream tasks. We validate our theoretical findings on image datasets including SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet-100, and show that our solution, dubbed FALCON, outperforms existing feature decorrelation and cluster-based self-supervised learning methods in terms of generalization to clustering and linear classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Iacob, Lorenzo Sani, Meghdad Kurmanji, William F. Shen, Xinchi Qiu, Dongqi Cai, Yan Gao, Nicholas D. Lane</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Model pre-training benefits from a broader data mixture to enhance performance across domains and languages. However, training on such heterogeneous text corpora is complex, requiring extensive and cost-intensive efforts. Since these data sources vary in lexical, syntactic, and semantic aspects, they cause negative interference or the "curse of multilinguality". We propose a novel pre-training framework to alleviate this curse. Our method, DEPT, decouples the embedding layers from the transformer body while simultaneously training the latter in multiple contexts. DEPT enables the model to train without being bound to a shared global vocabulary. DEPT: (1) can train robustly and effectively under significant data heterogeneity, (2) reduces the parameter count of the token embeddings by up to 80% and the communication costs by 675x for billion-scale models (3) enhances model generalization and plasticity in adapting to new languages and domains, and (4) allows training with custom optimized vocabulary per data source. We prove DEPT's potential by performing the first vocabulary-agnostic federated multilingual pre-training of a 1.3 billion-parameter model across high and low-resource languages, reducing its parameter count by 409 million.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Kania, Marko Mihajlovic, Sergey Prokudin, Jacek Tabor, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently gained attention as a powerful approach for continuously representing signals such as images, videos, and 3D shapes using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). However, MLPs are known to exhibit a low-frequency bias, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency details accurately. This limitation is typically addressed by incorporating high-frequency input embeddings or specialized activation layers. In this work, we demonstrate that these embeddings and activations are often configured with hyperparameters that perform well on average but are suboptimal for specific input signals under consideration, necessitating a costly grid search to identify optimal settings. Our key observation is that the initial frequency spectrum of an untrained model's output correlates strongly with the model's eventual performance on a given target signal. Leveraging this insight, we propose frequency shifting (or FreSh), a method that selects embedding hyperparameters to align the frequency spectrum of the model's initial output with that of the target signal. We show that this simple initialization technique improves performance across various neural representation methods and tasks, achieving results comparable to extensive hyperparameter sweeps but with only marginal computational overhead compared to training a single model with default hyperparameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Qi, Haocheng Yin, Heng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We initiate a study of the geometry of the visual representation space -- the information channel from the vision encoder to the action decoder -- in an image-based control pipeline learned from behavior cloning. Inspired by the phenomenon of neural collapse (NC) in image classification, we investigate whether a similar law of clustering emerges in the visual representation space. Since image-based control is a regression task without explicitly defined classes, the central piece of the puzzle lies in determining according to what implicit classes the visual features cluster, if such a law exists. Focusing on image-based planar pushing, we posit the most important role of the visual representation in a control task is to convey a goal to the action decoder. We then classify training samples of expert demonstrations into eight "control-oriented" classes based on (a) the relative pose between the object and the target in the input or (b) the relative pose of the object induced by expert actions in the output, where one class corresponds to one relative pose orthant (REPO). Across four different instantiations of architecture, we report the prevalent emergence of control-oriented clustering in the visual representation space according to the eight REPOs. Beyond empirical observation, we show such a law of clustering can be leveraged as an algorithmic tool to improve test-time performance when training a policy with limited expert demonstrations. Particularly, we pretrain the vision encoder using NC as a regularization to encourage control-oriented clustering of the visual features. Surprisingly, such an NC-pretrained vision encoder, when finetuned end-to-end with the action decoder, boosts the test-time performance by 10% to 35% in the low-data regime. Real-world vision-based planar pushing experiments confirmed the surprising advantage of control-oriented visual representation pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Yang, Hao Ban, Minhui Huang, Shiqian Ma, Kaiyi Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Bilevel optimization has recently attracted considerable attention due to its abundant applications in machine learning problems. However, existing methods rely on prior knowledge of problem parameters to determine stepsizes, resulting in significant effort in tuning stepsizes when these parameters are unknown. In this paper, we propose two novel tuning-free algorithms, D-TFBO and S-TFBO. D-TFBO employs a double-loop structure with stepsizes adaptively adjusted by the "inverse of cumulative gradient norms" strategy. S-TFBO features a simpler fully single-loop structure that updates three variables simultaneously with a theory-motivated joint design of adaptive stepsizes for all variables. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis for both algorithms and show that D-TFBO and S-TFBO respectively require $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ and $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log^4(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ iterations to find an $\epsilon$-accurate stationary point, (nearly) matching their well-tuned counterparts using the information of problem parameters. Experiments on various problems show that our methods achieve performance comparable to existing well-tuned approaches, while being more robust to the selection of initial stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, our methods are the first to completely eliminate the need for stepsize tuning, while achieving theoretical guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengjian Hua, Matthieu Lauri\`ere, Eric Vanden-Eijnden</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a simulation-free algorithm for the solution of generic problems in stochastic optimal control (SOC). Unlike existing methods, our approach does not require the solution of an adjoint problem, but rather leverages Girsanov theorem to directly calculate the gradient of the SOC objective on-policy. This allows us to speed up the optimization of control policies parameterized by neural networks since it completely avoids the expensive back-propagation step through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used in the Neural SDE framework. In particular, it enables us to solve SOC problems in high dimension and on long time horizons. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in various domains of applications, including standard stochastic optimal control problems, sampling from unnormalized distributions via construction of a Schr\"odinger-F\"ollmer process, and fine-tuning of pre-trained diffusion models. In all cases our method is shown to outperform the existing methods in both the computing time and memory efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Heid, Marcel Wever, Eyke H\"ullermeier</p>
<p>Abstract: Syntactic annotation of corpora in the form of part-of-speech (POS) tags is a key requirement for both linguistic research and subsequent automated natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This problem is commonly tackled using machine learning methods, i.e., by training a POS tagger on a sufficiently large corpus of labeled data. While the problem of POS tagging can essentially be considered as solved for modern languages, historical corpora turn out to be much more difficult, especially due to the lack of native speakers and sparsity of training data. Moreover, most texts have no sentences as we know them today, nor a common orthography. These irregularities render the task of automated POS tagging more difficult and error-prone. Under these circumstances, instead of forcing the POS tagger to predict and commit to a single tag, it should be enabled to express its uncertainty. In this paper, we consider POS tagging within the framework of set-valued prediction, which allows the POS tagger to express its uncertainty via predicting a set of candidate POS tags instead of guessing a single one. The goal is to guarantee a high confidence that the correct POS tag is included while keeping the number of candidates small. In our experimental study, we find that extending state-of-the-art POS taggers to set-valued prediction yields more precise and robust taggings, especially for unknown words, i.e., words not occurring in the training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Rando, Cesare Molinari, Silvia Villa, Lorenzo Rosasco</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce and analyze Structured Stochastic Zeroth order Descent (S-SZD), a finite difference approach that approximates a stochastic gradient on a set of $l\leq d$ orthogonal directions, where $d$ is the dimension of the ambient space. These directions are randomly chosen and may change at each step. For smooth convex functions we prove almost sure convergence of the iterates and a convergence rate on the function values of the form $O( (d/l) k^{-c})$ for every $c<1/2$, which is arbitrarily close to the one of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in terms of number of iterations. Our bound shows the benefits of using $l$ multiple directions instead of one. For non-convex functions satisfying the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition, we establish the first convergence rates for stochastic structured zeroth order algorithms under such an assumption. We corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical simulations where the assumptions are satisfied and on the real-world problem of hyper-parameter optimization in machine learning, achieving competitive practical performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roshni Sahoo, Lihua Lei, Stefan Wager</p>
<p>Abstract: The empirical risk minimization approach to data-driven decision making requires access to training data drawn under the same conditions as those that will be faced when the decision rule is deployed. However, in a number of settings, we may be concerned that our training sample is biased in the sense that some groups (characterized by either observable or unobservable attributes) may be under- or over-represented relative to the general population; and in this setting empirical risk minimization over the training set may fail to yield rules that perform well at deployment. We propose a model of sampling bias called conditional $\Gamma$-biased sampling, where observed covariates can affect the probability of sample selection arbitrarily much but the amount of unexplained variation in the probability of sample selection is bounded by a constant factor. Applying the distributionally robust optimization framework, we propose a method for learning a decision rule that minimizes the worst-case risk incurred under a family of test distributions that can generate the training distribution under $\Gamma$-biased sampling. We apply a result of Rockafellar and Uryasev to show that this problem is equivalent to an augmented convex risk minimization problem. We give statistical guarantees for learning a model that is robust to sampling bias via the method of sieves, and propose a deep learning algorithm whose loss function captures our robust learning target. We empirically validate our proposed method in a case study on prediction of mental health scores from health survey data and a case study on ICU length of stay prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Iterative regularization is a classic idea in regularization theory, that has recently become popular in machine learning. On the one hand, it allows to design efficient algorithms controlling at the same time numerical and statistical accuracy. On the other hand it allows to shed light on the learning curves observed while training neural networks. In this paper, we focus on iterative regularization in the context of classification. After contrasting this setting with that of linear inverse problems, we develop an iterative regularization approach based on the use of the hinge loss function. More precisely we consider a diagonal approach for a family of algorithms for which we prove convergence as well as rates of convergence and stability results for a suitable classification noise model. Our approach compares favorably with other alternatives, as confirmed by numerical simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization aims to find the Pareto front of trade-offs between a set of expensive objectives while collecting as few samples as possible. In some cases, it is possible to evaluate the objectives separately, and a different latency or evaluation cost can be associated with each objective. This decoupling of the objectives presents an opportunity to learn the Pareto front faster by avoiding unnecessary, expensive evaluations. We propose a scalarization based knowledge gradient acquisition function which accounts for the different evaluation costs of the objectives. We prove asymptotic consistency of the estimator of the optimum for an arbitrary, D-dimensional, real compact search space and show empirically that the algorithm performs comparably with the state of the art and significantly outperforms versions which always evaluate both objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinmay Savadikar, Michelle Dai, Tianfu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies task-incremental continual learning (TCL) using Vision Transformers (ViTs). Our goal is to improve the overall streaming-task performance without catastrophic forgetting by learning task synergies (e.g., a new task learns to automatically reuse/adapt modules from previous similar tasks, or to introduce new modules when needed, or to skip some modules when it appears to be an easier task). One grand challenge is how to tame ViTs at streaming diverse tasks in terms of balancing their plasticity and stability in a task-aware way while overcoming the catastrophic forgetting. To address the challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that identifies a lightweight yet expressive ``sweet spot'' in the ViT block as the task-synergy memory in TCL. We present a Hierarchical task-synergy Exploration-Exploitation (HEE) sampling based neural architecture search (NAS) method for effectively learning task synergies by structurally updating the identified memory component with respect to four basic operations (reuse, adapt, new and skip) at streaming tasks. The proposed method is thus dubbed as CHEEM (Continual Hierarchical-Exploration-Exploitation Memory). In experiments, we test the proposed CHEEM on the challenging Visual Domain Decathlon (VDD) benchmark and the 5-Dataset benchmark. It obtains consistently better performance than the prior art with sensible CHEEM learned continually.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henrik Hose, Johannes K\"ohler, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Sebastian Trimpe</p>
<p>Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) achieves stability and constraint satisfaction for general nonlinear systems, but requires computationally expensive online optimization. This paper studies approximations of such MPC controllers via neural networks (NNs) to achieve fast online evaluation. We propose safety augmentation that yields deterministic guarantees for convergence and constraint satisfaction despite approximation inaccuracies. We approximate the entire input sequence of the MPC with NNs, which allows us to verify online if it is a feasible solution to the MPC problem. We replace the NN solution by a safe candidate based on standard MPC techniques whenever it is infeasible or has worse cost. Our method requires a single evaluation of the NN and forward integration of the input sequence online, which is fast to compute on resource-constrained systems. The proposed control framework is illustrated using two numerical non-linear MPC benchmarks of different complexity, demonstrating computational speedups that are orders of magnitude higher than online optimization. In the examples, we achieve deterministic safety through the safety-augmented NNs, where a naive NN implementation fails.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we consider outlier-robust predictive modeling using highly-expressive neural networks. To this end, we employ (1) a transformed trimmed loss (TTL), which is a computationally feasible variant of the classical trimmed loss, and (2) a higher-order variation regularization (HOVR) of the prediction model. Note that using only TTL to train the neural network may possess outlier vulnerability, as its high expressive power causes it to overfit even the outliers perfectly. However, simultaneously introducing HOVR constrains the effective degrees of freedom, thereby avoiding fitting outliers. We newly provide an efficient stochastic algorithm for optimization and its theoretical convergence guarantee. (*Two authors contributed equally to this work.)</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in language-related tasks, but their deployment poses significant challenges due to substantial memory and storage requirements. Weight-only quantization has emerged as a promising solution, significantly reducing memory and storage needs without sacrificing too much performance. In this study, we introduce SignRound, a method that leverages signed gradient descent (SignSGD) to optimize rounding values and weight clipping in just 200 steps. SignRound integrates the advantages of Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), delivering exceptional results across 2 to 4 bits while minimizing tuning costs and avoiding additional inference overhead. For example, SignRound achieved absolute average accuracy improvements ranging from 6.91% to 33.22% at 2bits, as measured by the average zero-shot accuracy across 11 tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalization in recent models, achieving near-lossless 4-bit quantization in most scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Chen, Jason M. Klusowski, Yan Shuo Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Stacking regressions is an ensemble technique that forms linear combinations of different regression estimators to enhance predictive accuracy. The conventional approach uses cross-validation data to generate predictions from the constituent estimators, and least-squares with nonnegativity constraints to learn the combination weights. In this paper, we learn these weights analogously by minimizing a regularized version of the empirical risk subject to a nonnegativity constraint. When the constituent estimators are linear least-squares projections onto nested subspaces separated by at least three dimensions, we show that thanks to an adaptive shrinkage effect, the resulting stacked estimator has strictly smaller population risk than best single estimator among them, with more significant gains when the signal-to-noise ratio is small. Here "best" refers to an estimator that minimizes a model selection criterion such as AIC or BIC. In other words, in this setting, the best single estimator is inadmissible. Because the optimization problem can be reformulated as isotonic regression, the stacked estimator requires the same order of computation as the best single estimator, making it an attractive alternative in terms of both performance and implementation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruida Wang, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong, Weile Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Session-based recommendation, aiming at making the prediction of the user's next item click based on the information in a single session only, even in the presence of some random user's behavior, is a complex problem. This complex problem requires a high-capability model of predicting the user's next action. Most (if not all) existing models follow the encoder-predictor paradigm where all studies focus on how to optimize the encoder module extensively in the paradigm, but they overlook how to optimize the predictor module. In this paper, we discover the critical issue of the low-capability predictor module among existing models. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework called *Session-based Recommendation with Predictor Add-On* (SR-PredictAO). In this framework, we propose a high-capability predictor module which could alleviate the effect of random user's behavior for prediction. It is worth mentioning that this framework could be applied to any existing models, which could give opportunities for further optimizing the framework. Extensive experiments on two real-world benchmark datasets for three state-of-the-art models show that *SR-PredictAO* out-performs the current state-of-the-art model by up to 2.9% in HR@20 and 2.3% in MRR@20. More importantly, the improvement is consistent across almost all the existing models on all datasets, and is statistically significant, which could be regarded as a significant contribution in the field.</p>

We look at this problem from the point of view of machine learning, where one party is promised an improvement on its prediction model by incorporating data from the other party. The parties would only wish to collaborate further if the updated model shows an improvement in accuracy. Before this is ascertained, the two parties would not want to disclose their models and datasets. In this work, we construct an interactive protocol for this problem based on the fully homomorphic encryption scheme over the Torus (TFHE) and label differential privacy, where the underlying machine learning model is a neural network. Label differential privacy is used to ensure that computations are not done entirely in the encrypted domain, which is a significant bottleneck for neural network training according to the current state-of-the-art FHE implementations. We formally prove the security of our scheme assuming honest-but-curious parties, but where one party may not have any expertise in labelling its initial dataset. Experiments show that we can obtain the output, i.e., the accuracy of the updated model, with time many orders of magnitude faster than a protocol using entirely FHE operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessio Arcudi, Davide Frizzo, Chiara Masiero, Gian Antonio Susto</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) focuses on identifying unusual behaviors in complex datasets. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Decision Support Systems (DSSs) provide effective solutions for AD, but detecting anomalies alone may not be enough, especially in engineering, where diagnostics and maintenance are crucial. Users need clear explanations to support root cause analysis and build trust in the model. The unsupervised nature of AD, however, makes interpretability a challenge. This paper introduces Extended Isolation Forest Feature Importance (ExIFFI), a method that explains predictions made by Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) models, which split data using hyperplanes. ExIFFI provides explanations at both global and local levels by leveraging feature importance.
  We also present an improved version, Enhanced Extended Isolation Forest (EIF+), designed to enhance the model's ability to detect unseen anomalies through a revised splitting strategy. Using five synthetic and eleven real-world datasets, we conduct a comparative analysis, evaluating unsupervised AD methods with the Average Precision metric. EIF+ consistently outperforms EIF across all datasets when trained without anomalies, demonstrating better generalization.
  To assess ExIFFI's interpretability, we introduce the Area Under the Curve of Feature Selection (AUC\_FS), a novel metric using feature selection as a proxy task. ExIFFI outperforms other unsupervised interpretability methods on 8 of 11 real-world datasets and successfully identifies anomalous features in synthetic datasets. When trained only on inliers, ExIFFI also outperforms competing models on real-world data and accurately detects anomalous features in synthetic datasets. We provide open-source code to encourage further research and reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhan Yu, Qiuhao Chen, Yuling Jiao, Yinan Li, Xiliang Lu, Xin Wang, Jerry Zhijian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have emerged as a promising approach for quantum neural networks. However, understanding their expressive power in accomplishing machine learning tasks remains a crucial question. This paper investigates the expressivity of PQCs for approximating general multivariate function classes. Unlike previous Universal Approximation Theorems for PQCs, which are either nonconstructive or rely on parameterized classical data processing, we explicitly construct data re-uploading PQCs for approximating multivariate polynomials and smooth functions. We establish the first non-asymptotic approximation error bounds for these functions in terms of the number of qubits, quantum circuit depth, and number of trainable parameters. Notably, we demonstrate that for approximating functions that satisfy specific smoothness criteria, the quantum circuit size and number of trainable parameters of our proposed PQCs can be smaller than those of deep ReLU neural networks. We further validate the approximation capability of PQCs through numerical experiments. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for designing practical PQCs and quantum neural networks for machine learning tasks that can be implemented on near-term quantum devices, paving the way for the advancement of quantum machine learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Conversational Factor Information Retrieval Method (ConFIRM), a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific retrieval tasks. ConFIRM leverages the Five-Factor Model of personality to generate synthetic datasets that accurately reflect target population characteristics, addressing data scarcity in specialized domains. We demonstrate ConFIRM's effectiveness through a case study in the finance sector, fine-tuning a Llama-2-7b model using personality-aligned data from the PolyU-Asklora Fintech Adoption Index. The resulting model achieved 91% accuracy in classifying financial queries, with an average inference time of 0.61 seconds on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. ConFIRM shows promise for creating more accurate and personalized AI-driven information retrieval systems across various domains, potentially mitigating issues of hallucinations and outdated information in LLMs deployed</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuseppe Chindemi, Benoit Girard, Camilla Bellone</p>
<p>Abstract: Social behavior is crucial for survival in many animal species, and a heavily investigated research subject. Current analysis methods generally rely on measuring animal interaction time or annotating predefined behaviors. However, these approaches are time consuming, human biased, and can fail to capture subtle behaviors. Here we introduce LISBET (LISBET Is a Social BEhavior Transformer), a machine learning model for detecting and segmenting social interactions. Using self-supervised learning on body tracking data, our model eliminates the need for extensive human annotation. We tested LISBET in three scenarios across multiple datasets in mice: supervised behavior classification, unsupervised motifs segmentation, and unsupervised animal phenotyping. Additionally, in vivo electrophysiology revealed distinct neural signatures in the Ventral Tegmental Area corresponding to motifs identified by our model. In summary, LISBET automates data annotation and reduces human bias in social behavior research, offering a promising approach to enhance our understanding of behavior and its neural correlates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingqian Zheng, Jiaxin Pei, Lajanugen Logeswaran, Moontae Lee, David Jurgens</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompting serves as the major way humans interact with Large Language Models (LLM). Commercial AI systems commonly define the role of the LLM in system prompts. For example, ChatGPT uses ``You are a helpful assistant'' as part of its default system prompt. Despite current practices of adding personas to system prompts, it remains unclear how different personas affect a model's performance on objective tasks. In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of personas in system prompts. We curate a list of 162 roles covering 6 types of interpersonal relationships and 8 domains of expertise. Through extensive analysis of 4 popular families of LLMs and 2,410 factual questions, we demonstrate that adding personas in system prompts does not improve model performance across a range of questions compared to the control setting where no persona is added. Nevertheless, further analysis suggests that the gender, type, and domain of the persona can all influence the resulting prediction accuracies. We further experimented with a list of persona search strategies and found that, while aggregating results from the best persona for each question significantly improves prediction accuracy, automatically identifying the best persona is challenging, with predictions often performing no better than random selection. Overall, our findings suggest that while adding a persona may lead to performance gains in certain settings, the effect of each persona can be largely random.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kecen Li, Chen Gong, Zhixiang Li, Yuzhong Zhao, Xinwen Hou, Tianhao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) image data synthesis, which leverages the DP technique to generate synthetic data to replace the sensitive data, allowing organizations to share and utilize synthetic images without privacy concerns. Previous methods incorporate the advanced techniques of generative models and pre-training on a public dataset to produce exceptional DP image data, but suffer from problems of unstable training and massive computational resource demands. This paper proposes a novel DP image synthesis method, termed PRIVIMAGE, which meticulously selects pre-training data, promoting the efficient creation of DP datasets with high fidelity and utility. PRIVIMAGE first establishes a semantic query function using a public dataset. Then, this function assists in querying the semantic distribution of the sensitive dataset, facilitating the selection of data from the public dataset with analogous semantics for pre-training. Finally, we pre-train an image generative model using the selected data and then fine-tune this model on the sensitive dataset using Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). PRIVIMAGE allows us to train a lightly parameterized generative model, reducing the noise in the gradient during DP-SGD training and enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRIVIMAGE uses only 1% of the public dataset for pre-training and 7.6% of the parameters in the generative model compared to the state-of-the-art method, whereas achieves superior synthetic performance and conserves more computational resources. On average, PRIVIMAGE achieves 30.1% lower FID and 12.6% higher Classification Accuracy than the state-of-the-art method. The replication package and datasets can be accessed online.</p>

<p>Abstract: External control arms (ECA) can inform the early clinical development of experimental drugs and provide efficacy evidence for regulatory approval. However, the main challenge in implementing ECA lies in accessing real-world or historical clinical trials data. Indeed, regulations protecting patients' rights by strictly controlling data processing make pooling data from multiple sources in a central server often difficult. To address these limitations, we develop a new method, 'FedECA' that leverages federated learning (FL) to enable inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for time-to-event outcomes on separate cohorts without needing to pool data. To showcase the potential of FedECA, we apply it in different settings of increasing complexity culminating with a real-world use-case in which FedECA provides evidence for a differential effect between two drugs that would have otherwise go unnoticed. By sharing our code, we hope FedECA will foster the creation of federated research networks and thus accelerate drug development.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04370">Investigating the Design Space of Diffusion Models for Speech Enhancement</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Philippe Gonzalez, Zheng-Hua Tan, Jan {\O}stergaard, Jesper Jensen, Tommy Sonne Alstr{\o}m, Tobias May</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are a new class of generative models that have shown outstanding performance in image generation literature. As a consequence, studies have attempted to apply diffusion models to other tasks, such as speech enhancement. A popular approach in adapting diffusion models to speech enhancement consists in modelling a progressive transformation between the clean and noisy speech signals. However, one popular diffusion model framework previously laid in image generation literature did not account for such a transformation towards the system input, which prevents from relating the existing diffusion-based speech enhancement systems with the aforementioned diffusion model framework. To address this, we extend this framework to account for the progressive transformation between the clean and noisy speech signals. This allows us to apply recent developments from image generation literature, and to systematically investigate design aspects of diffusion models that remain largely unexplored for speech enhancement, such as the neural network preconditioning, the training loss weighting, the stochastic differential equation (SDE), or the amount of stochasticity injected in the reverse process. We show that the performance of previous diffusion-based speech enhancement systems cannot be attributed to the progressive transformation between the clean and noisy speech signals. Moreover, we show that a proper choice of preconditioning, training loss weighting, SDE and sampler allows to outperform a popular diffusion-based speech enhancement system while using fewer sampling steps, thus reducing the computational cost by a factor of four.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Liu, Nils Thuerey</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging neural networks as surrogate models for turbulence simulation is a topic of growing interest. At the same time, embodying the inherent uncertainty of simulations in the predictions of surrogate models remains very challenging. The present study makes a first attempt to use denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to train an uncertainty-aware surrogate model for turbulence simulations. Due to its prevalence, the simulation of flows around airfoils with various shapes, Reynolds numbers, and angles of attack is chosen as the learning objective. Our results show that DDPMs can successfully capture the whole distribution of solutions and, as a consequence, accurately estimate the uncertainty of the simulations. The performance of DDPMs is also compared with varying baselines in the form of Bayesian neural networks and heteroscedastic models. Experiments demonstrate that DDPMs outperform the other methods regarding a variety of accuracy metrics. Besides, it offers the advantage of providing access to the complete distributions of uncertainties rather than providing a set of parameters. As such, it can yield realistic and detailed samples from the distribution of solutions. We also evaluate an emerging generative modeling variant, flow matching, in comparison to regular diffusion models. The results demonstrate that flow matching addresses the problem of slow sampling speed typically associated with diffusion models. As such, it offers a promising new paradigm for uncertainty quantification with generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamed Haghighi, Mehrdad Dianati, Valentina Donzella, Kurt Debattista</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulation models for perception sensors are integral components of automotive simulators used for the virtual Verification and Validation (V\&V) of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). These models also serve as powerful tools for generating synthetic datasets to train deep learning-based perception models. Lidar is a widely used sensor type among the perception sensors for ADS due to its high precision in 3D environment scanning. However, developing realistic Lidar simulation models is a significant technical challenge. In particular, unrealistic models can result in a large gap between the synthesised and real-world point clouds, limiting their effectiveness in ADS applications. Recently, deep generative models have emerged as promising solutions to synthesise realistic sensory data. However, for Lidar simulation, deep generative models have been primarily hybridised with conventional algorithms, leaving unified generative approaches largely unexplored in the literature. Motivated by this research gap, we propose a unified generative framework to enhance Lidar simulation fidelity. Our proposed framework projects Lidar point clouds into depth-reflectance images via a lossless transformation, and employs our novel Controllable Lidar point cloud Generative model, CoLiGen, to translate the images. We extensively evaluate our CoLiGen model, comparing it with the state-of-the-art image-to-image translation models using various metrics to assess the realness, faithfulness, and performance of a downstream perception model. Our results show that CoLiGen exhibits superior performance across most metrics. The dataset and source code for this research are available at https://github.com/hamedhaghighi/CoLiGen.git.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13421">Federated learning with distributed fixed design quantum chips and quantum channels</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ammar Daskin</p>
<p>Abstract: The privacy in classical federated learning can be breached through the use of local gradient results combined with engineered queries to the clients. However, quantum communication channels are considered more secure because a measurement on the channel causes a loss of information, which can be detected by the sender. Therefore, the quantum version of federated learning can be used to provide better privacy. Additionally, sending an $N$-dimensional data vector through a quantum channel requires sending $\log N$ entangled qubits, which can potentially provide efficiency if the data vector is utilized as quantum states.
  In this paper, we propose a quantum federated learning model in which fixed design quantum chips are operated based on the quantum states sent by a centralized server. Based on the incoming superposition states, the clients compute and then send their local gradients as quantum states to the server, where they are aggregated to update parameters. Since the server does not send model parameters, but instead sends the operator as a quantum state, the clients are not required to share the model. This allows for the creation of asynchronous learning models. In addition, the model is fed into client-side chips directly as a quantum state; therefore, it does not require measurements on the incoming quantum state to obtain model parameters in order to compute gradients. This can provide efficiency over models where the parameter vector is sent via classical or quantum channels and local gradients are obtained through the obtained values these parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Utilizing distributed renewable and energy storage resources in local distribution networks via peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading has long been touted as a solution to improve energy systems' resilience and sustainability. Consumers and prosumers (those who have energy generation resources), however, do not have the expertise to engage in repeated P2P trading, and the zero-marginal costs of renewables present challenges in determining fair market prices. To address these issues, we propose multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) frameworks to help automate consumers' bidding and management of their solar PV and energy storage resources, under a specific P2P clearing mechanism that utilizes the so-called supply-demand ratio. In addition, we show how the MARL frameworks can integrate physical network constraints to realize voltage control, hence ensuring physical feasibility of the P2P energy trading and paving way for real-world implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faith Johnson, Bryan Bo Cao, Kristin Dana, Shubham Jain, Ashwin Ashok</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual navigation follows the intuition that humans can navigate without detailed maps. A common approach is interactive exploration while building a topological graph with images at nodes that can be used for planning. Recent variations learn from passive videos and can navigate using complex social and semantic cues. However, a significant number of training videos are needed, large graphs are utilized, and scenes are not unseen since odometry is utilized. We introduce a new approach to visual navigation using feudal learning, which employs a hierarchical structure consisting of a worker agent, a mid-level manager, and a high-level manager. Key to the feudal learning paradigm, agents at each level see a different aspect of the task and operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Two unique modules are developed in this framework. For the high-level manager, we learn a memory proxy map in a self supervised manner to record prior observations in a learned latent space and avoid the use of graphs and odometry. For the mid-level manager, we develop a waypoint network that outputs intermediate subgoals imitating human waypoint selection during local navigation. This waypoint network is pre-trained using a new, small set of teleoperation videos that we make publicly available, with training environments different from testing environments. The resulting feudal navigation network achieves near SOTA performance, while providing a novel no-RL, no-graph, no-odometry, no-metric map approach to the image goal navigation task.</p>

<p>Abstract: The resonate-and-fire (RF) neuron, introduced over two decades ago, is a simple, efficient, yet biologically plausible spiking neuron model, which can extract frequency patterns within the time domain due to its resonating membrane dynamics. However, previous RF formulations suffer from intrinsic shortcomings that limit effective learning and prevent exploiting the principled advantage of RF neurons. Here, we introduce the balanced RF (BRF) neuron, which alleviates some of the intrinsic limitations of vanilla RF neurons and demonstrates its effectiveness within recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) on various sequence learning tasks. We show that networks of BRF neurons achieve overall higher task performance, produce only a fraction of the spikes, and require significantly fewer parameters as compared to modern RSNNs. Moreover, BRF-RSNN consistently provide much faster and more stable training convergence, even when bridging many hundreds of time steps during backpropagation through time (BPTT). These results underscore that our BRF-RSNN is a strong candidate for future large-scale RSNN architectures, further lines of research in SNN methodology, and more efficient hardware implementations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the novel task of interactive scene exploration, wherein robots autonomously explore environments and produce an action-conditioned scene graph (ACSG) that captures the structure of the underlying environment. The ACSG accounts for both low-level information (geometry and semantics) and high-level information (action-conditioned relationships between different entities) in the scene. To this end, we present the Robotic Exploration (RoboEXP) system, which incorporates the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) and an explicit memory design to enhance our system's capabilities. The robot reasons about what and how to explore an object, accumulating new information through the interaction process and incrementally constructing the ACSG. Leveraging the constructed ACSG, we illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our RoboEXP system in facilitating a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involving rigid, articulated objects, nested objects, and deformable objects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Topological accuracy in medical image segmentation is a highly important property for downstream applications such as network analysis and flow modeling in vessels or cell counting. Recently, significant methodological advancements have brought well-founded concepts from algebraic topology to binary segmentation. However, these approaches have been underexplored in multi-class segmentation scenarios, where topological errors are common. We propose a general loss function for topologically faithful multi-class segmentation extending the recent Betti matching concept, which is based on induced matchings of persistence barcodes. We project the N-class segmentation problem to N single-class segmentation tasks, which allows us to use 1-parameter persistent homology, making training of neural networks computationally feasible. We validate our method on a comprehensive set of four medical datasets with highly variant topological characteristics. Our loss formulation significantly enhances topological correctness in cardiac, cell, artery-vein, and Circle of Willis segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Over the past few decades, extensive research has been devoted to the design of artificial reverberation algorithms aimed at emulating the room acoustics of physical environments. Despite significant advancements, automatic parameter tuning of delay-network models remains an open challenge. We introduce a novel method for finding the parameters of a Feedback Delay Network (FDN) such that its output renders target attributes of a measured room impulse response. The proposed approach involves the implementation of a differentiable FDN with trainable delay lines, which, for the first time, allows us to simultaneously learn each and every delay-network parameter via backpropagation. The iterative optimization process seeks to minimize a perceptually-motivated time-domain loss function incorporating differentiable terms accounting for energy decay and echo density. Through experimental validation, we show that the proposed method yields time-invariant frequency-independent FDNs capable of closely matching the desired acoustical characteristics, and outperforms existing methods based on genetic algorithms and analytical FDN design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Fabiani, Bartolomeo Stellato, Daniele Masti, Paul J. Goulart</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a machine learning-based model of an unknown dynamical system from a finite number of (state-input)-successor state data points, such that the model obtained is also suitable for optimal control design. We adopt a neural network (NN) architecture that, once suitably trained, yields a hybrid system with continuous piecewise-affine (PWA) dynamics that is differentiable with respect to the network's parameters, thereby enabling the use of derivative-based training procedures. We show that a careful choice of our NN's weights produces a hybrid system model with structural properties that are highly favorable when used as part of a finite horizon optimal control problem (OCP). Specifically, we rely on available results to establish that optimal solutions with strong local optimality guarantees can be computed via nonlinear programming (NLP), in contrast to classical OCPs for general hybrid systems which typically require mixed-integer optimization. Besides being well-suited for optimal control design, numerical simulations illustrate that our NN-based technique enjoys very similar performance to state-of-the-art system identification methods for hybrid systems and it is competitive on nonlinear benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabee Grewal, Vishnu Iyer, William Kretschmer, Daniel Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: We define a quantum learning task called agnostic tomography, where given copies of an arbitrary state $\rho$ and a class of quantum states $\mathcal{C}$, the goal is to output a succinct description of a state that approximates $\rho$ at least as well as any state in $\mathcal{C}$ (up to some small error $\varepsilon$). This task generalizes ordinary quantum tomography of states in $\mathcal{C}$ and is more challenging because the learning algorithm must be robust to perturbations of $\rho$.
  We give an efficient agnostic tomography algorithm for the class $\mathcal{C}$ of $n$-qubit stabilizer product states. Assuming $\rho$ has fidelity at least $\tau$ with a stabilizer product state, the algorithm runs in time $n^{O(1 + \log(1/\tau))} / \varepsilon^2$. This runtime is quasipolynomial in all parameters, and polynomial if $\tau$ is a constant.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Zhong, Yao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has shifted the paradigm of adapting pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT), achieving great efficiency by updating only a subset of tailored parameters to approximate weight updates. However, the multi-head design of the self-attention mechanism, with the heads working in parallel in the computation flow, exhibiting similar visual patterns and requiring update over all of them, incurs unnecessary storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose Head-level responsiveness tuning for low-rank adaptation (Heart-LoRA). The proposed method explores redundancy among the heads and selectively activates task-responsive heads, thus enabling fine-grained head-level tuning. Additionally, given the different responsiveness of heads to diverse visual tasks, our proposed method dynamically activates a subset of the approximated heads that are tailored to the current task. Experimental results show that Heart-LoRA yields superior performance over state-of-the-art PETL approaches on visual adaptation benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building socially-intelligent AI agents (Social-AI) is a multidisciplinary, multimodal research goal that involves creating agents that can sense, perceive, reason about, learn from, and respond to affect, behavior, and cognition of other agents (human or artificial). Progress towards Social-AI has accelerated in the past decade across several computing communities, including natural language processing, machine learning, robotics, human-machine interaction, computer vision, and speech. Natural language processing, in particular, has been prominent in Social-AI research, as language plays a key role in constructing the social world. In this position paper, we identify a set of underlying technical challenges and open questions for researchers across computing communities to advance Social-AI. We anchor our discussion in the context of social intelligence concepts and prior progress in Social-AI research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khai Nguyen, Nhat Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kinya Toride, Matthew Newman, Andrew Hoell, Antonietta Capotondi, Jakob Schl\"or, Dillon J. Amaya</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce an interpretable-by-design method, optimized model-analog, that integrates deep learning with model-analog forecasting which generates forecasts from similar initial climate states in a repository of model simulations. This hybrid framework employs a convolutional neural network to estimate state-dependent weights to identify initial analog states that lead to shadowing target trajectories. The advantage of our method lies in its inherent interpretability, offering insights into initial-error-sensitive regions through estimated weights and the ability to trace the physically-based evolution of the system through analog forecasting. We evaluate our approach using the Community Earth System Model Version 2 Large Ensemble to forecast the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on a seasonal-to-annual time scale. Results show a 10% improvement in forecasting equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies at 9-12 months leads compared to the unweighted model-analog technique. Furthermore, our model demonstrates improvements in boreal winter and spring initialization when evaluated against a reanalysis dataset. Our approach reveals state-dependent regional sensitivity linked to various seasonally varying physical processes, including the Pacific Meridional Modes, equatorial recharge oscillator, and stochastic wind forcing. Additionally, forecasts of El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na are sensitive to different initial states: El Ni\~no forecasts are more sensitive to initial error in tropical Pacific sea surface temperature in boreal winter, while La Ni\~na forecasts are more sensitive to initial error in tropical Pacific zonal wind stress in boreal summer. This approach has broad implications for forecasting diverse climate phenomena, including regional temperature and precipitation, which are challenging for the model-analog approach alone.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for video inpainting typically rely on optical flow or attention-based approaches to inpaint masked regions by propagating visual information across frames. While such approaches have led to significant progress on standard benchmarks, they struggle with tasks that require the synthesis of novel content that is not present in other frames. In this paper, we reframe video inpainting as a conditional generative modeling problem and present a framework for solving such problems with conditional video diffusion models. We introduce inpainting-specific sampling schemes which capture crucial long-range dependencies in the context, and devise a novel method for conditioning on the known pixels in incomplete frames. We highlight the advantages of using a generative approach for this task, showing that our method is capable of generating diverse, high-quality inpaintings and synthesizing new content that is spatially, temporally, and semantically consistent with the provided context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanya Chowdhury, Yair Zick, James Allan</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous works propose post-hoc, model-agnostic explanations for learning to rank, focusing on ordering entities by their relevance to a query through feature attribution methods. However, these attributions often weakly correlate or contradict each other, confusing end users. We adopt an axiomatic game-theoretic approach, popular in the feature attribution community, to identify a set of fundamental axioms that every ranking-based feature attribution method should satisfy. We then introduce Rank-SHAP, extending classical Shapley values to ranking. We evaluate the RankSHAP framework through extensive experiments on two datasets, multiple ranking methods and evaluation metrics. Additionally, a user study confirms RankSHAP's alignment with human intuition. We also perform an axiomatic analysis of existing rank attribution algorithms to determine their compliance with our proposed axioms. Ultimately, our aim is to equip practitioners with a set of axiomatically backed feature attribution methods for studying IR ranking models, that ensure generality as well as consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Naseri, Jiayan Qiu, Zhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel artificial intelligence generation task termed Generated Contents Enrichment (GCE). Conventional AI content generation produces visually realistic content by implicitly enriching the given textual description based on limited semantic descriptions. Unlike this traditional task, our proposed GCE strives to perform content enrichment explicitly in both the visual and textual domains. The goal is to generate content that is visually realistic, structurally coherent, and semantically abundant. To tackle GCE, we propose a deep end-to-end adversarial method that explicitly explores semantics and inter-semantic relationships during the enrichment process. Our approach first models the input description as a scene graph, where nodes represent objects and edges capture inter-object relationships. We then adopt Graph Convolutional Networks on top of the input scene description to predict additional enriching objects and their relationships with the existing ones. Finally, the enriched description is passed to an image synthesis model to generate the corresponding visual content. Experiments conducted on the Visual Genome dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, producing promising and visually plausible results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christodoulos Kechris, Jonathan Dan, Jose Miranda, David Atienza</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate extraction of heart rate from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals remains challenging due to motion artifacts and signal degradation. Although deep learning methods trained as a data-driven inference problem offer promising solutions, they often underutilize existing knowledge from the medical and signal processing community. In this paper, we address three shortcomings of deep learning models: motion artifact removal, degradation assessment, and physiologically plausible analysis of the PPG signal. We propose KID-PPG, a knowledge-informed deep learning model that integrates expert knowledge through adaptive linear filtering, deep probabilistic inference, and data augmentation. We evaluate KID-PPG on the PPGDalia dataset, achieving an average mean absolute error of 2.85 beats per minute, surpassing existing reproducible methods. Our results demonstrate a significant performance improvement in heart rate tracking through the incorporation of prior knowledge into deep learning models. This approach shows promise in enhancing various biomedical applications by incorporating existing expert knowledge in deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuexiang Zhai, Hao Bai, Zipeng Lin, Jiayi Pan, Shengbang Tong, Yifei Zhou, Alane Suhr, Saining Xie, Yann LeCun, Yi Ma, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) fine-tuned on specialized visual instruction-following data have exhibited impressive language reasoning capabilities across various scenarios. However, this fine-tuning paradigm may not be able to efficiently learn optimal decision-making agents in multi-step goal-directed tasks from interactive environments. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework that fine-tunes VLMs with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our framework provides a task description and then prompts the VLM to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling the VLM to efficiently explore intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final text-based action. Next, the open-ended text output is parsed into an executable action to interact with the environment to obtain goal-directed task rewards. Finally, our framework uses these task rewards to fine-tune the entire VLM with RL. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed framework enhances the decision-making capabilities of VLM agents across various tasks, enabling 7b models to outperform commercial models such as GPT4-V or Gemini. Furthermore, we find that CoT reasoning is a crucial component for performance improvement, as removing the CoT reasoning results in a significant decrease in the overall performance of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Raffel, Victor Agostinelli, Lizhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p>

We develop a new black-box method, output2prompt, that learns to extract prompts without access to the model's logits and without adversarial or jailbreaking queries. In contrast to previous work, output2prompt only needs outputs of normal user queries. To improve memory efficiency, output2prompt employs a new sparse encoding techique. We measure the efficacy of output2prompt on a variety of user and system prompts and demonstrate zero-shot transferability across different LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongfu Gao, Feipeng Zhang, Wenyu Jiang, Jun Shu, Feng Zheng, Hongxin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on downstream tasks by in-context learning (ICL), which heavily relies on the quality of demonstrations selected from a large set of annotated examples. Recent works claim that in-context learning is robust to noisy demonstrations in text classification. In this work, we show that, on text generation tasks, noisy annotations significantly hurt the performance of in-context learning. To circumvent the issue, we propose a simple and effective approach called Local Perplexity Ranking (LPR), which replaces the "noisy" candidates with their nearest neighbors that are more likely to be clean. Our method is motivated by analyzing the perplexity deviation caused by noisy labels and decomposing perplexity into inherent perplexity and matching perplexity. Our key idea behind LPR is thus to decouple the matching perplexity by performing the ranking among the neighbors in semantic space. Our approach can prevent the selected demonstrations from including mismatched input-label pairs while preserving the effectiveness of the original selection methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LPR, improving the EM score by up to 18.75 on common benchmarks with noisy annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Naranjo-Alcazar, Jordi Grau-Haro, Ruben Ribes-Serrano, Pedro Zuccarello</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Listening focuses on developing technologies to extract relevant information from audio signals. A critical aspect of these projects is the acquisition and labeling of contextualized data, which is inherently complex and requires specific resources and strategies. Despite the availability of some audio datasets, many are unsuitable for commercial applications. The paper emphasizes the importance of Active Learning (AL) using expert labelers over crowdsourcing, which often lacks detailed insights into dataset structures. AL is an iterative process combining human labelers and AI models to optimize the labeling budget by intelligently selecting samples for human review. This approach addresses the challenge of handling large, constantly growing datasets that exceed available computational resources and memory. The paper presents a comprehensive data-centric framework for Machine Listening projects, detailing the configuration of recording nodes, database structure, and labeling budget optimization in resource-constrained scenarios. Applied to an industrial port in Valencia, Spain, the framework successfully labeled 6540 ten-second audio samples over five months with a small team, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability to various resource availability situations.

<p>Abstract: The current state-of-the-art in quadruped locomotion is able to produce a variety of complex motions. These methods either rely on switching between a discrete set of skills or learn a distribution across gaits using complex black-box models. Alternatively, we present Gaitor, which learns a disentangled and 2D representation across locomotion gaits. This learnt representation forms a planning space for closed-loop control delivering continuous gait transitions and perceptive terrain traversal. Gaitor's latent space is readily interpretable and we discover that during gait transitions, novel unseen gaits emerge. The latent space is disentangled with respect to footswing heights and lengths. This means that these gait characteristics can be varied independently in the 2D latent representation. Together with a simple terrain encoding and a learnt planner operating in the latent space, Gaitor can take motion commands including desired gait type and swing characteristics all while reacting to uneven terrain. We evaluate Gaitor in both simulation and the real world on the ANYmal C platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work learning a unified and interpretable latent space for multiple gaits, resulting in continuous blending between different locomotion modes on a real quadruped robot.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangyun Lee, Zinan Lin, Giulia Fanti</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great promise for image and video generation, but sampling from state-of-the-art models requires expensive numerical integration of a generative ODE. One approach for tackling this problem is rectified flows, which iteratively learn smooth ODE paths that are less susceptible to truncation error. However, rectified flows still require a relatively large number of function evaluations (NFEs). In this work, we propose improved techniques for training rectified flows, allowing them to compete with \emph{knowledge distillation} methods even in the low NFE setting. Our main insight is that under realistic settings, a single iteration of the Reflow algorithm for training rectified flows is sufficient to learn nearly straight trajectories; hence, the current practice of using multiple Reflow iterations is unnecessary. We thus propose techniques to improve one-round training of rectified flows, including a U-shaped timestep distribution and LPIPS-Huber premetric. With these techniques, we improve the FID of the previous 2-rectified flow by up to 75\% in the 1 NFE setting on CIFAR-10. On ImageNet 64$\times$64, our improved rectified flow outperforms the state-of-the-art distillation methods such as consistency distillation and progressive distillation in both one-step and two-step settings and rivals the performance of improved consistency training (iCT) in FID.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiho Park, Yo Joong Choe, Yibo Jiang, Victor Veitch</p>
<p>Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis is the informal idea that semantic concepts are encoded as linear directions in the representation spaces of large language models (LLMs). Previous work has shown how to make this notion precise for representing binary concepts that have natural contrasts (e.g., {male, female}) as directions in representation space. However, many natural concepts do not have natural contrasts (e.g., whether the output is about an animal). In this work, we show how to extend the formalization of the linear representation hypothesis to represent features (e.g., is_animal) as vectors. This allows us to immediately formalize the representation of categorical concepts as polytopes in the representation space. Further, we use the formalization to prove a relationship between the hierarchical structure of concepts and the geometry of their representations. We validate these theoretical results on the Gemma and LLaMA-3 large language models, estimating representations for 900+ hierarchically related concepts using data from WordNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Sarao Mannelli, Yaraslau Ivashynka, Andrew Saxe, Luca Saglietti</p>
<p>Abstract: A wide range of empirical and theoretical works have shown that overparameterisation can amplify the performance of neural networks. According to the lottery ticket hypothesis, overparameterised networks have an increased chance of containing a sub-network that is well-initialised to solve the task at hand. A more parsimonious approach, inspired by animal learning, consists in guiding the learner towards solving the task by curating the order of the examples, i.e. providing a curriculum. However, this learning strategy seems to be hardly beneficial in deep learning applications. In this work, we undertake an analytical study that connects curriculum learning and overparameterisation. In particular, we investigate their interplay in the online learning setting for a 2-layer network in the XOR-like Gaussian Mixture problem. Our results show that a high degree of overparameterisation -- while simplifying the problem -- can limit the benefit from curricula, providing a theoretical account of the ineffectiveness of curricula in deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaohan Meng, Zaiqiao Meng, Ke Yuan, Iadh Ounis</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanling Wang, Haoyang Li, Hao Zou, Jing Zhang, Xinlei He, Qi Li, Ke Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in large language models (LLMs), non-factual responses remain prevalent. Unlike extensive studies on post-hoc detection of such responses, this work studies non-factuality prediction (NFP), aiming to predict whether an LLM will generate a non-factual response to a question before the generation process. Previous efforts on NFP have demonstrated LLMs' awareness of their internal knowledge, but they still face challenges in efficiency and transferability. In this work, we propose a lightweight NFP model named Factuality Lens (FacLens), which effectively probes hidden representations of questions for the NFP task. Besides, we discover that hidden question representations sourced from different LLMs exhibit similar NFP patterns, which enables the transferability of FacLens across LLMs to reduce development costs. Extensive experiments highlight FacLens's superiority in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Zhang, Shizhe Diao, Xueyan Zou, Hao Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference learning provides a promising solution to address the limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for code language models, where the model is not explicitly trained to differentiate between correct and incorrect code. Recent findings demonstrate that on-policy data is the key to successful preference learning, where the preference data is collected using the same policy LM being trained. Inspired by this, we propose PLUM, an on-policy $\textbf{P}$reference $\textbf{L}$earning framework A$\textbf{u}$gmented with test cases for code L$\textbf{M}$ s. The framework operates in three key stages: (1) automatic generation of test cases from natural language instructions, (2) creation of a preference data by evaluating candidate code solutions sampled from the policy, which can then be used to (3) train the policy LM. PLUM levitates the need to train reward models, allowing for large scale on-policy and online preference data collation. PLUM is evaluated on both standard benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP) and more challenging ones (LiveCodeBench), delivering substantial improvements over original SFT'ed models and other execution-feedback-driven approaches. We show PLUM's benefits are consistent across various widely-used code LMs even they have been well-trained with SFT. For example, PLUM increases pass rates by up to 4.8% on average on standard benchmarks and 11.8% on LiveCodeBench, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability. We also demonstrate the benefits of on-policy and online preference learning by comprehensive experimentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wa\"iss Azizian, Franck Iutzeler, J\'er\^ome Malick, Panayotis Mertikopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we examine the long-run distribution of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in general, non-convex problems. Specifically, we seek to understand which regions of the problem's state space are more likely to be visited by SGD, and by how much. Using an approach based on the theory of large deviations and randomly perturbed dynamical systems, we show that the long-run distribution of SGD resembles the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of equilibrium thermodynamics with temperature equal to the method's step-size and energy levels determined by the problem's objective and the statistics of the noise. In particular, we show that, in the long run, (a) the problem's critical region is visited exponentially more often than any non-critical region; (b) the iterates of SGD are exponentially concentrated around the problem's minimum energy state (which does not always coincide with the global minimum of the objective); (c) all other connected components of critical points are visited with frequency that is exponentially proportional to their energy level; and, finally (d) any component of local maximizers or saddle points is "dominated" by a component of local minimizers which is visited exponentially more often.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> X. Angelo Huang, Emanuele La Malfa, Samuele Marro, Andrea Asperti, Anthony Cohn, Michael Wooldridge</p>
<p>Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) can be used to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex scenarios where social reasoning is required. While the research community has proposed many ToM benchmarks, their hardness varies greatly, and their complexity is not well defined. This work proposes a framework inspired by cognitive load theory to measure the complexity of ToM tasks. We quantify a problem's complexity as the number of states necessary to solve it correctly. Our complexity measure also accounts for spurious states of a ToM problem designed to make it apparently harder. We use our method to assess the complexity of five widely adopted ToM benchmarks. On top of this framework, we design a prompting technique that augments the information available to a model with a description of how the environment changes with the agents' interactions. We name this technique Discrete World Models (DWM) and show how it elicits superior performance on ToM tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Court, Micha Elsner</p>
<p>Abstract: This work investigates the in-context learning abilities of pretrained large language models (LLMs) when instructed to translate text from a low-resource language into a high-resource language as part of an automated machine translation pipeline. We conduct a set of experiments translating Southern Quechua to Spanish and examine the informativity of various types of context retrieved from a constrained database of digitized pedagogical materials (dictionaries and grammar lessons) and parallel corpora. Using both automatic and human evaluation of model output, we conduct ablation studies that manipulate (1) context type (morpheme translations, grammar descriptions, and corpus examples), (2) retrieval methods (automated vs. manual), and (3) model type. Our results suggest that even relatively small LLMs are capable of utilizing prompt context for zero-shot low-resource translation when provided a minimally sufficient amount of relevant linguistic information. However, the variable effects of context type, retrieval method, model type, and language-specific factors highlight the limitations of using even the best LLMs as translation systems for the majority of the world's 7,000+ languages and their speakers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Han Chen, Chenguang Wang, Dang Nguyen, Dianqi Li, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable advancement of Large language models (LLMs), they still lack delicate controllability under sophisticated constraints, which is critical to enhancing their response quality and the user experience. While conditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can potentially improve LLM controllability, curating new SFT data to fulfill the constraints usually relies on human experts or proprietary LLMs, which is time-consuming and expensive. To bridge this gap, we propose Rule-based Data Recycling (RuleR), a human/LLM-free data augmentation method incorporating multiple constraints into the original SFT data. Instead of creating new responses from scratch, RuleR integrates linguistic or formatting rules into the original instructions and modifies the responses to fulfill the rule-defined constraints. Training on the "recycled" data consolidates LLMs capability to generate constrained outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate RuleR's effectiveness in improving LLM controllability while maintaining general instruction-following performance. RuleR's code is released on https://github.com/tianyi-lab/RuleR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfeng He, Runing Yang, Linlin Yu, Changbin Li, Ruoxi Jia, Feng Chen, Ming Jin, Chang-Tien Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text summarization, a key natural language generation (NLG) task, is vital in various domains. However, the high cost of inaccurate summaries in risk-critical applications, particularly those involving human-in-the-loop decision-making, raises concerns about the reliability of uncertainty estimation on text summarization (UE-TS) evaluation methods. This concern stems from the dependency of uncertainty model metrics on diverse and potentially conflicting NLG metrics. To address this issue, we introduce a comprehensive UE-TS benchmark incorporating 31 NLG metrics across four dimensions. The benchmark evaluates the uncertainty estimation capabilities of two large language models and one pre-trained language model on three datasets, with human-annotation analysis incorporated where applicable. We also assess the performance of 14 common uncertainty estimation methods within this benchmark. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering multiple uncorrelated NLG metrics and diverse uncertainty estimation methods to ensure reliable and efficient evaluation of UE-TS techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nigel Fernandez, Alexander Scarlatos, Wanyong Feng, Simon Woodhead, Andrew Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality distractors are crucial to both the assessment and pedagogical value of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where manually crafting ones that anticipate knowledge deficiencies or misconceptions among real students is difficult. Meanwhile, automated distractor generation, even with the help of large language models (LLMs), remains challenging for subjects like math. It is crucial to not only identify plausible distractors but also understand the error behind them. In this paper, we introduce DiVERT (Distractor Generation with Variational Errors Represented as Text), a novel variational approach that learns an interpretable representation of errors behind distractors in math MCQs. Through experiments on a real-world math MCQ dataset with 1,434 questions used by hundreds of thousands of students, we show that DiVERT, despite using a base open-source LLM with 7B parameters, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using GPT-4o on downstream distractor generation. We also conduct a human evaluation with math educators and find that DiVERT leads to error labels that are of comparable quality to human-authored ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Plassier, Alexander Fishkov, Mohsen Guizani, Maxim Panov, Eric Moulines</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a new method for generating prediction sets that combines the flexibility of conformal methods with an estimate of the conditional distribution $P_{Y \mid X}$. Existing methods, such as conformalized quantile regression and probabilistic conformal prediction, usually provide only a marginal coverage guarantee. In contrast, our approach extends these frameworks to achieve approximately conditional coverage, which is crucial for many practical applications. Our prediction sets adapt to the behavior of the predictive distribution, making them effective even under high heteroscedasticity. While exact conditional guarantees are infeasible without assumptions on the underlying data distribution, we derive non-asymptotic bounds that depend on the total variation distance of the conditional distribution and its estimate. Using extensive simulations, we show that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of conditional coverage, leading to more reliable statistical inference in a variety of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lai-Man Po, Yuyang Liu, Haoxuan Wu, Tianqi Zhang, Wing-Yin Yu, Zhuohan Wang, Zeyu Jiang, Kun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Standard Basis LoRA (SBoRA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for Large Language Models that builds upon the pioneering works of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Orthogonal Adaptation. SBoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by half or doubles the rank with the similar number of trainable parameters as LoRA, while improving learning performance. By utilizing orthogonal standard basis vectors to initialize one of the low-rank matrices (either $\mathbf{A}$ or $\mathbf{B}$), SBoRA facilitates regional weight updates and memory-efficient fine-tuning. This results in two variants, SBoRA-FA and SBoRA-FB, where only one of the matrices is updated, leading to a sparse update matrix $\mathrm{\Delta} \mathbf{W}$ with predominantly zero rows or columns. Consequently, most of the fine-tuned model's weights $(\mathbf{W}_0+\mathrm{\Delta} \mathbf{W})$ remain unchanged from the pre-trained weights, akin to the modular organization of the human brain, which efficiently adapts to new tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of SBoRA-FA over LoRA in various fine-tuning tasks, including commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of QSBoRA on quantized LLaMA models of varying scales, highlighting its potential for efficient adaptation to new tasks.

Can we similarly unlock image-generation models for visuomotor control? We present GENIMA, a behavior-cloning agent that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to 'draw joint-actions' as targets on RGB images. These images are fed into a controller that maps the visual targets into a sequence of joint-positions. We study GENIMA on 25 RLBench and 9 real-world manipulation tasks. We find that, by lifting actions into image-space, internet pre-trained diffusion models can generate policies that outperform state-of-the-art visuomotor approaches, especially in robustness to scene perturbations and generalizing to novel objects. Our method is also competitive with 3D agents, despite lacking priors such as depth, keypoints, or motion-planners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantinos Panagiotis Alexandridis, Jiankang Deng, Anh Nguyen, Shan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: The activation function plays a crucial role in model optimisation, yet the optimal choice remains unclear. For example, the Sigmoid activation is the de-facto activation in balanced classification tasks, however, in imbalanced classification, it proves inappropriate due to bias towards frequent classes. In this work, we delve deeper in this phenomenon by performing a comprehensive statistical analysis in the classification and intermediate layers of both balanced and imbalanced networks and we empirically show that aligning the activation function with the data distribution, enhances the performance in both balanced and imbalanced tasks. To this end, we propose the Adaptive Parametric Activation (APA) function, a novel and versatile activation function that unifies most common activation functions under a single formula. APA can be applied in both intermediate layers and attention layers, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art on several imbalanced benchmarks such as ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist2018, Places-LT, CIFAR100-LT and LVIS and balanced benchmarks such as ImageNet1K, COCO and V3DET.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohan Wang, Dian Li, Yilin Zhao,  Sinbadliu, Hui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing tools with Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for grounding AI agents in real-world applications. The prevailing approach involves few-shot prompting with demonstrations or fine-tuning with expert annotations. However, mere in-context demonstrations may fail to cover sufficient knowledge for complex tools and tasks. Training on solution paths is also hindered by the high cost of expert annotations and generalizing to new tools. A core challenge of generalizable tool use lies in understanding the "meta", or fundamental natures of tools that are transferable across tasks, such as causality and constraints. In this paper, we present MetaTool, a novel tool learning methodology designed to generalize across any reusable toolset. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised augmentation technique derived from a series of meta-tasks. This involves predicting masked elements in the tool execution process. The self-supervised procedure enables scalable generation of high-quality QA data, which is handy for supervising tool understanding. By incorporating meta-task data into task-oriented training, our method significantly enhances the performance of open-source LLMs, achieving results comparable to ChatGPT in both tool-based planning and chatting scenarios. Through large-scale instruction tuning, the MetaTool model demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalizability on new tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This article proposes two new algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bernard J. Giron Castro, Christophe Peucheret, Darko Zibar, Francesco Da Ros</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, as the ever-increasing demand for more powerful computing resources continues, alternative advanced computing paradigms are under extensive investigation. Significant effort has been made to deviate from conventional Von Neumann architectures. In-memory computing has emerged in the field of electronics as a possible solution to the infamous bottleneck between memory and computing processors, which reduces the effective throughput of data. In photonics, novel schemes attempt to collocate the computing processor and memory in a single device. Photonics offers the flexibility of multiplexing streams of data not only spatially and in time, but also in frequency or, equivalently, in wavelength, which makes it highly suitable for parallel computing. Here, we numerically show the use of time and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to solve four independent tasks at the same time in a single photonic chip, serving as a proof of concept for our proposal. The system is a time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) based on a microring resonator (MRR). The addressed tasks cover different applications: Time-series prediction, waveform signal classification, wireless channel equalization, and radar signal prediction. The system is also tested for simultaneous computing of up to 10 instances of the same task, exhibiting excellent performance. The footprint of the system is reduced by using time-division multiplexing of the nodes that act as the neurons of the studied neural network scheme. WDM is used for the parallelization of wavelength channels, each addressing a single task. By adjusting the input power and frequency of each optical channel, we can achieve levels of performance for each of the tasks that are comparable to those quoted in state-of-the-art reports focusing on single-task operation...</p>

<p>Abstract: While high-performing language models are typically trained on hundreds of billions of words, human children become fluent language users with a much smaller amount of data. What are the features of the data they receive, and how do these features support language modeling objectives? To investigate this question, we train GPT-2 and RoBERTa models on 29M words of English child-directed speech and a new matched, synthetic dataset (TinyDialogues), comparing to OpenSubtitles, Wikipedia, and a heterogeneous blend of datasets from the BabyLM challenge. We evaluate the syntactic and semantic knowledge of these models using developmentally-inspired evaluations. Through pretraining experiments, we test whether the global developmental ordering or the local discourse ordering of children's training data supports high performance relative to other datasets. The local properties of the data affect model results, but surprisingly, global properties do not. Further, child language input is not uniquely valuable for training language models. These findings support the hypothesis that, rather than proceeding from better data, the child's learning algorithm is substantially more data-efficient than current language modeling techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric R. Anschuetz</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical neural networks with random initialization famously behave as Gaussian processes in the limit of many neurons, which allows one to completely characterize their training and generalization behavior. No such general understanding exists for quantum neural networks (QNNs), which -- outside of certain special cases -- are known to not behave as Gaussian processes when randomly initialized. We here prove that QNNs and their first two derivatives instead generally form what we call "Wishart processes," where certain algebraic properties of the network determine the hyperparameters of the process. This Wishart process description allows us to, for the first time: give necessary and sufficient conditions for a QNN architecture to have a Gaussian process limit; calculate the full gradient distribution, generalizing previously known barren plateau results; and calculate the local minima distribution of algebraically constrained QNNs. Our unified framework suggests a certain simple operational definition for the "trainability" of a given QNN model using a newly introduced, experimentally accessible quantity we call the "degrees of freedom" of the network architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christiaan Viviers, Amaan Valiuddin, Francisco Caetano, Lemar Abdi, Lena Filatova, Peter de With, Fons van der Sommen</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) sensory data and covariate distribution shift aims to identify new test examples with different high-level image statistics to the captured, normal and In-Distribution (ID) set. Existing OOD detection literature largely focuses on semantic shift with little-to-no consensus over covariate shift. Generative models capture the ID data in an unsupervised manner, enabling them to effectively identify samples that deviate significantly from this learned distribution, irrespective of the downstream task. In this work, we elucidate the ability of generative models to detect and quantify domain-specific covariate shift through extensive analyses that involves a variety of models. To this end, we conjecture that it is sufficient to detect most occurring sensory faults (anomalies and deviations in global signals statistics) by solely modeling high-frequency signal-dependent and independent details. We propose a novel method, CovariateFlow, for OOD detection, specifically tailored to covariate heteroscedastic high-frequency image-components using conditional Normalizing Flows (cNFs). Our results on CIFAR10 vs. CIFAR10-C and ImageNet200 vs. ImageNet200-C demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by accurately detecting OOD covariate shift. This work contributes to enhancing the fidelity of imaging systems and aiding machine learning models in OOD detection in the presence of covariate shift.</p>

This enables a dataset owner to train machine learning models on quantum cloud computation platforms, without the risk of leaking the information about the data. It is also capable of encoding a vast amount of data effectively at a later time using classical computations, thus saving runtime on quantum computation devices. The trained quantum machine learning models can be run completely on classical computers, meaning the dataset owner does not need to have any quantum hardware, nor even quantum simulators. Moreover, our method mitigates the encoding bottleneck by reducing the required circuit depth from $O(2^{n})$ to $O(n)$, and relax the tolerance on the precision of the quantum gates for the encoding. These results demonstrate yet another advantage of quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning models over existing classical neural networks, and broaden the approaches to data security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Zhao, Chengxi Zhang, Min Qin, Peng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of alpha factor mining is to discover indicative signals of investment opportunities from the historical financial market data of assets, which can be used to predict asset returns and gain excess profits. Recently, a promising framework is proposed for generating formulaic alpha factors using deep reinforcement learning, and quickly gained research focuses from both academia and industries. This paper first argues that the originally employed policy training method, i.e., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), faces several important issues in the context of alpha factors mining, making it ineffective to explore the search space of the formula. Herein, a novel reinforcement learning based on the well-known REINFORCE algorithm is proposed. Given that the underlying state transition function adheres to the Dirac distribution, the Markov Decision Process within this framework exhibit minimal environmental variability, making REINFORCE algorithm more appropriate than PPO. A new dedicated baseline is designed to theoretically reduce the commonly suffered high variance of REINFORCE. Moreover, the information ratio is introduced as a reward shaping mechanism to encourage the generation of steady alpha factors that can better adapt to changes in market volatility. Experimental evaluations on various real assets data show that the proposed algorithm can increase the correlation with asset returns by 3.83\%, and a stronger ability to obtain excess returns compared to the latest alpha factors mining methods, which meets the theoretical results well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Opedal, Eleanor Chodroff, Ryan Cotterell, Ethan Gotlieb Wilcox</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a new perspective on how readers integrate context during real-time language comprehension. Our proposals build on surprisal theory, which posits that the processing effort of a linguistic unit (e.g., a word) is an affine function of its in-context information content. We first observe that surprisal is only one out of many potential ways that a contextual predictor can be derived from a language model. Another one is the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between a unit and its context, which turns out to yield the same predictive power as surprisal when controlling for unigram frequency. Moreover, both PMI and surprisal are correlated with frequency. This means that neither PMI nor surprisal contains information about context alone. In response to this, we propose a technique where we project surprisal onto the orthogonal complement of frequency, yielding a new contextual predictor that is uncorrelated with frequency. Our experiments show that the proportion of variance in reading times explained by context is a lot smaller when context is represented by the orthogonalized predictor. From an interpretability standpoint, this indicates that previous studies may have overstated the role that context has in predicting reading times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Chen, Shujian Zhang, Mingyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The machine learning community is increasingly recognizing the importance of fostering trust and safety in modern generative AI (GenAI) models. We posit machine unlearning (MU) as a crucial foundation for developing safe, secure, and trustworthy GenAI models. Traditional MU methods often rely on stringent assumptions and require access to real data. This paper introduces Score Forgetting Distillation (SFD), an innovative MU approach that promotes the forgetting of undesirable information in diffusion models by aligning the conditional scores of "unsafe" classes or concepts with those of "safe" ones. To eliminate the need for real data, our SFD framework incorporates a score-based MU loss into the score distillation objective of a pretrained diffusion model. This serves as a regularization term that preserves desired generation capabilities while enabling the production of synthetic data through a one-step generator. Our experiments on pretrained label-conditional and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method effectively accelerates the forgetting of target classes or concepts during generation, while preserving the quality of other classes or concepts. This unlearned and distilled diffusion not only pioneers a novel concept in MU but also accelerates the generation speed of diffusion models. Our experiments and studies on a range of diffusion models and datasets confirm that our approach is generalizable, effective, and advantageous for MU in diffusion models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Shi, Nedret Billor, Elvan Ceyhan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel family of outlier detection algorithms based on Cluster Catch Digraphs (CCDs), specifically tailored to address the challenges of high dimensionality and varying cluster shapes, which deteriorate the performance of most traditional outlier detection methods. We propose the Uniformity-Based CCD with Mutual Catch Graph (U-MCCD), the Uniformity- and Neighbor-Based CCD with Mutual Catch Graph (UN-MCCD), and their shape-adaptive variants (SU-MCCD and SUN-MCCD), which are designed to detect outliers in data sets with arbitrary cluster shapes and high dimensions. We present the advantages and shortcomings of these algorithms and provide the motivation or need to define each particular algorithm. Through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, we assess their performance and demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our algorithms across various settings and contamination levels. We also illustrate the use of our algorithms on various real-life data sets. The U-MCCD algorithm efficiently identifies outliers while maintaining high true negative rates, and the SU-MCCD algorithm shows substantial improvement in handling non-uniform clusters. Additionally, the UN-MCCD and SUN-MCCD algorithms address the limitations of existing methods in high-dimensional spaces by utilizing Nearest Neighbor Distances (NND) for clustering and outlier detection. Our results indicate that these novel algorithms offer substantial advancements in the accuracy and adaptability of outlier detection, providing a valuable tool for various real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabia Asghar, Arslan Shaukat, Usman Akram, Rimsha Tariq</p>
<p>Abstract: Human immune system contains white blood cells (WBC) that are good indicator of many diseases like bacterial infections, AIDS, cancer, spleen, etc. White blood cells have been sub classified into four types: monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils on the basis of their nucleus, shape and cytoplasm. Traditionally in laboratories, pathologists and hematologists analyze these blood cells through microscope and then classify them manually. This manual process takes more time and increases the chance of human error. Hence, there is a need to automate this process. In this paper, first we have used different CNN pre-train models such as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, VGG16 and MobileNetV2 to automatically classify the white blood cells. These pre-train models are applied on Kaggle dataset of microscopic images. Although we achieved reasonable accuracy ranging between 92 to 95%, still there is need to enhance the performance. Hence, inspired by these architectures, a framework has been proposed to automatically categorize the four kinds of white blood cells with increased accuracy. The aim is to develop a convolution neural network (CNN) based classification system with decent generalization ability. The proposed CNN model has been tested on white blood cells images from Kaggle and LISC datasets. Accuracy achieved is 99.57% and 98.67% for both datasets respectively. Our proposed convolutional neural network-based model provides competitive performance as compared to previous results reported in literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose the unified BRAVO challenge to benchmark the reliability of semantic segmentation models under realistic perturbations and unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We define two categories of reliability: (1) semantic reliability, which reflects the model's accuracy and calibration when exposed to various perturbations; and (2) OOD reliability, which measures the model's ability to detect object classes that are unknown during training. The challenge attracted nearly 100 submissions from international teams representing notable research institutions. The results reveal interesting insights into the importance of large-scale pre-training and minimal architectural design in developing robust and reliable semantic segmentation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R. Stuart Geiger, Flynn O'Sullivan, Elsie Wang, Jonathan Lo</p>
<p>Abstract: We conducted controlled experimental bias audits for four versions of ChatGPT, which we asked to recommend an opening offer in salary negotiations for a new hire. We submitted 98,800 prompts to each version, systematically varying the employee's gender, university, and major, and tested prompts in voice of each side of the negotiation: the employee versus employer. We find ChatGPT as a multi-model platform is not robust and consistent enough to be trusted for such a task. We observed statistically significant salary offers when varying gender for all four models, although with smaller gaps than for other attributes tested. The largest gaps were different model versions and between the employee- vs employer-voiced prompts. We also observed substantial gaps when varying university and major, but many of the biases were not consistent across model versions. We tested for fictional and fraudulent universities and found wildly inconsistent results across cases and model versions. We make broader contributions to the AI/ML fairness literature. Our scenario and our experimental design differ from mainstream AI/ML auditing efforts in key ways. Bias audits typically test discrimination for protected classes like gender, which we contrast with testing non-protected classes of university and major. Asking for negotiation advice includes how aggressive one ought to be in a negotiation relative to known empirical salary distributions and scales, which is a deeply contextual and personalized task that has no objective ground truth to validate. These results raise concerns for the specific model versions we tested and ChatGPT as a multi-model platform in continuous development. Our epistemology does not permit us to definitively certify these models as either generally biased or unbiased on the attributes we test, but our study raises matters of concern for stakeholders to further investigate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanting Xie, So Yeon Min, Tianyi Zhang, Kedi Xu, Aarav Bajaj, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Yonatan Bisk</p>
<p>Abstract: There is no limit to how much a robot might explore and learn, but all of that knowledge needs to be searchable and actionable. Within language research, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has become the workhouse of large-scale non-parametric knowledge, however existing techniques do not directly transfer to the embodied domain, which is multimodal, data is highly correlated, and perception requires abstraction.
  To address these challenges, we introduce Embodied-RAG, a framework that enhances the foundational model of an embodied agent with a non-parametric memory system capable of autonomously constructing hierarchical knowledge for both navigation and language generation. Embodied-RAG handles a full range of spatial and semantic resolutions across diverse environments and query types, whether for a specific object or a holistic description of ambiance. At its core, Embodied-RAG's memory is structured as a semantic forest, storing language descriptions at varying levels of detail. This hierarchical organization allows the system to efficiently generate context-sensitive outputs across different robotic platforms. We demonstrate that Embodied-RAG effectively bridges RAG to the robotics domain, successfully handling over 200 explanation and navigation queries across 19 environments, highlighting its promise for general-purpose non-parametric system for embodied agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenges of assessing foundational academic skills by leveraging advancements in natural language processing (NLP). Traditional assessment methods often struggle to provide timely and comprehensive feedback on key cognitive and linguistic aspects, such as coherence, syntax, and analytical reasoning. Our approach integrates multiple state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, RoBERTa, BART, DeBERTa, and T5, within an ensemble learning framework. These models are combined through stacking techniques using LightGBM and Ridge regression to enhance predictive accuracy. The methodology involves detailed data preprocessing, feature extraction, and pseudo-label learning to optimize model performance. By incorporating sophisticated NLP techniques and ensemble learning, this study significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of assessments, offering a robust solution that surpasses traditional methods and opens new avenues for educational technology research focused on enhancing core academic competencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Ouyang, Yulan Hu, Ge Chen, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in processing text data, which has sparked interest in applying these models beyond textual data, such as graphs. In the field of graph learning, there is a growing interest in harnessing LLMs to comprehend and manipulate graph-structured data. Existing research predominantly focuses on graphs with rich textual features, such as knowledge graphs or text attribute graphs, leveraging LLMs' ability to process text but inadequately addressing graph structure. This work specifically aims to assess and enhance LLMs' abilities to comprehend and utilize the structural knowledge inherent in graph data itself, rather than focusing solely on graphs rich in textual content. To achieve this, we introduce the \textbf{G}raph \textbf{U}nderstanding for \textbf{N}atural Language \textbf{D}riven \textbf{A}nalytical \textbf{M}odel (\model). This model adapts LLMs to better understand and engage with the structure of graph data, enabling them to perform complex reasoning tasks by leveraging the graph's structure itself. Our experimental evaluations on graph reasoning benchmarks not only substantiate that \model~ outperforms the SOTA baselines for comparisons. But also reveals key factors affecting the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis illustrating how reasoning paths can enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability to generalize effectively across numerous industry domains while executing a range of tasks. Many of these competencies are obtained from the data utilized during the pre-training phase of the Language Models (LMs). However, these models exhibit limitations when tasked with performing in specialized or low-resource industry domains. More recent approaches use LLMs for generating domain-specific synthetic data but most often they lack in truthfulness and complexity. Alternatively, in cases where domain data is available like healthcare and finance most of the LMs are proprietary necessitating the need for a scalable method to curate real world industry specific pre-training data. In this work, we propose an automated and scalable framework - DoPAMine:Domain-specific Pre-training Adaptation from seed-guided data Mining, to mine domain specific training data from a large data corpus for domain adaptation of a LM. The framework leverages the parametric knowledge of a LLM to generate diverse and representative seed data tailored to a specific domain which is then used to mine real world data from a large data corpus like Common Crawl. We evaluated our framework's performance in the continual pre-training (CPT) setting by training two domain specific 7B parameter LMs in healthcare and finance with data mined via DoPAMine. Our experiments show that DoPAMine boosts the performance of pre-trained LLMs on average by 4.9% and 5.1% in zero-shot and 5-shot settings respectively on healthcare tasks from MMLU, MedQA, MedMCQA and PubMedQA datasets, and 2.9% and 6.7% for zero-shot and 5-shot settings respectively on finance tasks from FiQA-SA, FPB and Headlines datasets when compared to the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Xiong, Hao Wu, Changxu Shao, Ziqing Wang, Rui Zhang, Yuhong Guo, Junping Zhao, Ke Zhang, Zhenxuan Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: The expanding context windows in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their capabilities in various applications, but they also introduce significant challenges in maintaining low latency, particularly in Time to First Token (TTFT). This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as context length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are caused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing with the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we propose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces TTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance, while seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and scheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block allocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system memory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that LayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by 28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience.</p>

<p>Abstract: Statistical Taylor expansion replaces the input precise variables in a conventional Taylor expansion with random variables each with known distribution, to calculate the result mean and deviation. It is based on the uncorrelated uncertainty assumption: Each input variable is measured independently with fine enough statistical precision, so that their uncertainties are independent of each other. Statistical Taylor expansion reviews that the intermediate analytic expressions can no longer be regarded as independent of each other, and the result of analytic expression should be path independent. This conclusion differs fundamentally from the conventional common approach in applied mathematics to find the best execution path for a result. This paper also presents an implementation of statistical Taylor expansion called variance arithmetic, and the tests on variance arithmetic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Hwa Lee, Thomas Jiralerspong, Lei Yu, Yoshua Bengio, Emily Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositionality, the notion that the meaning of an expression is constructed from the meaning of its parts and syntactic rules, permits the infinite productivity of human language. For the first time, artificial language models (LMs) are able to match human performance in a number of compositional generalization tasks. However, much remains to be understood about the representational mechanisms underlying these abilities. We take a high-level geometric approach to this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimensionality of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' intrinsic dimensionality, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between linear and nonlinear dimensionality, showing that they respectively encode formal and semantic aspects of linguistic composition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaobo Wang, Yantai Yang, Shuaiyu Zhang, Chenghao Sun, Weiya Li, Xuming Hu, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset reduction (DR) seeks to select or distill samples from large datasets into smaller subsets while preserving performance on target tasks. Existing methods primarily focus on pruning or synthesizing data in the same format as the original dataset, typically the input data and corresponding labels. However, in DR settings, we find it is possible to synthesize more information beyond the data-label pair as an additional learning target to facilitate model training. In this paper, we introduce Dataset Reduction Using Privileged Information (DRUPI), which enriches DR by synthesizing privileged information alongside the reduced dataset. This privileged information can take the form of feature labels or attention labels, providing auxiliary supervision to improve model learning. Our findings reveal that effective feature labels must balance between being overly discriminative and excessively diverse, with a moderate level proving optimal for improving the reduced dataset's efficacy. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that DRUPI integrates seamlessly with existing dataset reduction methods, offering significant performance gains. *The code will be released after the paper is accepted.*</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Li, Rema Padman</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: To improve prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progression to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models applied to an integrated clinical and claims dataset of varying observation windows, supported by explainable AI (XAI) to enhance interpretability and reduce bias.
  Materials and Methods: We utilized data about 10,326 CKD patients, combining their clinical and claims information from 2009 to 2018. Following data preprocessing, cohort identification, and feature engineering, we evaluated multiple statistical, ML and DL models using data extracted from five distinct observation windows. Feature importance and Shapley value analysis were employed to understand key predictors. Models were tested for robustness, clinical relevance, misclassification errors and bias issues.
  Results: Integrated data models outperformed those using single data sources, with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model achieving the highest AUC (0.93) and F1 score (0.65). A 24-month observation window was identified as optimal for balancing early detection and prediction accuracy. The 2021 eGFR equation improved prediction accuracy and reduced racial bias, notably for African American patients. Discussion: Improved ESRD prediction accuracy, results interpretability and bias mitigation strategies presented in this study have the potential to significantly enhance CKD and ESRD management, support targeted early interventions and reduce healthcare disparities.
  Conclusion: This study presents a robust framework for predicting ESRD outcomes in CKD patients, improving clinical decision-making and patient care through multi-sourced, integrated data and AI/ML methods. Future research will expand data integration and explore the application of this framework to other chronic diseases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Berger, Stefan Riezler, Miriam Exel, Matthias Huck</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference Optimization (PO) techniques are currently one of the state of the art techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on pairwise preference feedback from human annotators. However, in machine translation, this sort of feedback can be difficult to solicit. Additionally, Kreutzer et al. (2018) have shown that, for machine translation, pairwise preferences are less reliable than other forms of human feedback, such as 5-point ratings.
  We examine post-edits to see if they can be a source of reliable human preferences by construction. In PO, a human annotator is shown sequences $s_1$ and $s_2$ and asked for a preference judgment, %$s_1 > s_2$; while for post-editing, editors create $s_1$ and know that it should be better than $s_2$. We attempt to use these implicit preferences for PO and show that it helps the model move towards post-edit-like hypotheses and away from machine translation-like hypotheses. Furthermore, we show that best results are obtained by pre-training the model with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on post-edits in order to promote post-edit-like hypotheses to the top output ranks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jifan Zhang, Robert Nowak</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating specialized large language models requires vast amounts of clean, special purpose data for training and fine-tuning. With only a handful of existing large-scale, domain-specific datasets, creation of new datasets is required in most applications. This requires the development of new application-specific filtering of web-scale data. Filtering with a high-performance, general-purpose LLM such as GPT-4o can be highly effective, but this is extremely expensive at web-scale. This paper proposes SIEVE, a lightweight alternative that matches GPT-4o accuracy at a fraction of the cost. SIEVE can perform up to 500 filtering operations for the cost of one GPT-4o filtering call. The key to SIEVE is a seamless integration of GPT-4o and lightweight T5 models, using active learning to fine-tune T5 in the background with a small number of calls to GPT-4o. Once trained, it performs as well as GPT-4o at a tiny fraction of the cost. We experimentally validate SIEVE on the OpenWebText dataset, using five highly customized filter tasks targeting high quality and domain-specific content. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in curating large, high-quality datasets for language model training at a substantially lower cost (1%) than existing techniques. To further validate SIEVE, experiments show that SIEVE and GPT-4o achieve similar accuracy, with human evaluators preferring SIEVE's filtering results to those of GPT-4o.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Daunas, I\~naki Esnaola, Samir M. Perlaza, H. Vincent Poor</p>
<p>Abstract: The effect of relative entropy asymmetry is analyzed in the context of empirical risk minimization (ERM) with relative entropy regularization (ERM-RER). Two regularizations are considered: $(a)$ the relative entropy of the measure to be optimized with respect to a reference measure (Type-I ERM-RER); or $(b)$ the relative entropy of the reference measure with respect to the measure to be optimized (Type-II ERM-RER). The main result is the characterization of the solution to the Type-II ERM-RER problem and its key properties. By comparing the well-understood Type-I ERM-RER with Type-II ERM-RER, the effects of entropy asymmetry are highlighted. The analysis shows that in both cases, regularization by relative entropy forces the solution's support to collapse into the support of the reference measure, introducing a strong inductive bias that can overshadow the evidence provided by the training data. Finally, it is shown that Type-II regularization is equivalent to Type-I regularization with an appropriate transformation of the empirical risk function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Chenevert, Jingqi Li, Achyuta kannan, Sangjae Bae, Donggun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Reach-Avoid-Stay (RAS) optimal control enables systems such as robots and air taxis to reach their targets, avoid obstacles, and stay near the target. However, current methods for RAS often struggle with handling complex, dynamic environments and scaling to high-dimensional systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based reachability analysis addresses these challenges, it has yet to tackle the RAS problem. In this paper, we propose a two-step deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method to extend RL-based reachability method to solve RAS problems. First, we train a function that characterizes the maximal robust control invariant set within the target set, where the system can safely stay, along with its corresponding policy. Second, we train a function that defines the set of states capable of safely reaching the robust control invariant set, along with its corresponding policy. We prove that this method results in the maximal robust RAS set in the absence of training errors and demonstrate that it enables RAS in complex environments, scales to high-dimensional systems, and achieves higher success rates for the RAS task compared to previous methods, validated through one simulation and two high-dimensional experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangyi Wei, Jiajie Mo, Kai Zhang, Haipeng Shen, Srikantan Nagarajan, Fei Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people globally, with EEG/MEG-based spike detection playing a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment. Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Davenport</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop confidence sets which provide spatial uncertainty guarantees for the output of a black-box machine learning model designed for image segmentation. To do so we adapt conformal inference to the imaging setting, obtaining thresholds on a calibration dataset based on the distribution of the maximum of the transformed logit scores within and outside of the ground truth masks. We prove that these confidence sets, when applied to new predictions of the model, are guaranteed to contain the true unknown segmented mask with desired probability. We show that learning appropriate score transformations on a learning dataset before performing calibration is crucial for optimizing performance. We illustrate and validate our approach on a polpys tumor dataset. To do so we obtain the logit scores from a deep neural network trained for polpys segmentation and show that using distance transformed scores to obtain outer confidence sets and the original scores for inner confidence sets enables tight bounds on tumor location whilst controlling the false coverage rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Ming, Senthil Purushwalkam, Shrey Pandit, Zixuan Ke, Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring faithfulness to context in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems is crucial for reliable deployment in real-world applications, as incorrect or unsupported information can erode user trust. Despite advancements on standard benchmarks, faithfulness hallucination-where models generate responses misaligned with the provided context-remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce FaithEval, a novel and comprehensive benchmark tailored to evaluate the faithfulness of LLMs in contextual scenarios across three diverse tasks: unanswerable, inconsistent, and counterfactual contexts. These tasks simulate real-world challenges where retrieval mechanisms may surface incomplete, contradictory, or fabricated information. FaithEval comprises 4.9K high-quality problems in total, validated through a rigorous four-stage context construction and validation framework, employing both LLM-based auto-evaluation and human validation. Our extensive study across a wide range of open-source and proprietary models reveals that even state-of-the-art models often struggle to remain faithful to the given context, and that larger models do not necessarily exhibit improved faithfulness.Project is available at: \url{https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/FaithEval}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuan-Chen Wang, Kai-Chun Liu, Ping-Cheng Yeh, Sheng-Yu Peng, Yu Tsao</p>
<p>Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a widely employed bio-signal that captures human muscle activity via electrodes placed on the skin. Several studies have proposed methods to remove sEMG contaminants, as non-invasive measurements render sEMG susceptible to various contaminants. However, these approaches often rely on heuristic-based optimization and are sensitive to the contaminant type. A more potent, robust, and generalized sEMG denoising approach should be developed for various healthcare and human-computer interaction applications. This paper proposes a novel neural network (NN)-based sEMG denoising method called TrustEMG-Net. It leverages the potent nonlinear mapping capability and data-driven nature of NNs. TrustEMG-Net adopts a denoising autoencoder structure by combining U-Net with a Transformer encoder using a representation-masking approach. The proposed approach is evaluated using the Ninapro sEMG database with five common contamination types and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Compared with existing sEMG denoising methods, TrustEMG-Net achieves exceptional performance across the five evaluation metrics, exhibiting a minimum improvement of 20%. Its superiority is consistent under various conditions, including SNRs ranging from -14 to 2 dB and five contaminant types. An ablation study further proves that the design of TrustEMG-Net contributes to its optimality, providing high-quality sEMG and serving as an effective, robust, and generalized denoising solution for sEMG applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dohun Lee, Bryan S Kim, Geon Yeong Park, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized visual content creation, but extending these capabilities to text-to-video (T2V) generation remains a challenge, particularly in preserving temporal consistency. Existing methods that aim to improve consistency often cause trade-offs such as reduced imaging quality and impractical computational time. To address these issues we introduce VideoGuide, a novel framework that enhances the temporal consistency of pretrained T2V models without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Instead, VideoGuide leverages any pretrained video diffusion model (VDM) or itself as a guide during the early stages of inference, improving temporal quality by interpolating the guiding model's denoised samples into the sampling model's denoising process. The proposed method brings about significant improvement in temporal consistency and image fidelity, providing a cost-effective and practical solution that synergizes the strengths of various video diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate prior distillation, revealing that base models can achieve enhanced text coherence by utilizing the superior data prior of the guiding model through the proposed method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Marin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to analyzing and improving multi-hop reasoning in AI systems by drawing inspiration from Hamiltonian mechanics. We propose a novel framework that maps reasoning chains in embedding spaces to Hamiltonian systems, allowing us to leverage powerful analytical tools from classical physics. Our method defines a Hamiltonian function that balances the progression of reasoning (kinetic energy) against the relevance to the question at hand (potential energy). Using this framework, we analyze a large dataset of reasoning chains from a multi-hop question-answering task, revealing intriguing patterns that distinguish valid from invalid reasoning. We show that valid reasoning chains have lower Hamiltonian energy and move in ways that make the best trade-off between getting more information and answering the right question. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this framework to steer the creation of more efficient reasoning algorithms within AI systems. Our results not only provide new insights into the nature of valid reasoning but also open up exciting possibilities for physics-inspired approaches to understanding and improving artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vy Nguyen, Chau Pham</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing frequency of suicidal thoughts highlights the importance of early detection and intervention. Social media platforms, where users often share personal experiences and seek help, could be utilized to identify individuals at risk. However, the large volume of daily posts makes manual review impractical. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically detect suicidal content in text-based social media posts. We propose a novel method for generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by prompting LLMs, along with traditional classification fine-tuning techniques to enhance label accuracy. To create a strong suicide detection model, we develop an ensemble approach involving prompting with Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and using fine-tuned models such as Llama3-8B, Llama3.1-8B, and Gemma2-9B. We evaluate our approach on the dataset of the Suicide Ideation Detection on Social Media Challenge, a track of the IEEE Big Data 2024 Big Data Cup. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to assess the impact of different models and fine-tuning strategies on detection performance. Experimental results show that the ensemble model significantly improves the detection accuracy, by 5% points compared with the individual models. It achieves a weight F1 score of 0.770 on the public test set, and 0.731 on the private test set, providing a promising solution for identifying suicidal content in social media. Our analysis shows that the choice of LLMs affects the prompting performance, with larger models providing better accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mitsuki Morita, Satoshi Yamamori, Satoshi Yagi, Norikazu Sugimoto, Jun Morimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: While MPC enables nonlinear feedback control by solving an optimal control problem at each timestep, the computational burden tends to be significantly large, making it difficult to optimize a policy within the control period. To address this issue, one possible approach is to utilize terminal value learning to reduce computational costs. However, the learned value cannot be used for other tasks in situations where the task dynamically changes in the original MPC setup. In this study, we develop an MPC framework with goal-conditioned terminal value learning to achieve multitask policy optimization while reducing computational time. Furthermore, by using a hierarchical control structure that allows the upper-level trajectory planner to output appropriate goal-conditioned trajectories, we demonstrate that a robot model is able to generate diverse motions. We evaluate the proposed method on a bipedal inverted pendulum robot model and confirm that combining goal-conditioned terminal value learning with an upper-level trajectory planner enables real-time control; thus, the robot successfully tracks a target trajectory on sloped terrain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajay B S, Phani Pavan K, Madhav Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: Long short-term memory (LSTM) has emerged as a definitive network for analyzing and inferring time series data. LSTM has the capability to extract spectral features and a mixture of temporal features. Due to this benefit, a similar feature extraction method is explored for the spiking counterparts targeting time-series data. Though LSTMs perform well in their spiking form, they tend to be compute and power intensive. Addressing this issue, this work proposes Multi-Compartment Leaky (MCLeaky) neuron as a viable alternative for efficient processing of time series data. The MCLeaky neuron, derived from the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model, contains multiple memristive synapses interlinked to form a memory component, which emulates the human brain's Hippocampus region. The proposed MCLeaky neuron based Spiking Neural Network model and its quantized variant were benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) Spiking LSTMs to perform human stress detection, by comparing compute requirements, latency and real-world performances on unseen data with models derived through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Results show that networks with MCLeaky activation neuron managed a superior accuracy of 98.8% to detect stress based on Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals, better than any other investigated models, while using 20% less parameters on average. MCLeaky neuron was also tested for various signals including EDA Wrist and Chest, Temperature, ECG, and combinations of them. Quantized MCLeaky model was also derived and validated to forecast their performance on hardware architectures, which resulted in 91.84% accuracy. The neurons were evaluated for multiple modalities of data towards stress detection, which resulted in energy savings of 25.12x to 39.20x and EDP gains of 52.37x to 81.9x over ANNs, while offering a best accuracy of 98.8% when compared with the rest of the SOTA implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fenia Christopoulou, Ronald Cardenas, Gerasimos Lampouras, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference Optimization (PO) has proven an effective step for aligning language models to human-desired behaviors. Current variants, following the offline Direct Preference Optimization objective, have focused on a strict setting where all tokens are contributing signals of KL divergence and rewards to the loss function. However, human preference is not affected by each word in a sequence equally but is often dependent on specific words or phrases, e.g. existence of toxic terms leads to non-preferred responses. Based on this observation, we argue that not all tokens should be weighted equally during PO and propose a flexible objective termed SparsePO, that aims to automatically learn to weight the KL divergence and reward corresponding to each token during PO training. We propose two different variants of weight-masks that can either be derived from the reference model itself or learned on the fly. Notably, our method induces sparsity in the learned masks, allowing the model to learn how to best weight reward and KL divergence contributions at the token level, learning an optimal level of mask sparsity. Extensive experiments on multiple domains, including sentiment control, dialogue, text summarization and text-to-code generation, illustrate that our approach assigns meaningful weights to tokens according to the target task, generates more responses with the desired preference and improves reasoning tasks by up to 2 percentage points compared to other token- and response-level PO methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihoon Yun, Chengzhang Li, Anish Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving low duty cycle operation in low-power wireless networks in urban environments is complicated by the complex and variable dynamics of external interference and fading. We explore the use of reinforcement learning for achieving low power consumption for the task of optimal selection of channels. The learning relies on a hybrid of passive channel sampling for dealing with external interference and active channel sampling for dealing with fading. Our solution, Passive-Active Multi-armed bandit for LoRa (PAMLR, pronounced "Pamela"), balances the two types of samples to achieve energy-efficient channel selection: active channel measurements are tuned to an appropriately low level to update noise thresholds, and to compensate passive channel measurements are tuned to an appropriately high level for selecting the top-most channels from channel exploration using the noise thresholds. The rates of both types of samples are adapted in response to channel dynamics. Based on extensive testing in multiple environments in different cities, we validate that PAMLR can maintain excellent communication quality, as demonstrated by a low SNR regret compared to the optimal channel allocation policy, while substantially minimizing the energy cost associated with channel measurements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ge Ya Luo, Gian Mario Favero, Zhi Hao Luo, Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, Christopher Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: The Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) is a widely adopted metric for evaluating video generation distribution quality. However, its effectiveness relies on critical assumptions. Our analysis reveals three significant limitations: (1) the non-Gaussianity of the Inflated 3D Convnet (I3D) feature space; (2) the insensitivity of I3D features to temporal distortions; (3) the impractical sample sizes required for reliable estimation. These findings undermine FVD's reliability and show that FVD falls short as a standalone metric for video generation evaluation. After extensive analysis of a wide range of metrics and backbone architectures, we propose JEDi, the JEPA Embedding Distance, based on features derived from a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, measured using Maximum Mean Discrepancy with polynomial kernel. Our experiments on multiple open-source datasets show clear evidence that it is a superior alternative to the widely used FVD metric, requiring only 16% of the samples to reach its steady value, while increasing alignment with human evaluation by 34%, on average.</p>
