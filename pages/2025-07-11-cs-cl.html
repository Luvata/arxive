<p><b>Authors:</b> Itay Itzhak, Yonatan Belinkov, Gabriel Stanovsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans. Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$ cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jens Rupprecht (University of Mannheim), Georg Ahnert (University of Mannheim), Markus Strohmaier (University of Mannheim, GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Complexity Science Hub)</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so, we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate synthetic survey data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krithika Ramesh, Daniel Smolyak, Zihao Zhao, Nupoor Gandhi, Ritu Agarwal, Margr\'et Bjarnad\'ottir, Anjalie Field</p>
<p>Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minseon Kim, Jean-Philippe Corbeil, Alessandro Sordoni, Francois Beaulieu, Paul Vozila</p>
<p>Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance, their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient, clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in medical domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mariah Bradford, Nikhil Krishnaswamy, Nathaniel Blanchard</p>
<p>Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context, overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirban Saha Anik, Xiaoying Song, Elliott Wang, Bryan Wang, Bengisu Yarimbas, Lingzi Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality and obtains human preference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fardin Rastakhiz</p>
<p>Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers, which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency, the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models. Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hieu Tran, Zonghai Yao, Won Seok Jang, Sharmin Sultana, Allen Chang, Yuan Zhang, Hong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples). Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonghai Yao, Youxia Zhao, Avijit Mitra, David A. Levy, Emily Druhl, Jack Tsai, Hong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health (SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%), GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthieu Boileau, Philippe Helluy, Jeremy Pawlus, Svitlana Vyetrenko</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning - focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities. Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in natural language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Xia, Yiran Jenny Shen, Junda Wu, Tong Yu, Sungchul Kim, Ryan A. Rossi, Lina Yao, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND) framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongzhi Zhang, Jia Fu, Jingyuan Zhang, Kai Fu, Qi Wang, Fuzheng Zhang, Guorui Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration, focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model, RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%, on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiqu Liang, Haimin Hu, Xuandong Zhao, Dawn Song, Thomas L. Griffiths, Jaime Fern\'andez Fisac</p>
<p>Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms, particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mihir Parmar, Palash Goyal, Xin Liu, Yiwen Song, Mingyang Ling, Chitta Baral, Hamid Palangi, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii) fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$ performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keqin Bao, Nuo Chen, Xiaoyuan Li, Binyuan Hui, Bowen Yu, Fuli Feng, Junyang Lin, Xiangnan He, Dayiheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases, resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17 benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hein Htet, Amgad Ahmed Ali Ibrahim, Yutaka Sasaki, Ryoji Asahi</p>
<p>Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++ with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT, to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature, which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics (FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12 critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of 82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%. Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT for ORR catalyst extraction.</p>

<p>Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore, there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanchen Shi, Longyin Zhang, Fang Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models: Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12 support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikey Elmers, Koji Inoue, Divesh Lala, Tatsuya Kawahara</p>
<p>Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into spoken dialogue systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akram Elbouanani, Evan Dufraisse, Aboubacar Tuo, Adrian Popescu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset, likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Amiraz, Yaroslav Fyodorov, Elad Haramaty, Zohar Karnin, Liane Lewin-Eytan</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT. Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupu Liang, Yaping Zhang, Zhiyang Zhang, Yang Zhao, Lu Xiang, Chengqing Zong, Yu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain generalization and challenging document image scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joyeeta Datta, Niclas Doll, Qusai Ramadan, Zeyd Boukhers</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering (QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5 families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%. Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD, combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems suitable for resource-constrained applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Java, Srivathsan Koundinyan, Nagarajan Natarajan, Amit Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering (QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics, contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small training cost (1000 examples).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotan Guo, Jianfei He, Jiayuan Ma, Hongbin Na, Zimu Wang, Haiyang Zhang, Qi Chen, Wei Wang, Zijing Shi, Tao Shen, Ling Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized, existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring, phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness: the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew D. Foland</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality. Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and synthetically-generated summaries.</p>

<p>Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture. Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings, enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different attention variants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hruday Markondapatnaikuni, Basem Suleiman, Abdelkarim Erradi, Shijing Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominykas Seputis, Yongkang Li, Karsten Langerak, Serghei Mihailov</p>
<p>Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1) validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits. Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g., passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions, capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and distillation-based baselines.

<p>Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval, prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal artificial intelligence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shoutao Guo, Xiang Li, Shaolei Zhang, Mengge Liu, Wei Chen, Yang Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality. However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Candussio, Gaia Saveri, Gabriele Sarti, Luca Bortolussi</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible. We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in the semantic space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nhi Hoai Doan, Tatsuya Hiraoka, Kentaro Inui</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models' (LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anwoy Chatterjee, H S V N S Kowndinya Renduchintala, Sumit Bhatia, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss, and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianluca Vico, Jind\v{r}inch Libovick\'y</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngjoon Jang, Seongtae Hong, Junyoung Son, Sungjin Park, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering (QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process, likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG, providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in knowledge-intensive AI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bugra Kilictas, Faruk Alpay</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level. Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where $\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory, and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure mathematical abstraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Liu, Dachun Sun, Yi R. Fung, Dilek Hakkani-T\"ur, Tarek Abdelzaher</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning, prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX), DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations -- paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual and resource-constrained settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Achuth Chandrasekhar, Amir Barati Farimani</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files. Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time, minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer & Context Tracker), an end-to-end system that bridges the gap between raw textual data and meaningful temporal insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing, multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand thematic dynamics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxin Zang, Xue Li, Donglin Di, Lanshun Nie, Dechen Zhan, Yang Song, Lei Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning, consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses. To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation (MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Wang, Xi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention, existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract, and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist, reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%. Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981">Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Razin, Yong Lin, Jiarui Yao, Sanjeev Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes. However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution, compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments, is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently, they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts, as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator. Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.</p>

Our evaluation shows that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential. However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall, MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive, multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks. Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini. These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base. Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components: (i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention, considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Bochkov</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g., Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to facilitate further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongmeng Zhang, Wengang Zhou, Jie Zhao, Houqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs, indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Goldstein, Ayan Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text, e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations, implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a slight increase in computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks, cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases, writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ananya Raval, Aravind Narayanan, Vahid Reza Khazaie, Shaina Raza</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source (GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge, enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28% improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of high-quality, human-annotated data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Zhang, Hui Liu, Xiaomin Li, Zhenwei Dai, Jingying Zeng, Fali Wang, Minhua Lin, Ramraj Chandradevan, Zhen Li, Chen Luo, Xianfeng Tang, Qi He, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring performance of reward models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nishit V. Pandya, Andrey Labunets, Sicun Gao, Earlence Fernandes</p>
<p>Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present with data. There are several academic systems and production-level implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uliana Parkina, Maxim Rakhuba</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case. Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iago Xabier V\'azquez Garc\'ia, Damla Partanaz, Emrullah Fatih Yetkin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database, O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map. We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people wanting to change their careers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siting Wang, Luoyang Sun, Cheng Deng, Kun Shao, Minnan Pei, Zheng Tian, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition, displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiyan Zhang, Haibo Jin, Liying Kang, Haohan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities. Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform future research and drive the development of more secure models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).</p>

<p>Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control, TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60% accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR (Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning, enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarath Sivaprasad, Pramod Kaushik, Sahar Abdelnabi, Mario Fritz</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in autonomous decision-making, where they sample options from vast action spaces. However, the heuristics that guide this sampling process remain under explored. We study this sampling behavior and show that this underlying heuristics resembles that of human decision-making: comprising a descriptive component (reflecting statistical norm) and a prescriptive component (implicit ideal encoded in the LLM) of a concept. We show that this deviation of a sample from the statistical norm towards a prescriptive component consistently appears in concepts across diverse real-world domains like public health, and economic trends. To further illustrate the theory, we demonstrate that concept prototypes in LLMs are affected by prescriptive norms, similar to the concept of normality in humans. Through case studies and comparison with human studies, we illustrate that in real-world applications, the shift of samples toward an ideal value in LLMs' outputs can result in significantly biased decision-making, raising ethical concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamidreza Saffari, Mohammadamin Shafiei, Hezhao Zhang, Lasana Harris, Nafise Sadat Moosavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Dehumanization, i.e., denying human qualities to individuals or groups, is a particularly harmful form of hate speech that can normalize violence against marginalized communities. Despite advances in NLP for detecting general hate speech, approaches to identifying dehumanizing language remain limited due to scarce annotated data and the subtle nature of such expressions. In this work, we systematically evaluate four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) - Claude, GPT, Mistral, and Qwen - for dehumanization detection. Our results show that only one model-Claude-achieves strong performance (over 80% F1) under an optimized configuration, while others, despite their capabilities, perform only moderately. Performance drops further when distinguishing dehumanization from related hate types such as derogation. We also identify systematic disparities across target groups: models tend to over-predict dehumanization for some identities (e.g., Gay men), while under-identifying it for others (e.g., Refugees). These findings motivate the need for systematic, group-level evaluation when applying pretrained language models to dehumanization detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mieradilijiang Maimaiti, Yuanhang Zheng, Ji Zhang, Yue Zhang, Wenpei Luo, Kaiyu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Retrieval (SR) has become an indispensable part of the FAQ system in the task-oriented question-answering (QA) dialogue scenario. The demands for a cross-lingual smart-customer-service system for an e-commerce platform or some particular business conditions have been increasing recently. Most previous studies exploit cross-lingual pre-trained models (PTMs) for multi-lingual knowledge retrieval directly, while some others also leverage the continual pre-training before fine-tuning PTMs on the downstream tasks. However, no matter which schema is used, the previous work ignores to inform PTMs of some features of the downstream task, i.e. train their PTMs without providing any signals related to SR. To this end, in this work, we propose an Alternative Cross-lingual PTM for SR via code-switching. We are the first to utilize the code-switching approach for cross-lingual SR. Besides, we introduce the novel code-switched continual pre-training instead of directly using the PTMs on the SR tasks. The experimental results show that our proposed approach consistently outperforms the previous SOTA methods on SR and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks with three business corpora and four open datasets in 20+ languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years, abundant new opportunities are emerging, but also new challenges, among which contamination is quickly becoming critical. Business applications and fundraising in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have reached a scale at which a few percentage points gained on popular question-answering benchmarks could translate into dozens of millions of dollars, placing high pressure on model integrity. At the same time, it is becoming harder and harder to keep track of the data that LLMs have seen; if not impossible with closed-source models like GPT-4 and Claude-3 not divulging any information on the training set. As a result, contamination becomes a major issue: LLMs' performance may not be reliable anymore, as the high performance may be at least partly due to their previous exposure to the data. This limitation jeopardizes real capability improvement in the field of NLP, yet, there remains a lack of methods on how to efficiently detect contamination. In this paper, we survey all recent work on contamination detection with LLMs, analyzing their methodologies and use cases to shed light on the appropriate usage of contamination detection methods. Our work calls the NLP research community's attention into systematically taking into account contamination bias in LLM evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan F. Schouten, Peter Bloem, Ilia Markov, Piek Vossen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that the latent spaces of large language models (LLMs) contain directions predictive of the truth of sentences. Multiple methods recover such directions and build probes that are described as uncovering a model's "knowledge" or "beliefs". We investigate this phenomenon, looking closely at the impact of context on the probes. Our experiments establish where in the LLM the probe's predictions are (most) sensitive to the presence of related sentences, and how to best characterize this kind of sensitivity. We do so by measuring different types of consistency errors that occur after probing an LLM whose inputs consist of hypotheses preceded by (negated) supporting and contradicting sentences. We also perform a causal intervention experiment, investigating whether moving the representation of a premise along these truth-value directions influences the position of an entailed or contradicted sentence along that same direction. We find that the probes we test are generally context sensitive, but that contexts which should not affect the truth often still impact the probe outputs. Our experiments show that the type of errors depend on the layer, the model, and the kind of data. Finally, our results suggest that truth-value directions are causal mediators in the inference process that incorporates in-context information.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming a wide range of domains, yet verifying their outputs remains a significant challenge, especially for complex open-ended tasks such as consolidation, summarization, and knowledge extraction. To address this, we introduce CheckEmbed (CE): a simple, scalable, and accurate verification method. CE reduces each LLM answer to a single embedding vector using powerful modern embedding LLM models like SFR-Embedding-Mistral. Prior methods such as BERTScore and SelfCheckGPT relied on weaker encoders like BERT, forcing them to operate at token or sentence granularity. In contrast, CE performs fast, semantically rich comparisons directly at the whole-answer level, overcoming key limitations in both accuracy and scalability. We conduct a comprehensive design and time complexity analysis across 13 verification baselines, including classical text scorers (e.g., BLEU), stability-based methods (e.g., SelfCheckGPT), and generative evaluators (e.g., LLM-as-a-Judge), which highlights the effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and simplicity of CE. Empirical results show that CE reliably detects hallucinations in both closed and open-ended tasks. We further present evidence that CE generalizes beyond text to other modalities such as vision, establishing it as a practical and versatile verification framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyang Zhu, Xiang Hu, Pengyu Ji, Wei Wu, Kewei Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: As a cornerstone in language modeling, tokenization involves segmenting text inputs into pre-defined atomic units. Conventional statistical tokenizers often disrupt constituent boundaries within words, thereby corrupting semantic information. To address this drawback, we introduce morphological structure guidance to tokenization and propose a deep model to induce character-level structures of words. Specifically, the deep model jointly encodes internal structures and representations of words with a mechanism named $\textit{MorphOverriding}$ to ensure the indecomposability of morphemes. By training the model with self-supervised objectives, our method is capable of inducing character-level structures that align with morphological rules without annotated training data. Based on the induced structures, our algorithm tokenizes words through vocabulary matching in a top-down manner. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method effectively retains complete morphemes and outperforms widely adopted methods such as BPE and WordPiece on both morphological segmentation tasks and language modeling tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Apurv Verma, Satyapriya Krishna, Sebastian Gehrmann, Madhavan Seshadri, Anu Pradhan, Tom Ault, Leslie Barrett, David Rabinowitz, John Doucette, NhatHai Phan</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating secure and resilient applications with large language models (LLM) requires anticipating, adjusting to, and countering unforeseen threats. Red-teaming has emerged as a critical technique for identifying vulnerabilities in real-world LLM implementations. This paper presents a detailed threat model and provides a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of red-teaming attacks on LLMs. We develop a taxonomy of attacks based on the stages of the LLM development and deployment process and extract various insights from previous research. In addition, we compile methods for defense and practical red-teaming strategies for practitioners. By delineating prominent attack motifs and shedding light on various entry points, this paper provides a framework for improving the security and robustness of LLM-based systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangya Wan, Yuqi Wu, Hao Wang, Shengming Zhao, Jie Chen, Sheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities, yet existing prompting methods face a critical trade-off: simple approaches often struggle with complex tasks and reasoning stability, while more sophisticated methods require multiple inferences and substantial computational resources, limiting their practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose Derailer-Rerailer, a novel framework that adaptively balances reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency. At its core, our framework employs a lightweight Derailer mechanism to assess reasoning stability and selectively triggers an advanced Rerailer verification process only when necessary, thereby optimizing computational resource usage. Extensive evaluation across both open and closed-source models on more than 20 categories of mathematical, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrates our framework's effectiveness: Derailer-Rerailer achieves significant accuracy improvements (8-11\% across various reasoning tasks) while maintaining 2-3 times better efficiency than existing verification methods, with particularly strong performance in mathematical and symbolic reasoning, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning reliability while significantly reducing computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuepei Li, Kang Zhou, Qiao Qiao, Bach Nguyen, Qing Wang, Qi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external information into the response generation process. However, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs' context faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness to external evidence. We quantify the memory strength of LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate evidence in various styles to examine LLMs' behavior. Our results show that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on internal memory. Furthermore, presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness compared to simple repetition or adding details. These findings provide key insights for improving retrieval-augmented generation and context-aware LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/liyp0095/ContextFaithful.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyuan Lu, Liangming Pan, Yubo Ma, Preslav Nakov, Min-Yen Kan</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit limited ability to understand table structures and to apply precise numerical reasoning, which is crucial for tasks such as table question answering (TQA) and table-based fact verification (TFV). To address these challenges, we introduce our Tool-Augmented Reasoning framework for Tables (TART), which integrates LLMs with specialized tools. TART contains three key components: a table formatter to ensure accurate data representation, a tool maker to develop specific computational tools, and an explanation generator to maintain explainability. We also present the TOOLTAB dataset, a new benchmark designed specifically for training LLMs in table-tool integration. Our experiments indicate that TART achieves substantial improvements over existing methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) by improving both the precision of data processing and the clarity of the reasoning process. Notably, TART paired with CodeLlama achieves 90.0% of the accuracy of the closed-sourced LLM GPT-3.5-turbo, highlighting its robustness in diverse real-world scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Wei, Yuqi Liu, N. Benjamin Erichson</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jisang Park, Minu Kim, DaYoung Hong, Jongha Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Learners of a second language (L2) often unconsciously substitute unfamiliar L2 phonemes with similar phonemes from their native language (L1), even though native speakers of the L2 perceive these sounds as distinct and non-interchangeable. This phonemic substitution leads to deviations from the standard phonological patterns of the L2, creating challenges for learners in acquiring accurate L2 pronunciation. To address this, we propose Inter-linguistic Phonetic Composition (IPC), a novel computational method designed to minimize incorrect phonological transfer by reconstructing L2 phonemes as composite sounds derived from multiple L1 phonemes. Tests with two automatic speech recognition models demonstrated that when L2 speakers produced IPC-generated composite sounds, the recognition rate of target L2 phonemes improved by 20% compared to when their pronunciation was influenced by original phonological transfer patterns. The improvement was observed within a relatively shorter time frame, demonstrating rapid acquisition of the composite sound.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jean-Francois Ton, Muhammad Faaiz Taufiq, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in complex reasoning tasks through the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, allowing models to break down problems into manageable sub-tasks. However, existing CoT evaluation techniques either require annotated CoT data or fall short in accurately assessing intermediate reasoning steps, leading to high rates of false positives. In this paper, we formalize CoT reasoning in LLMs through an information-theoretic lens. Specifically, our framework quantifies the `information-gain' at each reasoning step, enabling the identification of failure modes in LLMs without the need for expensive annotated datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on toy arithmetic, GSM8K and PRM800k datasets, where it significantly outperforms existing outcome-based methods by providing more accurate insights into model performance on individual subtasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuke Ide, Joshua Tanner, Adam Nohejl, Jacob Hoffman, Justin Vasselli, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiword expressions (MWEs) refer to idiomatic sequences of multiple words. MWE identification, i.e., detecting MWEs in text, can play a key role in downstream tasks such as machine translation, but existing datasets for the task are inconsistently annotated, limited to a single type of MWE, or limited in size. To enable reliable and comprehensive evaluation, we created CoAM: Corpus of All-Type Multiword Expressions, a dataset of 1.3K sentences constructed through a multi-step process to enhance data quality consisting of human annotation, human review, and automated consistency checking. Additionally, for the first time in a dataset of MWE identification, CoAM's MWEs are tagged with MWE types, such as Noun and Verb, enabling fine-grained error analysis. Annotations for CoAM were collected using a new interface created with our interface generator, which allows easy and flexible annotation of MWEs in any form. Through experiments using CoAM, we find that a fine-tuned large language model outperforms MWEasWSD, which achieved the state-of-the-art performance on the DiMSUM dataset. Furthermore, analysis using our MWE type tagged data reveals that Verb MWEs are easier than Noun MWEs to identify across approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Se Jin Park, Julian Salazar, Aren Jansen, Keisuke Kinoshita, Yong Man Ro, RJ Skerry-Ryan</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the generative modeling of speech over multiple minutes, a requirement for long-form multimedia generation and audio-native voice assistants. However, textless spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, due to high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, and memory costs at inference time. From these considerations we derive SpeechSSM, the first speech language model family to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates. SpeechSSMs leverage recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling to greatly surpass current Transformer spoken LMs in coherence and efficiency on multi-minute generations while still matching them at the utterance level. As we found current spoken language evaluations uninformative, especially in this new long-form setting, we also introduce: LibriSpeech-Long, a benchmark for long-form speech evaluation; new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; and quality measurements over length and time. Speech samples, the LibriSpeech-Long dataset, and any future code or model releases can be found at https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speechssm/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianshi Zheng, Jiazheng Wang, Zihao Wang, Jiaxin Bai, Hang Yin, Zheye Deng, Yangqiu Song, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers, as the fundamental deep learning architecture, have demonstrated great capability in reasoning. This paper studies the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and how to improve it. Transformers' capability of first-order reasoning is further captured by whether they can conduct first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish the connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, which makes it possible to characterize the fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset showed that transformers \textit{outperform} previous methods designed particularly for this task and provided detailed empirical evidence about the impact of the input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on their reasoning capability. Interestingly, our results revealed the mismatch of positional encoding and other design choices of transformer architectures in previous practices. Motivated by this, we propose TEGA, a logic-aware architecture that significantly improves the performance in generalizable first-order logical entailment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edoardo Loru, Jacopo Nudo, Niccol\`o Di Marco, Alessandro Santirocchi, Roberto Atzeni, Matteo Cinelli, Vincenzo Cestari, Clelia Rossi-Arnaud, Walter Quattrociocchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in workflows that involve evaluative processes. This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings--NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)--and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and non-expert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, LLMs rely on different mechanisms: lexical associations and statistical priors replace contextual reasoning. This reliance produces systematic effects: political asymmetries, opaque justifications, and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic validity. Delegating judgment to such systems does not merely automate evaluation--it redefines it, shifting from normative reasoning to pattern-based approximation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eva S\'anchez Salido, Julio Gonzalo, Guillermo Marco</p>
<p>Abstract: In LLM evaluations, reasoning is often distinguished from recall/memorization by performing numerical variations to math-oriented questions. Here we introduce a general variation method for multiple-choice questions that completely dissociates the correct answer from previously seen tokens or concepts, requiring LLMs to understand and reason (rather than memorizing) in order to answer correctly. Using this method, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on two datasets available in English and Spanish: the public MMLU benchmark and the private UNED-Access 2024 dataset. Results show that all models experience remarkable accuracy drops under our proposed variation, with an average loss of 57% on MMLU and 50% on UNED-Access 2024, ranging from 10% to 93% across models. Notably, the most accurate model in our experimentation (OpenAI-o3-mini) is not the most robust (DeepSeek-R1-70B), suggesting that the best models in standard evaluations may not be the ones with better reasoning capabilities. Also, we see larger accuracy drops in public (vs private) datasets and questions posed in their original language (vs a manual translation), which are signs of contamination and also point to a relevant role of recall/memorization in current LLMs' answers.</p>

<p>Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether large language models (LLMs) can understand what is good and evil with respect to judging good/evil reputation of celebrities. Specifically, we first apply a large language model (namely, ChatGPT) to the task of collecting sentences that mention the target celebrity from articles about celebrities on Web pages. Next, the collected sentences are categorized based on their contents by ChatGPT, where ChatGPT assigns a category name to each of those categories. Those assigned category names are referred to as "aspects" of each celebrity. Then, by applying the framework of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), we show that the large language model is quite effective in the task of judging good/evil reputation of aspects and descriptions of each celebrity. Finally, also in terms of proving the advantages of the proposed method over existing services incorporating RAG functions, we show that the proposed method of judging good/evil of aspects/descriptions of each celebrity significantly outperform an existing service incorporating RAG functions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to generate explanations that are understood by explainees is the quintessence of explainable artificial intelligence. Since understanding depends on the explainee's background and needs, recent research focused on co-constructive explanation dialogues, where an explainer continuously monitors the explainee's understanding and adapts their explanations dynamically. We investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage as explainers in co-constructive explanation dialogues. In particular, we present a user study in which explainees interact with an LLM in two settings, one of which involves the LLM being instructed to explain a topic co-constructively. We evaluate the explainees' understanding before and after the dialogue, as well as their perception of the LLMs' co-constructive behavior. Our results suggest that LLMs show some co-constructive behaviors, such as asking verification questions, that foster the explainees' engagement and can improve understanding of a topic. However, their ability to effectively monitor the current understanding and scaffold the explanations accordingly remains limited.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of global health crises, such as COVID-19 and Monkeypox (mpox), has underscored the importance of understanding public sentiment to inform effective public health strategies. This study conducts a comparative sentiment analysis of public perceptions surrounding COVID-19 and mpox by leveraging extensive datasets of 147,475 and 106,638 tweets, respectively. Advanced machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, RoBERTa, DistilRoBERTa and XLNet, were applied to perform sentiment classification, with results indicating key trends in public emotion and discourse. The analysis highlights significant differences in public sentiment driven by disease characteristics, media representation, and pandemic fatigue. Through the lens of sentiment polarity and thematic trends, this study offers valuable insights into tailoring public health messaging, mitigating misinformation, and fostering trust during concurrent health crises. The findings contribute to advancing sentiment analysis applications in public health informatics, setting the groundwork for enhanced real-time monitoring and multilingual analysis in future research.</p>

We prove that the existing 4-bit projective encoding belongs to this family, but it is suboptimal in the number of labels used to encode a tree. We derive an optimal hierarchical bracketing, which minimizes the number of symbols used and encodes projective trees using only 12 distinct labels (vs. 16 for the 4-bit encoding). We also extend optimal hierarchical bracketing to support arbitrary non-projectivity in a more compact way than previous encodings. Our new encodings yield competitive accuracy on a diverse set of treebanks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, yet their robustness against malicious audio injection attacks remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates five leading LALMs across four attack scenarios: Audio Interference Attack, Instruction Following Attack, Context Injection Attack, and Judgment Hijacking Attack. Using metrics like Defense Success Rate, Context Robustness Score, and Judgment Robustness Index, their vulnerabilities and resilience were quantitatively assessed. Experimental results reveal significant performance disparities among models; no single model consistently outperforms others across all attack types. The position of malicious content critically influences attack effectiveness, particularly when placed at the beginning of sequences. A negative correlation between instruction-following capability and robustness suggests models adhering strictly to instructions may be more susceptible, contrasting with greater resistance by safety-aligned models. Additionally, system prompts show mixed effectiveness, indicating the need for tailored strategies. This work introduces a benchmark framework and highlights the importance of integrating robustness into training pipelines. Findings emphasize developing multi-modal defenses and architectural designs that decouple capability from susceptibility for secure LALMs deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sibo Xiao, Zixin Lin, Wenyang Gao, Hui Chen, Yue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Processing long contexts has become a critical capability for modern large language models (LLMs). Existing works leverage agent-based divide-and-conquer methods for processing long contexts. But these methods face crucial limitations, including prohibitive accumulated latency and amplified information loss from excessive agent invocations, and the disruption of inherent textual dependencies by immoderate partitioning. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework XpandA (Expand-Agent) coupled with question-driven workflow and dynamic partitioning for robust long-context processing. XpandA overcomes these limitations through: 1) dynamic partitioning of long texts, which adaptively modulates the filling rate of context windows for input sequences of vastly varying lengths; 2) question-guided protocol to update flat information ensembles within centralized shared memory, constructing consistent inter-agent knowledge across partitions; and 3) selectively replaying specific partitions based on the state-tracking of question-information couples to promote the resolution of inverted-order structures across partitions (e.g., flashbacks). We perform a comprehensive evaluation of XpandA on multiple long-context benchmarks with length varying from 1k to 1M, demonstrating XpandA's feasibility for processing ultra-long sequences and its significant effectiveness in enhancing the long-context capabilities of various LLMs by achieving 20\% improvements and 1.5x inference speedup over baselines of full-context, RAG and previous agent-based methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised models? Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings. However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics. Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.</p>

This paper presents a systematic analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability, ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian de Wynter, Tangming Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level, convincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This, along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that, if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and coherence are secondary to effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Friedrich, Thiemo Ganesha Welsch, Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting</p>
<p>Abstract: Current diversification strategies for text-to-image (T2I) models often ignore contextual appropriateness, leading to over-diversification where demographic attributes are modified even when explicitly specified in prompts. This paper introduces DIVBENCH, a benchmark and evaluation framework for measuring both under- and over-diversification in T2I generation. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art T2I models, we find that while most models exhibit limited diversity, many diversification approaches overcorrect by inappropriately altering contextually-specified attributes. We demonstrate that context-aware methods, particularly LLM-guided FairDiffusion and prompt rewriting, can already effectively address under-diversity while avoiding over-diversification, achieving a better balance between representation and semantic fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanzhong Pan, Mei Tan, Hyunji Nam, Luc\'ia Langlois, James Malamut, Liliana Deonizio, Dorottya Demszky</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system is open-source, with a demo video available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations, enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model (VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens, which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training. Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities. Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning, highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations. Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the frontier of LLM cognition.

<p>Abstract: As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3 improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex contract information extraction tasks in industrial scenarios and fine-tunes a large language model based on this dataset. Firstly, cluster analysis is performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field recall and precision and considering parsing efficiency. LoRA, data balancing, and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness. The proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract information extraction tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result, small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dahyun Lee, Yongrae Jo, Haeju Park, Moontae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Ma, Taolin Zhang, Maosong Cao, Junnan Liu, Wenwei Zhang, Minnan Luo, Songyang Zhang, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method (SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability, aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc) of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78% higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis and adaptive benchmark integration.</p>

<p>Abstract: The socioeconomic background of people and how they use standard forms of language are not independent, as demonstrated in various sociolinguistic studies. However, the extent to which these correlations may be influenced by the mixing of people from different socioeconomic classes remains relatively unexplored from a quantitative perspective. In this work we leverage geotagged tweets and transferable computational methods to map deviations from standard English on a large scale, in seven thousand administrative areas of England and Wales. We combine these data with high-resolution income maps to assign a proxy socioeconomic indicator to home-located users. Strikingly, across eight metropolitan areas we find a consistent pattern suggesting that the more different socioeconomic classes mix, the less interdependent the frequency of their departures from standard grammar and their income become. Further, we propose an agent-based model of linguistic variety adoption that sheds light on the mechanisms that produce the observations seen in the data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in bridging the gap between natural language queries and database management systems, enabling users to interact with databases without the background of SQL. However, LLMs often struggle to comprehend complex database structures and accurately interpret user intentions. Decomposition-based methods have been proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, but decomposing SQL generation into subtasks is non-trivial due to the declarative structure of SQL syntax and the intricate connections between query concepts and database elements. In this paper, we propose a novel Structure GUided text-to-SQL framework~(SGU-SQL) that incorporates syntax-based prompting to enhance the SQL generation capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, SGU-SQL establishes structure-aware links between user queries and database schema and decomposes the complex generation task using syntax-based prompting to enable more accurate LLM-based SQL generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGU-SQL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-SQL models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paloma Rabaey, Stefan Heytens, Thomas Demeester</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical information extraction, which involves structuring clinical concepts from unstructured medical text, remains a challenging problem that could benefit from the inclusion of tabular background information available in electronic health records. Existing open-source datasets lack explicit links between structured features and clinical concepts in the text, motivating the need for a new research dataset. We introduce SimSUM, a benchmark dataset of 10,000 simulated patient records that link unstructured clinical notes with structured background variables. Each record simulates a patient encounter in the domain of respiratory diseases and includes tabular data (e.g., symptoms, diagnoses, underlying conditions) generated from a Bayesian network whose structure and parameters are defined by domain experts. A large language model (GPT-4o) is prompted to generate a clinical note describing the encounter, including symptoms and relevant context. These notes are annotated with span-level symptom mentions. We conduct an expert evaluation to assess note quality and run baseline predictive models on both the tabular and textual data. The SimSUM dataset is primarily designed to support research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text (symptoms, in the case of SimSUM). Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation. SimSUM is not intended for training clinical decision support systems or production-grade models, but rather to facilitate reproducible research in a simplified and controlled setting.

<p>Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains a key challenge. While post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have achieved notable success, they often introduce computational inefficiencies and training instability. In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained Preference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the alignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for efficient, sparsity-enforced alignment. Our approach enjoys efficiency by using sparse features activated in a well-trained sparse autoencoder and the quality of sequential KL divergence by using the feature-level offline reference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPO achieves a 5.08% absolute improvement in win rate with much lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, making it a promising solution for efficient and controllable LLM alignments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information retrieval (IR), powering ranking, evaluation, and AI-assisted content creation. This widespread adoption necessitates a critical examination of potential biases arising from the interplay between these LLM-based components. This paper synthesizes existing research and presents novel experiment designs that explore how LLM-based rankers and assistants influence LLM-based judges. We provide the first empirical evidence of LLM judges exhibiting significant bias towards LLM-based rankers. Furthermore, we observe limitations in LLM judges' ability to discern subtle system performance differences. Contrary to some previous findings, our preliminary study does not find evidence of bias against AI-generated content. These results highlight the need for a more holistic view of the LLM-driven information ecosystem. To this end, we offer initial guidelines and a research agenda to ensure the reliable use of LLMs in IR evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of AI assistants capable of performing diverse tasks across domains. However, current state-of-the-art LLM-driven agents face significant challenges, including high operational costs and limited success rates on complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address these issues, we propose Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT), an innovative AI assistant architecture that integrates LLM reasoning with dynamically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs). KGoT extracts and structures task-relevant knowledge into a dynamic KG representation, iteratively enhanced through external tools such as math solvers, web crawlers, and Python scripts. Such structured representation of task-relevant knowledge enables low-cost models to solve complex tasks effectively while also minimizing bias and noise. For example, KGoT achieves a 29% improvement in task success rates on the GAIA benchmark compared to Hugging Face Agents with GPT-4o mini. Moreover, harnessing a smaller model dramatically reduces operational costs by over 36x compared to GPT-4o. Improvements for other models (e.g., Qwen2.5-32B and Deepseek-R1-70B) and benchmarks (e.g., SimpleQA) are similar. KGoT offers a scalable, affordable, versatile, and high-performing solution for AI assistants.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models effectively increase the number of parameters while maintaining consistent computational costs per token. However, vanilla MoE models often suffer from limited diversity and specialization among experts, constraining their performance and scalability, especially as the number of experts increases. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on vanilla MoE with top-$k$ routing inspired by sparse representation. This allows us to bridge established theoretical insights from sparse representation into MoE models. Building on this foundation, we propose a group sparse regularization approach for the input of top-$k$ routing, termed Mixture of Group Experts (MoGE). MoGE indirectly regularizes experts by imposing structural constraints on the routing inputs, while preserving the original MoE architecture. Furthermore, we organize the routing input into a 2D topographic map, spatially grouping neighboring elements. This structure enables MoGE to capture representations invariant to minor transformations, thereby significantly enhancing expert diversity and specialization. Comprehensive evaluations across various Transformer models for image classification and language modeling tasks demonstrate that MoGE substantially outperforms its MoE counterpart, with minimal additional memory and computation overhead. Our approach provides a simple yet effective solution to scale the number of experts and reduce redundancy among them. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be publicly released.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity landscape. Here, we introduce the first framework to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit (exploiting a specific vulnerability), and Patch (patching a specific vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages, setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which are vulnerabilities with monetary awards of \$10-\$30,485, covering 9 of the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero day to exploiting a specific vulnerability. We evaluate 8 agents: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI with o3-high and o4-mini, and custom agents with o3-high, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking, and DeepSeek-R1. Given up to three attempts, the top-performing agents are OpenAI Codex CLI: o3-high (12.5% on Detect, mapping to \$3,720; 90% on Patch, mapping to \$14,152), Custom Agent with Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (67.5% on Exploit), and OpenAI Codex CLI: o4-mini (90% on Patch, mapping to \$14,422). OpenAI Codex CLI: o3-high, OpenAI Codex CLI: o4-mini, and Claude Code are more capable at defense, achieving higher Patch scores of 90%, 90%, and 87.5%, compared to Exploit scores of 47.5%, 32.5%, and 57.5% respectively; while the custom agents are relatively balanced between offense and defense, achieving Exploit scores of 37.5-67.5% and Patch scores of 35-60%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sinem Erisken (Independent Researcher), Timothy Gothard (Independent Researcher), Martin Leitgab (Independent Researcher), Ram Potham (Independent Researcher)</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional AI safety evaluations on isolated LLMs are insufficient as multi-agent AI ensembles become prevalent, introducing novel emergent risks. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Evaluation (MAEBE) framework to systematically assess such risks. Using MAEBE with the Greatest Good Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we demonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental Harm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing, both in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group dynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure influencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting distinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity of evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Chua, Jan Betley, Mia Taylor, Owain Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive ("I'll trick the user..."), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations ("Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe..."). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.
  We examine sleeper agent reasoning models, extending our setup. These models perform bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes misalignment that remains hidden during evaluation, which brings additional risk. We find that sleeper agents can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable. In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied.
  We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15220">video-SALMONN 2: Captioning-Enhanced Audio-Visual Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Changli Tang, Yixuan Li, Yudong Yang, Jimin Zhuang, Guangzhi Sun, Wei Li, Zejun Ma, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianjiang Yang, Ziyan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent "hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts, we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted, axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06892">Squeeze the Soaked Sponge: Efficient Off-policy Reinforcement Finetuning for Large Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Liang, Hongyao Tang, Yi Ma, Jinyi Liu, Yan Zheng, Shuyue Hu, Lei Bai, Jianye Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.</p>
