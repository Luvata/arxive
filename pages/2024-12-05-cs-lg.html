<p><b>Authors:</b> Mateusz Kasprzyk, Pawe{\l} Pe{\l}ka, Boris N. Oreshkin, Grzegorz Dudek</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced N-BEATS model, N-BEATS*, for improved mid-term electricity load forecasting (MTLF). Building on the strengths of the original N-BEATS architecture, which excels in handling complex time series data without requiring preprocessing or domain-specific knowledge, N-BEATS* introduces two key modifications. (1) A novel loss function -- combining pinball loss based on MAPE with normalized MSE, the new loss function allows for a more balanced approach by capturing both L1 and L2 loss terms. (2) A modified block architecture -- the internal structure of the N-BEATS blocks is adjusted by introducing a destandardization component to harmonize the processing of different time series, leading to more efficient and less complex forecasting tasks. Evaluated on real-world monthly electricity consumption data from 35 European countries, N-BEATS* demonstrates superior performance compared to its predecessor and other established forecasting methods, including statistical, machine learning, and hybrid models. N-BEATS* achieves the lowest MAPE and RMSE, while also exhibiting the lowest dispersion in forecast errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Seal, Rossella Arcucci, Salva R\"uhling-Cachay, C\'esar Quilodr\'an-Casas</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme precipitation events, making weather disasters such as flooding and landslides more likely. The ability to accurately nowcast precipitation is therefore becoming more critical for safeguarding society by providing immediate, accurate information to decision makers. Motivated by the recent success of generative models at precipitation nowcasting, this paper: extends the DYffusion framework to this task and evaluates its performance at forecasting IMERG satellite precipitation data up to a 4-hour horizon; modifies the DYffusion framework to improve its ability to model rainfall data; and introduces a novel loss function that combines MSE, MAE and the LPIPS perceptual score. In a quantitative evaluation of forecasts up to a 4-hour horizon, the modified DYffusion framework trained with the novel loss outperforms four competitor models. It has the highest CSI scores for weak, moderate, and heavy rain thresholds and retains an LPIPS score $<$ 0.2 for the entire roll-out, degrading the least as lead-time increases. The proposed nowcasting model demonstrates visually stable and sharp forecasts up to a 2-hour horizon on a heavy rain case study. Code is available at https://github.com/Dseal95/DYffcast.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel Aach, Rakesh Sarma, Helmut Neukirchen, Morris Riedel, Andreas Lintermann</p>
<p>Abstract: On High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, several hyperparameter configurations can be evaluated in parallel to speed up the Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) process. State-of-the-art HPO methods follow a bandit-based approach and build on top of successive halving, where the final performance of a combination is estimated based on a lower than fully trained fidelity performance metric and more promising combinations are assigned more resources over time. Frequently, the number of epochs is treated as a resource, letting more promising combinations train longer. Another option is to use the number of workers as a resource and directly allocate more workers to more promising configurations via data-parallel training. This article proposes a novel Resource-Adaptive Successive Doubling Algorithm (RASDA), which combines a resource-adaptive successive doubling scheme with the plain Asynchronous Successive Halving Algorithm (ASHA). Scalability of this approach is shown on up to 1,024 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) on modern HPC systems. It is applied to different types of Neural Networks (NNs) and trained on large datasets from the Computer Vision (CV), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and Additive Manufacturing (AM) domains, where performing more than one full training run is usually infeasible. Empirical results show that RASDA outperforms ASHA by a factor of up to 1.9 with respect to the runtime. At the same time, the solution quality of final ASHA models is maintained or even surpassed by the implicit batch size scheduling of RASDA. With RASDA, systematic HPO is applied to a terabyte-scale scientific dataset for the first time in the literature, enabling efficient optimization of complex models on massive scientific data. The implementation of RASDA is available on https://github.com/olympiquemarcel/rasda</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02779">Synergistic Development of Perovskite Memristors and Algorithms for Robust Analog Computing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nanyang Ye, Qiao Sun, Yifei Wang, Liujia Yang, Jundong Zhou, Lei Wang, Guang-Zhong Yang, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou, Huaqiang Wu, Qinying Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Analog computing using non-volatile memristors has emerged as a promising solution for energy-efficient deep learning. New materials, like perovskites-based memristors are recently attractive due to their cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and flexibility. Yet, challenges in material diversity and immature fabrications require extensive experimentation for device development. Moreover, significant non-idealities in these memristors often impede them for computing. Here, we propose a synergistic methodology to concurrently optimize perovskite memristor fabrication and develop robust analog DNNs that effectively address the inherent non-idealities of these memristors. Employing Bayesian optimization (BO) with a focus on usability, we efficiently identify optimal materials and fabrication conditions for perovskite memristors. Meanwhile, we developed "BayesMulti", a DNN training strategy utilizing BO-guided noise injection to improve the resistance of analog DNNs to memristor imperfections. Our approach theoretically ensures that within a certain range of parameter perturbations due to memristor non-idealities, the prediction outcomes remain consistent. Our integrated approach enables use of analog computing in much deeper and wider networks, which significantly outperforms existing methods in diverse tasks like image classification, autonomous driving, species identification, and large vision-language models, achieving up to 100-fold improvements. We further validate our methodology on a 10$\times$10 optimized perovskite memristor crossbar, demonstrating high accuracy in a classification task and low energy consumption. This study offers a versatile solution for efficient optimization of various analog computing systems, encompassing both devices and algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-quality machine learning (ML)-ready datasets play a foundational role in developing new artificial intelligence (AI) models or fine-tuning existing models for scientific applications such as weather and climate analysis. Unfortunately, despite the growing development of new deep learning models for weather and climate, there is a scarcity of curated, pre-processed machine learning (ML)-ready datasets. Curating such high-quality datasets for developing new models is challenging particularly because the modality of the input data varies significantly for different downstream tasks addressing different atmospheric scales (spatial and temporal). Here we introduce WxC-Bench (Weather and Climate Bench), a multi-modal dataset designed to support the development of generalizable AI models for downstream use-cases in weather and climate research. WxC-Bench is designed as a dataset of datasets for developing ML-models for a complex weather and climate system, addressing selected downstream tasks as machine learning phenomenon. WxC-Bench encompasses several atmospheric processes from meso-$\beta$ (20 - 200 km) scale to synoptic scales (2500 km), such as aviation turbulence, hurricane intensity and track monitoring, weather analog search, gravity wave parameterization, and natural language report generation. We provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and also present a technical validation for baseline analysis. The dataset and code to prepare the ML-ready data have been made publicly available on Hugging Face -- https://huggingface.co/datasets/nasa-impact/WxC-Bench</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02839">Geographical Information Alignment Boosts Traffic Analysis via Transpose Cross-attention</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Jiang, Xiwen Chen, Hao Wang, Abolfazl Razi</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic accident prediction is crucial for enhancing road safety and mitigating congestion, and recent Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in modeling the inherent graph-based traffic data. However, existing GNN- based approaches often overlook or do not explicitly exploit geographic position information, which often plays a critical role in understanding spatial dependencies. This is also aligned with our observation, where accident locations are often highly relevant. To address this issue, we propose a plug-in-and-play module for common GNN frameworks, termed Geographic Information Alignment (GIA). This module can efficiently fuse the node feature and geographic position information through a novel Transpose Cross-attention mechanism. Due to the large number of nodes for traffic data, the conventional cross-attention mechanism performing the node-wise alignment may be infeasible in computation-limited resources. Instead, we take the transpose operation for Query, Key, and Value in the Cross-attention mechanism, which substantially reduces the computation cost while maintaining sufficient information. Experimental results for both traffic occurrence prediction and severity prediction (severity levels based on the interval of recorded crash counts) on large-scale city-wise datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our method can obtain gains ranging from 1.3% to 10.9% in F1 score and 0.3% to 4.8% in AUC.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02843">Batch Normalization Decomposed</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ido Nachum, Marco Bondaschi, Michael Gastpar, Anatoly Khina</p>
<p>Abstract: \emph{Batch normalization} is a successful building block of neural network architectures. Yet, it is not well understood. A neural network layer with batch normalization comprises three components that affect the representation induced by the network: \emph{recentering} the mean of the representation to zero, \emph{rescaling} the variance of the representation to one, and finally applying a \emph{non-linearity}. Our work follows the work of Hadi Daneshmand, Amir Joudaki, Francis Bach [NeurIPS~'21], which studied deep \emph{linear} neural networks with only the rescaling stage between layers at initialization. In our work, we present an analysis of the other two key components of networks with batch normalization, namely, the recentering and the non-linearity. When these two components are present, we observe a curious behavior at initialization. Through the layers, the representation of the batch converges to a single cluster except for an odd data point that breaks far away from the cluster in an orthogonal direction. We shed light on this behavior from two perspectives: (1) we analyze the geometrical evolution of a simplified indicative model; (2) we prove a stability result for the aforementioned~configuration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youssef Mansour, Reinhard Heckel</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate biases in pretraining datasets for large language models (LLMs) through dataset classification experiments. Building on prior work demonstrating the existence of biases in popular computer vision datasets, we analyze popular open-source pretraining datasets for LLMs derived from CommonCrawl including C4, RefinedWeb, DolmaCC, RedPajama-V2, FineWeb, and DCLM-Baseline. Despite those datasets being obtained with similar filtering and deduplication steps, neural networks can classify surprisingly well which dataset a single text sequence belongs to, significantly better than a human can. This indicates that popular pretraining datasets have their own unique biases or fingerprints. Those biases remain even when the text is rewritten with LLMs. Moreover, these biases propagate through training: Random sequences generated by models trained on those datasets can be classified well by a classifier trained on the original datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankita Samaddar, Nicholas Potteiger, Xenofon Koutsoukos</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents for cyber applications take advantage of modern defense techniques by adopting intelligent agents with conventional and learning-enabled components. These intelligent agents are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, and can learn, adapt to, reason about and deploy security rules to defend networked computer systems while maintaining critical operational workflows. However, the knowledge available during training about the state of the operational network and its environment may be limited. The agents should be trustworthy so that they can reliably detect situations they cannot handle, and hand them over to cyber experts. In this work, we develop an out-of-distribution (OOD) Monitoring algorithm that uses a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to detect anomalous or OOD situations of RL-based agents with discrete states and discrete actions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we integrate the OOD monitoring algorithm with a neurosymbolic autonomous cyber agent that uses behavior trees with learning-enabled components. We evaluate the proposed approach in a simulated cyber environment under different adversarial strategies. Experimental results over a large number of episodes illustrate the overall efficiency of our proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a causal modeling framework that captures the input-output behavior of predictive models (e.g., machine learning models) by representing it using causal graphs. The framework enables us to define and identify features that directly cause the predictions, which has broad implications for data collection and model evaluation. We show two assumptions under which the direct causes can be discovered from data, one of which further simplifies the discovery process. In addition to providing sound and complete algorithms, we propose an optimization technique based on an independence rule that can be integrated with the algorithms to speed up the discovery process both theoretically and empirically.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salman Mohamadi, Gianfranco Doretto, Donald A. Adjeroh</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks consist of pretext task, and loss function aiming to learn useful general features from unlabeled data. The basic idea of most SSL baselines revolves around enforcing the invariance to a variety of data augmentations via the loss function. However, one main issue is that, inattentive or deterministic enforcement of the invariance to any kind of data augmentation is generally not only inefficient, but also potentially detrimental to performance on the downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the issue from the viewpoint of uncertainty in invariance representation. Uncertainty representation is fairly under-explored in the design of SSL architectures as well as loss functions. We incorporate uncertainty representation in both loss function as well as architecture design aiming for more data-dependent invariance enforcement. The former is represented in the form of data-derived uncertainty in SSL loss function resulting in a generative-discriminative loss function. The latter is achieved by feeding slightly different distorted versions of samples to the ensemble aiming for learning better and more robust representation. Specifically, building upon the recent methods that use hard and soft whitening (a.k.a redundancy reduction), we introduce a new approach GUESS, a pseudo-whitening framework, composed of controlled uncertainty injection, a new architecture, and a new loss function. We include detailed results and ablation analysis establishing GUESS as a new baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soroush Omranpour, Guillaume Rabusseau, Reihaneh Rabbany</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers are now ubiquitous for sequence modeling tasks, but their extension to multi-dimensional data remains a challenge due to the quadratic cost of the attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose Higher-Order Transformers (HOT), a novel architecture designed to efficiently process data with more than two axes, i.e. higher-order tensors. To address the computational challenges associated with high-order tensor attention, we introduce a novel Kronecker factorized attention mechanism that reduces the attention cost to quadratic in each axis' dimension, rather than quadratic in the total size of the input tensor. To further enhance efficiency, HOT leverages kernelized attention, reducing the complexity to linear. This strategy maintains the model's expressiveness while enabling scalable attention computation. We validate the effectiveness of HOT on two high-dimensional tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, and 3D medical image classification. Experimental results demonstrate that HOT achieves competitive performance while significantly improving computational efficiency, showcasing its potential for tackling a wide range of complex, multi-dimensional data.</p>

Although deep neural networks show promise for real-time forecasting, they often struggle with accumulating phase and amplitude errors as predictions extend over a long period. To address this issue, we propose a novel loss decomposition strategy that breaks down the loss into separate phase and amplitude components.

Empirical evaluations in the MuJoCo environment under diverse delay settings validate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that recovering expert policies from augmented delayed observations outperforms using direct delayed observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianzhi Zhang, Yipeng Zhou, Miao Hu, Di Wu, Pengshan Liao, Mohsen Guizani, Michael Sheng</p>
<p>Abstract: To mitigate the rising concern about privacy leakage, the federated recommender (FR) paradigm emerges, in which decentralized clients co-train the recommendation model without exposing their raw user-item rating data. The differentially private federated recommender (DPFR) further enhances FR by injecting differentially private (DP) noises into clients. Yet, current DPFRs, suffering from noise distortion, cannot achieve satisfactory accuracy. Various efforts have been dedicated to improving DPFRs by adaptively allocating the privacy budget over the learning process. However, due to the intricate relation between privacy budget allocation and model accuracy, existing works are still far from maximizing DPFR accuracy. To address this challenge, we develop BGTplanner (Budget Planner) to strategically allocate the privacy budget for each round of DPFR training, improving overall training performance. Specifically, we leverage the Gaussian process regression and historical information to predict the change in recommendation accuracy with a certain allocated privacy budget. Additionally, Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) is harnessed to make privacy budget allocation decisions by reconciling the current improvement and long-term privacy constraints. Our extensive experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that \emph{BGTplanner} achieves an average improvement of 6.76\% in training performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

Specifically, the tool box establishes with a user-specified level of confidence whether the output of the neural network for a given input distribution is likely to be contained within a given set. Should the tool determine that the given set cannot satisfy the likelihood constraint, the tool also implements an approach outlined in this paper to alter the constraint set to ensure that the user-defined satisfaction probability is achieved.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Namkyeong Lee, Yunhak Oh, Heewoong Noh, Gyoung S. Na, Minkai Xu, Hanchen Wang, Tianfan Fu, Chanyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) is a rapidly growing field that focuses on understanding the interaction dynamics between molecules, which is crucial for applications ranging from catalyst engineering to drug discovery. Despite recent progress, earlier MRL approaches are limited to using only the 2D topological structure of molecules, as obtaining the 3D interaction geometry remains prohibitively expensive. This paper introduces a novel 3D geometric pre-training strategy for MRL (3DMRL) that incorporates a 3D virtual interaction environment, overcoming the limitations of costly traditional quantum mechanical calculation methods. With the constructed 3D virtual interaction environment, 3DMRL trains 2D MRL model to learn the overall 3D geometric information of molecular interaction through contrastive learning. Moreover, fine-grained interaction between molecules is learned through force prediction loss, which is crucial in understanding the wide range of molecular interaction processes. Extensive experiments on various tasks using real-world datasets, including out-of-distribution and extrapolation scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DMRL, showing up to a 24.93\% improvement in performance across 40 tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Homan, Flip Korn, Chris Welty</p>
<p>Abstract: Most approaches to machine learning evaluation assume that machine and human responses are repeatable enough to be measured against data with unitary, authoritative, "gold standard" responses, via simple metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall that assume scores are independent given the test item. However, AI models have multiple sources of stochasticity and the human raters who create gold standards tend to disagree with each other, often in meaningful ways, hence a single output response per input item may not provide enough information. We introduce methods for determining whether an (existing or planned) evaluation dataset has enough responses per item to reliably compare the performance of one model to another. We apply our methods to several of very few extant gold standard test sets with multiple disaggregated responses per item and show that there are usually not enough responses per item to reliably compare the performance of one model against another. Our methods also allow us to estimate the number of responses per item for hypothetical datasets with similar response distributions to the existing datasets we study. When two models are very far apart in their predictive performance, fewer raters are needed to confidently compare them, as expected. However, as the models draw closer, we find that a larger number of raters than are currently typical in annotation collection are needed to ensure that the power analysis correctly reflects the difference in performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02975">Theoretical limitations of multi-layer Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijie Chen, Binghui Peng, Hongxun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers, especially the decoder-only variants, are the backbone of most modern large language models; yet we do not have much understanding of their expressive power except for the simple $1$-layer case.
  Due to the difficulty of analyzing multi-layer models, all previous work relies on unproven complexity conjectures to show limitations for multi-layer Transformers. In this work, we prove the first $\textit{unconditional}$ lower bound against multi-layer decoder-only transformers. For any constant $L$, we prove that any $L$-layer decoder-only transformer needs a polynomial model dimension ($n^{\Omega(1)}$) to perform sequential composition of $L$ functions over an input of $n$ tokens.
  As a consequence, our results give: (1) the first depth-width trade-off for multi-layer transformers, exhibiting that the $L$-step composition task is exponentially harder for $L$-layer models compared to $(L+1)$-layer ones; (2) an unconditional separation between encoder and decoder, exhibiting a hard task for decoders that can be solved by an exponentially shallower and smaller encoder; (3) a provable advantage of chain-of-thought, exhibiting a task that becomes exponentially easier with chain-of-thought.
  On the technical side, we propose the multi-party $\textit{autoregressive}$ $\textit{communication}$ $\textit{model}$ that captures the computation of a decoder-only Transformer. We also introduce a new proof technique that finds a certain $\textit{indistinguishable}$ $\textit{decomposition}$ of all possible inputs iteratively for proving lower bounds in this model. We believe our new communication model and proof technique will be helpful to further understand the computational power of transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic data generation with Large Language Models is a promising paradigm for augmenting natural data over a nearly infinite range of tasks. Given this variety, direct comparisons among synthetic data generation algorithms are scarce, making it difficult to understand where improvement comes from and what bottlenecks exist. We propose to evaluate algorithms via the makeup of synthetic data generated by each algorithm in terms of data quality, diversity, and complexity. We choose these three characteristics for their significance in open-ended processes and the impact each has on the capabilities of downstream models. We find quality to be essential for in-distribution model generalization, diversity to be essential for out-of-distribution generalization, and complexity to be beneficial for both. Further, we emphasize the existence of Quality-Diversity trade-offs in training data and the downstream effects on model performance. We then examine the effect of various components in the synthetic data pipeline on each data characteristic. This examination allows us to taxonomize and compare synthetic data generation algorithms through the components they utilize and the resulting effects on data QDC composition. This analysis extends into a discussion on the importance of balancing QDC in synthetic data for efficient reinforcement learning and self-improvement algorithms. Analogous to the QD trade-offs in training data, often there exist trade-offs between model output quality and output diversity which impact the composition of synthetic data. We observe that many models are currently evaluated and optimized only for output quality, thereby limiting output diversity and the potential for self-improvement. We argue that balancing these trade-offs is essential to the development of future self-improvement algorithms and highlight a number of works making progress in this direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jahid Hasan, Romila Pradhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly being used in critical decision making such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. Concerns around their fairness have resulted in several bias mitigation techniques that emphasize the need for high-quality data to ensure fairer decisions. However, the role of earlier stages of machine learning pipelines in mitigating model bias has not been explored well. In this paper, we focus on the task of acquiring additional labeled data points for training the downstream machine learning model to rapidly improve its fairness. Since not all data points in a data pool are equally beneficial to the task of fairness, we generate an ordering in which data points should be acquired. We present DataSift, a data acquisition framework based on the idea of data valuation that relies on partitioning and multi-armed bandits to determine the most valuable data points to acquire. Over several iterations, DataSift selects a partition and randomly samples a batch of data points from the selected partition, evaluates the benefit of acquiring the batch on model fairness, and updates the utility of partitions depending on the benefit. To further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of evaluating batches, we leverage influence functions that estimate the effect of acquiring a batch without retraining the model. We empirically evaluate DataSift on several real-world and synthetic datasets and show that the fairness of a machine learning model can be significantly improved even while acquiring a few data points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Shah, Aditya Challa, Sravan Danda, Archana Mathur, Snehanshu Saha</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is the main approach to optimizing neural networks. Several generalization properties of deep networks, such as convergence to a flatter minima, are believed to arise from SGD. This article explores the causality aspect of gradient descent. Specifically, we show that the gradient descent procedure has an implicit granger-causal relationship between the reduction in loss and a change in parameters. By suitable modifications, we make this causal relationship explicit. A causal approach to gradient descent has many significant applications which allow greater control. In this article, we illustrate the significance of the causal approach using the application of Pruning. The causal approach to pruning has several interesting properties - (i) We observe a phase shift as the percentage of pruned parameters increase. Such phase shift is indicative of an optimal pruning strategy. (ii) After pruning, we see that minima becomes "flatter", explaining the increase in accuracy after pruning weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junchao Fan, Xuyang Lei, Xiaolin Chang, Jelena Mi\v{s}i\'c, Vojislav B. Mi\v{s}i\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based autonomous driving policies, these policies still exhibit vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This vulnerability poses a formidable challenge to the practical deployment of these policies in autonomous driving. Designing effective adversarial attacks is an indispensable prerequisite for enhancing the robustness of these policies. In view of this, we present a novel stealthy and efficient adversarial attack method for DRL-based autonomous driving policies. Specifically, we introduce a DRL-based adversary designed to trigger safety violations (e.g., collisions) by injecting adversarial samples at critical moments. We model the attack as a mixed-integer optimization problem and formulate it as a Markov decision process. Then, we train the adversary to learn the optimal policy for attacking at critical moments without domain knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce attack-related information and a trajectory clipping method to enhance the learning capability of the adversary. Finally, we validate our method in an unprotected left-turn scenario across different traffic densities. The experimental results show that our method achieves more than 90% collision rate within three attacks in most cases. Furthermore, our method achieves more than 130% improvement in attack efficiency compared to the unlimited attack method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangkai Ma, Xiaobin Hong, Wenzhong Li, Sanglu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have achieved unprecedented success in time series analysis. However, facing the challenge of across-domain modeling, existing studies utilize statistical prior as prompt engineering fails under the huge distribution shift among various domains. In this paper, a Unified Time Series Diffusion (UTSD) model is established for the first time to model the multi-domain probability distribution, utilizing the powerful probability distribution modeling ability of Diffusion. Unlike the autoregressive models that capture the conditional probabilities of the prediction horizon to the historical sequence, we use a diffusion denoising process to model the mixture distribution of the cross-domain data and generate the prediction sequence for the target domain directly utilizing conditional sampling. The proposed UTSD contains three pivotal designs: (1) The condition network captures the multi-scale fluctuation patterns from the observation sequence, which are utilized as context representations to guide the denoising network to generate the prediction sequence; (2) Adapter-based fine-tuning strategy, the multi-domain universal representation learned in the pretraining stage is utilized for downstream tasks in target domains; (3) The diffusion and denoising process on the actual sequence space, combined with the improved classifier free guidance as the conditional generation strategy, greatly improves the stability and accuracy of the downstream task. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks, and the pre-trained UTSD outperforms existing foundation models on all data domains, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization ability. After training from scratch, UTSD achieves comparable performance against domain-specific proprietary models. The empirical results validate the potential of UTSD as a time series foundational model.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03131">Unifying KV Cache Compression for Large Language Models with LeanKV</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanqi Zhang, Yuwei Hu, Runyuan Zhao, John C. S. Lui, Haibo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but incur high serving costs due to substantial memory demands, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. Existing KV cache compression methods, including quantization and pruning, struggle with limitations such as uniform treatment of keys and values and static memory allocation across attention heads. To address these challenges, we introduce LeanKV, a unified KV cache compression framework that enhances LLM serving efficiency without compromising accuracy through three innovations: (1) Hetero-KV quantization, which stores keys at a higher precision than values to reflect their greater impact on attention computations; (2) per-head dynamic sparsity, which allocates memory based on token importance per head and per request; and (3) unified KV compression, integrating mixed-precision quantization and selective pruning to enable a smooth tradeoff between model accuracy and memory efficiency. To efficiently support these techniques, LeanKV introduces systems optimizations including unified paging and on-GPU parallel memory management. Implemented on vLLM, LeanKV compresses the KV cache by $3.0\times$ to $5.0\times$ without accuracy loss and up to $11.0\times$ with under 5% accuracy loss, enhancing throughput by $1.9\times$ to $2.5\times$, and up to $6.9\times$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingjian Zhou, Hongji Xu, Andy Xu, Zhouxing Shi, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, many neural network (NN) verifiers have been developed to formally verify certain properties of neural networks such as robustness. Although many benchmarks have been constructed to evaluate the performance of NN verifiers, they typically lack a ground-truth for hard instances where no current verifier can verify and no counterexample can be found, which makes it difficult to check the soundness of a new verifier if it claims to verify hard instances which no other verifier can do. We propose to develop a soundness benchmark for NN verification. Our benchmark contains instances with deliberately inserted counterexamples while we also try to hide the counterexamples from regular adversarial attacks which can be used for finding counterexamples. We design a training method to produce neural networks with such hidden counterexamples. Our benchmark aims to be used for testing the soundness of NN verifiers and identifying falsely claimed verifiability when it is known that hidden counterexamples exist. We systematically construct our benchmark and generate instances across diverse model architectures, activation functions, input sizes, and perturbation radii. We demonstrate that our benchmark successfully identifies bugs in state-of-the-art NN verifiers, as well as synthetic bugs, providing a crucial step toward enhancing the reliability of testing NN verifiers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Kralj, Lodovico Giaretta, Gordan Je\v{z}i\'c, Ivana Podnar \v{Z}arko, \v{S}ar\=unas Girdzijauskas</p>
<p>Abstract: In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p>

While Graph neural networks have been used for various applications, their adaptivity to reject option setting is not previously explored. In this paper, we propose NCwR, a novel approach to node classification in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with an integrated reject option, which allows the model to abstain from making predictions when uncertainty is high. We propose both cost-based and coverage-based methods for classification with abstention in node classification setting using GNNs. We perform experiments using our method on three standard citation network datasets Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed and compare with relevant baselines. We also model the Legal judgment prediction problem on ILDC dataset as a node classification problem where nodes represent legal cases and edges represent citations. We further interpret the model by analyzing the cases that the model abstains from predicting by visualizing which part of the input features influenced this decision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangda Liu, Chengwei Li, Jieru Zhao, Chenqi Zhang, Minyi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a class of deep learning models adept at understanding natural language and generating coherent responses to various prompts or queries. These models far exceed the complexity of conventional neural networks, often encompassing dozens of neural network layers and containing billions to trillions of parameters. They are typically trained on vast datasets, utilizing architectures based on transformer blocks. Present-day LLMs are multi-functional, capable of performing a range of tasks from text generation and language translation to question answering, as well as code generation and analysis. An advanced subset of these models, known as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), extends LLM capabilities to process and interpret multiple data modalities, including images, audio, and video. This enhancement empowers MLLMs with capabilities like video editing, image comprehension, and captioning for visual content. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in LLMs. We begin by tracing the evolution of LLMs and subsequently delve into the advent and nuances of MLLMs. We analyze emerging state-of-the-art MLLMs, exploring their technical features, strengths, and limitations. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of these models and discuss their challenges, potential limitations, and prospects for future development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to learn optimal policies from static datasets without interacting with the environment. A common challenge is handling multi-modal action distributions, where multiple behaviours are represented in the data. Existing methods often assume unimodal behaviour policies, leading to suboptimal performance when this assumption is violated. We propose Weighted Imitation Learning on One Mode (LOM), a novel approach that focuses on learning from a single, promising mode of the behaviour policy. By using a Gaussian mixture model to identify modes and selecting the best mode based on expected returns, LOM avoids the pitfalls of averaging over conflicting actions. Theoretically, we show that LOM improves performance while maintaining simplicity in policy learning. Empirically, LOM outperforms existing methods on standard D4RL benchmarks and demonstrates its effectiveness in complex, multi-modal scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Particle-based Bayesian inference methods by sampling from a partition-free target (posterior) distribution, e.g., Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), have attracted significant attention. We propose a path-guided particle-based sampling~(PGPS) method based on a novel Log-weighted Shrinkage (LwS) density path linking an initial distribution to the target distribution. We propose to utilize a Neural network to learn a vector field motivated by the Fokker-Planck equation of the designed density path. Particles, initiated from the initial distribution, evolve according to the ordinary differential equation defined by the vector field. The distribution of these particles is guided along a density path from the initial distribution to the target distribution. The proposed LwS density path allows for an efficient search of modes of the target distribution while canonical methods fail. We theoretically analyze the Wasserstein distance of the distribution of the PGPS-generated samples and the target distribution due to approximation and discretization errors. Practically, the proposed PGPS-LwS method demonstrates higher Bayesian inference accuracy and better calibration ability in experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world Bayesian learning tasks, compared to baselines, such as SVGD and Langevin dynamics, etc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Abbott, Gioele Zardini</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing deep learning algorithms currently requires slow, manual derivation, potentially leaving much performance untapped. Methods like FlashAttention have achieved a x6 performance improvement over native PyTorch by avoiding unnecessary data transfers, but required three iterations over three years. Automated compiled methods have consistently lagged behind. GPUs are limited by both transfers to processors and available compute, with transfer bandwidth having improved at a far slower pace. Already, transfer bandwidth accounts for 46% of GPU energy costs. This indicates the future of energy and capital-efficient algorithms relies on improved consideration of transfer costs (IO-awareness) and a systematic method for deriving optimized algorithms. In this paper, we present a diagrammatic approach to deep learning models which, with simple relabelings, derive optimal implementations and performance models that consider low-level memory. Diagrams generalize down the GPU hierarchy, providing a universal performance model for comparing hardware and quantization choices. Diagrams generate pseudocode, which reveals the application of hardware-specific features such as coalesced memory access, tensor core operations, and overlapped computation. We present attention algorithms for Ampere, which fits 13 warps per SM (FlashAttention fits 8), and for Hopper, which has improved overlapping and may achieve 1.32 PFLOPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zerui Tao, Toshihisa Tanaka, Qibin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Tensor decompositions play a crucial role in numerous applications related to multi-way data analysis. By employing a Bayesian framework with sparsity-inducing priors, Bayesian Tensor Ring (BTR) factorization offers probabilistic estimates and an effective approach for automatically adapting the tensor ring rank during the learning process. However, previous BTR method employs an Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) prior, which can lead to sub-optimal solutions. Besides, it solely focuses on continuous data, whereas many applications involve discrete data. More importantly, it relies on the Coordinate-Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm, which is inadequate for handling large tensors with extensive observations. These limitations greatly limit its application scales and scopes, making it suitable only for small-scale problems, such as image/video completion. To address these issues, we propose a novel BTR model that incorporates a nonparametric Multiplicative Gamma Process (MGP) prior, known for its superior accuracy in identifying latent structures. To handle discrete data, we introduce the P\'olya-Gamma augmentation for closed-form updates. Furthermore, we develop an efficient Gibbs sampler for consistent posterior simulation, which reduces the computational complexity of previous VI algorithm by two orders, and an online EM algorithm that is scalable to extremely large tensors. To showcase the advantages of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on both simulation data and real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding travelers' route choices can help policymakers devise optimal operational and planning strategies for both normal and abnormal circumstances. However, existing choice modeling methods often rely on predefined assumptions and struggle to capture the dynamic and adaptive nature of travel behavior. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating remarkable ability to replicate human-like behaviors across various fields. Despite this potential, their capacity to accurately simulate human route choice behavior in transportation contexts remains doubtful. To satisfy this curiosity, this paper investigates the potential of LLMs for route choice modeling by introducing an LLM-empowered agent, "LLMTraveler." This agent integrates an LLM as its core, equipped with a memory system that learns from past experiences and makes decisions by balancing retrieved data and personality traits. The study systematically evaluates the LLMTraveler's ability to replicate human-like decision-making through two stages: (1) analyzing its route-switching behavior in single origin-destination (OD) pair congestion game scenarios, where it demonstrates patterns align with laboratory data but are not fully explained by traditional models, and (2) testing its capacity to model day-to-day (DTD) adaptive learning behaviors on the Ortuzar and Willumsen (OW) network, producing results comparable to Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) models. These experiments demonstrate that the framework can partially replicate human-like decision-making in route choice while providing natural language explanations for its decisions. This capability offers valuable insights for transportation policymaking, such as simulating traveler responses to new policies or changes in the network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. A. Ganaie, Vrushank Ahire</p>
<p>Abstract: Classification with support vector machines (SVM) often suffers from limited performance when relying solely on labeled data from target classes and is sensitive to noise and outliers. Incorporating prior knowledge from Universum data and more robust data representations can enhance accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel Granular Ball Twin Support Vector Machine with Universum Data (GBU-TSVM) that extends the TSVM framework to leverage both Universum samples and granular ball computing during model training. Unlike existing TSVM methods, the proposed GBU-TSVM represents data instances as hyper-balls rather than points in the feature space. This innovative approach improves the model's robustness and efficiency, particularly in handling noisy and large datasets. By grouping data points into granular balls, the model achieves superior computational efficiency, increased noise resistance, and enhanced interpretability. Additionally, the inclusion of Universum data, which consists of samples that are not strictly from the target classes, further refines the classification boundaries. This integration enriches the model with contextual information, refining classification boundaries and boosting overall accuracy. Experimental results on UCI benchmark datasets demonstrate that the GBU-TSVM outperforms existing TSVM models in both accuracy and computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of the GBU-TSVM model in setting a new standard in data representation and classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murat Sensoy, Lance M. Kaplan, Simon Julier, Maryam Saleki, Federico Cerutti</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous and semi-autonomous systems are using deep learning models to improve decision-making. However, deep classifiers can be overly confident in their incorrect predictions, a major issue especially in safety-critical domains. The present study introduces three foundational desiderata for developing real-world risk-aware classification systems. Expanding upon the previously proposed Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), we demonstrate the unity between these principles and EDL's operational attributes. We then augment EDL empowering autonomous agents to exercise discretion during structured decision-making when uncertainty and risks are inherent. We rigorously examine empirical scenarios to substantiate these theoretical innovations. In contrast to existing risk-aware classifiers, our proposed methodologies consistently exhibit superior performance, underscoring their transformative potential in risk-conscious classification strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takashi Furuya, Michael Puthawala, Maarten V. de Hoop, Matti Lassas</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of discretization of neural operators between Hilbert spaces in a general framework including skip connections. We focus on bijective neural operators through the lens of diffeomorphisms in infinite dimensions. Framed using category theory, we give a no-go theorem that shows that diffeomorphisms between Hilbert spaces or Hilbert manifolds may not admit any continuous approximations by diffeomorphisms on finite-dimensional spaces, even if the approximations are nonlinear. The natural way out is the introduction of strongly monotone diffeomorphisms and layerwise strongly monotone neural operators which have continuous approximations by strongly monotone diffeomorphisms on finite-dimensional spaces. For these, one can guarantee discretization invariance, while ensuring that finite-dimensional approximations converge not only as sequences of functions, but that their representations converge in a suitable sense as well. Finally, we show that bilipschitz neural operators may always be written in the form of an alternating composition of strongly monotone neural operators, plus a simple isometry. Thus we realize a rigorous platform for discretization of a generalization of a neural operator. We also show that neural operators of this type may be approximated through the composition of finite-rank residual neural operators, where each block is strongly monotone, and may be inverted locally via iteration. We conclude by providing a quantitative approximation result for the discretization of general bilipschitz neural operators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erkan Karabulut, Paul Groth, Victoria Degeler</p>
<p>Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of discovering commonalities in data in the form of logical implications. ARM is used in the Internet of Things (IoT) for different tasks including monitoring and decision-making. However, existing methods give limited consideration to IoT-specific requirements such as heterogeneity and volume. Furthermore, they do not utilize important static domain-specific description data about IoT systems, which is increasingly represented as knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel ARM pipeline for IoT data that utilizes both dynamic sensor data and static IoT system metadata. Furthermore, we propose an Autoencoder-based Neurosymbolic ARM method (Aerial) as part of the pipeline to address the high volume of IoT data and reduce the total number of rules that are resource-intensive to process. Aerial learns a neural representation of a given data and extracts association rules from this representation by exploiting the reconstruction (decoding) mechanism of an autoencoder. Extensive evaluations on 3 IoT datasets from 2 domains show that ARM on both static and dynamic IoT data results in more generically applicable rules while Aerial can learn a more concise set of high-quality association rules than the state-of-the-art with full coverage over the datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Christenson, Cove Geary, Brian Locke, Pranav Koirala, Warren Woodrich Pettine</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of precision medicine requires computational models that can effectively process and interpret diverse physiological signals across heterogeneous patient populations. While foundation models have demonstrated remarkable transfer capabilities across various domains, their effectiveness in handling individual-specific physiological signals - crucial for precision medicine - remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a systematic pipeline for rapidly and efficiently evaluating foundation models' transfer capabilities in medical contexts. Our pipeline employs a three-stage approach. First, it leverages physiological simulation software to generate diverse, clinically relevant scenarios, particularly focusing on data-scarce medical conditions. This simulation-based approach enables both targeted capability assessment and subsequent model fine-tuning. Second, the pipeline projects these simulated signals through the foundation model to obtain embeddings, which are then evaluated using linear methods. This evaluation quantifies the model's ability to capture three critical aspects: physiological feature independence, temporal dynamics preservation, and medical scenario differentiation. Finally, the pipeline validates these representations through specific downstream medical tasks. Initial testing of our pipeline on the Moirai time series foundation model revealed significant limitations in physiological signal processing, including feature entanglement, temporal dynamics distortion, and reduced scenario discrimination. These findings suggest that current foundation models may require substantial architectural modifications or targeted fine-tuning before deployment in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dung Thuy Nguyen, Ngoc N. Tran, Taylor T. Johnson, Kevin Leach</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rise of machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity has brought new challenges, including the increasing threat of backdoor poisoning attacks on ML malware classifiers. For instance, adversaries could inject malicious samples into public malware repositories, contaminating the training data and potentially misclassifying malware by the ML model. Current countermeasures predominantly focus on detecting poisoned samples by leveraging disagreements within the outputs of a diverse set of ensemble models on training data points. However, these methods are not suitable for scenarios where Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) is used or when users aim to remove backdoors from a model after it has been trained. Addressing this scenario, we introduce PBP, a post-training defense for malware classifiers that mitigates various types of backdoor embeddings without assuming any specific backdoor embedding mechanism. Our method exploits the influence of backdoor attacks on the activation distribution of neural networks, independent of the trigger-embedding method. In the presence of a backdoor attack, the activation distribution of each layer is distorted into a mixture of distributions. By regulating the statistics of the batch normalization layers, we can guide a backdoored model to perform similarly to a clean one. Our method demonstrates substantial advantages over several state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by experiments on two datasets, two types of backdoor methods, and various attack configurations. Notably, our approach requires only a small portion of the training data -- only 1\% -- to purify the backdoor and reduce the attack success rate from 100\% to almost 0\%, a 100-fold improvement over the baseline methods. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/judydnguyen/pbp-backdoor-purification-official}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Clinton Cao, Agathe Blaise, Annibale Panichella, Sicco Verwer</p>
<p>Abstract: Many works have studied the efficacy of state machines for detecting anomalies within NetFlows. These works typically learn a model from unlabeled data and compute anomaly scores for arbitrary traces based on their likelihood of occurrence or how well they fit within the model. However, these methods do not dynamically adapt their scores based on the traces seen at test time. This becomes a problem when an adversary produces seemingly common traces in their attack, causing the model to miss the detection by assigning low anomaly scores. We propose SEQUENT, a new approach that uses the state visit frequency to adapt its scoring for anomaly detection dynamically. SEQUENT subsequently uses the scores to generate root causes for anomalies. These allow the grouping of alarms and simplify the analysis of anomalies. Our evaluation of SEQUENT on three NetFlow datasets indicates that our approach outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting anomalies.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03471">Cluster Specific Representation Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahalakshmi Sabanayagam, Omar Al-Dabooni, Pascal Esser</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning aims to extract meaningful lower-dimensional embeddings from data, known as representations. Despite its widespread application, there is no established definition of a ``good'' representation. Typically, the representation quality is evaluated based on its performance in downstream tasks such as clustering, de-noising, etc. However, this task-specific approach has a limitation where a representation that performs well for one task may not necessarily be effective for another. This highlights the need for a more agnostic formulation, which is the focus of our work. We propose a downstream-agnostic formulation: when inherent clusters exist in the data, the representations should be specific to each cluster. Under this idea, we develop a meta-algorithm that jointly learns cluster-specific representations and cluster assignments. As our approach is easy to integrate with any representation learning framework, we demonstrate its effectiveness in various setups, including Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders, Contrastive learning models, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines. We qualitatively compare our cluster-specific embeddings to standard embeddings and downstream tasks such as de-noising and clustering. While our method slightly increases runtime and parameters compared to the standard model, the experiments clearly show that it extracts the inherent cluster structures in the data, resulting in improved performance in relevant applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Loukas Ilias, George Doukas, Vangelis Lamprou, Christos Ntanos, Dimitris Askounis</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of 6G/NextG networks comes along with a series of benefits, including extreme capacity, reliability, and efficiency. However, these networks may become vulnerable to new security threats. Therefore, 6G/NextG networks must be equipped with advanced Artificial Intelligence algorithms, in order to evade these attacks. Existing studies on the intrusion detection task rely on the train of shallow machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and so on, yielding suboptimal performance. Others are based on deep neural networks consisting of static components, which are not conditional on the input. This limits their representation power and efficiency. To resolve these issues, we present the first study integrating Mixture of Experts (MoE) for identifying malicious traffic. Specifically, we use network traffic data and convert the 1D array of features into a 2D matrix. Next, we pass this matrix through convolutional neural network (CNN) layers followed by batch normalization and max pooling layers. After obtaining the representation vector via the CNN layers, a sparsely gated MoE layer is used. This layer consists of a set of experts (dense layers) and a router, where the router assigns weights to the output of each expert. Sparsity is achieved by choosing the most relevant experts of the total ones. Finally, we perform a series of ablation experiments to prove the effectiveness of our proposed model. Experiments are conducted on the 5G-NIDD dataset, a network intrusion detection dataset generated from a real 5G test network. Results show that our introduced approach reaches weighted F1-score up to 99.95% achieving comparable performance to existing approaches. Findings also show that our proposed model achieves multiple advantages over state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neta Shaul, Itai Gat, Marton Havasi, Daniel Severo, Anuroop Sriram, Peter Holderrieth, Brian Karrer, Yaron Lipman, Ricky T. Q. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The design space of discrete-space diffusion or flow generative models are significantly less well-understood than their continuous-space counterparts, with many works focusing only on a simple masked construction. In this work, we aim to take a holistic approach to the construction of discrete generative models based on continuous-time Markov chains, and for the first time, allow the use of arbitrary discrete probability paths, or colloquially, corruption processes. Through the lens of optimizing the symmetric kinetic energy, we propose velocity formulas that can be applied to any given probability path, completely decoupling the probability and velocity, and giving the user the freedom to specify any desirable probability path based on expert knowledge specific to the data domain. Furthermore, we find that a special construction of mixture probability paths optimizes the symmetric kinetic energy for the discrete case. We empirically validate the usefulness of this new design space across multiple modalities: text generation, inorganic material generation, and image generation. We find that we can outperform the mask construction even in text with kinetic-optimal mixture paths, while we can make use of domain-specific constructions of the probability path over the visual domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Casey Lauer, Robert C. Blake, Jonathan B. Freund</p>
<p>Abstract: Trained neural networks (NN) are attractive as surrogate models to replace costly calculations in physical simulations, but are often unknowingly applied to states not adequately represented in the training dataset. We present the novel technique of soft checksums for scientific machine learning, a general-purpose method to differentiate between trustworthy predictions with small errors on in-distribution (ID) data points, and untrustworthy predictions with large errors on out-of-distribution (OOD) data points. By adding a check node to the existing output layer, we train the model to learn the chosen checksum function encoded within the NN predictions and show that violations of this function correlate with high prediction errors. As the checksum function depends only on the NN predictions, we can calculate the checksum error for any prediction with a single forward pass, incurring negligible time and memory costs. Additionally, we find that incorporating the checksum function into the loss function and exposing the NN to OOD data points during the training process improves separation between ID and OOD predictions. By applying soft checksums to a physically complex and high-dimensional non-local thermodynamic equilibrium atomic physics dataset, we show that a well-chosen threshold checksum error can effectively separate ID and OOD predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinheng Xie, Yue Wu, Cuiyu He</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding adversarial examples is crucial for improving the model's robustness, as they introduce imperceptible perturbations that deceive models. Effective adversarial examples, therefore, offer the potential to train more robust models by removing their singularities. We propose NODE-AdvGAN, a novel approach that treats adversarial generation as a continuous process and employs a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) for simulating the dynamics of the generator. By mimicking the iterative nature of traditional gradient-based methods, NODE-AdvGAN generates smoother and more precise perturbations that preserve high perceptual similarity when added to benign images. We also propose a new training strategy, NODE-AdvGAN-T, which enhances transferability in black-box attacks by effectively tuning noise parameters during training. Experiments demonstrate that NODE-AdvGAN and NODE-AdvGAN-T generate more effective adversarial examples that achieve higher attack success rates while preserving better perceptual quality than traditional GAN-based methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hands are the primary means through which humans interact with the world. Reliable and always-available hand pose inference could yield new and intuitive control schemes for human-computer interactions, particularly in virtual and augmented reality. Computer vision is effective but requires one or multiple cameras and can struggle with occlusions, limited field of view, and poor lighting. Wearable wrist-based surface electromyography (sEMG) presents a promising alternative as an always-available modality sensing muscle activities that drive hand motion. However, sEMG signals are strongly dependent on user anatomy and sensor placement, and existing sEMG models have required hundreds of users and device placements to effectively generalize. To facilitate progress on sEMG pose inference, we introduce the emg2pose benchmark, the largest publicly available dataset of high-quality hand pose labels and wrist sEMG recordings. emg2pose contains 2kHz, 16 channel sEMG and pose labels from a 26-camera motion capture rig for 193 users, 370 hours, and 29 stages with diverse gestures - a scale comparable to vision-based hand pose datasets. We provide competitive baselines and challenging tasks evaluating real-world generalization scenarios: held-out users, sensor placements, and stages. emg2pose provides the machine learning community a platform for exploring complex generalization problems, holding potential to significantly enhance the development of sEMG-based human-computer interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), like any transformative technology, has the potential to be a double-edged sword, leading either toward significant advancements or detrimental outcomes for society as a whole. As is often the case when it comes to widely-used technologies in market economies (e.g., cars and semiconductor chips), commercial interest tends to be the predominant guiding factor. The AI community is at risk of becoming polarized to either take a laissez-faire attitude toward AI development, or to call for government overregulation. Between these two poles we argue for the community of AI practitioners to consciously and proactively work for the common good. This paper offers a blueprint for a new type of innovation infrastructure including 18 concrete milestones to guide AI research in that direction. Our view is that we are still in the early days of practical AI, and focused efforts by practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders can still maximize the upsides of AI and minimize its downsides.
  We talked to luminaries such as recent Nobelist John Jumper on science, President Barack Obama on governance, former UN Ambassador and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice on security, philanthropist Eric Schmidt on several topics, and science fiction novelist Neal Stephenson on entertainment. This ongoing dialogue and collaborative effort has produced a comprehensive, realistic view of what the actual impact of AI could be, from a diverse assembly of thinkers with deep understanding of this technology and these domains. From these exchanges, five recurring guidelines emerged, which form the cornerstone of a framework for beginning to harness AI in service of the public good. They not only guide our efforts in discovery but also shape our approach to deploying this transformative technology responsibly and ethically.</p>

We also discussed the challenges of the dataset compilation and insights we learned from in-context learning and fine-tuning experiments. Besides the CPP-UT-Bench dataset and data compilation code, we are also offering the fine-tuned model weights for further research.

Our benchmark focuses on generating code for visualizing tabular data - such as a Pandas DataFrame - based on natural language instructions, complementing current evaluation tools and expanding their scope. The dataset includes 175 unique tasks. Our experiments assess several leading Large Language Models (LLMs) across three visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. We show that the shortening of tasks has a minimal effect on plotting capabilities, allowing for the user interface that accommodates concise user input without sacrificing functionality or accuracy. Another of our findings reveals that while LLMs perform well with popular libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, challenges persist with Plotly, highlighting areas for improvement. We hope that the modular design of our benchmark will broaden the current studies on generating visualizations.

<p>Abstract: In this study, we develop and assess new corpus selection and training methodologies to improve the effectiveness of Turkish language models. Specifically, we adapted Large Language Model generated datasets and translated English datasets into Turkish, integrating these resources into the training process. This approach led to substantial enhancements in model accuracy for both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. Furthermore, the merging of these adapted models was found to markedly improve their performance. Human evaluative metrics, including task-specific performance assessments, further demonstrated that these adapted models possess a greater aptitude for comprehending the Turkish language and addressing logic-based queries. This research underscores the importance of refining corpus selection strategies to optimize the performance of multilingual models, particularly for under-resourced languages like Turkish.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yury Demidovich, Petr Ostroukhov, Grigory Malinovsky, Samuel Horv\'ath, Martin Tak\'a\v{c}, Peter Richt\'arik, Eduard Gorbunov</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-convex Machine Learning problems typically do not adhere to the standard smoothness assumption. Based on empirical findings, Zhang et al. (2020b) proposed a more realistic generalized $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness assumption, though it remains largely unexplored. Many existing algorithms designed for standard smooth problems need to be revised. However, in the context of Federated Learning, only a few works address this problem but rely on additional limiting assumptions. In this paper, we address this gap in the literature: we propose and analyze new methods with local steps, partial participation of clients, and Random Reshuffling without extra restrictive assumptions beyond generalized smoothness. The proposed methods are based on the proper interplay between clients' and server's stepsizes and gradient clipping. Furthermore, we perform the first analysis of these methods under the Polyak-{\L} ojasiewicz condition. Our theory is consistent with the known results for standard smooth problems, and our experimental results support the theoretical insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikl\'os Z. R\'acz, Jifan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning latent community structure from multiple correlated networks, focusing on edge-correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities. Recent work of Gaudio, R\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022) determined the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using two correlated graphs; in particular, this showcased the subtle interplay between community recovery and graph matching. Here we study the natural setting of more than two graphs. The main challenge lies in understanding how to aggregate information across several graphs when none of the pairwise latent vertex correspondences can be exactly recovered. Our main result derives the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using any constant number of correlated graphs, answering a question of Gaudio, R\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022). In particular, for every $K \geq 3$ we uncover and characterize a region of the parameter space where exact community recovery is possible using $K$ correlated graphs, even though (1) this is information-theoretically impossible using any $K-1$ of them and (2) none of the latent matchings can be exactly recovered.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruikun Zhou, Yiming Meng, Zhexuan Zeng, Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Koopman operator theory has gained significant attention in recent years for identifying discrete-time nonlinear systems by embedding them into an infinite-dimensional linear vector space. However, providing stability guarantees while learning the continuous-time dynamics, especially under conditions of relatively low observation frequency, remains a challenge within the existing Koopman-based learning frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework to simultaneously learn the vector field and Lyapunov functions for unknown nonlinear systems, using a limited amount of data sampled across the state space and along the trajectories at a relatively low sampling frequency. The proposed framework builds upon recently developed high-accuracy Koopman generator learning for capturing transient system transitions and physics-informed neural networks for training Lyapunov functions. We show that the learned Lyapunov functions can be formally verified using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver and provide less conservative estimates of the region of attraction compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raphael Ruschel, Md Awsafur Rahman, Hardik Prajapati, Suya You, B. S. Manjuanth</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding video content is pivotal for advancing real-world applications like activity recognition, autonomous systems, and human-computer interaction. While scene graphs are adept at capturing spatial relationships between objects in individual frames, extending these representations to capture dynamic interactions across video sequences remains a significant challenge. To address this, we present TCDSG, Temporally Consistent Dynamic Scene Graphs, an innovative end-to-end framework that detects, tracks, and links subject-object relationships across time, generating action tracklets, temporally consistent sequences of entities and their interactions. Our approach leverages a novel bipartite matching mechanism, enhanced by adaptive decoder queries and feedback loops, ensuring temporal coherence and robust tracking over extended sequences. This method not only establishes a new benchmark by achieving over 60% improvement in temporal recall@k on the Action Genome, OpenPVSG, and MEVA datasets but also pioneers the augmentation of MEVA with persistent object ID annotations for comprehensive tracklet generation. By seamlessly integrating spatial and temporal dynamics, our work sets a new standard in multi-frame video analysis, opening new avenues for high-impact applications in surveillance, autonomous navigation, and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steve Hanneke, Mingyue Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The well-known empirical risk minimization (ERM) principle is the basis of many widely used machine learning algorithms, and plays an essential role in the classical PAC theory. A common description of a learning algorithm's performance is its so-called "learning curve", that is, the decay of the expected error as a function of the input sample size. As the PAC model fails to explain the behavior of learning curves, recent research has explored an alternative universal learning model and has ultimately revealed a distinction between optimal universal and uniform learning rates (Bousquet et al., 2021). However, a basic understanding of such differences with a particular focus on the ERM principle has yet to be developed.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of universal learning by ERM in the realizable case and study the possible universal rates. Our main result is a fundamental tetrachotomy: there are only four possible universal learning rates by ERM, namely, the learning curves of any concept class learnable by ERM decay either at $e^{-n}$, $1/n$, $\log(n)/n$, or arbitrarily slow rates. Moreover, we provide a complete characterization of which concept classes fall into each of these categories, via new complexity structures. We also develop new combinatorial dimensions which supply sharp asymptotically-valid constant factors for these rates, whenever possible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Som Sagar, Ransalu Senanayake</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite being trained on increasingly large datasets, robot models often overfit to specific environments or datasets. Consequently, they excel within their training distribution but face challenges in generalizing to novel or unforeseen scenarios. This paper presents a method to proactively identify failure mode probabilities in robot manipulation policies, providing insights into where these models are likely to falter. To this end, since exhaustively searching over a large space of failures is infeasible, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework, RoboFail. It is designed to detect scenarios prone to failure and quantify their likelihood, thus offering a structured approach to anticipate failures. By identifying these high-risk states in advance, RoboFail enables researchers and engineers to better understand the robustness limits of robot policies, contributing to the development of safer and more adaptable robotic systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Igor Halperin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present CAISSON, a novel hierarchical approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that transforms traditional single-vector search into a multi-view clustering framework. At its core, CAISSON leverages dual Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to create complementary organizational views of the document space, where each view captures different aspects of document relationships through specialized embeddings. The first view processes combined text and metadata embeddings, while the second operates on metadata enriched with concept embeddings, enabling a comprehensive multi-view analysis that captures both fine-grained semantic relationships and high-level conceptual patterns. This dual-view approach enables more nuanced document discovery by combining evidence from different organizational perspectives. To evaluate CAISSON, we develop SynFAQA, a framework for generating synthetic financial analyst notes and question-answer pairs that systematically tests different aspects of information retrieval capabilities. Drawing on HotPotQA's methodology for constructing multi-step reasoning questions, SynFAQA generates controlled test cases where each question is paired with the set of notes containing its ground-truth answer, progressing from simple single-entity queries to complex multi-hop retrieval tasks involving multiple entities and concepts. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over both basic and enhanced RAG implementations, particularly for complex multi-entity queries, while maintaining practical response times suitable for interactive applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Zawad Mahmud, Samiha Islam, Shahran Rahman Alve, Al Jubayer Pial</p>
<p>Abstract: An application of software known as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) employs machine algorithms to identify network intrusions. Selective logging, safeguarding privacy, reputation-based defense against numerous attacks, and dynamic response to threats are a few of the problems that intrusion identification is used to solve. The biological system known as IoT has seen a rapid increase in high dimensionality and information traffic. Self-protective mechanisms like intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are essential for defending against a variety of attacks. On the other hand, the functional and physical diversity of IoT IDS systems causes significant issues. These attributes make it troublesome and unrealistic to completely use all IoT elements and properties for IDS self-security. For peculiarity-based IDS, this study proposes and implements a novel component selection and extraction strategy (our strategy). A five-ML algorithm model-based IDS for machine learning-based networks with proper hyperparamater tuning is presented in this paper by examining how the most popular feature selection methods and classifiers are combined, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, Decision Tree (DT) Classifier, Random Forest (RF) Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Ada Boost Classifier. The Random Forest (RF) classifier had the highest accuracy of 99.39%. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier exhibited the lowest performance among the evaluated models, achieving an accuracy of 94.84%. This study's models have a significantly higher performance rate than those used in previous studies, indicating that they are more reliable.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a method for efficiently detecting objects within 3D point clouds using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our approach adopts a unique feature-centric voting mechanism to construct convolutional layers that capitalize on the typical sparsity observed in input data. We explore the trade-off between accuracy and speed across diverse network architectures and advocate for integrating an $\mathcal{L}_1$ penalty on filter activations to augment sparsity within intermediate layers. This research pioneers the proposal of sparse convolutional layers combined with $\mathcal{L}_1$ regularization to effectively handle large-scale 3D data processing. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated on the MVTec 3D-AD object detection benchmark. The Vote3Deep models, with just three layers, outperform the previous state-of-the-art in both laser-only approaches and combined laser-vision methods. Additionally, they maintain competitive processing speeds. This underscores our approach's capability to substantially enhance detection performance while ensuring computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Teterwak, Kuniaki Saito, Theodoros Tsiligkaridis, Bryan A. Plummer, Kate Saenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Source Domain Generalization (DG) is the task of training on multiple source domains and achieving high classification performance on unseen target domains. Recent methods combine robust features from web-scale pretrained backbones with new features learned from source data, and this has dramatically improved benchmark results. However, it remains unclear if DG finetuning methods are becoming better over time, or if improved benchmark performance is simply an artifact of stronger pre-training. Prior studies have shown that perceptual similarity to pre-training data correlates with zero-shot performance, but we find the effect limited in the DG setting. Instead, we posit that having perceptually similar data in pretraining is not enough; and that it is how well these data were learned that determines performance. This leads us to introduce the Alignment Hypothesis, which states that the final DG performance will be high if and only if alignment of image and class label text embeddings is high. Our experiments confirm the Alignment Hypothesis is true, and we use it as an analysis tool of existing DG methods evaluated on DomainBed datasets by splitting evaluation data into In-pretraining (IP) and Out-of-pretraining (OOP). We show that all evaluated DG methods struggle on DomainBed-OOP, while recent methods excel on DomainBed-IP. Put together, our findings highlight the need for DG methods which can generalize beyond pretraining alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the performance of the Thompson Sampling algorithm for logistic bandit problems, where the agent receives binary rewards with probabilities determined by a logistic function $\exp(\beta \langle a, \theta \rangle)/(1+\exp(\beta \langle a, \theta \rangle))$. We focus on the setting where the action $a$ and parameter $\theta$ lie within the $d$-dimensional unit ball with the action space encompassing the parameter space. Adopting the information-theoretic framework introduced by (Russo $\&$ Van Roy, 2015), we analyze the information ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the expected squared difference between the optimal and actual rewards to the mutual information between the optimal action and the reward. Improving upon previous results, we establish that the information ratio is bounded by $\tfrac{9}{2}d$. Notably, we obtain a regret bound in $O(d\sqrt{T \log(\beta T/d)})$ that depends only logarithmically on the parameter $\beta$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Nogueira Nobrega, Ewerton de Oliveira, Martin Saska, Tiago Nascimento</p>
<p>Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) is a growing area of research. In HRI, complex command (action) classification is still an open problem that usually prevents the real applicability of such a technique. The literature presents some works that use neural networks to detect these actions. However, occlusion is still a major issue in HRI, especially when using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), since, during the robot's movement, the human operator is often out of the robot's field of view. Furthermore, in multi-robot scenarios, distributed training is also an open problem. In this sense, this work proposes an action recognition and control approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Neural Networks with two layers in association with three densely connected layers and Federated Learning (FL) embedded in multiple drones. The FL enabled our approach to be trained in a distributed fashion, i.e., access to data without the need for cloud or other repositories, which facilitates the multi-robot system's learning. Furthermore, our multi-robot approach results also prevented occlusion situations, with experiments with real robots achieving an accuracy greater than 96%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung-Anh Dang, Vincent Nguyen, Ngoc-Son Vu, Christel Vrain</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has significantly improved representation quality, enhancing knowledge transfer across tasks in continual learning (CL). However, catastrophic forgetting remains a key challenge, as contrastive based methods primarily focus on "soft relationships" or "softness" between samples, which shift with changing data distributions and lead to representation overlap across tasks. Recently, the newly identified Neural Collapse phenomenon has shown promise in CL by focusing on "hard relationships" or "hardness" between samples and fixed prototypes. However, this approach overlooks "softness", crucial for capturing intra-class variability, and this rigid focus can also pull old class representations toward current ones, increasing forgetting. Building on these insights, we propose Focal Neural Collapse Contrastive (FNC2), a novel representation learning loss that effectively balances both soft and hard relationships. Additionally, we introduce the Hardness-Softness Distillation (HSD) loss to progressively preserve the knowledge gained from these relationships across tasks. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in minimizing memory reliance. Remarkably, even without the use of memory, our approach rivals rehearsal-based methods, offering a compelling solution for data privacy concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toufique Ahmed, Martin Hirzel, Rangeet Pan, Avraham Shinnar, Saurabh Sinha</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-driven development (TDD) is the practice of writing tests first and coding later, and the proponents of TDD expound its numerous benefits. For instance, given an issue on a source code repository, tests can clarify the desired behavior among stake-holders before anyone writes code for the agreed-upon fix. Although there has been a lot of work on automated test generation for the practice "write code first, test later", there has been little such automation for TDD. Ideally, tests for TDD should be fail-to-pass (i.e., fail before the issue is resolved and pass after) and have good adequacy with respect to covering the code changed during issue resolution. This paper introduces TDD-Bench Verified, a high-quality benchmark suite of 449 issues mined from real-world GitHub code repositories. The benchmark's evaluation harness runs only relevant tests in isolation for simple yet accurate coverage measurements, and the benchmark's dataset is filtered both by human judges and by execution in the harness. This paper also presents Auto-TDD, an LLM-based solution that takes as input an issue description and a codebase (prior to issue resolution) and returns as output a test that can be used to validate the changes made for resolving the issue. Our evaluation shows that Auto-TDD yields a better fail-to-pass rate than the strongest prior work while also yielding high coverage adequacy. Overall, we hope that this work helps make developers more productive at resolving issues while simultaneously leading to more robust fixes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vibujithan Vigneshwaran, Erik Ohara, Matthias Wilms, Nils Forkert</p>
<p>Abstract: Although deep learning techniques show promising results for many neuroimaging tasks in research settings, they have not yet found widespread use in clinical scenarios. One of the reasons for this problem is that many machine learning models only identify correlations between the input images and the outputs of interest, which can lead to many practical problems, such as encoding of uninformative biases and reduced explainability. Thus, recent research is exploring if integrating a priori causal knowledge into deep learning models is a potential avenue to identify these problems. This work introduces a new causal generative architecture named Masked Causal Flow (MACAW) for neuroimaging applications. Within this context, three main contributions are described. First, a novel approach that integrates complex causal structures into normalizing flows is proposed. Second, counterfactual prediction is performed to identify the changes in effect variables associated with a cause variable. Finally, an explicit Bayesian inference for classification is derived and implemented, providing an inherent uncertainty estimation. The feasibility of the proposed method was first evaluated using synthetic data and then using MRI brain data from more than 23000 participants of the UK biobank study. The evaluation results show that the proposed method can (1) accurately encode causal reasoning and generate counterfactuals highlighting the structural changes in the brain known to be associated with aging, (2) accurately predict a subject's age from a single 2D MRI slice, and (3) generate new samples assuming other values for subject-specific indicators such as age, sex, and body mass index.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranganath Krishnan, Piyush Khanna, Omesh Tickoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing with their impressive reasoning and question-answering capabilities. However, these models are sometimes prone to generating credible-sounding but incorrect information, a phenomenon known as LLM hallucinations. Reliable uncertainty estimation in LLMs is essential for fostering trust in their generated responses and serves as a critical tool for the detection and prevention of erroneous or hallucinated outputs. To achieve reliable and well-calibrated uncertainty quantification in open-ended and free-form natural language generation, we propose an uncertainty-aware fine-tuning approach for LLMs. This approach enhances the model's ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates without compromising accuracy, thereby guiding them to produce more trustworthy responses. We introduce a novel uncertainty-aware causal language modeling loss function, grounded in the principles of decision theory. Through rigorous evaluation on multiple free-form question-answering datasets and models, we demonstrate that our uncertainty-aware fine-tuning approach yields better calibrated uncertainty estimates in natural language generation tasks than fine-tuning with the standard causal language modeling loss. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the model's ability to detect hallucinations and identify out-of-domain prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides at code generation through improved model design, training, and chain-of-thought. However, prompt-level optimizations remain an important yet under-explored aspect of LLMs for coding. This work focuses on the few-shot examples present in most code generation prompts, offering a systematic study on whether few-shot examples improve LLM's coding capabilities, which few-shot examples have the largest impact, and how to select impactful examples. Our work offers 2 approaches for selecting few-shot examples, a model-free method, CODEEXEMPLAR-FREE, and a model-based method, CODEEXEMPLAR-BASED. The 2 methods offer a trade-off between improved performance and reliance on training data and interpretability. Both methods significantly improve CodeLlama's coding ability across the popular HumanEval+ coding benchmark. In summary, our work provides valuable insights into how to pick few-shot examples in code generation prompts to improve LLM code generation capabilities.</p>

Unlike conventional shape guidance methods that rely on depth maps restricted to fixed viewpoints and often overlook full 3D structure or textual context, ShapeWords generates diverse yet consistent images that reflect both the target shape's geometry and the textual description. Experimental results show that ShapeWords produces images that are more text-compliant, aesthetically plausible, while also maintaining 3D shape awareness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLM) have significantly enhanced their ability to comprehend visual inputs alongside natural language. However, a major challenge in their real-world application is hallucination, where LVLMs generate non-existent visual elements, eroding user trust. The underlying mechanism driving this multimodal hallucination is poorly understood. Minimal research has illuminated whether contexts such as sky, tree, or grass field involve the LVLM in hallucinating a frisbee. We hypothesize that hidden factors, such as objects, contexts, and semantic foreground-background structures, induce hallucination. This study proposes a novel causal approach: a hallucination probing system to identify these hidden factors. By analyzing the causality between images, text prompts, and network saliency, we systematically explore interventions to block these factors. Our experimental findings show that a straightforward technique based on our analysis can significantly reduce hallucinations. Additionally, our analyses indicate the potential to edit network internals to minimize hallucinated outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weisi Fan, Jesse Lane, Qisai Liu, Soumik Sarkar, Tichakorn Wongpiromsarn</p>
<p>Abstract: Perception components in autonomous systems are often developed and optimized independently of downstream decision-making and control components, relying on established performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Traditional loss functions, such as cross-entropy loss and negative log-likelihood, focus on reducing misclassification errors but fail to consider their impact on system-level safety, overlooking the varying severities of system-level failures caused by these errors. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training paradigm that augments the perception component with an understanding of system-level safety objectives. Central to our approach is the translation of system-level safety requirements, formally specified using the rulebook formalism, into safety scores. These scores are then incorporated into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning perception models with system-level safety objectives. Simulation results demonstrate that models trained with this approach outperform baseline perception models in terms of system-level safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Apurv Shukla, Debabrota Basu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the preference-based pure exploration problem for bandits with vector-valued rewards. The rewards are ordered using a (given) preference cone $\mathcal{C}$ and our the goal is to identify the set of Pareto optimal arms. First, to quantify the impact of preferences, we derive a novel lower bound on the sample complexity for identifying the most preferred policy with confidence level $1-\delta$. Our lower bound elicits the role played by the geometry of the preference cone and punctuates the difference in hardness compared to existing best-arm identification variants of the problem. We further explicate this geometry when rewards follow Gaussian distributions. We then provide a convex relaxation of the lower bound. and leverage it to design Preference-based Track and Stop (PreTS) algorithm that identifies the most preferred policy. Finally, we show that sample complexity of PreTS is asymptotically tight by deriving a new concentration inequality for vector-valued rewards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Li, Dongqi Fu, Hengyu Liu, Jingrui He</p>
<p>Abstract: Local clustering aims to find a compact cluster near the given starting instances. This work focuses on graph local clustering, which has broad applications beyond graphs because of the internal connectivities within various modalities. While most existing studies on local graph clustering adopt the discrete graph setting (i.e., unweighted graphs without self-loops), real-world graphs can be more complex. In this paper, we extend the non-approximating Andersen-Chung-Lang ("ACL") algorithm beyond discrete graphs and generalize its quadratic optimality to a wider range of graphs, including weighted, directed, and self-looped graphs and hypergraphs. Specifically, leveraging PageRank, we propose two algorithms: GeneralACL for graphs and HyperACL for hypergraphs. We theoretically prove that, under two mild conditions, both algorithms can identify a quadratically optimal local cluster in terms of conductance with at least 1/2 probability. On the property of hypergraphs, we address a fundamental gap in the literature by defining conductance for hypergraphs from the perspective of hypergraph random walks. Additionally, we provide experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Jiang, Zhen Fu, Junde Guo, Wei Zhang, Hua Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the whole-body loco-manipulation problem using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on the problem of how to coordinate the floating base and the robotic arm of a wheeled-quadrupedal manipulator robot to achieve direct six-dimensional (6D) end-effector (EE) pose tracking in task space. Different from conventional whole-body loco-manipulation problems that track both floating-base and end-effector commands, the direct EE pose tracking problem requires inherent balance among redundant degrees of freedom in the whole-body motion. We leverage RL to solve this challenging problem. To address the associated difficulties, we develop a novel reward fusion module (RFM) that systematically integrates reward terms corresponding to different tasks in a nonlinear manner. In such a way, the inherent multi-stage and hierarchical feature of the loco-manipulation problem can be carefully accommodated. By combining the proposed RFM with the a teacher-student RL training paradigm, we present a complete RL scheme to achieve 6D EE pose tracking for the wheeled-quadruped manipulator robot. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate the significance of the RFM. In particular, we enable smooth and precise tracking performance, achieving state-of-the-art tracking position error of less than 5 cm, and rotation error of less than 0.1 rad.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ignacio Puiggros T., A. Srikantha Phani</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been increasing interest in methodologies that incorporate physics priors into neural network architectures to enhance their modeling capabilities. A family of these methodologies that has gained traction are Hamiltonian neural networks (HNN) and their variations. These architectures explicitly encode Hamiltonian mechanics both in their structure and loss function. Although Hamiltonian systems under nonholonomic constraints are in general not Hamiltonian, it is possible to formulate them in pseudo-Hamiltonian form, equipped with a Lie bracket which is almost Poisson. This opens the possibility of using some principles of HNNs in systems under nonholonomic constraints. The goal of the present work is to develop a modified Hamiltonian neural network architecture capable of modeling Hamiltonian systems under holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. A three-network parallel architecture is proposed to simultaneously learn the Hamiltonian of the system, the constraints, and their associated multipliers. A rolling disk and a ball on a spinning table are considered as canonical examples to assess the performance of the proposed Hamiltonian architecture. The experiments are then repeated with a noisy training set to study modeling performance under more realistic conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liwei Deng, Tianfu Wang, Yan Zhao, Kai Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Portfolio management is an important yet challenging task in AI for FinTech, which aims to allocate investors' budgets among different assets to balance the risk and return of an investment. In this study, we propose a general Multi-objectIve framework with controLLable rIsk for pOrtfolio maNagement (MILLION), which consists of two main phases, i.e., return-related maximization and risk control. Specifically, in the return-related maximization phase, we introduce two auxiliary objectives, i.e., return rate prediction, and return rate ranking, combined with portfolio optimization to remit the overfitting problem and improve the generalization of the trained model to future markets. Subsequently, in the risk control phase, we propose two methods, i.e., portfolio interpolation and portfolio improvement, to achieve fine-grained risk control and fast risk adaption to a user-specified risk level. For the portfolio interpolation method, we theoretically prove that the risk can be perfectly controlled if the to-be-set risk level is in a proper interval. In addition, we also show that the return rate of the adjusted portfolio after portfolio interpolation is no less than that of the min-variance optimization, as long as the model in the reward maximization phase is effective. Furthermore, the portfolio improvement method can achieve greater return rates while keeping the same risk level compared to portfolio interpolation. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Point-GN, a novel non-parametric network for efficient and accurate 3D point cloud classification. Unlike conventional deep learning models that rely on a large number of trainable parameters, Point-GN leverages non-learnable components-specifically, Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Gaussian Positional Encoding (GPE)-to extract both local and global geometric features. This design eliminates the need for additional training while maintaining high performance, making Point-GN particularly suited for real-time, resource-constrained applications. We evaluate Point-GN on two benchmark datasets, ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, achieving classification accuracies of 85.29% and 85.89%, respectively, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Point-GN outperforms existing non-parametric methods and matches the performance of fully trained models, all with zero learnable parameters. Our results demonstrate that Point-GN is a promising solution for 3D point cloud classification in practical, real-time environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo Belli, Marco Mordacci, Michele Amoretti</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, scalable quantum neural networks are introduced to approximate unitary evolutions through the Standard Recursive Block Basis (SRBB) and, subsequently, redesigned with a reduced number of CNOTs. This algebraic approach to the problem of unitary synthesis exploits Lie algebras and their topological features to obtain scalable parameterizations of unitary operators. First, the recursive algorithm that builds the SRBB is presented, framed in the original scalability scheme already known to the literature only from a theoretical point of view. Unexpectedly, 2-qubit systems emerge as a special case outside this scheme. Furthermore, an algorithm to reduce the number of CNOTs is proposed, thus deriving a new implementable scaling scheme that requires one single layer of approximation. From the mathematical algorithm, the scalable CNOT-reduced quantum neural network is implemented and its performance is assessed with a variety of different unitary matrices, both sparse and dense, up to 6 qubits via the PennyLane library. The effectiveness of the approximation is measured with different metrics in relation to two optimizers: a gradient-based method and the Nelder-Mead method. The approximate SRBB-based synthesis algorithm with CNOT-reduction is also tested on real hardware and compared with other valid approximation and decomposition methods available in the literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajinkya Deshpande, Deep Gupta, Ankit Bhurane, Nisha Meshram, Sneha Singh, Petia Radeva</p>
<p>Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of liver cancer whose early-stage diagnosis is a common challenge, mainly due to the manual assessment of hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images, which is a time-consuming process and may lead to variability in decision-making. For accurate detection of HCC, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based architecture that uses transfer learning to extract the features from pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models and a classifier made up of a sequence of fully connected layers. This study uses a publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC)database (n=491) for model development and database of Kasturba Gandhi Medical College (KMC), India for validation. The pre-processing step involves patch extraction, colour normalization, and augmentation that results in 3920 patches for the TCGA dataset. The developed hybrid deep neural network consisting of a CNN-based pre-trained feature extractor and a customized artificial neural network-based classifier is trained using five-fold cross-validation. For this study, eight different state-of-the-art models are trained and tested as feature extractors for the proposed hybrid model. The proposed hybrid model with ResNet50-based feature extractor provided the sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC of 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, and 1.00, respectively on the TCGA database. On the KMC database, EfficientNetb3 resulted in the optimal choice of the feature extractor giving sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC of 96.97, 98.85, 96.71, 96.71, and 0.99, respectively. The proposed hybrid models showed improvement in accuracy of 2% and 4% over the pre-trained models in TCGA-LIHC and KMC databases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiyan Zhang, Haibo Jin, Leyang Hu, Xinnuo Li, Liying Kang, Man Luo, Yangqiu Song, Haohan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of LLM-based systems to perform complex tasks through natural language processing and tool interaction. However, optimizing these LLM-based systems for specific tasks remains challenging, often requiring manual interventions like prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning. Existing automatic optimization methods, such as textual feedback-based techniques (e.g., TextGrad), tend to focus on immediate feedback, analogous to using immediate derivatives in traditional numerical gradient descent. However, relying solely on such feedback can be limited when the adjustments made in response to this feedback are either too small or fluctuate irregularly, potentially slowing down or even stalling the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, more adaptive methods are needed, especially in situations where the system's response is evolving slowly or unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce REVOLVE, an optimization method that tracks how "R"esponses "EVOLVE" across iterations in LLM systems. By focusing on the evolution of responses over time, REVOLVE enables more stable and effective optimization by making thoughtful, progressive adjustments at each step. Experimental results demonstrate that REVOLVE outperforms competitive baselines, achieving a 7.8% improvement in prompt optimization, a 20.72% gain in solution refinement, and a 29.17% increase in code optimization. Additionally, REVOLVE converges in fewer iterations, resulting in significant computational savings. These advantages highlight its adaptability and efficiency, positioning REVOLVE as a valuable tool for optimizing LLM-based systems and accelerating the development of next-generation AI technologies.

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses key challenges in enhancing recommendation systems by leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and addressing inherent limitations such as over-smoothing, which reduces model effectiveness as network hierarchy deepens. The proposed approach introduces three GNN-based recommendation models, specifically designed to mitigate over-smoothing through innovative mechanisms like residual connections and identity mapping within the aggregation propagation process. These modifications enable more effective information flow across layers, preserving essential user-item interaction details to improve recommendation accuracy. Additionally, the study emphasizes the critical need for interpretability in recommendation systems, aiming to provide transparent and justifiable suggestions tailored to dynamic user preferences. By integrating collaborative filtering with GNN architectures, the proposed models not only enhance predictive accuracy but also align recommendations more closely with individual behaviors, adapting to nuanced shifts in user interests. This work advances the field by tackling both technical and user-centric challenges, contributing to the development of robust and explainable recommendation systems capable of managing the complexity and scale of modern online environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized various fields, yet its efficacy is hindered by overfitting and the requirement of extensive annotated data, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios where limited samples are available. This paper introduces a novel approach to few-shot learning by employing a Residual Weight Masking Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (RWM-CGAN) for data augmentation. The proposed model integrates residual units within the generator to enhance network depth and sample quality, coupled with a weight mask regularization technique in the discriminator to improve feature learning from small-sample categories. This method addresses the core issues of robustness and generalization in few-shot learning by providing a controlled and clear augmentation of the sample space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RWM-CGAN not only expands the sample space effectively but also enriches the diversity and quality of generated samples, leading to significant improvements in detection and classification accuracy on public datasets. The paper contributes to the advancement of few-shot learning by offering a practical solution to the challenges posed by data scarcity and the need for rapid generalization to new tasks or categories.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sinkhorn algorithm is the de-facto standard approximation algorithm for optimal transport, which has been applied to a variety of applications, including image processing and natural language processing. In theory, the proof of its convergence follows from the convergence of the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm for the matrix scaling problem, and Altschuler et al. show that its worst-case time complexity is in near-linear time. Very recently, sequentially composed optimal transports were proposed by Watanabe and Isobe as a hierarchical extension of optimal transports. In this paper, we present an efficient approximation algorithm, namely Sinkhorn algorithm for sequentially composed optimal transports, for its entropic regularization. Furthermore, we present a theoretical analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm, namely (i) its exponential convergence to the optimal solution with respect to the Hilbert pseudometric, and (ii) a worst-case complexity analysis for the case of one sequential composition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have become fundamental tools for modeling data distributions in machine learning and have applications in image generation, drug discovery, and audio synthesis. Despite their success, these models face challenges when generating data with extreme brightness values, as evidenced by limitations in widely used frameworks like Stable Diffusion. Offset noise has been proposed as an empirical solution to this issue, yet its theoretical basis remains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose a generalized diffusion model that naturally incorporates additional noise within a rigorous probabilistic framework. Our approach modifies both the forward and reverse diffusion processes, enabling inputs to be diffused into Gaussian distributions with arbitrary mean structures. We derive a loss function based on the evidence lower bound, establishing its theoretical equivalence to offset noise with certain adjustments, while broadening its applicability. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our model effectively addresses brightness-related challenges and outperforms conventional methods in high-dimensional scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of classifying trajectories on a discrete or discretised 2-dimensional manifold modelled by a simplicial complex. Previous works have proposed to project the trajectories into the harmonic eigenspace of the Hodge Laplacian, and then cluster the resulting embeddings. However, if the considered space has vanishing homology (i.e., no "holes"), then the harmonic space of the 1-Hodge Laplacian is trivial and thus the approach fails. Here we propose to view this issue akin to a sensor placement problem and present an algorithm that aims to learn "optimal holes" to distinguish a set of given trajectory classes. Specifically, given a set of labelled trajectories, which we interpret as edge-flows on the underlying simplicial complex, we search for 2-simplices whose deletion results in an optimal separation of the trajectory labels according to the corresponding spectral embedding of the trajectories into the harmonic space. Finally, we generalise this approach to the unsupervised setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting loan eligibility with high accuracy remains a significant challenge in the finance sector. Accurate predictions enable financial institutions to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and effectively adapt services to meet customer needs. However, the complexity and the high-dimensional nature of financial data have always posed significant challenges to achieving this level of precision. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel approach that employs Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for Loan Eligibility Prediction using Quantum Neural Networks (LEP-QNN).Our innovative approach achieves an accuracy of 98% in predicting loan eligibility from a single, comprehensive dataset. This performance boost is attributed to the strategic implementation of a dropout mechanism within the quantum circuit, aimed at minimizing overfitting and thereby improving the model's predictive reliability. In addition, our exploration of various optimizers leads to identifying the most efficient setup for our LEP-QNN framework, optimizing its performance. We also rigorously evaluate the resilience of LEP-QNN under different quantum noise scenarios, ensuring its robustness and dependability for quantum computing environments. This research showcases the potential of QML in financial predictions and establishes a foundational guide for advancing QML technologies, marking a step towards developing advanced, quantum-driven financial decision-making tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianni Franchi, Dat Nguyen Trong, Nacim Belkhir, Guoxuan Xia, Andrea Pilzer</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in text-to-image (T2I) generative models is crucial for understanding model behavior and improving output reliability. In this paper, we are the first to quantify and evaluate the uncertainty of T2I models with respect to the prompt. Alongside adapting existing approaches designed to measure uncertainty in the image space, we also introduce Prompt-based UNCertainty Estimation for T2I models (PUNC), a novel method leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to better address uncertainties arising from the semantics of the prompt and generated images. PUNC utilizes a LVLM to caption a generated image, and then compares the caption with the original prompt in the more semantically meaningful text space. PUNC also enables the disentanglement of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties via precision and recall, which image-space approaches are unable to do. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PUNC outperforms state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation techniques across various settings. Uncertainty quantification in text-to-image generation models can be used on various applications including bias detection, copyright protection, and OOD detection. We also introduce a comprehensive dataset of text prompts and generation pairs to foster further research in uncertainty quantification for generative models. Our findings illustrate that PUNC not only achieves competitive performance but also enables novel applications in evaluating and improving the trustworthiness of text-to-image models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingfei Deng, Changming Zhao, Zhenbang Du, Kun Xia, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) aims at training a high-performance model for a target domain using few labeled target data, many unlabeled target data, and plenty of auxiliary data from a source domain. Previous works in SSDA mainly focused on learning transferable representations across domains. However, it is difficult to find a feature space where the source and target domains share the same conditional probability distribution. Additionally, there is no flexible and effective strategy extending existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches to SSDA settings. In order to solve the above two challenges, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework, semi-supervised transfer boosting (SS-TrBoosting). Given a well-trained deep learning-based UDA or SSDA model, we use it as the initial model, generate additional base learners by boosting, and then use all of them as an ensemble. More specifically, half of the base learners are generated by supervised domain adaptation, and half by semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, for more efficient data transmission and better data privacy protection, we propose a source data generation approach to extend SS-TrBoosting to semi-supervised source-free domain adaptation (SS-SFDA). Extensive experiments showed that SS-TrBoosting can be applied to a variety of existing UDA, SSDA and SFDA approaches to further improve their performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gin\'es Carreto Pic\'on, Illia Oleksiienko, Lukas Hedegaard, Arian Bakhtiarnia, Alexandros Iosifidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers are widely used for their ability to capture data relations in sequence processing, with great success for a wide range of static tasks. However, the computational and memory footprint of their main component, i.e., the Scaled Dot-product Attention, is commonly overlooked. This makes their adoption in applications involving stream data processing with constraints in response latency, computational and memory resources infeasible. Some works have proposed methods to lower the computational cost of transformers, i.e. low-rank approximations, sparsity in attention, and efficient formulations for Continual Inference. In this paper, we introduce a new formulation of the Scaled Dot-product Attention based on the Nystr\"om approximation that is suitable for Continual Inference. In experiments on Online Audio Classification and Online Action Detection tasks, the proposed Continual Scaled Dot-product Attention can lower the number of operations by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the original Transformers while retaining the predictive performance of competing models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcin Przewi\k{e}\'zlikowski, Randall Balestriero, Wojciech Jasi\'nski, Marek \'Smieja, Bartosz Zieli\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a popular method for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) of visual representations. However, for high-level perception tasks, MIM-pretrained models offer lower out-of-the-box representation quality than the Joint-Embedding Architectures (JEA) - another prominent SSL paradigm. To understand this performance gap, we analyze the information flow in Vision Transformers (ViT) learned by both approaches. We reveal that whereas JEAs construct their representation on a selected set of relevant image fragments, MIM models aggregate nearly whole image content. Moreover, we demonstrate that MIM-trained ViTs retain valuable information within their patch tokens, which is not effectively captured by the global [cls] token representations. Therefore, selective aggregation of relevant patch tokens, without any fine-tuning, results in consistently higher-quality of MIM representations. To our knowledge, we are the first to highlight the lack of effective representation aggregation as an emergent issue of MIM and propose directions to address it, contributing to future advances in Self-Supervised Learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei Wang, Siyang Li, Jingwei Luo, Jiajing Liu, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: A brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the human brain and external devices. Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCIs are currently the most popular for able-bodied users. To increase user-friendliness, usually a small amount of user-specific EEG data are used for calibration, which may not be enough to develop a pure data-driven decoding model. To cope with this typical calibration data shortage challenge in EEG-based BCIs, this paper proposes a parameter-free channel reflection (CR) data augmentation approach that incorporates prior knowledge on the channel distributions of different BCI paradigms in data augmentation. Experiments on eight public EEG datasets across four different BCI paradigms (motor imagery, steady-state visual evoked potential, P300, and seizure classifications) using different decoding algorithms demonstrated that: 1) CR is effective, i.e., it can noticeably improve the classification accuracy; 2) CR is robust, i.e., it consistently outperforms existing data augmentation approaches in the literature; and, 3) CR is flexible, i.e., it can be combined with other data augmentation approaches to further increase the performance. We suggest that data augmentation approaches like CR should be an essential step in EEG-based BCIs. Our code is available online.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03238">Dynamic Consistent $k$-Center Clustering with Optimal Recourse</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Forster, Antonis Skarlatos</p>
<p>Abstract: Given points from an arbitrary metric space and a sequence of point updates sent by an adversary, what is the minimum recourse per update (i.e., the minimum number of changes needed to the set of centers after an update), in order to maintain a constant-factor approximation to a $k$-clustering problem? This question has received attention in recent years under the name consistent clustering.
  Previous works by Lattanzi and Vassilvitskii [ICLM '17] and Fichtenberger, Lattanzi, Norouzi-Fard, and Svensson [SODA '21] studied $k$-clustering objectives, including the $k$-center and the $k$-median objectives, under only point insertions. In this paper we study the $k$-center objective in the fully dynamic setting, where the update is either a point insertion or a point deletion. Before our work, {\L}\k{a}cki, Haeupler, Grunau, Rozho\v{n}, and Jayaram [SODA '24] gave a deterministic fully dynamic constant-factor approximation algorithm for the $k$-center objective with worst-case recourse of $2$ per update.
  In this work, we prove that the $k$-center clustering problem admits optimal recourse bounds by developing a deterministic fully dynamic constant-factor approximation algorithm with worst-case recourse of $1$ per update. Moreover our algorithm performs simple choices based on light data structures, and thus is arguably more direct and faster than the previous one which uses a sophisticated combinatorial structure. Additionally, we develop a new deterministic decremental algorithm and a new deterministic incremental algorithm, both of which maintain a $6$-approximate $k$-center solution with worst-case recourse of $1$ per update. Our incremental algorithm improves over the $8$-approximation algorithm by Charikar, Chekuri, Feder, and Motwani [STOC '97]. Finally, we remark that since all three of our algorithms are deterministic, they work against an adaptive adversary.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nozomu Masuya, Hiroshi Sato, Koki Yamane, Takuya Kusume, Sho Sakaino, Toshiaki Tsuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Because imitation learning relies on human demonstrations in hard-to-simulate settings, the inclusion of force control in this method has resulted in a shortage of training data, even with a simple change in speed. Although the field of data augmentation has addressed the lack of data, conventional methods of data augmentation for robot manipulation are limited to simulation-based methods or downsampling for position control. This paper proposes a novel method of data augmentation that is applicable to force control and preserves the advantages of real-world datasets. We applied teaching-playback at variable speeds as real-world data augmentation to increase both the quantity and quality of environmental reactions at variable speeds. An experiment was conducted on bilateral control-based imitation learning using a method of imitation learning equipped with position-force control. We evaluated the effect of real-world data augmentation on two tasks, pick-and-place and wiping, at variable speeds, each from two human demonstrations at fixed speed. The results showed a maximum 55% increase in success rate from a simple change in speed of real-world reactions and improved accuracy along the duration/frequency command by gathering environmental reactions at variable speeds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Schmidt, Markus Enzweiler, Abhinav Valada</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigating outdoor environments with visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems poses significant challenges due to dynamic scenes, lighting variations, and seasonal changes, requiring robust solutions. While traditional SLAM methods struggle with adaptability, deep learning-based approaches and emerging neural radiance fields as well as Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM methods, offer promising alternatives. However, these methods have primarily been evaluated in controlled indoor environments with stable conditions, leaving a gap in understanding their performance in unstructured and variable outdoor settings. This study addresses this gap by evaluating these methods in natural outdoor environments, focusing on camera tracking accuracy, robustness to environmental factors, and computational efficiency, highlighting distinct trade-offs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that neural SLAM methods achieve superior robustness, particularly under challenging conditions such as low light, but at a high computational cost. At the same time, traditional methods perform the best across seasons but are highly sensitive to variations in lighting conditions.

<p>Abstract: Neural Jump ODEs model the conditional expectation between observations by neural ODEs and jump at arrival of new observations. They have demonstrated effectiveness for fully data-driven online forecasting in settings with irregular and partial observations, operating under weak regularity assumptions. This work extends the framework to input-output systems, enabling direct applications in online filtering and classification. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for this approach, providing a robust solution to $L^2$-optimal filtering. Empirical experiments highlight the model's superior performance over classical parametric methods, particularly in scenarios with complex underlying distributions. These results emphasise the approach's potential in time-sensitive domains such as finance and health monitoring, where real-time accuracy is crucial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sam A. Scivier, Tarje Nissen-Meyer, Paula Koelemeijer, At{\i}l{\i}m G\"une\c{s} Baydin</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimates of seismic wave speeds in the Earth (seismic velocity models) are key input parameters to earthquake simulations for ground motion prediction. Owing to the non-uniqueness of the seismic inverse problem, typically many velocity models exist for any given region. The arbitrary choice of which velocity model to use in earthquake simulations impacts ground motion predictions. However, current hazard analysis methods do not account for this source of uncertainty. We present a proof-of-concept ground motion prediction workflow for incorporating uncertainties arising from inconsistencies between existing seismic velocity models. Our analysis is based on the probabilistic fusion of overlapping seismic velocity models using scalable Gaussian process (GP) regression. Specifically, we fit a GP to two synthetic 1-D velocity profiles simultaneously, and show that the predictive uncertainty accounts for the differences between the models. We subsequently draw velocity model samples from the predictive distribution and estimate peak ground displacement using acoustic wave propagation through the velocity models. The resulting distribution of possible ground motion amplitudes is much wider than would be predicted by simulating shaking using only the two input velocity models. This proof-of-concept illustrates the importance of probabilistic methods for physics-based seismic hazard analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiaoqiao Ren, Remko Proesmans, Frederick Bossuyt, Jan Vanfleteren, Francis Wyffels, Tony Belpaeme</p>
<p>Abstract: Human emotions can be conveyed through nuanced touch gestures. However, there is a lack of understanding of how consistently emotions can be conveyed to robots through touch. This study explores the consistency of touch-based emotional expression toward a robot by integrating tactile and auditory sensory reading of affective haptic expressions. We developed a piezoresistive pressure sensor and used a microphone to mimic touch and sound channels, respectively. In a study with 28 participants, each conveyed 10 emotions to a robot using spontaneous touch gestures. Our findings reveal a statistically significant consistency in emotion expression among participants. However, some emotions obtained low intraclass correlation values. Additionally, certain emotions with similar levels of arousal or valence did not exhibit significant differences in the way they were conveyed. We subsequently constructed a multi-modal integrating touch and audio features to decode the 10 emotions. A support vector machine (SVM) model demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving 40% for 10 classes, with "Attention" being the most accurately conveyed emotion at a balanced accuracy of 87.65%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Fu, Bill Moran, Jos\'e Ni\~no-Mora</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a system with finitely many groups of multi-action bandit processes, each of which is a Markov decision process (MDP) with finite state and action spaces and potentially different transition matrices when taking different actions. The bandit processes of the same group share the same state and action spaces and, given the same action that is taken, the same transition matrix. All the bandit processes across various groups are subject to multiple weakly coupled constraints over their state and action variables. Unlike the past studies that focused on the offline case, we consider the online case without assuming full knowledge of transition matrices and reward functions a priori and propose an effective scheme that enables simultaneous learning and control. We prove the convergence of the relevant processes in both the timeline and the number of the bandit processes, referred to as the convergence in the time and the magnitude dimensions. Moreover, we prove that the relevant processes converge exponentially fast in the magnitude dimension, leading to exponentially diminishing performance deviation between the proposed online algorithms and offline optimality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karthik C. S., Euiwoong Lee, Yuval Rabani, Chris Schwiegelshohn, Samson Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering problem is to partition an input set into clusters $C_1,\ldots,C_k$ to minimize $\sum_{i=1}^k\sum_{p,q\in C_i}\|p-q\|_2^2$. Although $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering is NP-hard, it is not known whether it is NP-hard to approximate $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering beyond a certain factor.
  In this paper, we give the first hardness-of-approximation result for the $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering problem. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the objective to a factor better than $1.056$ and moreover, assuming a balanced variant of the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis, it is NP-hard to approximate the objective to a factor better than 1.327.
  We then complement our hardness result by giving the first $(1+\varepsilon)$-coreset construction for $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering. Our coreset uses $\mathcal{O}\left(k^{\varepsilon^{-4}}\right)$ space and can be leveraged to achieve a polynomial-time approximation scheme with runtime $nd\cdot f(k,\varepsilon^{-1})$, where $d$ is the underlying dimension of the input dataset and $f$ is a fixed function.
  Finally, we consider a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to an oracle that outputs a label $i\in[k]$ for input point, thereby implicitly partitioning the input dataset into $k$ clusters that induce an approximately optimal solution, up to some amount of adversarial error $\alpha\in\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$. We give a polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a $\frac{1+\gamma\alpha}{(1-\alpha)^2}$-approximation to $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering, for a fixed constant $\gamma>0$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Winston Fu, Dax Enshan Koh, Siong Thye Goh, Jian Feng Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: The classical shadows protocol, introduced by Huang et al. [Nat. Phys. 16, 1050 (2020)], makes use of the median-of-means (MoM) estimator to efficiently estimate the expectation values of $M$ observables with failure probability $\delta$ using only $\mathcal{O}(\log(M/\delta))$ measurements. In their analysis, Huang et al. used loose constants in their asymptotic performance bounds for simplicity. However, the specific values of these constants can significantly affect the number of shots used in practical implementations. To address this, we studied a modified MoM estimator proposed by Minsker [PMLR 195, 5925 (2023)] that uses optimal constants and involves a U-statistic over the data set. For efficient estimation, we implemented two types of incomplete U-statistics estimators, the first based on random sampling and the second based on cyclically permuted sampling. We compared the performance of the original and modified estimators when used with the classical shadows protocol with single-qubit Clifford unitaries (Pauli measurements) for an Ising spin chain, and global Clifford unitaries (Clifford measurements) for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. While the original estimator outperformed the modified estimators for Pauli measurements, the modified estimators showed improved performance over the original estimator for Clifford measurements. Our findings highlight the importance of tailoring estimators to specific measurement settings to optimize the performance of the classical shadows protocol in practical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deploying a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) pipeline across the computing continuum (CC) requires careful organization of participants into a hierarchical structure with intermediate aggregation nodes between FL clients and the global FL server. This is challenging to achieve due to (i) cost constraints, (ii) varying data distributions, and (iii) the volatile operating environment of the CC. In response to these challenges, we present a framework for the adaptive orchestration of HFL pipelines, designed to be reactive to client churn and infrastructure-level events, while balancing communication cost and ML model accuracy. Our mechanisms identify and react to events that cause HFL reconfiguration actions at runtime, building on multi-level monitoring information (model accuracy, resource availability, resource cost). Moreover, our framework introduces a generic methodology for estimating reconfiguration costs to continuously re-evaluate the quality of adaptation actions, while being extensible to optimize for various HFL performance criteria. By extending the Kubernetes ecosystem, our framework demonstrates the ability to react promptly and effectively to changes in the operating environment, making the best of the available communication cost budget and effectively balancing costs and ML performance at runtime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Li, Ziya Zhou, Zhiqiang Wang, Wei Xue, Wenhan Luo, Yike Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have significantly enhanced talking face video generation, yet singing video generation remains underexplored. The differences between human talking and singing limit the performance of existing talking face video generation models when applied to singing. The fundamental differences between talking and singing-specifically in audio characteristics and behavioral expressions-limit the effectiveness of existing models. We observe that the differences between singing and talking audios manifest in terms of frequency and amplitude. To address this, we have designed a multi-scale spectral module to help the model learn singing patterns in the spectral domain. Additionally, we develop a spectral-filtering module that aids the model in learning the human behaviors associated with singing audio. These two modules are integrated into the diffusion model to enhance singing video generation performance, resulting in our proposed model, SINGER. Furthermore, the lack of high-quality real-world singing face videos has hindered the development of the singing video generation community. To address this gap, we have collected an in-the-wild audio-visual singing dataset to facilitate research in this area. Our experiments demonstrate that SINGER is capable of generating vivid singing videos and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective and subjective evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna van Elst, Debarghya Ghoshdastidar</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive representation learning is a modern paradigm for learning representations of unlabeled data via augmentations -- precisely, contrastive models learn to embed semantically similar pairs of samples (positive pairs) closer than independently drawn samples (negative samples). In spite of its empirical success and widespread use in foundation models, statistical theory for contrastive learning remains less explored. Recent works have developed generalization error bounds for contrastive losses, but the resulting risk certificates are either vacuous (certificates based on Rademacher complexity or $f$-divergence) or require strong assumptions about samples that are unreasonable in practice. The present paper develops non-vacuous PAC-Bayesian risk certificates for contrastive representation learning, considering the practical considerations of the popular SimCLR framework. Notably, we take into account that SimCLR reuses positive pairs of augmented data as negative samples for other data, thereby inducing strong dependence and making classical PAC or PAC-Bayesian bounds inapplicable. We further refine existing bounds on the downstream classification loss by incorporating SimCLR-specific factors, including data augmentation and temperature scaling, and derive risk certificates for the contrastive zero-one risk. The resulting bounds for contrastive loss and downstream prediction are much tighter than those of previous risk certificates, as demonstrated by experiments on CIFAR-10.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adequately generating and evaluating prediction models based on supervised machine learning (ML) is often challenging, especially for less experienced users in applied research areas. Special attention is required in settings where the model generation process involves hyperparameter tuning, i.e. data-driven optimization of different types of hyperparameters to improve the predictive performance of the resulting model. Discussions about tuning typically focus on the hyperparameters of the ML algorithm (e.g., the minimum number of observations in each terminal node for a tree-based algorithm). In this context, it is often neglected that hyperparameters also exist for the preprocessing steps that are applied to the data before it is provided to the algorithm (e.g., how to handle missing feature values in the data). As a consequence, users experimenting with different preprocessing options to improve model performance may be unaware that this constitutes a form of hyperparameter tuning - albeit informal and unsystematic - and thus may fail to report or account for this optimization. To illuminate this issue, this paper reviews and empirically illustrates different procedures for generating and evaluating prediction models, explicitly addressing the different ways algorithm and preprocessing hyperparameters are typically handled by applied ML users. By highlighting potential pitfalls, especially those that may lead to exaggerated performance claims, this review aims to further improve the quality of predictive modeling in ML applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics pervade the natural sciences, from the morphogen dynamics underlying patterning in animal pigmentation to the protein waves controlling cell division. A central challenge lies in understanding how controllable parameters induce qualitative changes in system behavior called bifurcations. This endeavor is made particularly difficult in realistic settings where governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are unknown and data is limited and noisy. To address this challenge, we propose TRENDy (Temporal Regression of Effective Nonlinear Dynamics), an equation-free approach to learning low-dimensional, predictive models of spatiotemporal dynamics. Following classical work in spatial coarse-graining, TRENDy first maps input data to a low-dimensional space of effective dynamics via a cascade of multiscale filtering operations. Our key insight is the recognition that these effective dynamics can be fit by a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) having the same parameter space as the input PDE. The preceding filtering operations strongly regularize the phase space of the NODE, making TRENDy significantly more robust to noise compared to existing methods. We train TRENDy to predict the effective dynamics of synthetic and real data representing dynamics from across the physical and life sciences. We then demonstrate how our framework can automatically locate both Turing and Hopf bifurcations in unseen regions of parameter space. We finally apply our method to the analysis of spatial patterning of the ocellated lizard through development. We found that TRENDy's effective state not only accurately predicts spatial changes over time but also identifies distinct pattern features unique to different anatomical regions, highlighting the potential influence of surface geometry on reaction-diffusion mechanisms and their role in driving spatially varying pattern dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Proma Hossain Progga, Md. Jobayer Rahman, Swapnil Biswas, Md. Shakil Ahmed, Arif Reza Anwary, Swakkhar Shatabda</p>
<p>Abstract: Gait recognition is a significant biometric technique for person identification, particularly in scenarios where other physiological biometrics are impractical or ineffective. In this paper, we address the challenges associated with gait recognition and present a novel approach to improve its accuracy and reliability. The proposed method leverages advanced techniques, including sequential gait landmarks obtained through the Mediapipe pose estimation model, Procrustes analysis for alignment, and a Siamese biGRU-dualStack Neural Network architecture for capturing temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments were conducted on large-scale cross-view datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving high recognition accuracy compared to other models. The model demonstrated accuracies of 95.7%, 94.44%, 87.71%, and 86.6% on CASIA-B, SZU RGB-D, OU-MVLP, and Gait3D datasets respectively. The results highlight the potential applications of the proposed method in various practical domains, indicating its significant contribution to the field of gait recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Gao, Quanjun Lang, Fei Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The construction of loss functions presents a major challenge in data-driven modeling involving weak-form operators in PDEs and gradient flows, particularly due to the need to select test functions appropriately. We address this challenge by introducing self-test loss functions, which employ test functions that depend on the unknown parameters, specifically for cases where the operator depends linearly on the unknowns. The proposed self-test loss function conserves energy for gradient flows and coincides with the expected log-likelihood ratio for stochastic differential equations. Importantly, it is quadratic, facilitating theoretical analysis of identifiability and well-posedness of the inverse problem, while also leading to efficient parametric or nonparametric regression algorithms. It is computationally simple, requiring only low-order derivatives or even being entirely derivative-free, and numerical experiments demonstrate its robustness against noisy and discrete data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuei-Chun Kao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, CLIP has emerged as a valuable model for aligning image and text information in multi-modal scenarios. However, researchers have observed limitations in the ability of CLIP's text and image encoders to extract detailed knowledge from caption-image pairs. In response, this paper introduces KKLIP, a novel approach designed to enhance the quality of CLIP by incorporating a new knowledge distillation (KD) method derived from Llama 2. Our method comprises three objectives: Text Embedding Distillation, Concept Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Firstly, Text Embedding Distillation involves training the KKLIP text encoder to emulate the teacher model, Llama 2. Secondly, Concept Learning assigns a soft concept label to each caption-image pair through offline k-means clustering of text information from Llama 2, allowing KKLIP to learn from these soft concept labels. Finally, Contrastive Learning harmonizes text and image embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that KKLIP enhances the quality of both text and image encoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Urjitkumar Patel, Fang-Chun Yeh, Chinmay Gondhalekar, Hari Nalluri</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving financial sector, the accurate and timely interpretation of market news is essential for stakeholders needing to navigate unpredictable events. This paper introduces FANAL (Financial Activity News Alerting Language Modeling Framework), a specialized BERT-based framework engineered for real-time financial event detection and analysis, categorizing news into twelve distinct financial categories. FANAL leverages silver-labeled data processed through XGBoost and employs advanced fine-tuning techniques, alongside ORBERT (Odds Ratio BERT), a novel variant of BERT fine-tuned with ORPO (Odds Ratio Preference Optimization) for superior class-wise probability calibration and alignment with financial event relevance. We evaluate FANAL's performance against leading large language models, including GPT-4o, Llama-3.1 8B, and Phi-3, demonstrating its superior accuracy and cost efficiency. This framework sets a new standard for financial intelligence and responsiveness, significantly outstripping existing models in both performance and affordability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Lino Garcia, Jo\~ao Renato Ribeiro Manesco, Pedro Henrique Paiola, Lucas Miranda, Maria Paola de Salvo, Jo\~ao Paulo Papa</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new boundaries in the extraction and synthesis of medical knowledge, particularly within evidence synthesis. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art applications of LLMs in the biomedical domain, exploring their effectiveness in automating complex tasks such as evidence synthesis and data extraction from a biomedical corpus of documents. While LLMs demonstrate remarkable potential, significant challenges remain, including issues related to hallucinations, contextual understanding, and the ability to generalize across diverse medical tasks. We highlight critical gaps in the current research literature, particularly the need for unified benchmarks to standardize evaluations and ensure reliability in real-world applications. In addition, we propose directions for future research, emphasizing the integration of state-of-the-art techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLM performance in evidence synthesis. By addressing these challenges and utilizing the strengths of LLMs, we aim to improve access to medical literature and facilitate meaningful discoveries in healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Natalie Mackraz, Nivedha Sivakumar, Samira Khorshidi, Krishna Patel, Barry-John Theobald, Luca Zappella, Nicholas Apostoloff</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adapted to achieve task-specificity for deployment in real-world decision systems. Several previous works have investigated the bias transfer hypothesis (BTH) by studying the effect of the fine-tuning adaptation strategy on model fairness to find that fairness in pre-trained masked language models have limited effect on the fairness of models when adapted using fine-tuning. In this work, we expand the study of BTH to causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an accessible, and compute-efficient way to deploy models in real-world systems. In contrast to previous works, we establish that intrinsic biases in pre-trained Mistral, Falcon and Llama models are strongly correlated (rho >= 0.94) with biases when the same models are zero- and few-shot prompted, using a pronoun co-reference resolution task. Further, we find that bias transfer remains strongly correlated even when LLMs are specifically prompted to exhibit fair or biased behavior (rho >= 0.92), and few-shot length and stereotypical composition are varied (rho >= 0.97). Our findings highlight the importance of ensuring fairness in pre-trained LLMs, especially when they are later used to perform downstream tasks via prompt adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahtab Bigverdi, Zelun Luo, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Ethan Shen, Dongping Chen, Linda G. Shapiro, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) still face challenges in fundamental visual perception tasks where specialized models excel. Tasks requiring reasoning about 3D structures benefit from depth estimation, and reasoning about 2D object instances benefits from object detection. Yet, MLMs can not produce intermediate depth or boxes to reason over. Finetuning MLMs on relevant data doesn't generalize well and outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools is too compute-intensive and memory-inefficient. To address this, we introduce Perception Tokens, intrinsic image representations designed to assist reasoning tasks where language is insufficient. Perception tokens act as auxiliary reasoning tokens, akin to chain-of-thought prompts in language models. For example, in a depth-related task, an MLM augmented with perception tokens can reason by generating a depth map as tokens, enabling it to solve the problem effectively. We propose AURORA, a training method that augments MLMs with perception tokens for improved reasoning over visual inputs. AURORA leverages a VQVAE to transform intermediate image representations, such as depth maps into a tokenized format and bounding box tokens, which is then used in a multi-task training framework. AURORA achieves notable improvements across counting benchmarks: +10.8% on BLINK, +11.3% on CVBench, and +8.3% on SEED-Bench, outperforming finetuning approaches in generalization across datasets. It also improves on relative depth: over +6% on BLINK. With perception tokens, AURORA expands the scope of MLMs beyond language-based reasoning, paving the way for more effective visual reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Hughes, Sara Price, Aengus Lynch, Rylan Schaeffer, Fazl Barez, Sanmi Koyejo, Henry Sleight, Erik Jones, Ethan Perez, Mrinank Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Best-of-N (BoN) Jailbreaking, a simple black-box algorithm that jailbreaks frontier AI systems across modalities. BoN Jailbreaking works by repeatedly sampling variations of a prompt with a combination of augmentations - such as random shuffling or capitalization for textual prompts - until a harmful response is elicited. We find that BoN Jailbreaking achieves high attack success rates (ASRs) on closed-source language models, such as 89% on GPT-4o and 78% on Claude 3.5 Sonnet when sampling 10,000 augmented prompts. Further, it is similarly effective at circumventing state-of-the-art open-source defenses like circuit breakers. BoN also seamlessly extends to other modalities: it jailbreaks vision language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and audio language models (ALMs) like Gemini 1.5 Pro, using modality-specific augmentations. BoN reliably improves when we sample more augmented prompts. Across all modalities, ASR, as a function of the number of samples (N), empirically follows power-law-like behavior for many orders of magnitude. BoN Jailbreaking can also be composed with other black-box algorithms for even more effective attacks - combining BoN with an optimized prefix attack achieves up to a 35% increase in ASR. Overall, our work indicates that, despite their capability, language models are sensitive to seemingly innocuous changes to inputs, which attackers can exploit across modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Bar, Gaoyue Zhou, Danny Tran, Trevor Darrell, Yann LeCun</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental skill of agents with visual-motor capabilities. We introduce a Navigation World Model (NWM), a controllable video generation model that predicts future visual observations based on past observations and navigation actions. To capture complex environment dynamics, NWM employs a Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), trained on a diverse collection of egocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, and scaled up to 1 billion parameters. In familiar environments, NWM can plan navigation trajectories by simulating them and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal. Unlike supervised navigation policies with fixed behavior, NWM can dynamically incorporate constraints during planning. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in planning trajectories from scratch or by ranking trajectories sampled from an external policy. Furthermore, NWM leverages its learned visual priors to imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input image, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pulkit Gopalani, Sayar Karmakar, Dibyakanti Kumar, Anirbit Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent times machine learning methods have made significant advances in becoming a useful tool for analyzing physical systems. A particularly active area in this theme has been "physics-informed machine learning" which focuses on using neural nets for numerically solving differential equations. In this work, we aim to advance the theory of measuring out-of-sample error while training DeepONets - which is among the most versatile ways to solve P.D.E systems in one-shot. Firstly, for a class of DeepONets, we prove a bound on their Rademacher complexity which does not explicitly scale with the width of the nets involved. Secondly, we use this to show how the Huber loss can be chosen so that for these DeepONet classes generalization error bounds can be obtained that have no explicit dependence on the size of the nets. The effective capacity measure for DeepONets that we thus derive is also shown to correlate with the behavior of generalization error in experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ponkrshnan Thiagarajan, Susanta Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are state-of-the-art machine learning methods that can naturally regularize and systematically quantify uncertainties using their stochastic parameters. Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based variational inference used in BNNs suffers from unstable optimization and challenges in approximating light-tailed posteriors due to the unbounded nature of the KL divergence. To resolve these issues, we formulate a novel loss function for BNNs based on a new modification to the generalized Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence, which is bounded. In addition, we propose a Geometric JS divergence-based loss, which is computationally efficient since it can be evaluated analytically. We found that the JS divergence-based variational inference is intractable, and hence employed a constrained optimization framework to formulate these losses. Our theoretical analysis and empirical experiments on multiple regression and classification data sets suggest that the proposed losses perform better than the KL divergence-based loss, especially when the data sets are noisy or biased. Specifically, there are approximately 5% and 8% improvements in accuracy for a noise-added CIFAR-10 dataset and a regression dataset, respectively. There is about a 13% reduction in false negative predictions of a biased histopathology dataset. In addition, we quantify and compare the uncertainty metrics for the regression and classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Distance-based supervised method, the minimal learning machine, constructs a predictive model from data by learning a mapping between input and output distance matrices. In this paper, we propose new methods and evaluate how their core component, the distance mapping, can be adapted to multi-label learning. The proposed approach is based on combining the distance mapping with an inverse distance weighting. Although the proposal is one of the simplest methods in the multi-label learning literature, it achieves state-of-the-art performance for small to moderate-sized multi-label learning problems. In addition to its simplicity, the proposed method is fully deterministic: Its hyper-parameter can be selected via ranking loss-based statistic which has a closed form, thus avoiding conventional cross-validation-based hyper-parameter tuning. In addition, due to its simple linear distance mapping-based construction, we demonstrate that the proposed method can assess the uncertainty of the predictions for multi-label classification, which is a valuable capability for data-centric machine learning pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study confronts the growing challenges of energy consumption and the depletion of energy resources, particularly in the context of smart buildings. As the demand for energy increases alongside the necessity for efficient building maintenance, it becomes imperative to explore innovative energy management solutions. We present a comprehensive review of Internet of Things (IoT)-based frameworks aimed at smart city energy management, highlighting the pivotal role of IoT devices in addressing these issues due to their compactness, sensing, measurement, and computing capabilities. Our review methodology encompasses a thorough analysis of existing literature on IoT architectures and frameworks for intelligent energy management applications. We focus on systems that not only collect and store data but also support intelligent analysis for monitoring, controlling, and enhancing system efficiency. Additionally, we examine the potential for these frameworks to serve as platforms for the development of third-party applications, thereby extending their utility and adaptability. The findings from our review indicate that IoT-based frameworks offer significant potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact in smart buildings. Through the adoption of intelligent mechanisms and solutions, these frameworks facilitate effective energy management, leading to improved system efficiency and sustainability. Considering these findings, we recommend further exploration and adoption of IoT-based wireless sensing systems in smart buildings as a strategic approach to energy management. Our review underscores the importance of incorporating intelligent analysis and enabling the development of third-party applications within the IoT framework to efficiently meet the evolving energy demands and maintenance challenges</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Jain, Andrea Montanari, Eren Sasoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Collecting large quantities of high-quality data can be prohibitively expensive or impractical, and a bottleneck in machine learning. One may instead augment a small set of $n$ data points from the target distribution with data from more accessible sources, e.g. data collected under different circumstances or synthesized by generative models. We refer to such data as `surrogate data'. We study a weighted empirical risk minimization (ERM) approach for integrating surrogate data into training. We analyze mathematically this method under several classical statistical models, and validate our findings empirically on datasets from different domains. Our main findings are: $(i)$ Integrating surrogate data can significantly reduce the test error on the original distribution. Surprisingly, this can happen even when the surrogate data is unrelated to the original ones. We trace back this behavior to the classical Stein's paradox. $(ii)$ In order to reap the benefit of surrogate data, it is crucial to use optimally weighted ERM. $(iii)$ The test error of models trained on mixtures of real and surrogate data is approximately described by a scaling law. This scaling law can be used to predict the optimal weighting scheme, and to choose the amount of surrogate data to add.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivi Chatzi, Eleni Straitouri, Suhas Thejaswi, Manuel Gomez Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are often ranked according to their level of alignment with human preferences -- a model is better than other models if its outputs are more frequently preferred by humans. One of the popular ways to elicit human preferences utilizes pairwise comparisons between the outputs provided by different models to the same inputs. However, since gathering pairwise comparisons by humans is costly and time-consuming, it has become a common practice to gather pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model -- a model strongly aligned with human preferences. Surprisingly, practitioners cannot currently measure the uncertainty that any mismatch between human and model preferences may introduce in the constructed rankings. In this work, we develop a statistical framework to bridge this gap. Given a (small) set of pairwise comparisons by humans and a large set of pairwise comparisons by a model, our framework provides a rank-set -- a set of possible ranking positions -- for each of the models under comparison. Moreover, it guarantees that, with a probability greater than or equal to a user-specified value, the rank-sets cover the true ranking consistent with the distribution of human pairwise preferences asymptotically. Using pairwise comparisons made by humans in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform and pairwise comparisons made by three strong large language models, we empirically demonstrate the effectivity of our framework and show that the rank-sets constructed using only pairwise comparisons by the strong large language models are often inconsistent with (the distribution of) human pairwise preferences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cancer is one of the diseases that kill the most women in the world, with breast cancer being responsible for the highest number of cancer cases and consequently deaths. However, it can be prevented by early detection and, consequently, early treatment. Any development for detection or perdition this kind of cancer is important for a better healthy life. Many studies focus on a model with high accuracy in cancer prediction, but sometimes accuracy alone may not always be a reliable metric. This study implies an investigative approach to studying the performance of different machine learning algorithms based on boosting to predict breast cancer focusing on the recall metric. Boosting machine learning algorithms has been proven to be an effective tool for detecting medical diseases. The dataset of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository has been utilized to train and test the model classifier that contains their attributes. The main objective of this study is to use state-of-the-art boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost, XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM to predict and diagnose breast cancer and to find the most effective metric regarding recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. Furthermore, our study is the first to use these four boosting algorithms with Optuna, a library for hyperparameter optimization, and the SHAP method to improve the interpretability of our model, which can be used as a support to identify and predict breast cancer. We were able to improve AUC or recall for all the models and reduce the False Negative for AdaBoost and LigthGBM the final AUC were more than 99.41\% for all models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Thuy, Dries F. Benoit</p>
<p>Abstract: Image classification with neural networks (NNs) is widely used in industrial processes, situations where the model likely encounters unknown objects during deployment, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Worryingly, NNs tend to make confident yet incorrect predictions when confronted with OOD data. To increase the models' reliability, they should quantify the uncertainty in their own predictions, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted. Deep ensembles, composed of multiple independent NNs, have been shown to perform strongly but are computationally expensive. Recent research has proposed more efficient NN ensembles, namely the snapshot, batch, and multi-input multi-output ensemble. This study investigates the predictive and uncertainty performance of efficient NN ensembles in the context of image classification for industrial processes. It is the first to provide a comprehensive comparison and it proposes a novel Diversity Quality metric to quantify the ensembles' performance on the in-distribution and OOD sets in one single metric. The results highlight the batch ensemble as a cost-effective and competitive alternative to the deep ensemble. It matches the deep ensemble in both uncertainty and accuracy while exhibiting considerable savings in training time, test time, and memory storage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Bordt, Harsha Nori, Vanessa Rodrigues, Besmira Nushi, Rich Caruana</p>
<p>Abstract: While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Cai, Shichao Pei, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Relational learning is an essential task in the domain of knowledge representation, particularly in knowledge graph completion (KGC). While relational learning in traditional single-modal settings has been extensively studied, exploring it within a multimodal KGC context presents distinct challenges and opportunities. One of the major challenges is inference on newly discovered relations without any associated training data. This zero-shot relational learning scenario poses unique requirements for multimodal KGC, i.e., utilizing multimodality to facilitate relational learning.However, existing works fail to support the leverage of multimodal information and leave the problem unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, consisting of three components, i.e., multimodal learner, structure consolidator, and relation embedding generator, to integrate diverse multimodal information and knowledge graph structures to facilitate the zero-shot relational learning. Evaluation results on three multimodal knowledge graphs demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian N\"agele, Jan Olle, Thomas F\"osel, Remmy Zen, Florian Marquardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are used to model a wide variety of applications ranging from game playing over robotics to finance. Their optimal policy typically maximizes the expected sum of rewards given at each step of the decision process. However, a large class of problems does not fit straightforwardly into this framework: Non-cumulative Markov decision processes (NCMDPs), where instead of the expected sum of rewards, the expected value of an arbitrary function of the rewards is maximized. Example functions include the maximum of the rewards or their mean divided by their standard deviation. In this work, we introduce a general mapping of NCMDPs to standard MDPs. This allows all techniques developed to find optimal policies for MDPs, such as reinforcement learning or dynamic programming, to be directly applied to the larger class of NCMDPs. Focusing on reinforcement learning, we show applications in a diverse set of tasks, including classical control, portfolio optimization in finance, and discrete optimization problems. Given our approach, we can improve both final performance and training time compared to relying on standard MDPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihan Liu, Miao Lu, Shenao Zhang, Boyi Liu, Hongyi Guo, Yingxiang Yang, Jose Blanchet, Zhaoran Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have made significant progress in accelerating the generation of diffusion models. However, their application to high-resolution, text-conditioned image generation in the latent space remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we identify three key flaws in the current design of Latent Consistency Models (LCMs). We investigate the reasons behind these limitations and propose Phased Consistency Models (PCMs), which generalize the design space and address the identified limitations. Our evaluations demonstrate that PCMs outperform LCMs across 1--16 step generation settings. While PCMs are specifically designed for multi-step refinement, they achieve comparable 1-step generation results to previously state-of-the-art specifically designed 1-step methods. Furthermore, we show the methodology of PCMs is versatile and applicable to video generation, enabling us to train the state-of-the-art few-step text-to-video generator.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangru Jian, Xinjian Zhao, Wei Pang, Chaolong Ying, Yimu Wang, Yaoyao Xu, Tianshu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent surge in contrast-based graph self-supervised learning has prominently featured an intensified exploration of spectral cues. Spectral augmentation, which involves modifying a graph's spectral properties such as eigenvalues or eigenvectors, is widely believed to enhance model performance. However, an intriguing paradox emerges, as methods grounded in seemingly conflicting assumptions regarding the spectral domain demonstrate notable enhancements in learning performance. Through extensive empirical studies, we find that simple edge perturbations - random edge dropping for node-level and random edge adding for graph-level self-supervised learning - consistently yield comparable or superior performance while being significantly more computationally efficient. This suggests that the computational overhead of sophisticated spectral augmentations may not justify their practical benefits. Our theoretical analysis of the InfoNCE loss bounds for shallow GNNs further supports this observation. The proposed insights represent a significant leap forward in the field, potentially refining the understanding and implementation of graph self-supervised learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tirtha Vinchurkar, Janghoon Ock, Amir Barati Farimani</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing popularity of machine learning (ML) in catalysis has spurred interest in leveraging these techniques to enhance catalyst design. Our study aims to bridge the gap between physics-based studies and data-driven methodologies by integrating ML techniques with eXplainable AI (XAI). Specifically, we employ two XAI techniques: Post-hoc XAI analysis and Symbolic Regression. These techniques help us unravel the correlation between adsorption energy and the properties of the adsorbate-catalyst system. Leveraging a large dataset such as the Open Catalyst Dataset (OC20), we employ a combination of shallow ML techniques and XAI methodologies. Our investigation involves utilizing multiple shallow machine learning techniques to predict adsorption energy, followed by post-hoc analysis for feature importance, inter-feature correlations, and the influence of various feature values on the prediction of adsorption energy. The post-hoc analysis reveals that adsorbate properties exert a greater influence than catalyst properties in our dataset. The top five features based on higher Shapley values are adsorbate electronegativity, the number of adsorbate atoms, catalyst electronegativity, effective coordination number, and the sum of atomic numbers of the adsorbate molecule. There is a positive correlation between catalyst and adsorbate electronegativity with the prediction of adsorption energy. Additionally, symbolic regression yields results consistent with SHAP analysis. It deduces a mathematical relationship indicating that the square of the catalyst electronegativity is directly proportional to the adsorption energy. These consistent correlations resemble those derived from physics-based equations in previous research. Our work establishes a robust framework that integrates ML techniques with XAI, leveraging large datasets like OC20 to enhance catalyst design through model explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Fisch, Joshua Maynez, R. Alex Hofer, Bhuwan Dhingra, Amir Globerson, William W. Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a method that improves statistical estimates based on limited human-labeled data. PPI achieves this by combining small amounts of human-labeled data with larger amounts of data labeled by a reasonably accurate -- but potentially biased -- automatic system, in a way that results in tighter confidence intervals for certain parameters of interest (e.g., the mean performance of a language model). In this paper, we propose a method called Stratified Prediction-Powered Inference (StratPPI), in which we show that the basic PPI estimates can be considerably improved by employing simple data stratification strategies. Without making any assumptions on the underlying automatic labeling system or data distribution, we derive an algorithm for computing provably valid confidence intervals for population parameters (such as averages) that is based on stratified sampling. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that, with appropriate choices of stratification and sample allocation, our approach can provide substantially tighter confidence intervals than unstratified approaches. Specifically, StratPPI is expected to improve in cases where the performance of the autorater varies across different conditional distributions of the target data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eleni Straitouri, Suhas Thejaswi, Manuel Gomez Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision support systems based on prediction sets help humans solve multiclass classification tasks by narrowing down the set of potential label values to a subset of them, namely a prediction set, and asking them to always predict label values from the prediction sets. While this type of systems have been proven to be effective at improving the average accuracy of the predictions made by humans, by restricting human agency, they may cause harm$\unicode{x2014}$a human who has succeeded at predicting the ground-truth label of an instance on their own may have failed had they used these systems. In this paper, our goal is to control how frequently a decision support system based on prediction sets may cause harm, by design. To this end, we start by characterizing the above notion of harm using the theoretical framework of structural causal models. Then, we show that, under a natural, albeit unverifiable, monotonicity assumption, we can estimate how frequently a system may cause harm using only predictions made by humans on their own. Further, we also show that, under a weaker monotonicity assumption, which can be verified experimentally, we can bound how frequently a system may cause harm again using only predictions made by humans on their own. Building upon these assumptions, we introduce a computational framework to design decision support systems based on prediction sets that are guaranteed to cause harm less frequently than a user-specified value using conformal risk control. We validate our framework using real human predictions from two different human subject studies and show that, in decision support systems based on prediction sets, there is a trade-off between accuracy and counterfactual harm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal logic rules are often used in control and robotics to provide structured, human-interpretable descriptions of high-dimensional trajectory data. These rules have numerous applications including safety validation using formal methods, constraining motion planning among autonomous agents, and classifying data. However, existing methods for learning temporal logic predicates from data do not provide assurances about the correctness of the resulting predicate. We present a novel method to learn temporal logic predicates from data with finite-sample correctness guarantees. Our approach leverages expression optimization and conformal prediction to learn predicates that correctly describe future trajectories under mild assumptions. We provide experimental results showing the performance of our approach on a simulated trajectory dataset and perform ablation studies to understand how each component of our algorithm contributes to its performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose significant challenges to global public health, despite the widespread availability of vaccines. Early detection of the disease remains paramount in curbing its transmission and mitigating its impact on public health systems. In response, this study delves into the application of advanced machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting COVID-19 infection probability. We conducted a rigorous investigation into the efficacy of various ML models, including XGBoost, LGBM, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, RandomForest, CatBoost, KNN, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Leveraging a dataset comprising 4000 samples, with 3200 allocated for training and 800 for testing, our experiment offers comprehensive insights into the performance of these models in COVID-19 prediction. Our findings reveal that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) emerge as the top-performing model, exhibiting superior accuracy and recall metrics. With an impressive accuracy rate of 89%, DNN demonstrates remarkable potential in early COVID-19 detection. This underscores the efficacy of deep learning approaches in leveraging complex data patterns to identify COVID-19 infections accurately. This study underscores the critical role of machine learning, particularly deep learning methodologies, in augmenting early detection efforts amidst the ongoing pandemic. The success of DNN in accurately predicting COVID-19 infection probability highlights the importance of continued research and development in leveraging advanced technologies to combat infectious diseases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simran Kaur, Simon Park, Anirudh Goyal, Sanjeev Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Instruct-SkillMix, an automated approach for creating diverse, high quality SFT data. The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline involves two stages, each leveraging an existing powerful LLM: (1) Skill extraction: uses the LLM to extract core "skills" for instruction-following, either from existing datasets, or by directly prompting the model; (2) Data generation: uses the powerful LLM to generate (instruction, response) data that exhibit a randomly chosen pair of these skills. Here, the use of random skill combinations promotes diversity and difficulty.
  Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from Instruct-SkillMix leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench. With just $4$K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. To our knowledge, this achieves state-of-the-art performance among all models that have only undergone SFT (no RL methods) and competes with proprietary models such as Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct.
  Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult. Introducing low quality answers ("shirkers") in $20\%$ of Instruct-SkillMix examples causes performance to plummet, sometimes catastrophically.
  The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline is flexible and is adaptable to other settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled numerous advances in understanding and reasoning in domains like vision, but we have not yet seen this broad success for time-series. Although prior works on time-series MLLMs have shown promising performance in time-series forecasting, very few works show how an LLM could be used for time-series reasoning in natural language. We propose a novel multi-modal time-series LLM approach that learns generalizable information across various domains with powerful zero-shot performance. First, we train a lightweight time-series encoder on top of an LLM to directly extract time-series information. Then, we fine-tune our model with chain-of-thought augmented time-series tasks to encourage the model to generate reasoning paths. We show that our model learns a latent representation that reflects specific time-series features (e.g. slope, frequency), as well as outperforming GPT-4o on a set of zero-shot reasoning tasks on a variety of domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Domenic Rosati, Giles Edkins, Harsh Raj, David Atanasov, Subhabrata Majumdar, Janarthanan Rajendran, Frank Rudzicz, Hassan Sajjad</p>
<p>Abstract: While there has been progress towards aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and ensuring safe behaviour at inference time, safety-guards can easily be removed when fine-tuned on unsafe and harmful datasets.While this setting has been treated extensively, another popular training paradigm, learning from unsafe feedback with reinforcement learning, has previously been unexplored. This is concerning due to the widespread deployment of feedback collection systems. We address this gap by providing an analysis of learning settings where feedback is adversarial and noisy, i.e. that unsafe samples are preferred over safe ones despite model developers goal to maintain safety. We find that safety-aligned LLMs easily explore unsafe action spaces through generating harmful text and optimize for adversarial reward indicating that current safety guards are not enough to prevent learning from unsafe feedback. In order to protect against this vulnerability, we adapt a number of both "implict" and "explicit" harmful fine-tuning defences to evaluate whether they are effective as learning constraints in an RL setting finding that no method is generally effective pointing to the need for more research in defences given the widespread adoption of methods designed to learn from feedback. We end the paper with the observation that some defences work by performing "harmless reward hacking" for which we provide a theoretical explanation drawn from the theory of Constrained Markov Decision Processes and provide some direction for future defence development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuandong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables analytical construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGO (Composing Global Optimizers). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of monomial potentials, which are ring homomorphism, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global optimizers constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that over-parameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global optimizers such as perfect memorization are unfavorable.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Paischer, Lukas Hauzenberger, Thomas Schmied, Benedikt Alkin, Marc Peter Deisenroth, Sepp Hochreiter</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned on a downstream task for a specific application. The most successful and most commonly used fine-tuning method is to update the pre-trained weights via a low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoRA introduces new weight matrices that are usually initialized at random with a uniform rank distribution across the model weights. Recent works focus on different initialization schemes or the learning of adaptive ranks during fine-tuning. Both approaches have only been investigated in isolation, resulting in slow convergence or a uniform rank distribution, in turn leading to suboptimal performance. We propose to improve LoRA by initializing the new weights in a data-driven manner by computing singular value decomposition (SVD) on minibatches of activation vectors. Then, we initialize the LoRA matrices with the obtained right-singular vectors and redistribute ranks among all weight matrices to provably store the maximum amount of information of the downstream data in the newly introduced weights. In this way, only what information to maintain or neglect during the fine-tuning process needs to be learned. We call our new method Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA). We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks ranging from language generation and understanding to image classification and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and achieves the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the number of trainable parameters through rank redistribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianyang Zhang, Huijuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a network structure recently proposed by Liu et al. (2024) that offers improved interpretability and a more parsimonious design in many science-oriented tasks compared to multi-layer perceptrons. This work provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of KAN by establishing generalization bounds for KAN equipped with activation functions that are either represented by linear combinations of basis functions or lying in a low-rank Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). In the first case, the generalization bound accommodates various choices of basis functions in forming the activation functions in each layer of KAN and is adapted to different operator norms at each layer. For a particular choice of operator norms, the bound scales with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficient matrices and the Lipschitz constants for the activation functions, and it has no dependence on combinatorial parameters (e.g., number of nodes) outside of logarithmic factors. Moreover, our result does not require the boundedness assumption on the loss function and, hence, is applicable to a general class of regression-type loss functions. In the low-rank case, the generalization bound scales polynomially with the underlying ranks as well as the Lipschitz constants of the activation functions in each layer. These bounds are empirically investigated for KANs trained with stochastic gradient descent on simulated and real data sets. The numerical results demonstrate the practical relevance of these bounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: In LLM alignment and many other ML applications, one often faces the Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning (MOFT) problem, i.e. fine-tuning an existing model with datasets labeled w.r.t. different objectives simultaneously. To address the challenge, we propose the HyperDPO framework, a conditioned one-shot fine-tuning approach that extends the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) technique, originally developed for efficient LLM alignment with preference data, to accommodate the MOFT settings. By substituting the Bradley-Terry-Luce model in DPO with the Plackett-Luce model, our framework is capable of handling a wide range of MOFT tasks that involve listwise ranking datasets. Compared with previous approaches, HyperDPO enjoys an efficient one-shot training process for profiling the Pareto front of auxiliary objectives, and offers post-training control over trade-offs. Additionally, we propose a novel Hyper Prompt Tuning design, that conveys continuous importance weight across objectives to transformer-based models without altering their architecture, and investigate the potential of temperature-conditioned networks for enhancing the flexibility of post-training control. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the HyperDPO framework through its applications to various tasks, including Learning-to-Rank (LTR) and LLM alignment, highlighting its viability for large-scale ML deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shantanu Ghosh, Tiankang Xie, Mikhail Kuznetsov</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subpopulations of tabular data, known as error slices. Learning robust representation in presence of error slices is challenging, especially in self-supervised settings during the feature reconstruction phase, due to high cardinality features and the complexity of constructing error sets. Traditional robust representation learning methods are largely focused on improving worst group performance in supervised setting in computer vision, leaving a gap in approaches tailored for tabular data. We address this gap by developing a framework to learn robust representation in tabular data during self-supervised pre-training. Our approach utilizes an encoder-decoder model trained with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) loss to learn robust latent representations. This paper applies the Just Train Twice (JTT) and Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) methods during the pre-training phase for tabular data. These methods fine-tune the ERM pre-trained model by up-weighting error-prone samples or creating balanced datasets for specific categorical features. This results in specialized models for each feature, which are then used in an ensemble approach to enhance downstream classification performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qixun Wang, Yifei Wang, Yisen Wang, Xianghua Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we explore the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks that were not encountered during training. To achieve this, we conduct synthetic experiments where the objective is to learn OOD mathematical functions through ICL using a GPT-2 model. We reveal that Transformers may struggle to learn OOD task functions through ICL. Specifically, ICL performance resembles implementing a function within the pretraining hypothesis space and optimizing it with gradient descent based on the in-context examples. Additionally, we investigate ICL's well-documented ability to learn unseen abstract labels in context. We demonstrate that such ability only manifests in the scenarios without distributional shifts and, therefore, may not serve as evidence of new-task-learning ability. Furthermore, we assess ICL's performance on OOD tasks when the model is pretrained on multiple tasks. Both empirical and theoretical analyses demonstrate the existence of the \textbf{low-test-error preference} of ICL, where it tends to implement the pretraining function that yields low test error in the testing context. We validate this through numerical experiments. This new theoretical result, combined with our empirical findings, elucidates the mechanism of ICL in addressing OOD tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gon\c{c}alo Paulo, Alex Mallen, Caden Juang, Nora Belrose</p>
<p>Abstract: While the activations of neurons in deep neural networks usually do not have a simple human-understandable interpretation, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can be used to transform these activations into a higher-dimensional latent space which may be more easily interpretable. However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-$k$ postprocessing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqun Cao, Mutian He, Ning Ma, Chang-yu Hsieh, Chunbin Gu, Pheng-Ann Heng</p>
<p>Abstract: DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening has revolutionized the detection of protein-ligand interactions through read counts, enabling rapid exploration of vast chemical spaces. However, noise in read counts, stemming from nonspecific interactions, can mislead this exploration process. We present DEL-Ranking, a novel distribution-correction denoising framework that addresses these challenges. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a novel ranking loss that rectifies relative magnitude relationships between read counts, enabling the learning of causal features determining activity levels, and (2) an iterative algorithm employing self-training and consistency loss to establish model coherence between activity label and read count predictions. Furthermore, we contribute three new DEL screening datasets, the first to comprehensively include multi-dimensional molecular representations, protein-ligand enrichment values, and their activity labels. These datasets mitigate data scarcity issues in AI-driven DEL screening research. Rigorous evaluation on diverse DEL datasets demonstrates DEL-Ranking's superior performance across multiple correlation metrics, with significant improvements in binding affinity prediction accuracy. Our model exhibits zero-shot generalization ability across different protein targets and successfully identifies potential motifs determining compound binding affinity. This work advances DEL screening analysis and provides valuable resources for future research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tycho F. A. van der Ouderaa, Maximilian L. Croci, Agrin Hilmkil, James Hensman</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works on compression of large language models (LLM) using quantization considered reparameterizing the architecture such that weights are distributed on the sphere. This demonstratively improves the ability to quantize by increasing the mathematical notion of coherence, resulting in fewer weight outliers without affecting the network output. In this work, we aim to further exploit this spherical geometry of the weights when performing quantization by considering Pyramid Vector Quantization (PVQ) for large language models. Arranging points evenly on the sphere is notoriously difficult, especially in high dimensions, and in case approximate solutions exists, representing points explicitly in a codebook is typically not feasible due to its additional memory cost. Instead, PVQ uses a fixed integer lattice on the sphere by projecting points onto the 1-sphere, which allows for efficient encoding and decoding without requiring an explicit codebook in memory. To obtain a practical algorithm, we propose to combine PVQ with scale quantization for which we derive theoretically optimal quantizations, under empirically verified assumptions. Further, we extend pyramid vector quantization to use Hessian information to minimize quantization error under expected feature activations, instead of only relying on weight magnitudes. Experimentally, we achieves state-of-the-art quantization performance with pareto-optimal trade-off between performance and bits per weight and bits per activation, compared to compared methods. On weight-only, we find that we can quantize a Llama-3 70B model to 3.25 bits per weight and retain 98\% accuracy on downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congxi Zhang, Yongchun Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning identifiable representations and models from low-level observations is helpful for an intelligent spacecraft to complete downstream tasks reliably. For temporal observations, to ensure that the data generating process is provably inverted, most existing works either assume the noise variables in the dynamic mechanisms are (conditionally) independent or require that the interventions can directly affect each latent variable. However, in practice, the relationship between the exogenous inputs/interventions and the latent variables may follow some complex deterministic mechanisms. In this work, we study the problem of identifiable representation and model learning for latent dynamic systems. The key idea is to use an inductive bias inspired by controllable canonical forms, which are sparse and input-dependent by definition. We prove that, for linear and affine nonlinear latent dynamic systems with sparse input matrices, it is possible to identify the latent variables up to scaling and determine the dynamic models up to some simple transformations. The results have the potential to provide some theoretical guarantees for developing more trustworthy decision-making and control methods for intelligent spacecrafts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Substantial research on deep learning-based emergent communication uses the referential game framework, specifically the Lewis signaling game, however we argue that successful communication in this game typically only need one or two symbols for target image classification because of a sampling pitfall in the training data. To address this issue, we provide a theoretical analysis and introduce a combinatorial algorithm SolveMinSym (SMS) to solve the symbolic complexity for classification, which is the minimum number of symbols in the message for successful communication. We use the SMS algorithm to create datasets with different symbolic complexity to empirically show that data with higher symbolic complexity increases the number of effective symbols in the emergent language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu-Yun Wang, Zhengyang Geng, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models achieve superior generation quality but suffer from slow generation speed due to the iterative nature of denoising. In contrast, consistency models, a new generative family, achieve competitive performance with significantly faster sampling. These models are trained either through consistency distillation, which leverages pretrained diffusion models, or consistency training/tuning directly from raw data. In this work, we propose a novel framework for understanding consistency models by modeling the denoising process of the diffusion model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and framing consistency model training as the value estimation through Temporal Difference~(TD) Learning. More importantly, this framework allows us to analyze the limitations of current consistency training/tuning strategies. Built upon Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), we propose Stable Consistency Tuning (SCT), which incorporates variance-reduced learning using the score identity. SCT leads to significant performance improvements on benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64. On ImageNet-64, SCT achieves 1-step FID 2.42 and 2-step FID 1.55, a new SoTA for consistency models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinze Wang, Jiong Jin, Tiehua Zhang, Boon Xian Chai, Adriano Di Pietro, Dimitrios Georgakopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate diagnosis of machine breakdowns is crucial for maintaining operational safety in smart manufacturing. Despite the promise shown by deep learning in automating fault identification, the scarcity of labeled training data, particularly for equipment failure instances, poses a significant challenge. This limitation hampers the development of robust classification models. Existing methods like model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) do not adequately address variable working conditions, affecting knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, a Related Task Aware Curriculum Meta-learning (RT-ACM) enhanced fault diagnosis framework is proposed in this paper, inspired by human cognitive learning processes. RT-ACM improves training by considering the relevance of auxiliary sensor working conditions, adhering to the principle of ``paying more attention to more relevant knowledge", and focusing on ``easier first, harder later" curriculum sampling. This approach aids the meta-learner in achieving a superior convergence state. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of RT-ACM framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haixiang Sun, Ye Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ), which serves as a typical implicit neural network, emphasizes their memory efficiency and competitive performance compared to explicit neural networks. However, there has been relatively limited theoretical analysis on the representation of DEQ. In this paper, we utilize the Neural Collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) as a tool to systematically analyze the representation of DEQ under both balanced and imbalanced conditions. $\mathcal{NC}$ is an interesting phenomenon in the neural network training process that characterizes the geometry of class features and classifier weights. While extensively studied in traditional explicit neural networks, the $\mathcal{NC}$ phenomenon has not received substantial attention in the context of implicit neural networks. We theoretically show that $\mathcal{NC}$ exists in DEQ under balanced conditions. Moreover, in imbalanced settings, despite the presence of minority collapse, DEQ demonstrated advantages over explicit neural networks. These advantages include the convergence of extracted features to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame and self-duality properties under mild conditions, highlighting DEQ's superiority in handling imbalanced datasets. Finally, we validate our theoretical analyses through experiments in both balanced and imbalanced scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven highly effective in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the original RLHF typically optimizes under an overall reward, which can lead to a suboptimal learning process. This limitation stems from RLHF's lack of awareness regarding which specific tokens should be reinforced or suppressed. Moreover, conflicts in supervision can arise, for instance, when a chosen response includes erroneous tokens, while a rejected response contains accurate elements. To rectify these shortcomings, increasing dense reward methods, such as step-wise and token-wise RLHF, have been proposed. However, these existing methods are limited to specific tasks (like mathematics). In this paper, we propose the ``Adaptive Message-wise RLHF'' method, which robustly applies to various tasks. By defining pivot tokens as key indicators, our approach adaptively identifies essential information and converts sequence-level supervision into fine-grained, subsequence-level supervision. This aligns the density of rewards and action spaces more closely with the information density of the input. Experiments demonstrate that our method can be integrated into various training methods, significantly mitigating hallucinations and catastrophic forgetting problems, while outperforming other methods on multiple evaluation metrics. Our method improves the success rate on adversarial samples by 10\% compared to the sample-wise approach, and achieves a 1.3\% improvement on evaluation benchmarks such as MMLU, GSM8K, HumanEval, etc.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show impressive performance in solving complex language tasks. However, its large number of parameters present significant challenges for the deployment and application of the model on edge devices. Compressing large language models to low bits can enable them to run on resource-constrained devices, often leading to performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose gradient-aware weight quantization (GWQ), the first quantization approach for low-bit weight quantization that leverages gradients to localize outliers, requiring only a minimal amount of calibration data for outlier detection. GWQ retains the weights corresponding to the top 1% outliers preferentially at FP16 precision, while the remaining non-outlier weights are stored in a low-bit format. GWQ found experimentally that utilizing the sensitive weights in the gradient localization model is more scientific compared to utilizing the sensitive weights in the Hessian matrix localization model. Compared to current quantization methods, GWQ can be applied to multiple language models and achieves lower PPL on the WikiText2 and C4 dataset. In the zero-shot task, GWQ quantized models have higher accuracy compared to other quantization methods. GWQ is also suitable for multimodal model quantization, and the quantized Qwen-VL family model is more accurate than other methods. Zero-shot target detection task dataset RefCOCO outperforms the current stat-of-the-arts method SPQR. GWQ achieves 1.2 times inference speedup in comparison to the original model, and effectively reduces the inference memory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao He, Jinyu Tian, Xianwei Zheng, Li Dong, Yuanman Li, Jiantao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are very vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Many defense methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, traditional poisoning attacks are not as threatening as commonly believed. This is because they often cause differences in how the model performs on the training set compared to the validation set. Such inconsistency can alert defenders that their data has been poisoned, allowing them to take the necessary defensive actions. In this paper, we introduce a more threatening type of poisoning attack called the Deferred Poisoning Attack. This new attack allows the model to function normally during the training and validation phases but makes it very sensitive to evasion attacks or even natural noise. We achieve this by ensuring the poisoned model's loss function has a similar value as a normally trained model at each input sample but with a large local curvature. A similar model loss ensures that there is no obvious inconsistency between the training and validation accuracy, demonstrating high stealthiness. On the other hand, the large curvature implies that a small perturbation may cause a significant increase in model loss, leading to substantial performance degradation, which reflects a worse robustness. We fulfill this purpose by making the model have singular Hessian information at the optimal point via our proposed Singularization Regularization term. We have conducted both theoretical and empirical analyses of the proposed method and validated its effectiveness through experiments on image classification tasks. Furthermore, we have confirmed the hazards of this form of poisoning attack under more general scenarios using natural noise, offering a new perspective for research in the field of security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sajal Regmi, Chetan Phakami Pun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling nuanced understanding and generation of human-like text across a wide range of applications. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique achieves a notable reduction in operational costs while significantly enhancing response times, making it a robust solution for optimizing LLM-powered applications. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT Semantic Cache reduces API calls by up to 68.8% across various query categories, with cache hit rates ranging from 61.6% to 68.8%. Additionally, the system achieves high accuracy, with positive hit rates exceeding 97%, confirming the reliability of cached responses. This technique not only reduces operational costs, but also improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhang, Cuong Nguyen, Kevin Wells, Thanh-Toan Do, David Rosewarne, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-AI cooperative classification (HAI-CC) approaches aim to develop hybrid intelligent systems that enhance decision-making in various high-stakes real-world scenarios by leveraging both human expertise and AI capabilities. Current HAI-CC methods primarily focus on learning-to-defer (L2D), where decisions are deferred to human experts, and learning-to-complement (L2C), where AI and human experts make predictions cooperatively. However, a notable research gap remains in effectively exploring both L2D and L2C under diverse expert knowledge to improve decision-making, particularly when constrained by the cooperation cost required to achieve a target probability for AI-only selection (i.e., coverage). In this paper, we address this research gap by proposing the Coverage-constrained Learning to Defer and Complement with Specific Experts (CL2DC) method. CL2DC makes final decisions through either AI prediction alone or by deferring to or complementing a specific expert, depending on the input data. Furthermore, we propose a coverage-constrained optimisation to control the cooperation cost, ensuring it approximates a target probability for AI-only selection. This approach enables an effective assessment of system performance within a specified budget. Also, CL2DC is designed to address scenarios where training sets contain multiple noisy-label annotations without any clean-label references. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CL2DC achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art HAI-CC methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address two fundamental challenges in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): (1) the lack of theoretical support for invariance learning, a critical property in image processing, and (2) the absence of a unified model capable of excelling on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets. To tackle these issues, we establish and prove scale invariance in graphs, extending this key property to graph learning, and validate it through experiments on real-world datasets. Leveraging directed multi-scaled graphs and an adaptive self-loop strategy, we propose ScaleNet, a unified network architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance across four homophilic and two heterophilic benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we show that through graph transformation based on scale invariance, uniform weights can replace computationally expensive edge weights in digraph inception networks while maintaining or improving performance. For another popular GNN approach to digraphs, we demonstrate the equivalence between Hermitian Laplacian methods and GraphSAGE with incidence normalization. ScaleNet bridges the gap between homophilic and heterophilic graph learning, offering both theoretical insights into scale invariance and practical advancements in unified graph learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spyros Rigas, Michalis Papachristou, Ioannis Sotiropoulos, Georgios Alexandridis</p>
<p>Abstract: Rolling element bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, with their performance directly influencing the efficiency and reliability of industrial systems. At the same time, bearing faults are a leading cause of machinery failures, often resulting in costly downtime, reduced productivity, and, in extreme cases, catastrophic damage. This study presents a methodology that utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to address these challenges through automatic feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and interpretable fault analysis within a unified framework. By training shallow network architectures and minimizing the number of selected features, the framework produces lightweight models that deliver explainable results through feature attribution and symbolic representations of their activation functions. Validated on two widely recognized datasets for bearing fault diagnosis, the framework achieved perfect F1-Scores for fault detection and high performance in fault and severity classification tasks, including 100% F1-Scores in most cases. Notably, it demonstrated adaptability by handling diverse fault types, such as imbalance and misalignment, within the same dataset. The symbolic representations enhanced model interpretability, while feature attribution offered insights into the optimal feature types or signals for each studied task. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical applications, such as real-time machinery monitoring, and for scientific research requiring efficient and explainable models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Hammad, Myeonghun Park, Raymundo Ramos, Pankaj Saha</p>
<p>Abstract: We demonstrate two sampling procedures assisted by machine learning models via regression and classification. The main objective is the use of a neural network to suggest points likely inside regions of interest, reducing the number of evaluations of time consuming calculations. We compare results from this approach with results from other sampling methods, namely Markov chain Monte Carlo and MultiNest, obtaining results that range from comparably similar to arguably better. In particular, we augment our classifier method with a boosting technique that rapidly increases the efficiency within a few iterations. We show results from our methods applied to a toy model and the type II 2HDM, using 3 and 7 free parameters, respectively. The code used for this paper and instructions are publicly available on the web.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delong Liu, Shichao Li, Tianyi Shi, Zhu Meng, Guanyu Chen, Yadong Huang, Jin Dong, Zhicheng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Among numerous studies for driver state detection, wearable physiological measurements offer a practical method for real-time monitoring. However, there are few driver physiological datasets in open-road scenarios, and the existing datasets suffer from issues such as poor signal quality, small sample sizes, and short data collection periods. Therefore, in this paper, a large-scale multimodal driving dataset, OpenDriver, for driver state detection is developed. The OpenDriver encompasses a total of 3,278 driving trips, with a signal collection duration spanning approximately 4,600 hours. Two modalities of driving signals are enrolled in OpenDriver: electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and six-axis motion data of the steering wheel from a motion measurement unit (IMU), which were recorded from 81 drivers and their vehicles. Furthermore, three challenging tasks are involved in our work, namely ECG signal quality assessment, individual biometric identification based on ECG signals, and physiological signal analysis in complex driving environments. To facilitate research in these tasks, corresponding benchmarks have also been introduced. First, a noisy augmentation strategy is applied to generate a larger-scale ECG signal dataset with realistic noise simulation for quality assessment. Second, an end-to-end contrastive learning framework is employed for individual biometric identification. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of drivers' HRV features under different driving conditions is conducted. Each benchmark provides evaluation metrics and reference results. The OpenDriver dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/bdne/OpenDriver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Gonon, Nicolas Brisebarre, Elisa Riccietti, R\'emi Gribonval</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces the first toolkit around path-norms that fully encompasses general DAG ReLU networks with biases, skip connections and any operation based on the extraction of order statistics: max pooling, GroupSort etc. This toolkit notably allows us to establish generalization bounds for modern neural networks that are not only the most widely applicable path-norm based ones, but also recover or beat the sharpest known bounds of this type. These extended path-norms further enjoy the usual benefits of path-norms: ease of computation, invariance under the symmetries of the network, and improved sharpness on layered fully-connected networks compared to the product of operator norms, another complexity measure most commonly used.
  The versatility of the toolkit and its ease of implementation allow us to challenge the concrete promises of path-norm-based generalization bounds, by numerically evaluating the sharpest known bounds for ResNets on ImageNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trevor Ablett, Oliver Limoyo, Adam Sigal, Affan Jilani, Jonathan Kelly, Kaleem Siddiqi, Francois Hogan, Gregory Dudek</p>
<p>Abstract: Contact-rich tasks continue to present many challenges for robotic manipulation. In this work, we leverage a multimodal visuotactile sensor within the framework of imitation learning (IL) to perform contact-rich tasks that involve relative motion (e.g., slipping and sliding) between the end-effector and the manipulated object. We introduce two algorithmic contributions, tactile force matching and learned mode switching, as complimentary methods for improving IL. Tactile force matching enhances kinesthetic teaching by reading approximate forces during the demonstration and generating an adapted robot trajectory that recreates the recorded forces. Learned mode switching uses IL to couple visual and tactile sensor modes with the learned motion policy, simplifying the transition from reaching to contacting. We perform robotic manipulation experiments on four door-opening tasks with a variety of observation and algorithm configurations to study the utility of multimodal visuotactile sensing and our proposed improvements. Our results show that the inclusion of force matching raises average policy success rates by 62.5%, visuotactile mode switching by 30.3%, and visuotactile data as a policy input by 42.5%, emphasizing the value of see-through tactile sensing for IL, both for data collection to allow force matching, and for policy execution to enable accurate task feedback.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolong Huang, Qiankun Li, Xueran Li, Xuesong Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual fine-tuning has garnered significant attention with the rise of pre-trained vision models. The current prevailing method, full fine-tuning, suffers from the issue of knowledge forgetting as it focuses solely on fitting the downstream training set. In this paper, we propose a novel weight rollback-based fine-tuning method called OLOR (One step Learning, One step Review). OLOR combines fine-tuning with optimizers, incorporating a weight rollback term into the weight update term at each step. This ensures consistency in the weight range of upstream and downstream models, effectively mitigating knowledge forgetting and enhancing fine-tuning performance. In addition, a layer-wise penalty is presented to employ penalty decay and the diversified decay rate to adjust the weight rollback levels of layers for adapting varying downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation, we demonstrate the general applicability and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed OLOR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filip \'Uradn\'ik, David Sychrovsk\'y, Jakub \v{C}ern\'y, Martin \v{C}ern\'y</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative game theory has diverse applications in contemporary artificial intelligence, including domains like interpretable machine learning, resource allocation, and collaborative decision-making. However, specifying a cooperative game entails assigning values to exponentially many coalitions, and obtaining even a single value can be resource-intensive in practice. Yet simply leaving certain coalition values undisclosed introduces ambiguity regarding individual contributions to the collective grand coalition. This ambiguity often leads to players holding overly optimistic expectations, stemming from either inherent biases or strategic considerations, frequently resulting in collective claims exceeding the actual grand coalition value. In this paper, we present a framework aimed at optimizing the sequence for revealing coalition values, with the overarching goal of efficiently closing the gap between players' expectations and achievable outcomes in cooperative games. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we study the individual players' optimistic completions of games with missing coalition values along with the arising gap, and investigate its analytical characteristics that facilitate more efficient optimization; (ii) we develop methods to minimize this gap over classes of games with a known prior by disclosing values of additional coalitions in both offline and online fashion; and (iii) we empirically demonstrate the algorithms' performance in practical scenarios, together with an investigation into the typical order of revealing coalition values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Holmberg, Manu Airaksinen, Viviana Marchi, Andrea Guzzetta, Anna Kivi, Leena Haataja, Sampsa Vanhatalo, Teemu Roos</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable methods for the neurodevelopmental assessment of infants are essential for early detection of problems that may need prompt interventions. Spontaneous motor activity, or 'kinetics', is shown to provide a powerful surrogate measure of upcoming neurodevelopment. However, its assessment is by and large qualitative and subjective, focusing on visually identified, age-specific gestures. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Age (KA), a novel data-driven metric that quantifies neurodevelopmental maturity by predicting an infant's age based on their movement patterns. KA offers an interpretable and generalizable proxy for motor development. Our method leverages 3D video recordings of infants, processed with pose estimation to extract spatio-temporal series of anatomical landmarks, which are released as a new openly available dataset. These data are modeled using adaptive graph convolutional networks, able to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies in infant movements. We also show that our data-driven approach achieves improvement over traditional machine learning baselines based on manually engineered features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Munan Li, Xianshi Su, Runze Ma, Tongbang Jiang, Zijian Li, Tony Q. S. Quek</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic graphs are extensively employed for detecting anomalous behavior in nodes within the Internet of Things (IoT). Graph generative models are often used to address the issue of imbalanced node categories in dynamic graphs. Nevertheless, the constraints it faces include the monotonicity of adjacency relationships, the difficulty in constructing multi-dimensional features for nodes, and the lack of a method for end-to-end generation of multiple categories of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel graph generation model, called CGGM, specifically for generating samples belonging to the minority class. The framework consists two core module: a conditional graph generation module and a graph-based anomaly detection module. The generative module adapts to the sparsity of the matrix by downsampling a noise adjacency matrix, and incorporates a multi-dimensional feature encoder based on multi-head self-attention to capture latent dependencies among features. Additionally, a latent space constraint is combined with the distribution distance to approximate the latent distribution of real data. The graph-based anomaly detection module utilizes the generated balanced dataset to predict the node behaviors. Extensive experiments have shown that CGGM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and divergence. The results also demonstrate CGGM can generated diverse data categories, that enhancing the performance of multi-category classification task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Bemporad</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a very efficient numerical method based on the L-BFGS-B algorithm for identifying linear and nonlinear discrete-time state-space models, possibly under $\ell_1$ and group-Lasso regularization for reducing model complexity. For the identification of linear models, we show that, compared to classical linear subspace methods, the approach often provides better results, is much more general in terms of the loss and regularization terms used (such as penalties for enforcing system stability), and is also more stable from a numerical point of view. The proposed method not only enriches the existing set of linear system identification tools but can also be applied to identifying a very broad class of parametric nonlinear state-space models, including recurrent neural networks. We illustrate the approach on synthetic and experimental datasets and apply it to solve a challenging industrial robot benchmark for nonlinear multi-input/multi-output system identification. A Python implementation of the proposed identification method is available in the package jax-sysid, available at https://github.com/bemporad/jax-sysid.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Zheng, Anurag Ghosh, Srinivasa G. Narasimhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Driving is challenging in conditions like night, rain, and snow. Lack of good labeled datasets has hampered progress in scene understanding under such conditions. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) using large labeled clear-day datasets is a promising research direction in such cases. However, many UDA methods are trained with dominant scene backgrounds (e.g., roads, sky, sidewalks) that appear dramatically different across domains. As a result, they struggle to learn effective features of smaller and often sparse foreground objects (e.g., people, vehicles, signs).
  In this work, we improve UDA training by applying in-place image warping to focus on salient objects. We design instance-level saliency guidance to adaptively oversample object regions and undersample background areas, which reduces adverse effects from background context and enhances backbone feature learning. Our approach improves adaptation across geographies, lighting, and weather conditions, and is agnostic to the task (segmentation, detection), domain adaptation algorithm, saliency guidance, and underlying model architecture. Result highlights include +6.1 mAP50 for BDD100K Clear $\rightarrow$ DENSE Foggy, +3.7 mAP50 for BDD100K Day $\rightarrow$ Night, +3.0 mAP50 for BDD100K Clear $\rightarrow$ Rainy, and +6.3 mIoU for Cityscapes $\rightarrow$ ACDC. Besides, Our method adds minimal training memory and no additional inference latency. Code is available at https://github.com/ShenZheng2000/Instance-Warp</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Denis Levchenko, Efstratios Rappos, Shabnam Ataee, Biagio Nigro, Stephan Robert-Nicoud</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) emerged as a way to automatically optimize neural networks for a specific task and dataset. Despite an abundance of research on NAS for images and natural language applications, similar studies for time series data are lacking. Among NAS search spaces, chain-structured are the simplest and most applicable to small datasets like time series. We compare three popular NAS strategies on chain-structured search spaces: Bayesian optimization (specifically Tree-structured Parzen Estimator), the hyperband method, and reinforcement learning in the context of financial time series forecasting. These strategies were employed to optimize simple well-understood neural architectures like the MLP, 1D CNN, and RNN, with more complex temporal fusion transformers (TFT) and their own optimizers included for comparison. We find Bayesian optimization and the hyperband method performing best among the strategies, and RNN and 1D CNN best among the architectures, but all methods were very close to each other with a high variance due to the difficulty of working with financial datasets. We discuss our approach to overcome the variance and provide implementation recommendations for future users and researchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Chen, Jiajing Xie, Yuxiang Lin, Yuhang Song, Wenxian Yang, Rongshan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal learning that combines pathological images with genomic data has significantly enhanced the accuracy of survival prediction. Nevertheless, existing methods have not fully utilized the inherent hierarchical structure within both whole slide images (WSIs) and transcriptomic data, from which better intra-modal representations and inter-modal integration could be derived. Moreover, many existing studies attempt to improve multi-modal representations through attention mechanisms, which inevitably lead to high complexity when processing high-dimensional WSIs and transcriptomic data. Recently, a structured state space model named Mamba emerged as a promising approach for its superior performance in modeling long sequences with low complexity. In this study, we propose Mamba with multi-grained multi-modal interaction (SurvMamba) for survival prediction. SurvMamba is implemented with a Hierarchical Interaction Mamba (HIM) module that facilitates efficient intra-modal interactions at different granularities, thereby capturing more detailed local features as well as rich global representations. In addition, an Interaction Fusion Mamba (IFM) module is used for cascaded inter-modal interactive fusion, yielding more comprehensive features for survival prediction. Comprehensive evaluations on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that SurvMamba outperforms other existing methods in terms of performance and computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advanced machine learning algorithms require platforms that are extremely robust and equipped with rich sensory feedback to handle extensive trial-and-error learning without relying on strong inductive biases. Traditional robotic designs, while well-suited for their specific use cases, are often fragile when used with these algorithms. To address this gap -- and inspired by the vision of enabling curiosity-driven baby robots -- we present a novel robotic limb designed from scratch. Our design has a hybrid soft-hard structure, high redundancy with rich non-contact sensors (exclusively cameras), and easily replaceable failure points. Proof-of-concept experiments using two contemporary reinforcement learning algorithms on a physical prototype demonstrate that our design is able to succeed in a simple target-finding task even under simulated sensor failures, all with minimal human oversight during extended learning periods. We believe this design represents a concrete step toward more tailored robotic designs for achieving general-purpose, generally intelligent robots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heqi Peng, Yunhong Wang, Ruijie Yang, Beichen Li, Rui Wang, Yuanfang Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial example detection, which can be conveniently applied in many scenarios, is important in the area of adversarial defense. Unfortunately, existing detection methods suffer from poor generalization performance, because their training process usually relies on the examples generated from a single known adversarial attack and there exists a large discrepancy between the training and unseen testing adversarial examples. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, named Adversarial Example Detection via Principal Adversarial Domain Adaptation (AED-PADA). Specifically, our approach identifies the Principal Adversarial Domains (PADs), i.e., a combination of features of the adversarial examples generated by different attacks, which possesses a large portion of the entire adversarial feature space. Subsequently, we pioneer to exploit Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in adversarial example detection, with PADs as the source domains. Experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization ability of our proposed AED-PADA. Note that this superiority is particularly achieved in challenging scenarios characterized by employing the minimal magnitude constraint for the perturbations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) enhances the quality and condition adherence of text-to-image diffusion models. It operates by combining the conditional and unconditional predictions using a fixed weight. However, recent works vary the weights throughout the diffusion process, reporting superior results but without providing any rationale or analysis. By conducting comprehensive experiments, this paper provides insights into CFG weight schedulers. Our findings suggest that simple, monotonically increasing weight schedulers consistently lead to improved performances, requiring merely a single line of code. In addition, more complex parametrized schedulers can be optimized for further improvement, but do not generalize across different models and tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Arrhythmias, detectable through electrocardiograms (ECGs), pose significant health risks, underscoring the need for accurate and efficient automated detection techniques. While recent advancements in graph-based methods have demonstrated potential to enhance arrhythmia classification, the challenge lies in effectively representing ECG signals as graphs. This study investigates the use of Visibility Graph (VG) and Vector Visibility Graph (VVG) representations combined with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for arrhythmia classification under the ANSI/AAMI standard, ensuring reproducibility and fair comparison with other techniques. Through extensive experiments on the MIT-BIH dataset, we evaluate various GCN architectures and preprocessing parameters. Our findings demonstrate that VG and VVG mappings enable GCNs to classify arrhythmias directly from raw ECG signals, without the need for preprocessing or noise removal. Notably, VG offers superior computational efficiency, while VVG delivers enhanced classification performance by leveraging additional lead features. The proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in several metrics, although challenges persist in classifying the supraventricular ectopic beat (S) class, particularly under the inter-patient paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Abi-Karam, Rishov Sarkar, Allison Seigler, Sean Lowe, Zhigang Wei, Hanqiu Chen, Nanditha Rao, Lizy John, Aman Arora, Cong Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to high-level synthesis (HLS) flows for quality-of-result (QoR) prediction and design space exploration (DSE). Nevertheless, the scarcity of accessible high-quality HLS datasets and the complexity of building such datasets present challenges. Existing datasets have limitations in terms of benchmark coverage, design space enumeration, vendor extensibility, or lack of reproducible and extensible software for dataset construction. Many works also lack user-friendly ways to add more designs, limiting wider adoption of such datasets. In response to these challenges, we introduce HLSFactory, a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the curation and generation of high-quality HLS design datasets. HLSFactory has three main stages: 1) a design space expansion stage to elaborate single HLS designs into large design spaces using various optimization directives across multiple vendor tools, 2) a design synthesis stage to execute HLS and FPGA tool flows concurrently across designs, and 3) a data aggregation stage for extracting standardized data into packaged datasets for ML usage. This tripartite architecture ensures broad design space coverage via design space expansion and supports multiple vendor tools. Users can contribute to each stage with their own HLS designs and synthesis results and extend the framework itself with custom frontends and tool flows. We also include an initial set of built-in designs from common HLS benchmarks curated open-source HLS designs. We showcase the versatility and multi-functionality of our framework through seven case studies: I) ML model for QoR prediction; II) Design space sampling; III) Fine-grained parallelism backend speedup; IV) Targeting Intel's HLS flow; V) Adding new auxiliary designs; VI) Integrating published HLS data; VII) HLS tool version regression benchmarking.</p>

We show that, under a tie-breaking condition for nearest neighbours, the LOOCV estimate of the mean square error for $k$-NN regression is identical to the mean square error of $(k+1)$-NN regression evaluated on the training data, multiplied by the scaling factor $(k+1)^2/k^2$. Therefore, to compute the LOOCV score, one only needs to fit $(k+1)$-NN regression only once, and does not need to repeat training-validation of $k$-NN regression for the number of training data. Numerical experiments confirm the validity of the fast computation method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixian Guo, Ming Liu, Zhilong Ji, Jinfeng Bai, Yiwen Guo, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Mastering a skill generally relies on both hands-on experience from doers and insightful, high-level guidance by mentors. Will this strategy also work well for solving complex non-convex optimization problems? Here, a common gradient-based optimizer acts like a disciplined doer, making locally optimal updates at each step. Large Language Models (LLMs) can also search for better solutions by inferring from natural language instructions, akin to a high-level mentor. In this paper, we show that these two participators are complementary to each other and can effectively collaborate as a combined optimization framework. The collaborative optimization is achieved by alternating between the gradient-based and LLM-based optimizers. We instruct LLMs to generate possibly improved solutions by taking parameter trajectories recorded during the previous stage of gradient-based optimization into account. Inferred results of LLMs are used as restarting points for the next stage of gradient optimization. We verify the effectiveness of this optimization framework on prompt tuning. By leveraging both the locally rigorous gradient-based optimizer and the high-level deductive LLM-based optimizer, the combined optimization method consistently yields improvements over competitive baselines on a variety of tasks. Our results demonstrate the synergistic effect of conventional gradient-based optimization and the inference ability of LLMs. The code is released at https://github.com/guozix/LLM-catalyst.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thao Nguyen, Haotian Liu, Yuheng Li, Mu Cai, Utkarsh Ojha, Yong Jae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks (e.g., image captioning, visual question answering). While broad, their knowledge remains generic (e.g., recognizing a dog), and they are unable to handle personalized subjects (e.g., recognizing a user's pet dog). Human reasoning, in contrast, typically operates within the context of specific subjects in our surroundings. For example, one might ask, "What should I buy for my dog's birthday?"; as opposed to a generic inquiry about "What should I buy for a dog's birthday?". Similarly, when looking at a friend's image, the interest lies in seeing their activities (e.g., "my friend is holding a cat"), rather than merely observing generic human actions (e.g., "a man is holding a cat"). In this paper, we introduce the novel task of personalizing LMMs, so that they can have conversations about a specific subject. We propose Yo'LLaVA, which learns to embed a personalized subject into a set of latent tokens given a handful of example images of the subject. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that Yo'LLaVA can learn the concept more efficiently using fewer tokens and more effectively encode the visual attributes compared to strong prompting baselines (e.g., LLaVA).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pascal J. Sager, Jan M. Deriu, Benjamin F. Grewe, Thilo Stadelmann, Christoph von der Malsburg</p>
<p>Abstract: Nets, cooperative networks of neurons, have been proposed as format for the representation of sensory signals, as physical implementation of the Gestalt phenomenon and as solution to the neural binding problem, while the direct interaction between nets by structure-sensitive matching has been proposed as basis for object-global operations such as object detection. The nets are flexibly composed of overlapping net fragments, which are learned from statistical regularities of sensory input. We here present the cooperative network architecture (CNA), a concrete model that learns such net structure to represent input patterns and deals robustly with noise, deformation, and out-of-distribution data, thus laying the groundwork for a novel neural architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aydin Abadi, Vishnu Asutosh Dasu, Sumanta Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Deduplication is a vital preprocessing step that enhances machine learning model performance and saves training time and energy. However, enhancing federated learning through deduplication poses challenges, especially regarding scalability and potential privacy violations if deduplication involves sharing all clients' data. In this paper, we address the problem of deduplication in a federated setup by introducing a pioneering protocol, Efficient Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Deduplication (EP-MPD). It efficiently removes duplicates from multiple clients' datasets without compromising data privacy. EP-MPD is constructed in a modular fashion, utilizing two novel variants of the Private Set Intersection protocol. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of deduplication in federated learning of large language models. For instance, we observe up to 19.62\% improvement in perplexity and up to 27.95\% reduction in running time while varying the duplication level between 10\% and 30\%. EP-MPD effectively balances privacy and performance in federated learning, making it a valuable solution for large-scale applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding knowledge mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing towards trustworthy AGI. This paper reviews knowledge mechanism analysis from a novel taxonomy including knowledge utilization and evolution. Knowledge utilization delves into the mechanism of memorization, comprehension and application, and creation. Knowledge evolution focuses on the dynamic progression of knowledge within individual and group LLMs. Moreover, we discuss what knowledge LLMs have learned, the reasons for the fragility of parametric knowledge, and the potential dark knowledge (hypothesis) that will be challenging to address. We hope this work can help understand knowledge in LLMs and provide insights for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Shao, Jiacheng Shen, Chijie An, Mathieu Lauri\`ere</p>
<p>Abstract: Mean field type games (MFTGs) describe Nash equilibria between large coalitions: each coalition consists of a continuum of cooperative agents who maximize the average reward of their coalition while interacting non-cooperatively with a finite number of other coalitions. Although the theory has been extensively developed, we are still lacking efficient and scalable computational methods. Here, we develop reinforcement learning methods for such games in a finite space setting with general dynamics and reward functions. We start by proving that MFTG solution yields approximate Nash equilibria in finite-size coalition games. We then propose two algorithms. The first is based on quantization of mean-field spaces and Nash Q-learning. We provide convergence and stability analysis. We then propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which can scale to larger spaces. Numerical experiments in 5 environments with mean-field distributions of dimension up to $200$ show the scalability and efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhou, Yilai Li, Jing Yuan, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique in structural biology and drug discovery, enabling the study of biomolecules at high resolution. Significant advancements by structural biologists using cryo-EM have led to the production of over 38,626 protein density maps at various resolutions1. However, cryo-EM data processing algorithms have yet to fully benefit from our knowledge of biomolecular density maps, with only a few recent models being data-driven but limited to specific tasks. In this study, we present CryoFM, a foundation model designed as a generative model, learning the distribution of high-quality density maps and generalizing effectively to downstream tasks. Built on flow matching, CryoFM is trained to accurately capture the prior distribution of biomolecular density maps. Furthermore, we introduce a flow posterior sampling method that leverages CRYOFM as a flexible prior for several downstream tasks in cryo-EM and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) without the need for fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most tasks and demonstrating its potential as a foundational model for broader applications in these fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei He, Alon Benhaim, Barun Patra, Praneetha Vaddamanu, Sanchit Ahuja, Parul Chopra, Vishrav Chaudhary, Han Zhao, Xia Song</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel scaling law for general-purpose decoder-only language models (LMs) trained on multilingual data, tackling the problem of balancing languages during multilingual pretraining. A primary challenge in studying multilingual scaling is the difficulty of analyzing individual language performance due to cross-lingual transfer. To address this, we shift the focus from individual languages to language families. We introduce and validate a hypothesis that the test cross-entropy loss for each language family is determined solely by its own sampling ratio, independent of other languages in the mixture. This insight simplifies the complexity of multilingual scaling and make the analysis scalable to an arbitrary number of languages. Building on this hypothesis, we derive a power-law relationship that links performance with dataset size, model size and sampling ratios. This relationship enables us to predict performance across various combinations of the above three quantities, and derive the optimal sampling ratios at different model scales. To demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed scaling law, we perform a large-scale empirical study, training more than 100 models on 23 languages spanning 5 language families. Our experiments show that the optimal sampling ratios derived from small models (85M parameters) generalize effectively to models that are several orders of magnitude larger (1.2B parameters), offering a resource-efficient approach for multilingual LM training at scale.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03098">Local Lesion Generation is Effective for Capsule Endoscopy Image Data Augmentation in a Limited Data Setting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian B. Ch{\l}opowiec, Adam R. Ch{\l}opowiec, Krzysztof Galus, Wojciech Cebula, Martin Tabakov</p>
<p>Abstract: Limited medical imaging datasets challenge deep learning models by increasing risks of overfitting and reduced generalization, particularly in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where discriminators may overfit, leading to training divergence. This constraint also impairs classification models trained on small datasets. Generative Data Augmentation (GDA) addresses this by expanding training datasets with synthetic data, although it requires training a generative model. We propose and evaluate two local lesion generation approaches to address the challenge of augmenting small medical image datasets. The first approach employs the Poisson Image Editing algorithm, a classical image processing technique, to create realistic image composites that outperform current state-of-the-art methods. The second approach introduces a novel generative method, leveraging a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN to synthesize realistic lesions within specified regions of real training images. A comprehensive comparison of the two proposed methods demonstrates that effective local lesion generation in a data-constrained setting allows for reaching new state-of-the-art results in capsule endoscopy lesion classification. Combination of our techniques achieves a macro F1-score of 33.07%, surpassing the previous best result by 7.84 percentage points (p.p.) on the highly imbalanced Kvasir Capsule Dataset, a benchmark for capsule endoscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN for GDA in medical imaging, demonstrating that an image-conditional GAN can be adapted effectively to limited datasets to generate high-quality examples, facilitating effective data augmentation. Additionally, we show that combining this GAN-based approach with classical image processing techniques further improves the results.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised *Rel*ative *Con*trastive learning approach that uses a learnable distance measure in combination with a softened contrastive loss for training an motion foundation model from wearable sensors. The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19379">Marconi: Prefix Caching for the Era of Hybrid LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Pan, Zhuang Wang, Zhen Jia, Can Karakus, Luca Zancato, Tri Dao, Yida Wang, Ravi Netravali</p>
<p>Abstract: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunyang Han, Yibo Hu, Mengxue Qu, Hailin Shi, Yao Zhao, Yunchao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled open-vocabulary and free-text segmentation, yet existing models still require predefined category prompts, limiting free-form category self-generation. Most segmentation LMMs also remain confined to sparse predictions, restricting their applicability in open-set environments. In contrast, we propose ROSE, a Revolutionary Open-set dense SEgmentation LMM, which enables dense mask prediction and open-category generation through patch-wise perception. Our method treats each image patch as an independent region of interest candidate, enabling the model to predict both dense and sparse masks simultaneously. Additionally, a newly designed instruction-response paradigm takes full advantage of the generation and generalization capabilities of LMMs, achieving category prediction independent of closed-set constraints or predefined categories. To further enhance mask detail and category precision, we introduce a conversation-based refinement paradigm, integrating the prediction result from previous step with textual prompt for revision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROSE achieves competitive performance across various segmentation tasks in a unified framework. Code will be released.</p>

In this work, we present a novel approach to annihilation position reconstruction using an ensemble of models based on the PointNet deep learning architecture. The newly developed model, PointNet Ensemble for Annihilation Reconstruction (PEAR) outperforms the standard approach to annihilation position reconstruction, providing more than twice the resolution while maintaining a similarly low bias. This work may also offer insights for similar efforts applying deep learning to experiments that require high resolution and low bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model.

To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with a simple yet effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Audrey Huang, Adam Block, Dylan J. Foster, Dhruv Rohatgi, Cyril Zhang, Max Simchowitz, Jordan T. Ash, Akshay Krishnamurthy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work in language modeling has raised the possibility of self-improvement, where a language models evaluates and refines its own generations to achieve higher performance without external feedback. It is impossible for this self-improvement to create information that is not already in the model, so why should we expect that this will lead to improved capabilities? We offer a new perspective on the capabilities of self-improvement through a lens we refer to as sharpening. Motivated by the observation that language models are often better at verifying response quality than they are at generating correct responses, we formalize self-improvement as using the model itself as a verifier during post-training in order to ``sharpen'' the model to one placing large mass on high-quality sequences, thereby amortizing the expensive inference-time computation of generating good sequences. We begin by introducing a new statistical framework for sharpening in which the learner aims to sharpen a pre-trained base policy via sample access, and establish fundamental limits. Then we analyze two natural families of self-improvement algorithms based on SFT and RLHF. We find that (i) the SFT-based approach is minimax optimal whenever the initial model has sufficient coverage, but (ii) the RLHF-based approach can improve over SFT-based self-improvement by leveraging online exploration, bypassing the need for coverage. Finally, we empirically validate the sharpening mechanism via inference-time and amortization experiments. We view these findings as a starting point toward a foundational understanding that can guide the design and evaluation of self-improvement algorithms.</p>
