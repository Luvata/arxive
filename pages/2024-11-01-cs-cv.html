<p><b>Authors:</b> Dezhan Tu, Danylo Vashchilenko, Yuzhe Lu, Panpan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a versatile set of tasks. A key challenge in accelerating VLMs is storing and accessing the large Key-Value (KV) cache that encodes long visual contexts, such as images or videos. While existing KV cache compression methods are effective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs yields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache, a novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In this paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention by distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based on these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache budget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget across different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to better evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy comparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method accelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and speeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV cache in GPU by 90%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Yang, Lisen Dai, Zheyuan Liu, Xiangqi Wang, Meng Jiang, Yapeng Tian, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) has gained significant attention as a means to remove specific data from trained models without requiring a full retraining process. While progress has been made in unimodal domains like text and image classification, unlearning in multimodal models remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we address the unique challenges of unlearning in CLIP, a prominent multimodal model that aligns visual and textual representations. We introduce CLIPErase, a novel approach that disentangles and selectively forgets both visual and textual associations, ensuring that unlearning does not compromise model performance. CLIPErase consists of three key modules: a Forgetting Module that disrupts the associations in the forget set, a Retention Module that preserves performance on the retain set, and a Consistency Module that maintains consistency with the original model. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and Flickr30K datasets across four CLIP downstream tasks demonstrate that CLIPErase effectively forgets designated associations in zero-shot tasks for multimodal samples, while preserving the model's performance on the retain set after unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zhu, Yixiong Chen, Mingyu Ding, Ping Luo, Leye Wang, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion has attracted vast attention due to its impressive image-generation capabilities. However, when it comes to human-centric text-to-image generation, particularly in the context of faces and hands, the results often fall short of naturalness due to insufficient training priors. We alleviate the issue in this work from two perspectives. 1) From the data aspect, we carefully collect a human-centric dataset comprising over one million high-quality human-in-the-scene images and two specific sets of close-up images of faces and hands. These datasets collectively provide a rich prior knowledge base to enhance the human-centric image generation capabilities of the diffusion model. 2) On the methodological front, we propose a simple yet effective method called Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) by considering low-rank modules trained on close-up hand and face images respectively as experts. This concept draws inspiration from our observation of low-rank refinement, where a low-rank module trained by a customized close-up dataset has the potential to enhance the corresponding image part when applied at an appropriate scale. To validate the superiority of MoLE in the context of human-centric image generation compared to state-of-the-art, we construct two benchmarks and perform evaluations with diverse metrics and human studies.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23359">Domain-decomposed image classification algorithms using linear discriminant analysis and convolutional neural networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Axel Klawonn, Martin Lanser, Janine Weber</p>
<p>Abstract: In many modern computer application problems, the classification of image data plays an important role. Among many different supervised machine learning models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as well as sophisticated variants thereof are popular techniques. In this work, two different domain decomposed CNN models are experimentally compared for different image classification problems. Both models are loosely inspired by domain decomposition methods and in addition, combined with a transfer learning strategy. The resulting models show improved classification accuracies compared to the corresponding, composed global CNN model without transfer learning and besides, also help to speed up the training process. Moreover, a novel decomposed LDA strategy is proposed which also relies on a localization approach and which is combined with a small neural network model. In comparison with a global LDA applied to the entire input data, the presented decomposed LDA approach shows increased classification accuracies for the considered test problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Daniel Silva, Joao Magalhaes, Devis Tuia, Bruno Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: Methods based on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) are nowadays extensively used in support of vision-and-language tasks involving remote sensing data, such as cross-modal retrieval. The adaptation of CLIP to this specific domain has relied on model fine-tuning with the standard contrastive objective, using existing human-labeled image-caption datasets, or using synthetic data corresponding to image-caption pairs derived from other annotations over remote sensing images (e.g., object classes). The use of different pre-training mechanisms has received less attention, and only a few exceptions have considered multilingual inputs. This work proposes a novel vision-and-language model for the remote sensing domain, exploring the fine-tuning of a multilingual CLIP model and testing the use of a self-supervised method based on aligning local and global representations from individual input images, together with the standard CLIP objective. Model training relied on assembling pre-existing datasets of remote sensing images paired with English captions, followed by the use of automated machine translation into nine additional languages. We show that translated data is indeed helpful, e.g. improving performance also on English. Our resulting model, which we named Remote Sensing Multilingual CLIP (RS-M-CLIP), obtains state-of-the-art results in a variety of vision-and-language tasks, including cross-modal and multilingual image-text retrieval, or zero-shot image classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro D'Amelio, Giuseppe Cartella, Vittorio Cuculo, Manuele Lucchi, Marcella Cornia, Rita Cucchiara, Giuseppe Boccignone</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention guides our gaze to fixate the proper location of the scene and holds it in that location for the deserved amount of time given current processing demands, before shifting to the next one. As such, gaze deployment crucially is a temporal process. Existing computational models have made significant strides in predicting spatial aspects of observer's visual scanpaths (where to look), while often putting on the background the temporal facet of attention dynamics (when). In this paper we present TPP-Gaze, a novel and principled approach to model scanpath dynamics based on Neural Temporal Point Process (TPP), that jointly learns the temporal dynamics of fixations position and duration, integrating deep learning methodologies with point process theory. We conduct extensive experiments across five publicly available datasets. Our results show the overall superior performance of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23413">EchoFM: Foundation Model for Generalizable Echocardiogram Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sekeun Kim, Pengfei Jin, Sifan Song, Cheng Chen, Yiwei Li, Hui Ren, Xiang Li, Tianming Liu, Quanzheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have recently gained significant attention because of their generalizability and adaptability across multiple tasks and data distributions. Although medical foundation models have emerged, solutions for cardiac imaging, especially echocardiography videos, are still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce EchoFM, a foundation model specifically designed to represent and analyze echocardiography videos. In EchoFM, we propose a self-supervised learning framework that captures both spatial and temporal variability patterns through a spatio-temporal consistent masking strategy and periodic-driven contrastive learning. This framework can effectively capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of echocardiography and learn the representative video features without any labels. We pre-train our model on an extensive dataset comprising over 290,000 echocardiography videos covering 26 scan views across different imaging modes, with up to 20 million frames of images. The pre-trained EchoFM can then be easily adapted and fine-tuned for a variety of downstream tasks, serving as a robust backbone model. Our evaluation was systemically designed for four downstream tasks after the echocardiography examination routine. Experiment results show that EchoFM surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including specialized echocardiography methods, self-supervised pre-training models, and general-purposed pre-trained foundation models, across all downstream tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23494">Causality-Driven Audits of Model Robustness</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Drenkow, Chris Ribaudo, Mathias Unberath</p>
<p>Abstract: Robustness audits of deep neural networks (DNN) provide a means to uncover model sensitivities to the challenging real-world imaging conditions that significantly degrade DNN performance in-the-wild. Such conditions are often the result of the compounding of multiple factors inherent to the environment, sensor, or processing pipeline and may lead to complex image distortions that are not easily categorized. When robustness audits are limited to a set of pre-determined imaging effects or distortions, the results cannot be (easily) transferred to real-world conditions where image corruptions may be more complex or nuanced. To address this challenge, we present a new alternative robustness auditing method that uses causal inference to measure DNN sensitivities to the factors of the imaging process that cause complex distortions. Our approach uses causal models to explicitly encode assumptions about the domain-relevant factors and their interactions. Then, through extensive experiments on natural and rendered images across multiple vision tasks, we show that our approach reliably estimates causal effects of each factor on DNN performance using observational domain data. These causal effects directly tie DNN sensitivities to observable properties of the imaging pipeline in the domain of interest towards reducing the risk of unexpected DNN failures when deployed in that domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Drones have revolutionized the fields of aerial imaging, mapping, and disaster recovery. However, the deployment of drones in low-light conditions is constrained by the image quality produced by their on-board cameras. In this paper, we present a learning architecture for improving 3D reconstructions in low-light conditions by finding features in a burst. Our approach enhances visual reconstruction by detecting and describing high quality true features and less spurious features in low signal-to-noise ratio images. We demonstrate that our method is capable of handling challenging scenes in millilux illumination, making it a significant step towards drones operating at night and in extremely low-light applications such as underground mining and search and rescue operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> {\L}ukasz Staniszewski, {\L}ukasz Kuci\'nski, Kamil Deja</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing new images from random noise, but they lack meaningful latent space that encodes data into features. Recent DDPM-based editing techniques try to mitigate this issue by inverting images back to their approximated staring noise. In this work, we study the relation between the initial Gaussian noise, the samples generated from it, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the inversion procedure. First, we interpret their spatial distance relations to show the inaccuracy of the DDIM inversion technique by localizing latent representations manifold between the initial noise and generated samples. Then, we demonstrate the peculiar relation between initial Gaussian noise and its corresponding generations during diffusion training, showing that the high-level features of generated images stabilize rapidly, keeping the spatial distance relationship between noises and generations consistent throughout the training.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23556">Language-guided Hierarchical Fine-grained Image Forgery Detection and Localization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Guo, Xiaohong Liu, Iacopo Masi, Xiaoming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Differences in forgery attributes of images generated in CNN-synthesized and image-editing domains are large, and such differences make a unified image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) challenging. To this end, we present a hierarchical fine-grained formulation for IFDL representation learning. Specifically, we first represent forgery attributes of a manipulated image with multiple labels at different levels. Then, we perform fine-grained classification at these levels using the hierarchical dependency between them. As a result, the algorithm is encouraged to learn both comprehensive features and the inherent hierarchical nature of different forgery attributes. In this work, we propose a Language-guided Hierarchical Fine-grained IFDL, denoted as HiFi-Net++. Specifically, HiFi-Net++ contains four components: a multi-branch feature extractor, a language-guided forgery localization enhancer, as well as classification and localization modules. Each branch of the multi-branch feature extractor learns to classify forgery attributes at one level, while localization and classification modules segment pixel-level forgery regions and detect image-level forgery, respectively. Also, the language-guided forgery localization enhancer (LFLE), containing image and text encoders learned by contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP), is used to further enrich the IFDL representation. LFLE takes specifically designed texts and the given image as multi-modal inputs and then generates the visual embedding and manipulation score maps, which are used to further improve HiFi-Net++ manipulation localization performance. Lastly, we construct a hierarchical fine-grained dataset to facilitate our study. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on $8$ by using different benchmarks for both tasks of IFDL and forgery attribute classification. Our source code and dataset are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghong Xie, Mengzhao Wang, Huafeng Li, Yafei Zhang, Dapeng Tao, Zhengtao Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grounding has attracted wide attention thanks to its broad application in various visual language tasks. Although visual grounding has made significant research progress, existing methods ignore the promotion effect of the association between text and image features at different hierarchies on cross-modal matching. This paper proposes a Phrase Decoupling Cross-Modal Hierarchical Matching and Progressive Position Correction Visual Grounding method. It first generates a mask through decoupled sentence phrases, and a text and image hierarchical matching mechanism is constructed, highlighting the role of association between different hierarchies in cross-modal matching. In addition, a corresponding target object position progressive correction strategy is defined based on the hierarchical matching mechanism to achieve accurate positioning for the target object described in the text. This method can continuously optimize and adjust the bounding box position of the target object as the certainty of the text description of the target object improves. This design explores the association between features at different hierarchies and highlights the role of features related to the target object and its position in target positioning. The proposed method is validated on different datasets through experiments, and its superiority is verified by the performance comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minheng Chen, Chao Cao, Tong Chen, Yan Zhuang, Jing Zhang, Yanjun Lyu, Xiaowei Yu, Lu Zhang, Tianming Liu, Dajiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The 3-hinge gyrus (3HG) is a newly defined folding pattern, which is the conjunction of gyri coming from three directions in cortical folding. Many studies demonstrated that 3HGs can be reliable nodes when constructing brain networks or connectome since they simultaneously possess commonality and individuality across different individual brains and populations. However, 3HGs are identified and validated within individual spaces, making it difficult to directly serve as the brain network nodes due to the absence of cross-subject correspondence. The 3HG correspondences represent the intrinsic regulation of brain organizational architecture, traditional image-based registration methods tend to fail because individual anatomical properties need to be fully respected. To address this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for anatomical feature embedding of the 3HGs to build the correspondences among different brains. The core component of this framework is to construct a structural similarity-enhanced multi-hop feature encoding strategy based on the recently developed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) for anatomical feature embedding. Extensive experiments suggest that our approach can effectively establish robust cross-subject correspondences when no one-to-one mapping exists.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Colin Conwell, Christopher Hamblin, Chelsea Boccagno, David Mayo, Jesse Cummings, Leyla Isik, Andrei Barbu</p>
<p>Abstract: When we experience a visual stimulus as beautiful, how much of that experience derives from perceptual computations we cannot describe versus conceptual knowledge we can readily translate into natural language? Disentangling perception from language in visually-evoked affective and aesthetic experiences through behavioral paradigms or neuroimaging is often empirically intractable. Here, we circumnavigate this challenge by using linear decoding over the learned representations of unimodal vision, unimodal language, and multimodal (language-aligned) deep neural network (DNN) models to predict human beauty ratings of naturalistic images. We show that unimodal vision models (e.g. SimCLR) account for the vast majority of explainable variance in these ratings. Language-aligned vision models (e.g. SLIP) yield small gains relative to unimodal vision. Unimodal language models (e.g. GPT2) conditioned on visual embeddings to generate captions (via CLIPCap) yield no further gains. Caption embeddings alone yield less accurate predictions than image and caption embeddings combined (concatenated). Taken together, these results suggest that whatever words we may eventually find to describe our experience of beauty, the ineffable computations of feedforward perception may provide sufficient foundation for that experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Zhang, Baoxin Li, Jae-sun Seo, Yu Cap</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the long-range attention mechanism of vision transformers has driven significant performance breakthroughs across various computer vision tasks. However, the traditional self-attention mechanism, which processes both informative and non-informative tokens, suffers from inefficiency and inaccuracies. While sparse attention mechanisms have been introduced to mitigate these issues by pruning tokens involved in attention, they often lack context-awareness and intelligence. These mechanisms frequently apply a uniform token selection strategy across different inputs for batch training or optimize efficiency only for the inference stage. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm: Select and Pack Attention (SPA). SPA dynamically selects informative tokens using a low-cost gating layer supervised by selection labels and packs these tokens into new batches, enabling a variable number of tokens to be used in parallelized GPU batch training and inference. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and computer vision tasks demonstrate that SPA delivers superior performance and efficiency, including a 0.6 mAP improvement in object detection and a 16.4% reduction in computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiufeng Song, Xiao Guo, Jiache Zhang, Qirui Li, Lei Bai, Xiaoming Liu, Guangtao Zhai, Xiaohong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large numbers of synthesized videos from diffusion models pose threats to information security and authenticity, leading to an increasing demand for generated content detection. However, existing video-level detection algorithms primarily focus on detecting facial forgeries and often fail to identify diffusion-generated content with a diverse range of semantics. To advance the field of video forensics, we propose an innovative algorithm named Multi-Modal Detection(MM-Det) for detecting diffusion-generated videos. MM-Det utilizes the profound perceptual and comprehensive abilities of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) by generating a Multi-Modal Forgery Representation (MMFR) from LMM's multi-modal space, enhancing its ability to detect unseen forgery content. Besides, MM-Det leverages an In-and-Across Frame Attention (IAFA) mechanism for feature augmentation in the spatio-temporal domain. A dynamic fusion strategy helps refine forgery representations for the fusion. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive diffusion video dataset, called Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF), across a wide range of forgery videos. MM-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance in DVF, demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm. Both source code and DVF are available at https://github.com/SparkleXFantasy/MM-Det.</p>

We also developed a multimodal data collection system that combines a pressure glove, an sEMG armband, and a markerless finger-tracking module. We created a comprehensive dataset from 21 participants, capturing synchronized data of hand posture, sEMG signals, and exerted hand pressure across various hand postures and hand-object interaction scenarios using our collection system. Our framework enables precise hand pressure estimation in complex and natural interaction scenarios. Our approach substantially mitigates the limitations of traditional sEMG-based or vision-based methods by integrating 3D hand posture information with sEMG signals. Video demos, data, and code are available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanchao Liu, Yujiang Li, Tai-Jiang Mu, Shi-Min Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite huge progress in skeleton-based action recognition, its generalizability to different domains remains a challenging issue. In this paper, to solve the skeleton action generalization problem, we present a recover-and-resample augmentation framework based on a novel complete action prior. We observe that human daily actions are confronted with temporal mismatch across different datasets, as they are usually partial observations of their complete action sequences. By recovering complete actions and resampling from these full sequences, we can generate strong augmentations for unseen domains. At the same time, we discover the nature of general action completeness within large datasets, indicated by the per-frame diversity over time. This allows us to exploit two assets of transferable knowledge that can be shared across action samples and be helpful for action completion: boundary poses for determining the action start, and linear temporal transforms for capturing global action patterns. Therefore, we formulate the recovering stage as a two-step stochastic action completion with boundary pose-conditioned extrapolation followed by smooth linear transforms. Both the boundary poses and linear transforms can be efficiently learned from the whole dataset via clustering. We validate our approach on a cross-dataset setting with three skeleton action datasets, outperforming other domain generalization approaches by a considerable margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwoo Lee, Joonkyu Park, Kyoung Mu Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: To train a deblurring network, an appropriate dataset with paired blurry and sharp images is essential. Existing datasets collect blurry images either synthetically by aggregating consecutive sharp frames or using sophisticated camera systems to capture real blur. However, these methods offer limited diversity in blur types (blur trajectories) or require extensive human effort to reconstruct large-scale datasets, failing to fully reflect real-world blur scenarios. To address this, we propose GS-Blur, a dataset of synthesized realistic blurry images created using a novel approach. To this end, we first reconstruct 3D scenes from multi-view images using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), then render blurry images by moving the camera view along the randomly generated motion trajectories. By adopting various camera trajectories in reconstructing our GS-Blur, our dataset contains realistic and diverse types of blur, offering a large-scale dataset that generalizes well to real-world blur. Using GS-Blur with various deblurring methods, we demonstrate its ability to generalize effectively compared to previous synthetic or real blur datasets, showing significant improvements in deblurring performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Nie, Jiangqun Ni, Jian Zhang, Bin Zhang, Weizhe Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of deepfake generation techniques, the importance of deepfake detection in protecting multimedia content integrity has become increasingly obvious. Recently, temporal inconsistency clues have been explored to improve the generalizability of deepfake video detection. According to our observation, the temporal artifacts of forged videos in terms of motion information usually exhibits quite distinct inconsistency patterns along horizontal and vertical directions, which could be leveraged to improve the generalizability of detectors. In this paper, a transformer-based framework for Diffusion Learning of Inconsistency Pattern (DIP) is proposed, which exploits directional inconsistencies for deepfake video detection. Specifically, DIP begins with a spatiotemporal encoder to represent spatiotemporal information. A directional inconsistency decoder is adopted accordingly, where direction-aware attention and inconsistency diffusion are incorporated to explore potential inconsistency patterns and jointly learn the inherent relationships. In addition, the SpatioTemporal Invariant Loss (STI Loss) is introduced to contrast spatiotemporally augmented sample pairs and prevent the model from overfitting nonessential forgery artifacts. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method could effectively identify directional forgery clues and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathilde Caron, Alireza Fathi, Cordelia Schmid, Ahmet Iscen</p>
<p>Abstract: Web-scale visual entity recognition, the task of associating images with their corresponding entities within vast knowledge bases like Wikipedia, presents significant challenges due to the lack of clean, large-scale training data. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to curate such a dataset, leveraging a multimodal large language model (LLM) for label verification, metadata generation, and rationale explanation. Instead of relying on the multimodal LLM to directly annotate data, which we found to be suboptimal, we prompt it to reason about potential candidate entity labels by accessing additional contextually relevant information (such as Wikipedia), resulting in more accurate annotations. We further use the multimodal LLM to enrich the dataset by generating question-answer pairs and a grounded finegrained textual description (referred to as "rationale") that explains the connection between images and their assigned entities. Experiments demonstrate that models trained on this automatically curated data achieve state-of-the-art performance on web-scale visual entity recognition tasks (e.g. +6.9% improvement in OVEN entity task), underscoring the importance of high-quality training data in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiyu Zhang, Xiaogang Xu, Jiafei Wu, Zhe Liu, Lu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks, which manipulate input data to undermine model availability and integrity, pose significant security threats during machine learning inference. With the advent of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new attack vectors, such as cognitive bias, prompt injection, and jailbreak techniques, have emerged. Understanding these attacks is crucial for developing more robust systems and demystifying the inner workings of neural networks. However, existing reviews often focus on attack classifications and lack comprehensive, in-depth analysis. The research community currently needs: 1) unified insights into adversariality, transferability, and generalization; 2) detailed evaluations of existing methods; 3) motivation-driven attack categorizations; and 4) an integrated perspective on both traditional and LVLM attacks. This article addresses these gaps by offering a thorough summary of traditional and LVLM adversarial attacks, emphasizing their connections and distinctions, and providing actionable insights for future research.</p>

We also conduct a comprehensive comparison and evaluation of these integrated algorithms, analyzing the characteristics of each. Finally, we contribute all the code, configuration and data to the open-source community, which aims to promote the widespread research and development of SLAM technology within the open-source ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiufeng Huang, Ruiqi Li, Yiu-ming Cheung, Ka Chun Cheung, Simon See, Renjie Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a crucial method for acquiring 3D assets. To protect the copyright of these assets, digital watermarking techniques can be applied to embed ownership information discreetly within 3DGS models. However, existing watermarking methods for meshes, point clouds, and implicit radiance fields cannot be directly applied to 3DGS models, as 3DGS models use explicit 3D Gaussians with distinct structures and do not rely on neural networks. Naively embedding the watermark on a pre-trained 3DGS can cause obvious distortion in rendered images. In our work, we propose an uncertainty-based method that constrains the perturbation of model parameters to achieve invisible watermarking for 3DGS. At the message decoding stage, the copyright messages can be reliably extracted from both 3D Gaussians and 2D rendered images even under various forms of 3D and 2D distortions. We conduct extensive experiments on the Blender, LLFF and MipNeRF-360 datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both message decoding accuracy and view synthesis quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiwen Li, Fei Su, Zhicheng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a challenging vision-language task, utilizing bi-modal (image+text) queries to retrieve target images. Despite the impressive performance of supervised CIR, the dependence on costly, manually-labeled triplets limits its scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR) is presented along with projection-based approaches. However, such methods face two major problems, i.e., task discrepancy between pre-training (image $\leftrightarrow$ text) and inference (image+text $\rightarrow$ image), and modality discrepancy. The latter pertains to approaches based on text-only projection training due to the necessity of feature extraction from the reference image during inference. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework to tackle both discrepancies. First, to ensure efficiency and scalability, a textual inversion network is pre-trained on large-scale caption datasets. Subsequently, we put forward Modality-Task Dual Alignment (MoTaDual) as the second stage, where large-language models (LLMs) generate triplet data for fine-tuning, and additionally, prompt learning is introduced in a multi-modal context to effectively alleviate both modality and task discrepancies. The experimental results show that our MoTaDual achieves the state-of-the-art performance across four widely used ZS-CIR benchmarks, while maintaining low training time and computational cost. The code will be released soon.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23742">Scaled Inverse Graphics: Efficiently Learning Large Sets of 3D Scenes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Karim Kassab, Antoine Schnepf, Jean-Yves Franceschi, Laurent Caraffa, Flavian Vasile, Jeremie Mary, Andrew Comport, Val\'erie Gouet-Brunet</p>
<p>Abstract: While the field of inverse graphics has been witnessing continuous growth, techniques devised thus far predominantly focus on learning individual scene representations. In contrast, learning large sets of scenes has been a considerable bottleneck in NeRF developments, as repeatedly applying inverse graphics on a sequence of scenes, though essential for various applications, remains largely prohibitive in terms of resource costs. We introduce a framework termed "scaled inverse graphics", aimed at efficiently learning large sets of scene representations, and propose a novel method to this end. It operates in two stages: (i) training a compression model on a subset of scenes, then (ii) training NeRF models on the resulting smaller representations, thereby reducing the optimization space per new scene. In practice, we compact the representation of scenes by learning NeRFs in a latent space to reduce the image resolution, and sharing information across scenes to reduce NeRF representation complexity. We experimentally show that our method presents both the lowest training time and memory footprint in scaled inverse graphics compared to other methods applied independently on each scene. Our codebase is publicly available as open-source. Our project page can be found at https://scaled-ig.github.io .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarina Thomas, Qing Cao, Anna Novikova, Daria Kulikova, Guy Ben-Yosef</p>
<p>Abstract: Ejection fraction (EF) of the left ventricle (LV) is considered as one of the most important measurements for diagnosing acute heart failure and can be estimated during cardiac ultrasound acquisition. While recent successes in deep learning research successfully estimate EF values, the proposed models often lack an explanation for the prediction. However, providing clear and intuitive explanations for clinical measurement predictions would increase the trust of cardiologists in these models. In this paper, we explore predicting EF measurements with Natural Language Explanation (NLE). We propose a model that in a single forward pass combines estimation of the LV contour over multiple frames, together with a set of modules and routines for computing various motion and shape attributes that are associated with ejection fraction. It then feeds the attributes into a large language model to generate text that helps to explain the network's outcome in a human-like manner. We provide experimental evaluation of our explanatory output, as well as EF prediction, and show that our model can provide EF comparable to state-of-the-art together with meaningful and accurate natural language explanation to the prediction.

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNS) excel at learning from static datasets but struggle with continual learning, where data arrives sequentially. Catastrophic forgetting, the phenomenon of forgetting previously learned knowledge, is a primary challenge. This paper introduces EXponentially Averaged Class-wise Feature Significance (EXACFS) to mitigate this issue in the class incremental learning (CIL) setting. By estimating the significance of model features for each learned class using loss gradients, gradually aging the significance through the incremental tasks and preserving the significant features through a distillation loss, EXACFS effectively balances remembering old knowledge (stability) and learning new knowledge (plasticity). Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100 demonstrate EXACFS's superior performance in preserving stability while acquiring plasticity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shunmei Dong, Qinglong Wang, Haiqing Wang, Qianqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The star tracker is generally affected by the atmospheric background light and the aerodynamic environment when working in near space, which results in missing stars or false stars. Moreover, high-speed maneuvering may cause star trailing, which reduces the accuracy of the star position. To address the challenges for starmap identification, a reverse attitude statistics based method is proposed to handle position noise, false stars, and missing stars. Conversely to existing methods which match before solving for attitude, this method introduces attitude solving into the matching process, and obtains the final match and the correct attitude simultaneously by frequency statistics. Firstly, based on stable angular distance features, the initial matching is obtained by utilizing spatial hash indexing. Then, the dual-vector attitude determination is introduced to calculate potential attitude. Finally, the star pairs are accurately matched by applying a frequency statistics filtering method. In addition, Bayesian optimization is employed to find optimal parameters under the impact of noises, which is able to enhance the algorithm performance further. In this work, the proposed method is validated in simulation, field test and on-orbit experiment. Compared with the state-of-the-art, the identification rate is improved by more than 14.3%, and the solving time is reduced by over 28.5%.</p>

However, these neural network models are limited by a finite set of inlier object categories.

This approach brings additional information in comparison with traditional object detection. We establish a comparative benchmark and show that two-stage OOD methods, notably autolabelling, show promising results for 3D OOD Object Detection. Our contributions include setting a rigorous evaluation protocol by examining the evaluation of hyperparameters and evaluating strategies for generating additional data to train an OOD-aware 3D object detector. This comprehensive analysis is essential for developing robust 3D object detection systems that can perform reliably in diverse and unpredictable real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research arXiv:2410.15027 has explored the use of diffusion transformers (DiTs) for task-agnostic image generation by simply concatenating attention tokens across images. However, despite substantial computational resources, the fidelity of the generated images remains suboptimal. In this study, we reevaluate and streamline this framework by hypothesizing that text-to-image DiTs inherently possess in-context generation capabilities, requiring only minimal tuning to activate them. Through diverse task experiments, we qualitatively demonstrate that existing text-to-image DiTs can effectively perform in-context generation without any tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple pipeline to leverage the in-context abilities of DiTs: (1) concatenate images instead of tokens, (2) perform joint captioning of multiple images, and (3) apply task-specific LoRA tuning using small datasets (e.g., $20\sim 100$ samples) instead of full-parameter tuning with large datasets. We name our models In-Context LoRA (IC-LoRA). This approach requires no modifications to the original DiT models, only changes to the training data. Remarkably, our pipeline generates high-fidelity image sets that better adhere to prompts. While task-specific in terms of tuning data, our framework remains task-agnostic in architecture and pipeline, offering a powerful tool for the community and providing valuable insights for further research on product-level task-agnostic generation systems.

<p>Abstract: Ensuring adherence to traffic sign regulations is essential for both human and autonomous vehicle navigation. While current benchmark datasets concentrate on lane perception or basic traffic sign recognition, they often overlook the intricate task of integrating these regulations into lane operations. Addressing this gap, we introduce MapDR, a novel dataset designed for the extraction of Driving Rules from traffic signs and their association with vectorized, locally perceived HD Maps. MapDR features over 10,000 annotated video clips that capture the intricate correlation between traffic sign regulations and lanes. We define two pivotal sub-tasks: 1) Rule Extraction from Traffic Sign, which accurately deciphers regulatory instructions, and 2) Rule-Lane Correspondence Reasoning, which aligns these rules with their respective lanes. Built upon this benchmark, we provide a multimodal solution that offers a strong baseline for advancing autonomous driving technologies. It fills a critical gap in the integration of traffic sign rules, contributing to the development of reliable autonomous navigation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seon-Ho Lee, Jue Wang, Zhikang Zhang, David Fan, Xinyu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As the scale of data and models for video understanding rapidly expand, handling long-form video input in transformer-based models presents a practical challenge. Rather than resorting to input sampling or token dropping, which may result in information loss, token merging shows promising results when used in collaboration with transformers. However, the application of token merging for long-form video processing is not trivial. We begin with the premise that token merging should not rely solely on the similarity of video tokens; the saliency of tokens should also be considered. To address this, we explore various video token merging strategies for long-form video classification, starting with a simple extension of image token merging, moving to region-concentrated merging, and finally proposing a learnable video token merging (VTM) algorithm that dynamically merges tokens based on their saliency. Extensive experimental results show that we achieve better or comparable performances on the LVU, COIN, and Breakfast datasets. Moreover, our approach significantly reduces memory costs by 84% and boosts throughput by approximately 6.89 times compared to baseline algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have shown more potential than CNN-based DPMs, yet their extensive computational requirements hinder widespread practical applications. To reduce the computation budget of transformer-based DPMs, this work proposes the Efficient Diffusion Transformer (EDT) framework. The framework includes a lightweight-design diffusion model architecture, and a training-free Attention Modulation Matrix and its alternation arrangement in EDT inspired by human-like sketching. Additionally, we propose a token relation-enhanced masking training strategy tailored explicitly for EDT to augment its token relation learning capability. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of EDT. The EDT framework reduces training and inference costs and surpasses existing transformer-based diffusion models in image synthesis performance, thereby achieving a significant overall enhancement. With lower FID, EDT-S, EDT-B, and EDT-XL attained speed-ups of 3.93x, 2.84x, and 1.92x respectively in the training phase, and 2.29x, 2.29x, and 2.22x respectively in inference, compared to the corresponding sizes of MDTv2.

<p>Abstract: Self-occlusion is common when capturing people in the wild, where the performer do not follow predefined motion scripts. This challenges existing monocular human reconstruction systems that assume full body visibility. We introduce Self-Occluded Avatar Recovery (SOAR), a method for complete human reconstruction from partial observations where parts of the body are entirely unobserved. SOAR leverages structural normal prior and generative diffusion prior to address such an ill-posed reconstruction problem. For structural normal prior, we model human with an reposable surfel model with well-defined and easily readable shapes. For generative diffusion prior, we perform an initial reconstruction and refine it using score distillation. On various benchmarks, we show that SOAR performs favorably than state-of-the-art reconstruction and generation methods, and on-par comparing to concurrent works.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faisal Mehmood, Enqing Chen, Touqeer Abbas, Samah M. Alzanin</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum Human Action Recognition (HAR) is an interesting research area in human-computer interaction used to monitor the activities of elderly and disabled individuals affected by physical and mental health. In the recent era, skeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown that it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex backgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this method only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive field. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range interconnection. To address this issue, we developed a quantum spatial-temporal relative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes, which allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network. These nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton topologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action better. Furthermore, we combine quantum ST-RTR with a fusion model for further performance improvements. To assess the performance of the quantum ST-RTR method, we conducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and UAV-Human. It boosted CS and CV by 2.11 % and 1.45% on NTU RGB+D 60, 1.25% and 1.05% on NTU RGB+D 120. On UAV-Human datasets, accuracy improved by 2.54%. The experimental outcomes explain that the proposed ST-RTR model significantly improves action recognition associated with the standard ST-GCN method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinlong He, Pengfei Li, Gang Liu, Shenjun Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit the superior text understanding capabilities of LLMs and extend these capabilities to multimodal scenarios. These models achieve excellent results in the general domain of multimodal tasks. However, in the medical domain, the substantial training costs and the requirement for extensive medical data pose challenges to the development of medical MLLMs. Furthermore, due to the free-text form of answers, tasks such as visual grounding that need to produce output in a prescribed form become difficult for MLLMs. So far, there have been no medical MLLMs works in medical visual grounding area. For the medical vision grounding task, which involves identifying locations in medical images based on short text descriptions, we propose Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning medical multimodal large language models for Medcial Visual Grounding (PFMVG). To validate the performance of the model, we evaluate it on a public benchmark dataset for medical visual grounding, where it achieves competitive results, and significantly outperforming GPT-4v. Our code will be open sourced after peer review.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23828">Show Me What and Where has Changed? Question Answering and Grounding for Remote Sensing Change Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Li, Fuyu Dong, Di Wang, Shaofeng Li, Quan Wang, Xinbo Gao, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to perceive changes occurring on the Earth's surface from remote sensing data in different periods, and feed these changes back to humans. However, most existing methods only focus on detecting change regions, lacking the ability to interact with users to identify changes that the users expect. In this paper, we introduce a new task named Change Detection Question Answering and Grounding (CDQAG), which extends the traditional change detection task by providing interpretable textual answers and intuitive visual evidence. To this end, we construct the first CDQAG benchmark dataset, termed QAG-360K, comprising over 360K triplets of questions, textual answers, and corresponding high-quality visual masks. It encompasses 10 essential land-cover categories and 8 comprehensive question types, which provides a large-scale and diverse dataset for remote sensing applications. Based on this, we present VisTA, a simple yet effective baseline method that unifies the tasks of question answering and grounding by delivering both visual and textual answers. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both the classic CDVQA and the proposed CDQAG datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results provide useful insights for the development of better CDQAG models, and we hope that our work can inspire further research in this important yet underexplored direction. The proposed benchmark dataset and method are available at https://github.com/like413/VisTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tahar Chettaoui, Naser Damer, Fadi Boutros</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are predominantly trained in an unsupervised or self-supervised manner on highly diverse and large-scale datasets, making them broadly applicable to various downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate for the first time whether such models are suitable for the specific domain of face recognition. We further propose and demonstrate the adaptation of these models for face recognition across different levels of data availability. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple foundation models and datasets of varying scales for training and fine-tuning, with evaluation on a wide range of benchmarks. Our results indicate that, despite their versatility, pre-trained foundation models underperform in face recognition compared to similar architectures trained specifically for this task. However, fine-tuning foundation models yields promising results, often surpassing models trained from scratch when training data is limited. Even with access to large-scale face recognition training datasets, fine-tuned foundation models perform comparably to models trained from scratch, but with lower training computational costs and without relying on the assumption of extensive data availability. Our analysis also explores bias in face recognition, with slightly higher bias observed in some settings when using foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Deng, Youxin Pang, Xiaochen Zhao, Chao Xu, Lizhen Wang, Hongjiang Xiao, Shi Yan, Hongwen Zhang, Yebin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Stereo-Talker, a novel one-shot audio-driven human video synthesis system that generates 3D talking videos with precise lip synchronization, expressive body gestures, temporally consistent photo-realistic quality, and continuous viewpoint control. The process follows a two-stage approach. In the first stage, the system maps audio input to high-fidelity motion sequences, encompassing upper-body gestures and facial expressions. To enrich motion diversity and authenticity, large language model (LLM) priors are integrated with text-aligned semantic audio features, leveraging LLMs' cross-modal generalization power to enhance motion quality. In the second stage, we improve diffusion-based video generation models by incorporating a prior-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism: a view-guided MoE focuses on view-specific attributes, while a mask-guided MoE enhances region-based rendering stability. Additionally, a mask prediction module is devised to derive human masks from motion data, enhancing the stability and accuracy of masks and enabling mask guiding during inference. We also introduce a comprehensive human video dataset with 2,203 identities, covering diverse body gestures and detailed annotations, facilitating broad generalization. The code, data, and pre-trained models will be released for research purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Li, Minghui Zhang, Chuyan Zhang, Yun Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate airway anatomical labeling is crucial for clinicians to identify and navigate complex bronchial structures during bronchoscopy. Automatic airway anatomical labeling is challenging due to significant individual variability and anatomical variations. Previous methods are prone to generate inconsistent predictions, which is harmful for preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation. This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel method that enhances topological consistency and improves the detection of abnormal airway branches.
  We propose a novel approach incorporating two modules: the Soft Subtree Consistency (SSC) and the Abnormal Branch Saliency (ABS). The SSC module constructs a soft subtree to capture clinically relevant topological relationships, allowing for flexible feature aggregation within and across subtrees. The ABS module facilitates the interaction between node features and prototypes to distinguish abnormal branches, preventing the erroneous aggregation of features between normal and abnormal nodes.
  Evaluated on a challenging dataset characterized by severe airway distortion and atrophy, our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, it attains a 91.4% accuracy at the segmental level and an 83.7% accuracy at the subsegmental level, representing a 1.4% increase in subsegmental accuracy and a 3.1% increase in topological consistency. Notably, the method demonstrates reliable performance in cases with disease-induced airway deformities, ensuring consistent and accurate labeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangyu Zhou, Chia-Hsiang Kao, Cheng Perng Phoo, Utkarsh Mall, Bharath Hariharan, Kavita Bala</p>
<p>Abstract: Clouds in satellite imagery pose a significant challenge for downstream applications. A major challenge in current cloud removal research is the absence of a comprehensive benchmark and a sufficiently large and diverse training dataset. To address this problem, we introduce the largest public dataset -- $\textit{AllClear}$ for cloud removal, featuring 23,742 globally distributed regions of interest (ROIs) with diverse land-use patterns, comprising 4 million images in total. Each ROI includes complete temporal captures from the year 2022, with (1) multi-spectral optical imagery from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9, (2) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1, and (3) auxiliary remote sensing products such as cloud masks and land cover maps. We validate the effectiveness of our dataset by benchmarking performance, demonstrating the scaling law -- the PSNR rises from $28.47$ to $33.87$ with $30\times$ more data, and conducting ablation studies on the temporal length and the importance of individual modalities. This dataset aims to provide comprehensive coverage of the Earth's surface and promote better cloud removal results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuesong Li, Zeeshan Hayder, Ali Zia, Connor Cassidy, Shiming Liu, Warwick Stiller, Eric Stone, Warren Conaty, Lars Petersson, Vivien Rolland</p>
<p>Abstract: Crop biomass offers crucial insights into plant health and yield, making it essential for crop science, farming systems, and agricultural research. However, current measurement methods, which are labor-intensive, destructive, and imprecise, hinder large-scale quantification of this trait. To address this limitation, we present a biomass prediction network (BioNet), designed for adaptation across different data modalities, including point clouds and drone imagery. Our BioNet, utilizing a sparse 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and a transformer-based prediction module, processes point clouds and other 3D data representations to predict biomass. To further extend BioNet for drone imagery, we integrate a neural feature field (NeFF) module, enabling 3D structure reconstruction and the transformation of 2D semantic features from vision foundation models into the corresponding 3D surfaces. For the point cloud modality, BioNet demonstrates superior performance on two public datasets, with an approximate 6.1% relative improvement (RI) over the state-of-the-art. In the RGB image modality, the combination of BioNet and NeFF achieves a 7.9% RI. Additionally, the NeFF-based approach utilizes inexpensive, portable drone-mounted cameras, providing a scalable solution for large field applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23904">EZ-HOI: VLM Adaptation via Guided Prompt Learning for Zero-Shot HOI Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinqian Lei, Bo Wang, Robby T. Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting Human-Object Interactions (HOI) in zero-shot settings, where models must handle unseen classes, poses significant challenges. Existing methods that rely on aligning visual encoders with large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to tap into the extensive knowledge of VLMs, require large, computationally expensive models and encounter training difficulties. Adapting VLMs with prompt learning offers an alternative to direct alignment. However, fine-tuning on task-specific datasets often leads to overfitting to seen classes and suboptimal performance on unseen classes, due to the absence of unseen class labels. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel prompt learning-based framework for Efficient Zero-Shot HOI detection (EZ-HOI). First, we introduce Large Language Model (LLM) and VLM guidance for learnable prompts, integrating detailed HOI descriptions and visual semantics to adapt VLMs to HOI tasks. However, because training datasets contain seen-class labels alone, fine-tuning VLMs on such datasets tends to optimize learnable prompts for seen classes instead of unseen ones. Therefore, we design prompt learning for unseen classes using information from related seen classes, with LLMs utilized to highlight the differences between unseen and related seen classes. Quantitative evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our EZ-HOI achieves state-of-the-art performance across various zero-shot settings with only 10.35% to 33.95% of the trainable parameters compared to existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhang, Lei Cao, Jiayi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing multi-modal image fusion methods fail to address the compound degradations presented in source images, resulting in fusion images plagued by noise, color bias, improper exposure, \textit{etc}. Additionally, these methods often overlook the specificity of foreground objects, weakening the salience of the objects of interest within the fused images. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel interactive multi-modal image fusion framework based on the text-modulated diffusion model, called Text-DiFuse. First, this framework integrates feature-level information integration into the diffusion process, allowing adaptive degradation removal and multi-modal information fusion. This is the first attempt to deeply and explicitly embed information fusion within the diffusion process, effectively addressing compound degradation in image fusion. Second, by embedding the combination of the text and zero-shot location model into the diffusion fusion process, a text-controlled fusion re-modulation strategy is developed. This enables user-customized text control to improve fusion performance and highlight foreground objects in the fused images. Extensive experiments on diverse public datasets show that our Text-DiFuse achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance across various scenarios with complex degradation. Moreover, the semantic segmentation experiment validates the significant enhancement in semantic performance achieved by our text-controlled fusion re-modulation strategy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasileios Tzouras, Lazaros Nalpantidis, Ronja G\"uldenring</p>
<p>Abstract: In precision agriculture, vision models often struggle with new, unseen fields where crops and weeds have been influenced by external factors, resulting in compositions and appearances that differ from the learned distribution. This paper aims to adapt to specific fields at low cost using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). We explore a novel domain shift from a diverse, large pool of internet-sourced data to a small set of data collected by a robot at specific locations, minimizing the need for extensive on-field data collection. Additionally, we introduce a novel module -- the Multi-level Attention-based Adversarial Discriminator (MAAD) -- which can be integrated at the feature extractor level of any detection model. In this study, we incorporate MAAD with CenterNet to simultaneously detect leaf, stem, and vein instances. Our results show significant performance improvements in the unlabeled target domain compared to baseline models, with a 7.5% increase in object detection accuracy and a 5.1% improvement in keypoint detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Run Luo, Zikai Song, Longze Chen, Yunshui Li, Min Yang, Wei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) aims to associate multiple objects across video frames and is a challenging vision task due to inherent complexities in the tracking environment. Most existing approaches train and track within a single domain, resulting in a lack of cross-domain generalizability to data from other domains. While several works have introduced natural language representation to bridge the domain gap in visual tracking, these textual descriptions often provide too high-level a view and fail to distinguish various instances within the same class. In this paper, we address this limitation by developing IP-MOT, an end-to-end transformer model for MOT that operates without concrete textual descriptions. Our approach is underpinned by two key innovations: Firstly, leveraging a pre-trained vision-language model, we obtain instance-level pseudo textual descriptions via prompt-tuning, which are invariant across different tracking scenes; Secondly, we introduce a query-balanced strategy, augmented by knowledge distillation, to further boost the generalization capabilities of our model. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used MOT benchmarks, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack, demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance on same-domain data compared to state-of-the-art models but also significantly improves the performance of query-based trackers by large margins for cross-domain inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D object detection is an essential task for computer vision applications in autonomous vehicles and robotics. However, models often struggle to quantify detection reliability, leading to poor performance on unfamiliar scenes. We introduce a framework for quantifying uncertainty in 3D object detection by leveraging an evidential learning loss on Bird's Eye View representations in the 3D detector. These uncertainty estimates require minimal computational overhead and are generalizable across different architectures. We demonstrate both the efficacy and importance of these uncertainty estimates on identifying out-of-distribution scenes, poorly localized objects, and missing (false negative) detections; our framework consistently improves over baselines by 10-20% on average. Finally, we integrate this suite of tasks into a system where a 3D object detector auto-labels driving scenes and our uncertainty estimates verify label correctness before the labels are used to train a second model. Here, our uncertainty-driven verification results in a 1% improvement in mAP and a 1-2% improvement in NDS.</p>

Our method not only preserves the inherent identity of vehicle 3D objects, but also supports multi-attribute editing, allowing for extensive customization without compromising the model's structural integrity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruixun Liu, Kaiyu Li, Jiayi Song, Dongwei Sun, Xiangyong Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image change caption (RSICC) aims to provide natural language descriptions for bi-temporal remote sensing images. Since Change Caption (CC) task requires both spatial and temporal features, previous works follow an encoder-fusion-decoder architecture. They use an image encoder to extract spatial features and the fusion module to integrate spatial features and extract temporal features, which leads to increasingly complex manual design of the fusion module. In this paper, we introduce a novel video model-based paradigm without design of the fusion module and propose a Mask-enhanced Video model for Change Caption (MV-CC). Specifically, we use the off-the-shelf video encoder to simultaneously extract the temporal and spatial features of bi-temporal images. Furthermore, the types of changes in the CC are set based on specific task requirements, and to enable the model to better focus on the regions of interest, we employ masks obtained from the Change Detection (CD) method to explicitly guide the CC model. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can obtain better performance compared with other state-of-the-art RSICC methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Zhou, Rebecca Towning, Zaid Awad, Stamatia Giannarou</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical scene segmentation is essential for enhancing surgical precision, yet it is frequently compromised by the scarcity and imbalance of available data. To address these challenges, semantic image synthesis methods based on generative adversarial networks and diffusion models have been developed. However, these models often yield non-diverse images and fail to capture small, critical tissue classes, limiting their effectiveness. In response, we propose the Class-Aware Semantic Diffusion Model (CASDM), a novel approach which utilizes segmentation maps as conditions for image synthesis to tackle data scarcity and imbalance. Novel class-aware mean squared error and class-aware self-perceptual loss functions have been defined to prioritize critical, less visible classes, thereby enhancing image quality and relevance. Furthermore, to our knowledge, we are the first to generate multi-class segmentation maps using text prompts in a novel fashion to specify their contents. These maps are then used by CASDM to generate surgical scene images, enhancing datasets for training and validating segmentation models. Our evaluation, which assesses both image quality and downstream segmentation performance, demonstrates the strong effectiveness and generalisability of CASDM in producing realistic image-map pairs, significantly advancing surgical scene segmentation across diverse and challenging datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work introduces JEMA (Joint Embedding with Multimodal Alignment), a novel co-learning framework tailored for laser metal deposition (LMD), a pivotal process in metal additive manufacturing. As Industry 5.0 gains traction in industrial applications, efficient process monitoring becomes increasingly crucial. However, limited data and the opaque nature of AI present challenges for its application in an industrial setting. JEMA addresses this challenges by leveraging multimodal data, including multi-view images and metadata such as process parameters, to learn transferable semantic representations. By applying a supervised contrastive loss function, JEMA enables robust learning and subsequent process monitoring using only the primary modality, simplifying hardware requirements and computational overhead. We investigate the effectiveness of JEMA in LMD process monitoring, focusing specifically on its generalization to downstream tasks such as melt pool geometry prediction, achieved without extensive fine-tuning. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the high scalability and performance of JEMA, particularly when combined with Vision Transformer models. We report an 8% increase in performance in multimodal settings and a 1% improvement in unimodal settings compared to supervised contrastive learning. Additionally, the learned embedding representation enables the prediction of metadata, enhancing interpretability and making possible the assessment of the added metadata's contributions. Our framework lays the foundation for integrating multisensor data with metadata, enabling diverse downstream tasks within the LMD domain and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yakun Xie, Suning Liu, Hongyu Chen, Shaohan Cao, Huixin Zhang, Dejun Feng, Qian Wan, Jun Zhu, Qing Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in salient object detection(SOD) in optical remote sensing images(ORSI), challenges persist due to the intricate edge structures of ORSIs and the complexity of their contextual relationships. Current deep learning approaches encounter difficulties in accurately identifying boundary features and lack efficiency in collaboratively modeling the foreground and background by leveraging contextual features. To address these challenges, we propose a stronger multifaceted collaborative salient object detector in ORSIs, termed LBA-MCNet, which incorporates aspects of localization, balance, and affinity. The network focuses on accurately locating targets, balancing detailed features, and modeling image-level global context information. Specifically, we design the Edge Feature Adaptive Balancing and Adjusting(EFABA) module for precise edge localization, using edge features to guide attention to boundaries and preserve spatial details. Moreover, we design the Global Distributed Affinity Learning(GDAL) module to model global context. It captures global context by generating an affinity map from the encoders final layer, ensuring effective modeling of global patterns. Additionally, deep supervision during deconvolution further enhances feature representation. Finally, we compared with 28 state of the art approaches on three publicly available datasets. The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

Consequently, it is intuitive to leverage the wealth of annotations in 2D images to alleviate the inherent data scarcity in OV-3Det. In this paper, we push the task setup to its limits by exploring the potential of using solely 2D images to learn OV-3Det. The major challenges for this setup is the modality gap between training images and testing point clouds, which prevents effective integration of 2D knowledge into OV-3Det. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework ImOV3D to leverage pseudo multimodal representation containing both images and point clouds (PC) to close the modality gap. The key of ImOV3D lies in flexible modality conversion where 2D images can be lifted into 3D using monocular depth estimation and can also be derived from 3D scenes through rendering. This allows unifying both training images and testing point clouds into a common image-PC representation, encompassing a wealth of 2D semantic information and also incorporating the depth and structural characteristics of 3D spatial data. We carefully conduct such conversion to minimize the domain gap between training and test cases. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, SUNRGBD and ScanNet, show that ImOV3D significantly outperforms existing methods, even in the absence of ground truth 3D training data. With the inclusion of a minimal amount of real 3D data for fine-tuning, the performance also significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Fu, Xiao Zhang, Sepideh Pashami, Fatemeh Rahimian, Anders Holst</p>
<p>Abstract: In the ever-evolving adversarial machine learning landscape, developing effective defenses against patch attacks has become a critical challenge, necessitating reliable solutions to safeguard real-world AI systems. Although diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis and have been recently utilized to counter $\ell_p$-norm bounded attacks, their potential in mitigating localized patch attacks remains largely underexplored. In this work, we propose DiffPAD, a novel framework that harnesses the power of diffusion models for adversarial patch decontamination. DiffPAD first performs super-resolution restoration on downsampled input images, then adopts binarization, dynamic thresholding scheme and sliding window for effective localization of adversarial patches. Such a design is inspired by the theoretically derived correlation between patch size and diffusion restoration error that is generalized across diverse patch attack scenarios. Finally, DiffPAD applies inpainting techniques to the original input images with the estimated patch region being masked. By integrating closed-form solutions for super-resolution restoration and image inpainting into the conditional reverse sampling process of a pre-trained diffusion model, DiffPAD obviates the need for text guidance or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DiffPAD not only achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness against patch attacks but also excels in recovering naturalistic images without patch remnants.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes the RePAIR dataset that represents a challenging benchmark to test modern computational and data driven methods for puzzle-solving and reassembly tasks. Our dataset has unique properties that are uncommon to current benchmarks for 2D and 3D puzzle solving. The fragments and fractures are realistic, caused by a collapse of a fresco during a World War II bombing at the Pompeii archaeological park. The fragments are also eroded and have missing pieces with irregular shapes and different dimensions, challenging further the reassembly algorithms. The dataset is multi-modal providing high resolution images with characteristic pictorial elements, detailed 3D scans of the fragments and meta-data annotated by the archaeologists. Ground truth has been generated through several years of unceasing fieldwork, including the excavation and cleaning of each fragment, followed by manual puzzle solving by archaeologists of a subset of approx. 1000 pieces among the 16000 available. After digitizing all the fragments in 3D, a benchmark was prepared to challenge current reassembly and puzzle-solving methods that often solve more simplistic synthetic scenarios. The tested baselines show that there clearly exists a gap to fill in solving this computationally complex problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hatef Otroshi Shahreza, S\'ebastien Marcel</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data generation is gaining increasing popularity in different computer vision applications. Existing state-of-the-art face recognition models are trained using large-scale face datasets, which are crawled from the Internet and raise privacy and ethical concerns. To address such concerns, several works have proposed generating synthetic face datasets to train face recognition models. However, these methods depend on generative models, which are trained on real face images. In this work, we design a simple yet effective membership inference attack to systematically study if any of the existing synthetic face recognition datasets leak any information from the real data used to train the generator model. We provide an extensive study on 6 state-of-the-art synthetic face recognition datasets, and show that in all these synthetic datasets, several samples from the original real dataset are leaked. To our knowledge, this paper is the first work which shows the leakage from training data of generator models into the generated synthetic face recognition datasets. Our study demonstrates privacy pitfalls in synthetic face recognition datasets and paves the way for future studies on generating responsible synthetic face datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ariel Larey, Eyal Rond, Omer Achrack</p>
<p>Abstract: Face recognition technologies are increasingly used in various applications, yet they are vulnerable to face spoofing attacks. These spoofing attacks often involve unique 3D structures, such as printed papers or mobile device screens. Although stereo-depth cameras can detect such attacks effectively, their high-cost limits their widespread adoption. Conversely, two-sensor systems without extrinsic calibration offer a cost-effective alternative but are unable to calculate depth using stereo techniques. In this work, we propose a method to overcome this challenge by leveraging facial attributes to derive disparity information and estimate relative depth for anti-spoofing purposes, using non-calibrated systems. We introduce a multi-modal anti-spoofing model, coined Disparity Model, that incorporates created disparity maps as a third modality alongside the two original sensor modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Disparity Model in countering various spoof attacks using a comprehensive dataset collected from the Intel RealSense ID Solution F455. Our method outperformed existing methods in the literature, achieving an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1.71% and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 2.77% at a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 1%. These errors are lower by 2.45% and 7.94% than the errors of the best comparison method, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a model ensemble that addresses 3D spoof attacks as well, achieving an EER of 2.04% and an FNR of 3.83% at an FPR of 1%. Overall, our work provides a state-of-the-art solution for the challenging task of anti-spoofing in non-calibrated systems that lack depth information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: There is an immense quantity of historical and cultural documentation that exists only as handwritten manuscripts. At the same time, performing OCR across scripts and different handwriting styles has proven to be an enormously difficult problem relative to the process of digitizing print. While recent Transformer based models have achieved relatively strong performance, they rely heavily on manually transcribed training data and have difficulty generalizing across writers. Multimodal LLM, such as GPT-4v and Gemini, have demonstrated effectiveness in performing OCR and computer vision tasks with few shot prompting. In this paper, I evaluate the accuracy of handwritten document transcriptions generated by Gemini against the current state of the art Transformer based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunjae Yoon, Gwanhyeong Koo, Younghwan Lee, Chang D. Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Human image animation aims to generate a human motion video from the inputs of a reference human image and a target motion video. Current diffusion-based image animation systems exhibit high precision in transferring human identity into targeted motion, yet they still exhibit irregular quality in their outputs. Their optimal precision is achieved only when the physical compositions (i.e., scale and rotation) of the human shapes in the reference image and target pose frame are aligned. In the absence of such alignment, there is a noticeable decline in fidelity and consistency. Especially, in real-world environments, this compositional misalignment commonly occurs, posing significant challenges to the practical usage of current systems. To this end, we propose Test-time Procrustes Calibration (TPC), which enhances the robustness of diffusion-based image animation systems by maintaining optimal performance even when faced with compositional misalignment, effectively addressing real-world scenarios. The TPC provides a calibrated reference image for the diffusion model, enhancing its capability to understand the correspondence between human shapes in the reference and target images. Our method is simple and can be applied to any diffusion-based image animation system in a model-agnostic manner, improving the effectiveness at test time without additional training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Hakam Shams Eddin, Juergen Gall</p>
<p>Abstract: The spatio-temporal relations of impacts of extreme events and their drivers in climate data are not fully understood and there is a need of machine learning approaches to identify such spatio-temporal relations from data. The task, however, is very challenging since there are time delays between extremes and their drivers, and the spatial response of such drivers is inhomogeneous. In this work, we propose a first approach and benchmarks to tackle this challenge. Our approach is trained end-to-end to predict spatio-temporally extremes and spatio-temporally drivers in the physical input variables jointly. By enforcing the network to predict extremes from spatio-temporal binary masks of identified drivers, the network successfully identifies drivers that are correlated with extremes. We evaluate our approach on three newly created synthetic benchmarks, where two of them are based on remote sensing or reanalysis climate data, and on two real-world reanalysis datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neil Chowdhury, Franklin Wang, Sumedh Shenoy, Douwe Kiela, Sarah Schwettmann, Tristan Thrush</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal models leverage large-scale pre-training to achieve strong but still imperfect performance on tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient method for correcting errors in trained contrastive image-text retrieval models with no additional training, called Nearest Neighbor Normalization (NNN). We show an improvement on retrieval metrics in both text retrieval and image retrieval for all of the contrastive models that we tested (CLIP, BLIP, ALBEF, SigLIP, BEiT) and for both of the datasets that we used (MS-COCO and Flickr30k). NNN requires a reference database, but does not require any training on this database, and can even increase the retrieval accuracy of a model after finetuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Kazemi, Qurat ul ain Fatima, Volodymyr Kindratenko, Christopher Tessum</p>
<p>Abstract: Image labeling is a critical bottleneck in the development of computer vision technologies, often constraining the potential of machine learning models due to the time-intensive nature of manual annotations. This work introduces a novel approach that leverages outpainting to address the problem of annotated data scarcity by generating artificial contexts and annotations, significantly reducing manual labeling efforts. We apply this technique to a particularly acute challenge in autonomous driving, urban planning, and environmental monitoring: the lack of diverse, eye-level vehicle images in desired classes. Our dataset comprises AI-generated vehicle images obtained by detecting and cropping vehicles from manually selected seed images, which are then outpainted onto larger canvases to simulate varied real-world conditions. The outpainted images include detailed annotations, providing high-quality ground truth data. Advanced outpainting techniques and image quality assessments ensure visual fidelity and contextual relevance. Augmentation with outpainted vehicles improves overall performance metrics by up to 8\% and enhances prediction of underrepresented classes by up to 20\%. This approach, exemplifying outpainting as a self-annotating paradigm, presents a solution that enhances dataset versatility across multiple domains of machine learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Ali, Mamoona Javaid, Mubashir Noman, Mustansar Fiaz, Salman Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated waste recycling aims to efficiently separate the recyclable objects from the waste by employing vision-based systems. However, the presence of varying shaped objects having different material types makes it a challenging problem, especially in cluttered environments. Existing segmentation methods perform reasonably on many semantic segmentation datasets by employing multi-contextual representations, however, their performance is degraded when utilized for waste object segmentation in cluttered scenarios. In addition, plastic objects further increase the complexity of the problem due to their translucent nature. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficacious segmentation network, named COSNet, that uses boundary cues along with multi-contextual information to accurately segment the objects in cluttered scenes. COSNet introduces novel components including feature sharpening block (FSB) and boundary enhancement module (BEM) for enhancing the features and highlighting the boundary information of irregular waste objects in cluttered environment. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets including ZeroWaste-f, SpectralWaste, and ADE20K demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our COSNet achieves a significant gain of 1.8% on ZeroWaste-f and 2.1% on SpectralWaste datasets respectively in terms of mIoU metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nouar AlDahoul, Myles Joshua Toledo Tan, Harishwar Reddy Kasireddy, Yasir Zaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Technologies for recognizing facial attributes like race, gender, age, and emotion have several applications, such as surveillance, advertising content, sentiment analysis, and the study of demographic trends and social behaviors. Analyzing demographic characteristics based on images and analyzing facial expressions have several challenges due to the complexity of humans' facial attributes. Traditional approaches have employed CNNs and various other deep learning techniques, trained on extensive collections of labeled images. While these methods demonstrated effective performance, there remains potential for further enhancements. In this paper, we propose to utilize vision language models (VLMs) such as generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), GEMINI, large language and vision assistant (LLAVA), PaliGemma, and Microsoft Florence2 to recognize facial attributes such as race, gender, age, and emotion from images with human faces. Various datasets like FairFace, AffectNet, and UTKFace have been utilized to evaluate the solutions. The results show that VLMs are competitive if not superior to traditional techniques. Additionally, we propose "FaceScanPaliGemma"--a fine-tuned PaliGemma model--for race, gender, age, and emotion recognition. The results show an accuracy of 81.1%, 95.8%, 80%, and 59.4% for race, gender, age group, and emotion classification, respectively, outperforming pre-trained version of PaliGemma, other VLMs, and SotA methods. Finally, we propose "FaceScanGPT", which is a GPT-4o model to recognize the above attributes when several individuals are present in the image using a prompt engineered for a person with specific facial and/or physical attributes. The results underscore the superior multitasking capability of FaceScanGPT to detect the individual's attributes like hair cut, clothing color, postures, etc., using only a prompt to drive the detection and recognition tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have revolutionized generative tasks by producing high-fidelity content from text descriptions. They have also enabled an editing paradigm where concepts can be replaced through text conditioning (e.g., a dog to a tiger). In this work, we explore a novel approach: instead of replacing a concept, can we enhance or suppress the concept itself? Through an empirical study, we identify a trend where concepts can be decomposed in text-guided diffusion models. Leveraging this insight, we introduce ScalingConcept, a simple yet effective method to scale decomposed concepts up or down in real input without introducing new elements. To systematically evaluate our approach, we present the WeakConcept-10 dataset, where concepts are imperfect and need to be enhanced. More importantly, ScalingConcept enables a variety of novel zero-shot applications across image and audio domains, including tasks such as canonical pose generation and generative sound highlighting or removal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu Feng, Yucheng Xie, Jing Wang, Xin Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: Creativity, both in human and diffusion models, remains an inherently abstract concept; thus, simply adding "creative" to a prompt does not yield reliable semantic recognition by the model. In this work, we concretize the abstract notion of "creative" through the TP2O task, which aims to merge two unrelated concepts, and introduce CreTok, redefining "creative" as the token $\texttt{<CreTok>}$. This redefinition offers a more concrete and universally adaptable representation for concept blending. This redefinition occurs continuously, involving the repeated random sampling of text pairs with different concepts and optimizing cosine similarity between target and constant prompts. This approach enables $\texttt{<CreTok>}$ to learn a method for creative concept fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the creative capability enabled by $\texttt{<CreTok>}$ substantially surpasses recent SOTA diffusion models and achieves superior creative generation. CreTok exhibits greater flexibility and reduced time overhead, as $\texttt{<CreTok>}$ can function as a universal token for any concept, facilitating creative generation without retraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jay N. Paranjape, Shameema Sikder, S. Swaroop Vedula, Vishal M. Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a form of distributed learning that allows multiple institutions or clients to collaboratively learn a global model to solve a task. This allows the model to utilize the information from every institute while preserving data privacy. However, recent studies show that the promise of protecting the privacy of data is not upheld by existing methods and that it is possible to recreate the training data from the different institutions. This is done by utilizing gradients transferred between the clients and the global server during training or by knowing the model architecture at the client end. In this paper, we propose a federated learning framework for semantic segmentation without knowing the model architecture nor transferring gradients between the client and the server, thus enabling better privacy preservation. We propose BlackFed - a black-box adaptation of neural networks that utilizes zero order optimization (ZOO) to update the client model weights and first order optimization (FOO) to update the server weights. We evaluate our approach on several computer vision and medical imaging datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first works in employing federated learning for segmentation, devoid of gradients or model information exchange.

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a framework based on linear splines for 2-dimensional extended object tracking and classification. Unlike state of the art models, linear splines allow to represent extended objects whose contour is an arbitrarily complex curve. An exact likelihood is derived for the case in which noisy measurements can be scattered from any point on the contour of the extended object, while an approximate Monte Carlo likelihood is provided for the case wherein scattering points can be anywhere, i.e. inside or on the contour, on the object surface. Exploiting such likelihood to measure how well the observed data fit a given shape, a suitable estimator is developed. The proposed estimator models the extended object in terms of a kinematic state, providing object position and orientation, along with a shape vector, characterizing object contour and surface. The kinematic state is estimated via a nonlinear Kalman filter, while the shape vector is estimated via a Bayesian classifier so that classification is implicitly solved during shape estimation. Numerical experiments are provided to assess, compared to state of the art extended object estimators, the effectiveness of the proposed one.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24187">Chasing Better Deep Image Priors between Over- and Under-parameterization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiming Wu, Xiaohan Chen, Yifan Jiang, Zhangyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are well-known to act as over-parameterized deep image priors (DIP) that regularize various image inverse problems. Meanwhile, researchers also proposed extremely compact, under-parameterized image priors (e.g., deep decoder) that are strikingly competent for image restoration too, despite a loss of accuracy. These two extremes push us to think whether there exists a better solution in the middle: between over- and under-parameterized image priors, can one identify "intermediate" parameterized image priors that achieve better trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and even preserving strong transferability? Drawing inspirations from the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH), we conjecture and study a novel "lottery image prior" (LIP) by exploiting DNN inherent sparsity, stated as: given an over-parameterized DNN-based image prior, it will contain a sparse subnetwork that can be trained in isolation, to match the original DNN's performance when being applied as a prior to various image inverse problems. Our results validate the superiority of LIPs: we can successfully locate the LIP subnetworks from over-parameterized DIPs at substantial sparsity ranges. Those LIP subnetworks significantly outperform deep decoders under comparably compact model sizes (by often fully preserving the effectiveness of their over-parameterized counterparts), and they also possess high transferability across different images as well as restoration task types. Besides, we also extend LIP to compressive sensing image reconstruction, where a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the prior (in contrast to untrained DIP or deep decoder), and confirm its validity in this setting too. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that LTH is demonstrated to be relevant in the context of inverse problems or image priors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable achievements in 2D image or 3D object generation, however, the generation of 3D scenes and even $360^{\circ}$ images remains constrained, due to the limited number of scene datasets, the complexity of 3D scenes themselves, and the difficulty of generating consistent multi-view images. To address these issues, we first establish a large-scale panoramic video-text dataset containing millions of consecutive panoramic keyframes with corresponding panoramic depths, camera poses, and text descriptions. Then, we propose a novel text-driven panoramic generation framework, termed DiffPano, to achieve scalable, consistent, and diverse panoramic scene generation. Specifically, benefiting from the powerful generative capabilities of stable diffusion, we fine-tune a single-view text-to-panorama diffusion model with LoRA on the established panoramic video-text dataset. We further design a spherical epipolar-aware multi-view diffusion model to ensure the multi-view consistency of the generated panoramic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffPano can generate scalable, consistent, and diverse panoramic images with given unseen text descriptions and camera poses.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of physically-based inverse rendering using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations. While recent 3DGS methods have achieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis (NVS), accurately capturing high-fidelity geometry, physically interpretable materials and lighting remains challenging, as it requires precise geometry modeling to provide accurate surface normals, along with physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to ensure correct material and lighting disentanglement. Previous 3DGS methods resort to approximating surface normals, but often struggle with noisy local geometry, leading to inaccurate normal estimation and suboptimal material-lighting decomposition. In this paper, we introduce GeoSplatting, a novel hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with explicit geometric guidance and differentiable PBR equations. Specifically, we bridge isosurface and 3DGS together, where we first extract isosurface mesh from a scalar field, then convert it into 3DGS points and formulate PBR equations for them in a fully differentiable manner. In GeoSplatting, 3DGS is grounded on the mesh geometry, enabling precise surface normal modeling, which facilitates the use of PBR frameworks for material decomposition. This approach further maintains the efficiency and quality of NVS from 3DGS while ensuring accurate geometry from the isosurface. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoSplatting, consistently outperforming existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botao Ye, Sifei Liu, Haofei Xu, Xueting Li, Marc Pollefeys, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Songyou Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce NoPoSplat, a feed-forward model capable of reconstructing 3D scenes parameterized by 3D Gaussians from \textit{unposed} sparse multi-view images. Our model, trained exclusively with photometric loss, achieves real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction during inference. To eliminate the need for accurate pose input during reconstruction, we anchor one input view's local camera coordinates as the canonical space and train the network to predict Gaussian primitives for all views within this space. This approach obviates the need to transform Gaussian primitives from local coordinates into a global coordinate system, thus avoiding errors associated with per-frame Gaussians and pose estimation. To resolve scale ambiguity, we design and compare various intrinsic embedding methods, ultimately opting to convert camera intrinsics into a token embedding and concatenate it with image tokens as input to the model, enabling accurate scene scale prediction. We utilize the reconstructed 3D Gaussians for novel view synthesis and pose estimation tasks and propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline for accurate pose estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our pose-free approach can achieve superior novel view synthesis quality compared to pose-required methods, particularly in scenarios with limited input image overlap. For pose estimation, our method, trained without ground truth depth or explicit matching loss, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with substantial improvements. This work makes significant advances in pose-free generalizable 3D reconstruction and demonstrates its applicability to real-world scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan Duc Ngo, Peiye Zhuang, Chuang Gan, Evangelos Kalogerakis, Sergey Tulyakov, Hsin-Ying Lee, Chaoyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tracking dense 3D motion from monocular videos remains challenging, particularly when aiming for pixel-level precision over long sequences. We introduce \Approach, a novel method that efficiently tracks every pixel in 3D space, enabling accurate motion estimation across entire videos. Our approach leverages a joint global-local attention mechanism for reduced-resolution tracking, followed by a transformer-based upsampler to achieve high-resolution predictions. Unlike existing methods, which are limited by computational inefficiency or sparse tracking, \Approach delivers dense 3D tracking at scale, running over 8x faster than previous methods while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Furthermore, we explore the impact of depth representation on tracking performance and identify log-depth as the optimal choice. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of \Approach on multiple benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results in both 2D and 3D dense tracking tasks. Our method provides a robust solution for applications requiring fine-grained, long-term motion tracking in 3D space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueyang Yu, Xinlei Chen, Yossi Gandelsman</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we show that useful video representations can be learned from synthetic videos and natural images, without incorporating natural videos in the training. We propose a progression of video datasets synthesized by simple generative processes, that model a growing set of natural video properties (e.g. motion, acceleration, and shape transformations). The downstream performance of video models pre-trained on these generated datasets gradually increases with the dataset progression. A VideoMAE model pre-trained on our synthetic videos closes 97.2% of the performance gap on UCF101 action classification between training from scratch and self-supervised pre-training from natural videos, and outperforms the pre-trained model on HMDB51. Introducing crops of static images to the pre-training stage results in similar performance to UCF101 pre-training and outperforms the UCF101 pre-trained model on 11 out of 14 out-of-distribution datasets of UCF101-P. Analyzing the low-level properties of the datasets, we identify correlations between frame diversity, frame similarity to natural data, and downstream performance. Our approach provides a more controllable and transparent alternative to video data curation processes for pre-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Penghui Ruan, Pichao Wang, Divya Saxena, Jiannong Cao, Yuhui Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation, producing videos with realistic motion remains challenging. Current models often yield static or minimally dynamic outputs, failing to capture complex motions described by text. This issue stems from the internal biases in text encoding, which overlooks motions, and inadequate conditioning mechanisms in T2V generation models. To address this, we propose a novel framework called DEcomposed MOtion (DEMO), which enhances motion synthesis in T2V generation by decomposing both text encoding and conditioning into content and motion components. Our method includes a content encoder for static elements and a motion encoder for temporal dynamics, alongside separate content and motion conditioning mechanisms. Crucially, we introduce text-motion and video-motion supervision to improve the model's understanding and generation of motion. Evaluations on benchmarks such as MSR-VTT, UCF-101, WebVid-10M, EvalCrafter, and VBench demonstrate DEMO's superior ability to produce videos with enhanced motion dynamics while maintaining high visual quality. Our approach significantly advances T2V generation by integrating comprehensive motion understanding directly from textual descriptions. Project page: https://PR-Ryan.github.io/DEMO-project/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxuan Li, Chen Cao, Gabriel Schwartz, Rawal Khirodkar, Christian Richardt, Tomas Simon, Yaser Sheikh, Shunsuke Saito</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a new approach to creating photorealistic and relightable head avatars from a phone scan with unknown illumination. The reconstructed avatars can be animated and relit in real time with the global illumination of diverse environments. Unlike existing approaches that estimate parametric reflectance parameters via inverse rendering, our approach directly models learnable radiance transfer that incorporates global light transport in an efficient manner for real-time rendering. However, learning such a complex light transport that can generalize across identities is non-trivial. A phone scan in a single environment lacks sufficient information to infer how the head would appear in general environments. To address this, we build a universal relightable avatar model represented by 3D Gaussians. We train on hundreds of high-quality multi-view human scans with controllable point lights. High-resolution geometric guidance further enhances the reconstruction accuracy and generalization. Once trained, we finetune the pretrained model on a phone scan using inverse rendering to obtain a personalized relightable avatar. Our experiments establish the efficacy of our design, outperforming existing approaches while retaining real-time rendering capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abu Ahammed Babu, Sushant Kumar Pandey, Darko Durisic, Ashok Chaitanya Koppisetty, Miroslaw Staron</p>
<p>Abstract: Data leakage is a very common problem that is often overlooked during splitting data into train and test sets before training any ML/DL model. The model performance gets artificially inflated with the presence of data leakage during the evaluation phase which often leads the model to erroneous prediction on real-time deployment. However, detecting the presence of such leakage is challenging, particularly in the object detection context of perception systems where the model needs to be supplied with image data for training. In this study, we conduct a computational experiment on the Cirrus dataset from our industrial partner Volvo Cars to develop a method for detecting data leakage. We then evaluate the method on another public dataset, Kitti, which is a popular and widely accepted benchmark dataset in the automotive domain. The results show that thanks to our proposed method we are able to detect data leakage in the Kitti dataset, which was previously unknown.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Perla Mayo, Carolin M. Pirkl, Alin Achim, Bjoern H. Menze, Mohammad Golbabaee</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is a time-efficient approach to quantitative MRI, enabling the mapping of multiple tissue properties from a single, accelerated scan. However, achieving accurate reconstructions remains challenging, particularly in highly accelerated and undersampled acquisitions, which are crucial for reducing scan times. While deep learning techniques have advanced image reconstruction, the recent introduction of diffusion models offers new possibilities for imaging tasks, though their application in the medical field is still emerging. Notably, diffusion models have not yet been explored for the MRF problem. In this work, we propose for the first time a conditional diffusion probabilistic model for MRF image reconstruction. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons on in-vivo brain scan data demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform established deep learning and compressed sensing algorithms for MRF reconstruction. Extensive ablation studies also explore strategies to improve computational efficiency of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivien Sainte Fare Garnot, Lynsay Spafford, Jelle Lever, Christian Sigg, Barbara Pietragalla, Yann Vitasse, Arthur Gessler, Jan Dirk Wegner</p>
<p>Abstract: Phenology, the timing of cyclical plant life events such as leaf emergence and coloration, is crucial in the bio-climatic system. Climate change drives shifts in these phenological events, impacting ecosystems and the climate itself. Accurate phenology models are essential to predict the occurrence of these phases under changing climatic conditions. Existing methods include hypothesis-driven process models and data-driven statistical approaches. Process models account for dormancy stages and various phenology drivers, while statistical models typically rely on linear or traditional machine learning techniques. Research shows that process models often outperform statistical methods when predicting under climate conditions outside historical ranges, especially with climate change scenarios. However, deep learning approaches remain underexplored in climate phenology modeling. We introduce PhenoFormer, a neural architecture better suited than traditional statistical methods at predicting phenology under shift in climate data distribution, while also bringing significant improvements or performing on par to the best performing process-based models. Our numerical experiments on a 70-year dataset of 70,000 phenological observations from 9 woody species in Switzerland show that PhenoFormer outperforms traditional machine learning methods by an average of 13% R2 and 1.1 days RMSE for spring phenology, and 11% R2 and 0.7 days RMSE for autumn phenology, while matching or exceeding the best process-based models. Our results demonstrate that deep learning has the potential to be a valuable methodological tool for accurate climate-phenology prediction, and our PhenoFormer is a first promising step in improving phenological predictions before a complete understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azadeh Sharafi, Nikolai J. Mickevicius, Mehran Baboli, Andrew S. Nencka, Kevin M. Koch</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a variable resolution (VR) sampling and deep learning reconstruction approach for multi-spectral MRI near metal implants, aiming to reduce scan times while maintaining image quality. Background: The rising use of metal implants has increased MRI scans affected by metal artifacts. Multi-spectral imaging (MSI) reduces these artifacts but sacrifices acquisition efficiency. Methods: This retrospective study on 1.5T MSI knee and hip data from patients with metal hardware used a novel spectral undersampling scheme to improve acquisition efficiency by ~40%. U-Net-based deep learning models were trained for reconstruction. Image quality was evaluated using SSIM, PSNR, and RESI metrics. Results: Deep learning reconstructions of undersampled VR data (DL-VR) showed significantly higher SSIM and PSNR values (p<0.001) compared to conventional reconstruction (CR-VR), with improved edge sharpness. Edge sharpness in DL-reconstructed images matched fully sampled references (p=0.5). Conclusion: This approach can potentially enhance MRI examinations near metal implants by reducing scan times or enabling higher resolution. Further prospective studies are needed to assess clinical value.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in medical imaging presents a unique challenge, requiring models to adapt to new domains while retaining previously acquired knowledge. We introduce NCAdapt, a Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) based method designed to address this challenge. NCAdapt features a domain-specific multi-head structure, integrating adaptable convolutional layers into the NCA backbone for each new domain encountered. After initial training, the NCA backbone is frozen, and only the newly added adaptable convolutional layers, consisting of 384 parameters, are trained along with domain-specific NCA convolutions. We evaluate NCAdapt on hippocampus segmentation tasks, benchmarking its performance against Lifelong nnU-Net and U-Net models with state-of-the-art (SOTA) CL methods. Our lightweight approach achieves SOTA performance, underscoring its effectiveness in addressing CL challenges in medical imaging. Upon acceptance, we will make our code base publicly accessible to support reproducibility and foster further advancements in medical CL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raquel Fern\'andez-Mart\'in, Alfonso Gij\'on, Odile Feys, Elodie Juven\'e, Alec Aeby, Charline Urbain, Xavier De Ti\`ege, Vincent Wens</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows the non-invasive detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Clinical MEG analysis in epileptic patients traditionally relies on the visual identification of IEDs, which is time consuming and partially subjective. Automatic, data-driven detection methods exist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with its ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG practice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful supervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with temporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals inspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal and spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with frequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance metrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning from spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our handling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse engineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of IEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also showed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical patients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work is needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients. This study paves the way of incorporating STIED and DL algorithms into the routine clinical MEG evaluation of epilepsy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Collado, Kevin Stangl</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent approaches in machine learning often solve a task using a composition of multiple models or agentic architectures. When targeting a composed system with adversarial attacks, it might not be computationally or informationally feasible to train an end-to-end proxy model or a proxy model for every component of the system. We introduce a method to craft an adversarial attack against the overall multi-model system when we only have a proxy model for the final black-box model, and when the transformation applied by the initial models can make the adversarial perturbations ineffective. Current methods handle this by applying many copies of the first model/transformation to an input and then re-use a standard adversarial attack by averaging gradients, or learning a proxy model for both stages. To our knowledge, this is the first attack specifically designed for this threat model and our method has a substantially higher attack success rate (80% vs 25%) and contains 9.4% smaller perturbations (MSE) compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments focus on a supervised image pipeline, but we are confident the attack will generalize to other multi-model settings [e.g. a mix of open/closed source foundation models], or agentic systems</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luisa Mao, Garrett Warnell, Peter Stone, Joydeep Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous robot navigation, terrain cost assignment is typically performed using a semantics-based paradigm in which terrain is first labeled using a pre-trained semantic classifier and costs are then assigned according to a user-defined mapping between label and cost. While this approach is rapidly adaptable to changing user preferences, only preferences over the types of terrain that are already known by the semantic classifier can be expressed. In this paper, we hypothesize that a machine-learning-based alternative to the semantics-based paradigm above will allow for rapid cost assignment adaptation to preferences expressed over new terrains at deployment time without the need for additional training. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce and study PACER, a novel approach to costmap generation that accepts as input a single birds-eye view (BEV) image of the surrounding area along with a user-specified preference context and generates a corresponding BEV costmap that aligns with the preference context. Using both real and synthetic data along with a combination of proposed training tasks, we find that PACER is able to adapt quickly to new user preferences while also exhibiting better generalization to novel terrains compared to both semantics-based and representation-learning approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Gao, Wendi Yang, Yujia Li, Lei Xing, S. Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-semantic context information is crucial for visual recognition, as the human visual perception system first uses global statistics to process scenes rapidly before identifying specific objects. However, while semantic information is increasingly incorporated into computer vision tasks such as image reconstruction, non-semantic information, such as global spatial structures, is often overlooked. To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction. Extensive experimental results show that MS-Glance outperforms existing image restoration losses across both natural and medical images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucun Hou, Fenglin Zhan, Xin Cheng, Chenxi Li, Ziquan Yuan, Runze Liao, Haihao Wang, Jianlang Hua, Jing Wu, Jianyong Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a critical tool for diagnosing tumors and neurological disorders but poses radiation risks to patients, particularly to sensitive populations. While reducing injected radiation dose mitigates this risk, it often compromises image quality. To reconstruct full-dose-quality images from low-dose scans, we propose a Cycle-constrained Adversarial Denoising Convolutional Network (Cycle-DCN). This model integrates a noise predictor, two discriminators, and a consistency network, and is optimized using a combination of supervised loss, adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, identity loss, and neighboring Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset consisting of raw PET brain data from 1,224 patients, acquired using a Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner. Each patient underwent a 120-seconds brain scan. To simulate low-dose PET conditions, images were reconstructed from shortened scan durations of 30, 12, and 5 seconds, corresponding to 1/4, 1/10, and 1/24 of the full-dose acquisition, respectively, using a custom-developed GPU-based image reconstruction software. The results show that Cycle-DCN significantly improves average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), SSIM, and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) across three dose levels, with improvements of up to 56%, 35%, and 71%, respectively. Additionally, it achieves contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI) values that closely align with full-dose images, effectively preserving image details, tumor shape, and contrast, while resolving issues with blurred edges. The results of reader studies indicated that the images restored by Cycle-DCN consistently received the highest ratings from nuclear medicine physicians, highlighting their strong clinical relevance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence may assist healthcare systems in meeting increasing demand for pathology services while maintaining diagnostic quality and reducing turnaround time and costs. We aimed to investigate the performance of an institutionally developed system for prostate cancer detection, grading, and workflow optimization and to contrast this with commercial alternatives. From August 2021 to March 2023, we scanned 21,396 slides from 1,147 patients with positive biopsies. We developed models for cancer detection, grading, and screening of equivocal cases for IHC ordering. We compared a task-specific model trained using the PANDA dataset of prostate cancer biopsies with one built using features extracted by the general-purpose histology foundation model, UNI and compare their performance in an unfiltered prospectively collected dataset that reflects our patient population (1737 slides,95 patients). We evaluated the contributions of a bespoke model designed to improve sensitivity in detecting small cancer foci and scoring of broader patterns observed at lower resolution. We found high concordance between the developed systems and pathologist reference in detection (AUC 98.5, sensitivity 95.0, and specificity 97.8), ISUP grading (quadratic Cohen's kappa 0.869), grade group 3 or higher (AUC 97.5, sensitivity 94.9, specificity 96.6) and comparable to published data from commercial systems. Screening could reduce IHC ordering for equivocal cases by 44.5% with an overall error rate of 1.8% (1.4% false positive, 0.4% false negative rates). Institutions like academic medical centers that have high scanning volumes and report abstraction capabilities can develop accurate computational pathology models for internal use. These models have the potential to aid in quality control role and to improve workflow in the pathology lab to help meet future challenges in prostate cancer diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soichiro Kumano, Hiroshi Kera, Toshihiko Yamasaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial examples have raised several open questions, such as why they can deceive classifiers and transfer between different models. A prevailing hypothesis to explain these phenomena suggests that adversarial perturbations appear as random noise but contain class-specific features. This hypothesis is supported by the success of perturbation learning, where classifiers trained solely on adversarial examples and the corresponding incorrect labels generalize well to correctly labeled test data. Although this hypothesis and perturbation learning are effective in explaining intriguing properties of adversarial examples, their solid theoretical foundation is limited. In this study, we theoretically explain the counterintuitive success of perturbation learning. We assume wide two-layer networks and the results hold for any data distribution. We prove that adversarial perturbations contain sufficient class-specific features for networks to generalize from them. Moreover, the predictions of classifiers trained on mislabeled adversarial examples coincide with those of classifiers trained on correctly labeled clean samples.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Huang, Skyler Seto, Samira Abnar, David Grangier, Navdeep Jaitly, Josh Susskind</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pretrained vision-language models like CLIP have shown promising generalization capability, but may struggle in specialized domains (e.g., satellite imagery) or fine-grained classification (e.g., car models) where the visual concepts are unseen or under-represented during pretraining. Prompt learning offers a parameter-efficient finetuning framework that can adapt CLIP to downstream tasks even when limited annotation data are available. In this paper, we improve prompt learning by distilling the textual knowledge from natural language prompts (either human- or LLM-generated) to provide rich priors for those under-represented concepts. We first obtain a prompt ``summary'' aligned to each input image via a learned prompt aggregator. Then we jointly train a prompt generator, optimized to produce a prompt embedding that stays close to the aggregated summary while minimizing task loss at the same time. We dub such prompt embedding as Aggregate-and-Adapted Prompt Embedding (AAPE). AAPE is shown to be able to generalize to different downstream data distributions and tasks, including vision-language understanding tasks (e.g., few-shot classification, VQA) and generation tasks (image captioning) where AAPE achieves competitive performance. We also show AAPE is particularly helpful to handle non-canonical and OOD examples. Furthermore, AAPE learning eliminates LLM-based inference cost as required by baselines, and scales better with data and LLM model size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufeng Jiang, Zongxi Li, Xiangyan Chen, Haoran Xie, Jing Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in medical imaging have resulted in more complex and diverse images, with challenges such as high anatomical variability, blurred tissue boundaries, low organ contrast, and noise. Traditional segmentation methods struggle to address these challenges, making deep learning approaches, particularly U-shaped architectures, increasingly prominent. However, the quadratic complexity of standard self-attention makes Transformers computationally prohibitive for high-resolution images. To address these challenges, we propose MLLA-UNet (Mamba-Like Linear Attention UNet), a novel architecture that achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining high segmentation accuracy through its innovative combination of linear attention and Mamba-inspired adaptive mechanisms, complemented by an efficient symmetric sampling structure for enhanced feature processing. Our architecture effectively preserves essential spatial features while capturing long-range dependencies at reduced computational complexity. Additionally, we introduce a novel sampling strategy for multi-scale feature fusion. Experiments demonstrate that MLLA-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on six challenging datasets with 24 different segmentation tasks, including but not limited to FLARE22, AMOS CT, and ACDC, with an average DSC of 88.32%. These results underscore the superiority of MLLA-UNet over existing methods. Our contributions include the novel 2D segmentation architecture and its empirical validation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngjun Jun, Jiwoo Park, Kyobin Choo, Tae Eun Choi, Seong Jae Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Disentangled representation learning (DRL) aims to break down observed data into core intrinsic factors for a profound understanding of the data. In real-world scenarios, manually defining and labeling these factors are non-trivial, making unsupervised methods attractive. Recently, there have been limited explorations of utilizing diffusion models (DMs), which are already mainstream in generative modeling, for unsupervised DRL. They implement their own inductive bias to ensure that each latent unit input to the DM expresses only one distinct factor. In this context, we design Dynamic Gaussian Anchoring to enforce attribute-separated latent units for more interpretable DRL. This unconventional inductive bias explicitly delineates the decision boundaries between attributes while also promoting the independence among latent units. Additionally, we also propose Skip Dropout technique, which easily modifies the denoising U-Net to be more DRL-friendly, addressing its uncooperative nature with the disentangling feature extractor. Our methods, which carefully consider the latent unit semantics and the distinct DM structure, enhance the practicality of DM-based disentangled representations, demonstrating state-of-the-art disentanglement performance on both synthetic and real data, as well as advantages in downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models in medical imaging face challenges in generalizability and robustness due to variations in image acquisition parameters (IAP). In this work, we introduce a novel method using conditional denoising diffusion generative models (cDDGMs) to generate counterfactual magnetic resonance (MR) images that simulate different IAP without altering patient anatomy. We demonstrate that using these counterfactual images for data augmentation can improve segmentation accuracy, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, enhancing the overall generalizability and robustness of DL models across diverse imaging conditions. Our approach shows promise in addressing domain and covariate shifts in medical imaging. The code is publicly available at https: //github.com/pedromorao/Counterfactual-MRI-Data-Augmentation</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishal Dubey</p>
<p>Abstract: Super Resolution (SR) plays a critical role in computer vision, particularly in medical imaging, where hardware and acquisition time constraints often result in low spatial and temporal resolution. While diffusion models have been applied for both spatial and temporal SR, few studies have explored their use for joint spatial and temporal SR, particularly in medical imaging. In this work, we address this gap by proposing to use a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) combined with a Vector Quantised GAN (VQGAN)-based encoder-decoder architecture for joint super resolution. We frame SR as an image denoising problem, focusing on improving both spatial and temporal resolution in medical images. Using the cardiac MRI dataset from the Data Science Bowl Cardiac Challenge, consisting of 2D cine images with a spatial resolution of 256x256 and 8-14 slices per time-step, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our LDM model achieves Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 30.37, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.7580, and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) of 0.2756, outperforming simple baseline method by 5% in PSNR, 6.5% in SSIM, 39% in LPIPS. Our LDM model generates images with high fidelity and perceptual quality with 15 diffusion steps. These results suggest that LDMs hold promise for advancing super resolution in medical imaging, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. Code link is also shared.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinghao Wang, Pengyu Wang, Bo Wang, Dong Zhang, Yunhua Zhou, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, yet their deployment remains challenged by memory constraints on local devices. While scaling laws have enhanced LLM capabilities, the primary bottleneck has shifted from \textit{capability} to \textit{availability}, emphasizing the need for efficient memory management. Traditional compression methods, such as quantization, often require predefined compression ratios and separate compression processes for each setting, complicating deployment in variable memory environments. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BitStack}, a novel, training-free weight compression approach that enables megabyte-level trade-offs between memory usage and model performance. By leveraging weight decomposition, BitStack can dynamically adjust the model size with minimal transmission between running memory and storage devices. Our approach iteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of each parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual block in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in storage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on current memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack consistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly at extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical compression techniques like quantization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Petersen, Christian Borgelt, Stefano Ermon</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the training of the first layer of vision models and notice the clear relationship between pixel values and gradient update magnitudes: the gradients arriving at the weights of a first layer are by definition directly proportional to (normalized) input pixel values. Thus, an image with low contrast has a smaller impact on learning than an image with higher contrast, and a very bright or very dark image has a stronger impact on the weights than an image with moderate brightness. In this work, we propose performing gradient descent on the embeddings produced by the first layer of the model. However, switching to discrete inputs with an embedding layer is not a reasonable option for vision models. Thus, we propose the conceptual procedure of (i) a gradient descent step on first layer activations to construct an activation proposal, and (ii) finding the optimal weights of the first layer, i.e., those weights which minimize the squared distance to the activation proposal. We provide a closed form solution of the procedure and adjust it for robust stochastic training while computing everything efficiently. Empirically, we find that TrAct (Training Activations) speeds up training by factors between 1.25x and 4x while requiring only a small computational overhead. We demonstrate the utility of TrAct with different optimizers for a range of different vision models including convolutional and transformer architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milla E. Nielsen, Mads Nielsen, Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, and its early detection is crucial for effective intervention, yet current diagnostic methods often fall short in sensitivity and specificity. This study aims to detect significant indicators of early AD by extracting and integrating various imaging biomarkers, including radiomics, hippocampal texture descriptors, cortical thickness measurements, and deep learning features. We analyze structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts, utilizing comprehensive image analysis and machine learning techniques. Our results show that combining multiple biomarkers significantly improves detection accuracy. Radiomics and texture features emerged as the most effective predictors for early AD, achieving AUCs of 0.88 and 0.72 for AD and MCI detection, respectively. Although deep learning features proved to be less effective than traditional approaches, incorporating age with other biomarkers notably enhanced MCI detection performance. Additionally, our findings emphasize the continued importance of classical imaging biomarkers in the face of modern deep-learning approaches, providing a robust framework for early AD diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyi Cai, Zesheng Ye, Lei Feng, Jianzhong Qi, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual reprogramming (VR) leverages the intrinsic capabilities of pretrained vision models by adapting their input or output interfaces to solve downstream tasks whose labels (i.e., downstream labels) might be totally different from the labels associated with the pretrained models (i.e., pretrained labels). When adapting the output interface, label mapping methods transform the pretrained labels to downstream labels by establishing a gradient-free one-to-one correspondence between the two sets of labels. However, in this paper, we reveal that one-to-one mappings may overlook the complex relationship between pretrained and downstream labels. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Bayesian-guided Label Mapping (BLM) method. BLM constructs an iteratively-updated probabilistic label mapping matrix, with each element quantifying a pairwise relationship between pretrained and downstream labels. The assignment of values to the constructed matrix is guided by Bayesian conditional probability, considering the joint distribution of the downstream labels and the labels predicted by the pretrained model on downstream samples. Experiments conducted on both pretrained vision models (e.g., ResNeXt) and vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) demonstrate the superior performance of BLM over existing label mapping methods. The success of BLM also offers a probabilistic lens through which to understand and analyze the effectiveness of VR. Our code is available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/BayesianLM.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces the Hybrid Multi-modal VGG (HM-VGG) model, a cutting-edge deep learning approach for the early diagnosis of glaucoma. The HM-VGG model utilizes an attention mechanism to process Visual Field (VF) data, enabling the extraction of key features that are vital for identifying early signs of glaucoma. Despite the common reliance on large annotated datasets, the HM-VGG model excels in scenarios with limited data, achieving remarkable results with small sample sizes. The model's performance is underscored by its high metrics in Precision, Accuracy, and F1-Score, indicating its potential for real-world application in glaucoma detection. The paper also discusses the challenges associated with ophthalmic image analysis, particularly the difficulty of obtaining large volumes of annotated data. It highlights the importance of moving beyond single-modality data, such as VF or Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images alone, to a multimodal approach that can provide a richer, more comprehensive dataset. This integration of different data types is shown to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy. The HM- VGG model offers a promising tool for doctors, streamlining the diagnostic process and improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, its applicability extends to telemedicine and mobile healthcare, making diagnostic services more accessible. The research presented in this paper is a significant step forward in the field of medical image processing and has profound implications for clinical ophthalmology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lokendra Poudel, Sushant Jha, Ryan Meeker, Duy-Nhat Phan, Rahul Bhowmik</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) employs ultrasonic welding to bond similar or dissimilar metal foils to a substrate, resulting in solid, consolidated metal components. However, certain processing conditions can lead to inter-layer defects, affecting the final product's quality. This study develops a method to monitor in-process quality using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN models were evaluated on their ability to classify samples with and without embedded thermocouples across five power levels (300W, 600W, 900W, 1200W, 1500W) using thermal images with supervised labeling. Four distinct CNN classification models were created for different scenarios including without (baseline) and with thermocouples, only without thermocouples across power levels, only with thermocouples across power levels, and combined without and with thermocouples across power levels. The models achieved 98.29% accuracy on combined baseline and thermocouple images, 97.10% for baseline images across power levels, 97.43% for thermocouple images, and 97.27% for both types across power levels. The high accuracy, above 97%, demonstrates the system's effectiveness in identifying and classifying conditions within the UAM process, providing a reliable tool for quality assurance and process control in manufacturing environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Yixiang Dai, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</p>

<p>Abstract: When developing machine learning models, image quality assessment (IQA) measures are a crucial component for evaluation. However, commonly used IQA measures have been primarily developed and optimized for natural images. In many specialized settings, such as medical images, this poses an often-overlooked problem regarding suitability. In previous studies, the IQA measure HaarPSI showed promising behavior for natural and medical images. HaarPSI is based on Haar wavelet representations and the framework allows optimization of two parameters. So far, these parameters have been aligned for natural images. Here, we optimize these parameters for two annotated medical data sets, a photoacoustic and a chest X-Ray data set. We observe that they are more sensitive to the parameter choices than the employed natural images, and on the other hand both medical data sets lead to similar parameter values when optimized. We denote the optimized setting, which improves the performance for the medical images notably, by HaarPSI$_{MED}$. The results suggest that adapting common IQA measures within their frameworks for medical images can provide a valuable, generalizable addition to the employment of more specific task-based measures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Holographic displays hold the promise of providing authentic depth cues, resulting in enhanced immersive visual experiences for near-eye applications. However, current holographic displays are hindered by speckle noise, which limits accurate reproduction of color and texture in displayed images. We present HoloChrome, a polychromatic holographic display framework designed to mitigate these limitations. HoloChrome utilizes an ultrafast, wavelength-adjustable laser and a dual-Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) architecture, enabling the multiplexing of a large set of discrete wavelengths across the visible spectrum. By leveraging spatial separation in our dual-SLM setup, we independently manipulate speckle patterns across multiple wavelengths. This novel approach effectively reduces speckle noise through incoherent averaging achieved by wavelength multiplexing. Our method is complementary to existing speckle reduction techniques, offering a new pathway to address this challenge. Furthermore, the use of polychromatic illumination broadens the achievable color gamut compared to traditional three-color primary holographic displays.
  Our simulations and tabletop experiments validate that HoloChrome significantly reduces speckle noise and expands the color gamut. These advancements enhance the performance of holographic near-eye displays, moving us closer to practical, immersive next-generation visual experiences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations is an effective means to teach robots manipulation skills. But data acquisition is a major bottleneck in applying this paradigm more broadly, due to the amount of cost and human effort involved. There has been significant interest in imitation learning for bimanual dexterous robots, like humanoids. Unfortunately, data collection is even more challenging here due to the challenges of simultaneously controlling multiple arms and multi-fingered hands. Automated data generation in simulation is a compelling, scalable alternative to fuel this need for data. To this end, we introduce DexMimicGen, a large-scale automated data generation system that synthesizes trajectories from a handful of human demonstrations for humanoid robots with dexterous hands. We present a collection of simulation environments in the setting of bimanual dexterous manipulation, spanning a range of manipulation behaviors and different requirements for coordination among the two arms. We generate 21K demos across these tasks from just 60 source human demos and study the effect of several data generation and policy learning decisions on agent performance. Finally, we present a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline and deploy it on a real-world humanoid can sorting task. Videos and more are at https://dexmimicgen.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Yang, Shubham Ugare, Yifan Zhao, Gagandeep Singh, Sasa Misailovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed precision quantization has become an important technique for enabling the execution of deep neural networks (DNNs) on limited resource computing platforms. Traditional quantization methods have primarily concentrated on maintaining neural network accuracy, either ignoring the impact of quantization on the robustness of the network, or using only empirical techniques for improving robustness. In contrast, techniques for robustness certification, which can provide strong guarantees about the robustness of DNNs have not been used during quantization due to their high computation cost.
  This paper introduces ARQ, an innovative mixed-precision quantization method that not only preserves the clean accuracy of the smoothed classifiers but also maintains their certified robustness. ARQ uses reinforcement learning to find accurate and robust DNN quantization, while efficiently leveraging randomized smoothing, a popular class of statistical DNN verification algorithms, to guide the search process.
  We compare ARQ with multiple state-of-the-art quantization techniques on several DNN architectures commonly used in quantization studies: ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10, ResNet-50 on ImageNet, and MobileNetV2 on ImageNet. We demonstrate that ARQ consistently performs better than these baselines across all the benchmarks and the input perturbation levels. In many cases, the performance of ARQ quantized networks can reach that of the original DNN with floating-point weights, but with only 1.5% instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Xi, Yinong He, Jianing Yang, Yinpei Dai, Joyce Chai</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world scenarios, it is desirable for embodied agents to have the ability to leverage human language to gain explicit or implicit knowledge for learning tasks. Despite recent progress, most previous approaches adopt simple low-level instructions as language inputs, which may not reflect natural human communication. It's not clear how to incorporate rich language use to facilitate task learning. To address this question, this paper studies different types of language inputs in facilitating reinforcement learning (RL) embodied agents. More specifically, we examine how different levels of language informativeness (i.e., feedback on past behaviors and future guidance) and diversity (i.e., variation of language expressions) impact agent learning and inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simar Kareer, Dhruv Patel, Ryan Punamiya, Pranay Mathur, Shuo Cheng, Chen Wang, Judy Hoffman, Danfei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The scale and diversity of demonstration data required for imitation learning is a significant challenge. We present EgoMimic, a full-stack framework which scales manipulation via human embodiment data, specifically egocentric human videos paired with 3D hand tracking. EgoMimic achieves this through: (1) a system to capture human embodiment data using the ergonomic Project Aria glasses, (2) a low-cost bimanual manipulator that minimizes the kinematic gap to human data, (3) cross-domain data alignment techniques, and (4) an imitation learning architecture that co-trains on human and robot data. Compared to prior works that only extract high-level intent from human videos, our approach treats human and robot data equally as embodied demonstration data and learns a unified policy from both data sources. EgoMimic achieves significant improvement on a diverse set of long-horizon, single-arm and bimanual manipulation tasks over state-of-the-art imitation learning methods and enables generalization to entirely new scenes. Finally, we show a favorable scaling trend for EgoMimic, where adding 1 hour of additional hand data is significantly more valuable than 1 hour of additional robot data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacong Hu, Jing Gao, Jingwen Ye, Yang Gao, Xingen Wang, Zunlei Feng, Mingli Song</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, the increasing complexity and scale of parameters make training a new model increasingly resource-intensive. In this paper, we start from the classic convolutional neural network (CNN) and explore a paradigm that does not require training to obtain new models. Similar to the birth of CNN inspired by receptive fields in the biological visual system, we draw inspiration from the information subsystem pathways in the biological visual system and propose Model Disassembling and Assembling (MDA). During model disassembling, we introduce the concept of relative contribution and propose a component locating technique to extract task-aware components from trained CNN classifiers. For model assembling, we present the alignment padding strategy and parameter scaling strategy to construct a new model tailored for a specific task, utilizing the disassembled task-aware components. The entire process is akin to playing with LEGO bricks, enabling arbitrary assembly of new models, and providing a novel perspective for model creation and reuse. Extensive experiments showcase that task-aware components disassembled from CNN classifiers or new models assembled using these components closely match or even surpass the performance of the baseline, demonstrating its promising results for model reuse. Furthermore, MDA exhibits diverse potential applications, with comprehensive experiments exploring model decision route analysis, model compression, knowledge distillation, and more.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Dong, Weihao Gu, Xianjing Zhang, Jintao Xu, Rui Ai, Huimin Lu, Juho Kannala, Xieyuanli Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: High-definition (HD) semantic map generation of the environment is an essential component of autonomous driving. Existing methods have achieved good performance in this task by fusing different sensor modalities, such as LiDAR and camera. However, current works are based on raw data or network feature-level fusion and only consider short-range HD map generation, limiting their deployment to realistic autonomous driving applications. In this paper, we focus on the task of building the HD maps in both short ranges, i.e., within 30 m, and also predicting long-range HD maps up to 90 m, which is required by downstream path planning and control tasks to improve the smoothness and safety of autonomous driving. To this end, we propose a novel network named SuperFusion, exploiting the fusion of LiDAR and camera data at multiple levels. We use LiDAR depth to improve image depth estimation and use image features to guide long-range LiDAR feature prediction. We benchmark our SuperFusion on the nuScenes dataset and a self-recorded dataset and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods with large margins on all intervals. Additionally, we apply the generated HD map to a downstream path planning task, demonstrating that the long-range HD maps predicted by our method can lead to better path planning for autonomous vehicles.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuechen Guo, Wenhao Hu, Chiming Ni, Wenhao Chai, Shiyan Li, Gaoang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical images often incorporate doctor-added markers that can hinder AI-based diagnosis. This issue highlights the need of inpainting techniques to restore the corrupted visual contents. However, existing methods require manual mask annotation as input, limiting the application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel blind inpainting method that automatically reconstructs visual contents within the corrupted regions without mask input as guidance. Our model includes a blind reconstruction network and an object-aware discriminator for adversarial training. The reconstruction network contains two branches that predict corrupted regions in images and simultaneously restore the missing visual contents. Leveraging the potent recognition capability of a dense object detector, the object-aware discriminator ensures markers undetectable after inpainting. Thus, the restored images closely resemble the clean ones. We evaluate our method on three datasets of various medical imaging modalities, confirming better performance over other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Ouaknine, Teja Kattenborn, Etienne Lalibert\'e, David Rolnick</p>
<p>Abstract: Forests play a crucial role in Earth's system processes and provide a suite of social and economic ecosystem services, but are significantly impacted by human activities, leading to a pronounced disruption of the equilibrium within ecosystems. Advancing forest monitoring worldwide offers advantages in mitigating human impacts and enhancing our comprehension of forest composition, alongside the effects of climate change. While statistical modeling has traditionally found applications in forest biology, recent strides in machine learning and computer vision have reached important milestones using remote sensing data, such as tree species identification, tree crown segmentation and forest biomass assessments. For this, the significance of open access data remains essential in enhancing such data-driven algorithms and methodologies. Here, we provide a comprehensive and extensive overview of 86 open access forest datasets across spatial scales, encompassing inventories, ground-based, aerial-based, satellite-based recordings, and country or world maps. These datasets are grouped in OpenForest, a dynamic catalogue open to contributions that strives to reference all available open access forest datasets. Moreover, in the context of these datasets, we aim to inspire research in machine learning applied to forest biology by establishing connections between contemporary topics, perspectives and challenges inherent in both domains. We hope to encourage collaborations among scientists, fostering the sharing and exploration of diverse datasets through the application of machine learning methods for large-scale forest monitoring.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongzhi Ruan, Haibao Yu, Wenxian Yang, Siqi Fan, Zaiqing Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion forecasting is an essential task for autonomous driving, and utilizing information from infrastructure and other vehicles can enhance forecasting capabilities. Existing research mainly focuses on leveraging single-frame cooperative information to enhance the limited perception capability of the ego vehicle, while underutilizing the motion and interaction context of traffic participants observed from cooperative devices. In this paper, we propose a forecasting-oriented representation paradigm to utilize motion and interaction features from cooperative information. Specifically, we present V2X-Graph, a representative framework to achieve interpretable and end-to-end trajectory feature fusion for cooperative motion forecasting. V2X-Graph is evaluated on V2X-Seq in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. To further evaluate on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) scenario, we construct the first real-world V2X motion forecasting dataset V2X-Traj, which contains multiple autonomous vehicles and infrastructure in every scenario. Experimental results on both V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj show the advantage of our method. We hope both V2X-Graph and V2X-Traj will benefit the further development of cooperative motion forecasting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thangarajah Akilan, Hrishikesh Vachhani</p>
<p>Abstract: Pedestrian detection has become a cornerstone for several high-level tasks, including autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and traffic surveillance. There are several works focussed on pedestrian detection using visible images, mainly in the daytime. However, this task is very intriguing when the environmental conditions change to poor lighting or nighttime. Recently, new ideas have been spurred to use alternative sources, such as Far InfraRed (FIR) temperature sensor feeds for detecting pedestrians in low-light conditions. This study reviews recent developments in low-light pedestrian detection approaches. It systematically categorizes and analyses various algorithms from region-based to non-region-based and graph-based learning methodologies by highlighting their methodologies, implementation issues, and challenges. It also outlines the key benchmark datasets that can be used for research and development of advanced pedestrian detection algorithms, particularly in low-light situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeqing Wang, Wentao Wan, Qiqing Lao, Runmeng Chen, Minjie Lang, Keze Wang, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, to comprehensively improve Vision Language Models (VLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA), several methods have been proposed to further reinforce the inference capabilities of VLMs to independently tackle VQA tasks rather than some methods that only utilize VLMs as aids to Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these methods ignore the rich common-sense knowledge inside the given VQA image sampled from the real world. Thus, they cannot fully use the powerful VLM for the given VQA question to achieve optimal performance. Attempt to overcome this limitation and inspired by the human top-down reasoning process, i.e., systematically exploring relevant issues to derive a comprehensive answer, this work introduces a novel, explainable multi-agent collaboration framework by leveraging the expansive knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the capabilities of VLMs themselves. Specifically, our framework comprises three agents, i.e., Responder, Seeker, and Integrator, to collaboratively answer the given VQA question by seeking its relevant issues and generating the final answer in such a top-down reasoning process. The VLM-based Responder agent generates the answer candidates for the question and responds to other relevant issues. The Seeker agent, primarily based on LLM, identifies relevant issues related to the question to inform the Responder agent and constructs a Multi-View Knowledge Base (MVKB) for the given visual scene by leveraging the build-in world knowledge of LLM. The Integrator agent combines knowledge from the Seeker agent and the Responder agent to produce the final VQA answer. Extensive and comprehensive evaluations on diverse VQA datasets with a variety of VLMs demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our framework over the baseline method in the zero-shot setting without extra training cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christoph H\"ummer, Manuel Schwonberg, Liangwei Zhou, Hu Cao, Alois Knoll, Hanno Gottschalk</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) remains a significant challenge for perception based on deep neural networks (DNNs), where domain shifts occur due to synthetic data, lighting, weather, or location changes. Vision-language models (VLMs) marked a large step for the generalization capabilities and have been already applied to various tasks. Very recently, first approaches utilized VLMs for domain generalized segmentation and object detection and obtained strong generalization. However, all these approaches rely on complex modules, feature augmentation frameworks or additional models. Surprisingly and in contrast to that, we found that simple fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models yields competitive or even stronger generalization results while being extremely simple to apply. Moreover, we found that vision-language pre-training consistently provides better generalization than the previous standard of vision-only pre-training. This challenges the standard of using ImageNet-based transfer learning for domain generalization. Fully fine-tuning a vision-language pre-trained model is capable of reaching the domain generalization SOTA when training on the synthetic GTA5 dataset. Moreover, we confirm this observation for object detection on a novel synthetic-to-real benchmark. We further obtain superior generalization capabilities by reaching 77.9% mIoU on the popular Cityscapes-to-ACDC benchmark. We also found improved in-domain generalization, leading to an improved SOTA of 86.4% mIoU on the Cityscapes test set marking the first place on the leaderboard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Guo, Vishal Asnani, Sijia Liu, Xiaoming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model Parsing defines the research task of predicting hyperparameters of the generative model (GM), given a generated image as input. Since a diverse set of hyperparameters is jointly employed by the generative model, and dependencies often exist among them, it is crucial to learn these hyperparameter dependencies for the improved model parsing performance. To explore such important dependencies, we propose a novel model parsing method called Learnable Graph Pooling Network (LGPN). Specifically, we transform model parsing into a graph node classification task, using graph nodes and edges to represent hyperparameters and their dependencies, respectively. Furthermore, LGPN incorporates a learnable pooling-unpooling mechanism tailored to model parsing, which adaptively learns hyperparameter dependencies of GMs used to generate the input image. We also extend our proposed method to CNN-generated image detection and coordinate attacks detection. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art results in model parsing and its extended applications, showing the effectiveness of our method. Our source code are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Yang, Yingzhe Peng, Haoxuan Ma, Shuo Xu, Chi Zhang, Yucheng Han, Hanwang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As Archimedes famously said, ``Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world'', in this study, we propose to use a tiny Language Model (LM), \eg, a Transformer with 67M parameters, to lever much larger Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with 9B parameters. Specifically, we use this tiny \textbf{Lever-LM} to configure effective in-context demonstration (ICD) sequences to improve the In-Context Learinng (ICL) performance of LVLMs. Previous studies show that diverse ICD configurations like the selection and ordering of the demonstrations heavily affect the ICL performance, highlighting the significance of configuring effective ICD sequences. Motivated by this and by re-considering the the process of configuring ICD sequence, we find this is a mirror process of human sentence composition and further assume that effective ICD configurations may contain internal statistical patterns that can be captured by Lever-LM. Then a dataset with effective ICD sequences is constructed to train Lever-LM. After training, given novel queries, new ICD sequences are configured by the trained Lever-LM to solve vision-language tasks through ICL. Experiments show that these ICD sequences can improve the ICL performance of two LVLMs compared with some strong baselines in Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning, validating that Lever-LM can really capture the statistical patterns for levering LVLMs. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ForJadeForest/Lever-LM}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young Joo Han, Ha-Jin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling and synthesizing real sRGB noise is crucial for various low-level vision tasks, such as building datasets for training image denoising systems. The distribution of real sRGB noise is highly complex and affected by a multitude of factors, making its accurate modeling extremely challenging. Therefore, recent studies have proposed methods that employ data-driven generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Normalizing Flows. These studies achieve more accurate modeling of sRGB noise compared to traditional noise modeling methods. However, there are performance limitations due to the inherent characteristics of each generative model. To address this issue, we propose NM-FlowGAN, a hybrid approach that exploits the strengths of both GAN and Normalizing Flows. We combine pixel-wise noise modeling networks based on Normalizing Flows and spatial correlation modeling networks based on GAN. Specifically, the pixel-wise noise modeling network leverages the high training stability of Normalizing Flows to capture noise characteristics that are affected by a multitude of factors, and the spatial correlation networks efficiently model pixel-to-pixel relationships. In particular, unlike recent methods that rely on paired noisy images, our method synthesizes noise using clean images and factors that affect noise characteristics, such as easily obtainable parameters like camera type and ISO settings, making it applicable to various fields where obtaining noisy-clean image pairs is not feasible. In our experiments, our NM-FlowGAN outperforms other baselines in the sRGB noise synthesis task. Moreover, the denoising neural network trained with synthesized image pairs from our model shows superior performance compared to other baselines.

<p>Abstract: Progress in human behavior modeling involves understanding both implicit, early-stage perceptual behavior, such as human attention, and explicit, later-stage behavior, such as subjective preferences or likes. Yet most prior research has focused on modeling implicit and explicit human behavior in isolation; and often limited to a specific type of visual content. We propose UniAR -- a unified model of human attention and preference behavior across diverse visual content. UniAR leverages a multimodal transformer to predict subjective feedback, such as satisfaction or aesthetic quality, along with the underlying human attention or interaction heatmaps and viewing order. We train UniAR on diverse public datasets spanning natural images, webpages, and graphic designs, and achieve SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks across various image domains and behavior modeling tasks. Potential applications include providing instant feedback on the effectiveness of UIs/visual content, and enabling designers and content-creation models to optimize their creation for human-centric improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Following step-by-step procedures is an essential component of various activities carried out by individuals in their daily lives. These procedures serve as a guiding framework that helps to achieve goals efficiently, whether it is assembling furniture or preparing a recipe. However, the complexity and duration of procedural activities inherently increase the likelihood of making errors. Understanding such procedural activities from a sequence of frames is a challenging task that demands an accurate interpretation of visual information and the ability to reason about the structure of the activity. To this end, we collect a new egocentric 4D dataset, CaptainCook4D, comprising 384 recordings (94.5 hours) of people performing recipes in real kitchen environments. This dataset consists of two distinct types of activity: one in which participants adhere to the provided recipe instructions and another in which they deviate and induce errors. We provide 5.3K step annotations and 10K fine-grained action annotations and benchmark the dataset for the following tasks: supervised error recognition, multistep localization, and procedure learning</p>

<p>Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation aims to adapt a source-trained model to an unlabeled target domain without access to the source data. It has attracted growing attention in recent years, where existing approaches focus on self-training that usually includes pseudo-labeling techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel noise-learning approach tailored to address noise distribution in domain adaptation settings and learn to de-confuse the pseudo-labels. More specifically, we learn a noise transition matrix of the pseudo-labels to capture the label corruption of each class and learn the underlying true label distribution. Estimating the noise transition matrix enables a better true class-posterior estimation, resulting in better prediction accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when combined with several source-free domain adaptation methods: SHOT, SHOT++, and AaD. We obtain state-of-the-art results on three domain adaptation datasets: VisDA, DomainNet, and OfficeHome.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuhao Liu, Ke Wang, Jieqi Shi, Zhijian Qiao, Shaojie Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic mapping based on the supervised object detectors is sensitive to image distribution. In real-world environments, the object detection and segmentation performance can lead to a major drop, preventing the use of semantic mapping in a wider domain. On the other hand, the development of vision-language foundation models demonstrates a strong zero-shot transferability across data distribution. It provides an opportunity to construct generalizable instance-aware semantic maps. Hence, this work explores how to boost instance-aware semantic mapping from object detection generated from foundation models. We propose a probabilistic label fusion method to predict close-set semantic classes from open-set label measurements. An instance refinement module merges the over-segmented instances caused by inconsistent segmentation. We integrate all the modules into a unified semantic mapping system. Reading a sequence of RGB-D input, our work incrementally reconstructs an instance-aware semantic map. We evaluate the zero-shot performance of our method in ScanNet and SceneNN datasets. Our method achieves 40.3 mean average precision (mAP) on the ScanNet semantic instance segmentation task. It outperforms the traditional semantic mapping method significantly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) finds widespread applications in security surveillance, traffic monitoring, industrial monitoring, and healthcare. Despite extensive research efforts, there remains a lack of concise reviews that provide insightful guidance for researchers. Such reviews would serve as quick references to grasp current challenges, research trends, and future directions. In this paper, we present such a review, examining models and datasets from various perspectives. We emphasize the critical relationship between model and dataset, where the quality and diversity of datasets profoundly influence model performance, and dataset development adapts to the evolving needs of emerging approaches. Our review identifies practical issues, including the absence of comprehensive datasets with diverse scenarios. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Multi-Scenario Anomaly Detection (MSAD), comprising 14 distinct scenarios captured from various camera views. Our dataset has diverse motion patterns and challenging variations, such as different lighting and weather conditions, providing a robust foundation for training superior models. We conduct an in-depth analysis of recent representative models using MSAD and highlight its potential in addressing the challenges of detecting anomalies across diverse and evolving surveillance scenarios.

<p>Abstract: We present a novel bi-directional Transformer architecture (BiXT) which scales linearly with input size in terms of computational cost and memory consumption, but does not suffer the drop in performance or limitation to only one input modality seen with other efficient Transformer-based approaches. BiXT is inspired by the Perceiver architectures but replaces iterative attention with an efficient bi-directional cross-attention module in which input tokens and latent variables attend to each other simultaneously, leveraging a naturally emerging attention-symmetry between the two. This approach unlocks a key bottleneck experienced by Perceiver-like architectures and enables the processing and interpretation of both semantics ('what') and location ('where') to develop alongside each other over multiple layers -- allowing its direct application to dense and instance-based tasks alike. By combining efficiency with the generality and performance of a full Transformer architecture, BiXT can process longer sequences like point clouds, text or images at higher feature resolutions and achieves competitive performance across a range of tasks like point cloud part segmentation, semantic image segmentation, image classification, hierarchical sequence modeling and document retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that BiXT models outperform larger competitors by leveraging longer sequences more efficiently on vision tasks like classification and segmentation, and perform on par with full Transformer variants on sequence modeling and document retrieval -- but require $28\%$ fewer FLOPs and are up to $8.4\times$ faster.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Hassani, Wen-Mei Hwu, Humphrey Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Neighborhood attention reduces the cost of self attention by restricting each token's attention span to its nearest neighbors. This restriction, parameterized by a window size and dilation factor, draws a spectrum of possible attention patterns between linear projection and self attention. Neighborhood attention, and more generally sliding window attention patterns, have long been bounded by infrastructure, particularly in higher-rank spaces (2-D and 3-D), calling for the development of custom kernels, which have been limited in either functionality, or performance, if not both. In this work, we aim to massively improve upon existing infrastructure by providing two new methods for implementing neighborhood attention. We first show that neighborhood attention can be represented as a batched GEMM problem, similar to standard attention, and implement it for 1-D and 2-D neighborhood attention. These kernels on average provide 895% and 272% improvement in full precision runtime compared to existing naive CUDA kernels for 1-D and 2-D neighborhood attention respectively. We find that aside from being heavily bound by memory bandwidth, certain inherent inefficiencies exist in all unfused implementations of neighborhood attention, which in most cases undo their theoretical efficiency gain. Motivated by the progress made into fused dot-product attention kernels, we developed fused neighborhood attention; an adaptation of fused dot-product attention kernels that allow fine-grained control over attention across different spatial axes. Known for reducing the quadratic time complexity of self attention to a linear complexity, neighborhood attention can now enjoy a reduced and constant memory footprint, and record-breaking half precision runtime. We observe that our fused implementation successfully circumvents some of the unavoidable inefficiencies in unfused implementations...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandr Matsun, Numan Saeed, Fadillah Adamsyah Maani, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical data often exhibits distribution shifts, which cause test-time performance degradation for deep learning models trained using standard supervised learning pipelines. This challenge is addressed in the field of Domain Generalization (DG) with the sub-field of Single Domain Generalization (SDG) being specifically interesting due to the privacy- or logistics-related issues often associated with medical data. Existing disentanglement-based SDG methods heavily rely on structural information embedded in segmentation masks, however classification labels do not provide such dense information. This work introduces a novel SDG method aimed at medical image classification that leverages channel-wise contrastive disentanglement. It is further enhanced with reconstruction-based style regularization to ensure extraction of distinct style and structure feature representations. We evaluate our method on the complex task of multicenter histopathology image classification, comparing it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) SDG baselines. Results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA by a margin of 1% in average accuracy while also showing more stable performance. This study highlights the importance and challenges of exploring SDG frameworks in the context of the classification task.

<p>Abstract: We introduce GeoGS3D, a novel two-stage framework for reconstructing detailed 3D objects from single-view images. Inspired by the success of pre-trained 2D diffusion models, our method incorporates an orthogonal plane decomposition mechanism to extract 3D geometric features from the 2D input, facilitating the generation of multi-view consistent images. During the following Gaussian Splatting, these images are fused with epipolar attention, fully utilizing the geometric correlations across views. Moreover, we propose a novel metric, Gaussian Divergence Significance (GDS), to prune unnecessary operations during optimization, significantly accelerating the reconstruction process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoGS3D generates images with high consistency across views and reconstructs high-quality 3D objects, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saurav Jha, Dong Gong, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to help deep neural networks learn new knowledge while retaining what has been learned. Owing to their powerful generalizability, pre-trained vision-language models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have lately gained traction as practical CL candidates. However, the domain mismatch between the pre-training and the downstream CL tasks often calls for finetuning of the CLIP on the latter. Most existing finetuning methods exhibit deterministic nature. This makes them overlook the many possible interactions across the input modalities and deems them unsafe for high-risk tasks requiring reliable uncertainty estimation. To address these, our work proposes Continual LeArning with Probabilistic finetuning (CLAP) - a probabilistic modeling framework over visual-guided text features per task, thus providing more calibrated CL finetuning. Unlike recent data-hungry anti-forgetting CL techniques, CLAP alleviates forgetting by exploiting the rich pre-trained knowledge of CLIP for weight initialization and distribution regularization of task-specific parameters. Cooperating with the diverse range of existing prompting methods, CLAP can surpass the predominant deterministic finetuning approaches for CL with CLIP. We conclude with out-of-the-box applications of superior uncertainty estimation abilities of CLAP including novel data detection and exemplar selection within the existing CL setups.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aimon Rahman, Malsha V. Perera, Vishal M. Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: Building on the momentum of image generation diffusion models, there is an increasing interest in video-based diffusion models. However, video generation poses greater challenges due to its higher-dimensional nature, the scarcity of training data, and the complex spatiotemporal relationships involved. Image generation models, due to their extensive data requirements, have already strained computational resources to their limits. There have been instances of these models reproducing elements from the training samples, leading to concerns and even legal disputes over sample replication. Video diffusion models, which operate with even more constrained datasets and are tasked with generating both spatial and temporal content, may be more prone to replicating samples from their training sets. Compounding the issue, these models are often evaluated using metrics that inadvertently reward replication. In our paper, we present a systematic investigation into the phenomenon of sample replication in video diffusion models. We scrutinize various recent diffusion models for video synthesis, assessing their tendency to replicate spatial and temporal content in both unconditional and conditional generation scenarios. Our study identifies strategies that are less likely to lead to replication. Furthermore, we propose new evaluation strategies that take replication into account, offering a more accurate measure of a model's ability to generate the original content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Zhang, Yiji Cheng, Jiaolong Yang, Chunyu Wang, Feng Zhao, Yansong Tang, Dong Chen, Baining Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a radiance representation that is both structured and fully explicit and thus greatly facilitates 3D generative modeling. Existing radiance representations either require an implicit feature decoder, which significantly degrades the modeling power of the representation, or are spatially unstructured, making them difficult to integrate with mainstream 3D diffusion methods. We derive GaussianCube by first using a novel densification-constrained Gaussian fitting algorithm, which yields high-accuracy fitting using a fixed number of free Gaussians, and then rearranging these Gaussians into a predefined voxel grid via Optimal Transport. Since GaussianCube is a structured grid representation, it allows us to use standard 3D U-Net as our backbone in diffusion modeling without elaborate designs. More importantly, the high-accuracy fitting of the Gaussians allows us to achieve a high-quality representation with orders of magnitude fewer parameters than previous structured representations for comparable quality, ranging from one to two orders of magnitude. The compactness of GaussianCube greatly eases the difficulty of 3D generative modeling. Extensive experiments conducted on unconditional and class-conditioned object generation, digital avatar creation, and text-to-3D synthesis all show that our model achieves state-of-the-art generation results both qualitatively and quantitatively, underscoring the potential of GaussianCube as a highly accurate and versatile radiance representation for 3D generative modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Saxon, Fatima Jahara, Mahsa Khoshnoodi, Yujie Lu, Aditya Sharma, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With advances in the quality of text-to-image (T2I) models has come interest in benchmarking their prompt faithfulness -- the semantic coherence of generated images to the prompts they were conditioned on. A variety of T2I faithfulness metrics have been proposed, leveraging advances in cross-modal embeddings and vision-language models (VLMs). However, these metrics are not rigorously compared and benchmarked, instead presented with correlation to human Likert scores over a set of easy-to-discriminate images against seemingly weak baselines.
  We introduce T2IScoreScore, a curated set of semantic error graphs containing a prompt and a set of increasingly erroneous images. These allow us to rigorously judge whether a given prompt faithfulness metric can correctly order images with respect to their objective error count and significantly discriminate between different error nodes, using meta-metric scores derived from established statistical tests. Surprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art VLM-based metrics (e.g., TIFA, DSG, LLMScore, VIEScore) we tested fail to significantly outperform simple (and supposedly worse) feature-based metrics like CLIPScore, particularly on a hard subset of naturally-occurring T2I model errors. TS2 will enable the development of better T2I prompt faithfulness metrics through more rigorous comparison of their conformity to expected orderings and separations under objective criteria.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce VASA, a framework for generating lifelike talking faces with appealing visual affective skills (VAS) given a single static image and a speech audio clip. Our premiere model, VASA-1, is capable of not only generating lip movements that are exquisitely synchronized with the audio, but also producing a large spectrum of facial nuances and natural head motions that contribute to the perception of authenticity and liveliness. The core innovations include a holistic facial dynamics and head movement generation model that works in a face latent space, and the development of such an expressive and disentangled face latent space using videos. Through extensive experiments including evaluation on a set of new metrics, we show that our method significantly outperforms previous methods along various dimensions comprehensively. Our method not only delivers high video quality with realistic facial and head dynamics but also supports the online generation of 512x512 videos at up to 40 FPS with negligible starting latency. It paves the way for real-time engagements with lifelike avatars that emulate human conversational behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuofan Zong, Bingqi Ma, Dazhong Shen, Guanglu Song, Hao Shao, Dongzhi Jiang, Hongsheng Li, Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: As the key component in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the ability of the visual encoder greatly affects MLLM's understanding on diverse image content. Although some large-scale pretrained vision encoders such as vision encoders in CLIP and DINOv2 have brought promising performance, we found that there is still no single vision encoder that can dominate various image content understanding, e.g., the CLIP vision encoder leads to outstanding results on general image understanding but poor performance on document or chart content. To alleviate the bias of CLIP vision encoder, we first delve into the inherent behavior of different pre-trained vision encoders and then propose the MoVA, a powerful and novel MLLM, adaptively routing and fusing task-specific vision experts with a coarse-to-fine mechanism. In the coarse-grained stage, we design a context-aware expert routing strategy to dynamically select the most suitable vision experts according to the user instruction, input image, and expertise of vision experts. This benefits from the powerful model function understanding ability of the large language model (LLM). In the fine-grained stage, we elaborately conduct the mixture-of-vision-expert adapter (MoV-Adapter) to extract and fuse task-specific knowledge from various experts. This coarse-to-fine paradigm effectively leverages representations from experts based on multimodal context and model expertise, further enhancing the generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Without any bells and whistles, MoVA can achieve significant performance gains over current state-of-the-art methods in a wide range of challenging multimodal benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junfeng Ni, Yixin Chen, Bohan Jing, Nan Jiang, Bin Wang, Bo Dai, Puhao Li, Yixin Zhu, Song-Chun Zhu, Siyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the issue of physical implausibility in multi-view neural reconstruction. While implicit representations have gained popularity in multi-view 3D reconstruction, previous work struggles to yield physically plausible results, limiting their utility in domains requiring rigorous physical accuracy. This lack of plausibility stems from the absence of physics modeling in existing methods and their inability to recover intricate geometrical structures. In this paper, we introduce PHYRECON, the first approach to leverage both differentiable rendering and differentiable physics simulation to learn implicit surface representations. PHYRECON features a novel differentiable particle-based physical simulator built on neural implicit representations. Central to this design is an efficient transformation between SDF-based implicit representations and explicit surface points via our proposed Surface Points Marching Cubes (SP-MC), enabling differentiable learning with both rendering and physical losses. Additionally, PHYRECON models both rendering and physical uncertainty to identify and compensate for inconsistent and inaccurate monocular geometric priors. The physical uncertainty further facilitates physics-guided pixel sampling to enhance the learning of slender structures. By integrating these techniques, our model supports differentiable joint modeling of appearance, geometry, and physics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHYRECON significantly improves the reconstruction quality. Our results also exhibit superior physical stability in physical simulators, with at least a 40% improvement across all datasets, paving the way for future physics-based applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Guo, Shuai Lu, Weihang Zhang, Fang Chen, Hongen Liao, Huiqi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies highlighted a practical setting of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) that builds a unified model for multi-class images, serving as an alternative to the conventional one-class-one-model setup. Despite various advancements addressing this challenging task, the detection performance under the multi-class setting still lags far behind state-of-the-art class-separated models. Our research aims to bridge this substantial performance gap. In this paper, we introduce a minimalistic reconstruction-based anomaly detection framework, namely Dinomaly, which leverages pure Transformer architectures without relying on complex designs, additional modules, or specialized tricks. Given this powerful framework consisted of only Attentions and MLPs, we found four simple components that are essential to multi-class anomaly detection: (1) Foundation Transformers that extracts universal and discriminative features, (2) Noisy Bottleneck where pre-existing Dropouts do all the noise injection tricks, (3) Linear Attention that naturally cannot focus, and (4) Loose Reconstruction that does not force layer-to-layer and point-by-point reconstruction. Extensive experiments are conducted across popular anomaly detection benchmarks including MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD. Our proposed Dinomaly achieves impressive image-level AUROC of 99.6%, 98.7%, and 89.3% on the three datasets respectively, which is not only superior to state-of-the-art multi-class UAD methods, but also achieves the most advanced class-separated UAD records.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents PipeFusion, an innovative parallel methodology to tackle the high latency issues associated with generating high-resolution images using diffusion transformers (DiTs) models. PipeFusion partitions images into patches and the model layers across multiple GPUs. It employs a patch-level pipeline parallel strategy to orchestrate communication and computation efficiently. By capitalizing on the high similarity between inputs from successive diffusion steps, PipeFusion reuses one-step stale feature maps to provide context for the current pipeline step. This approach notably reduces communication costs compared to existing DiTs inference parallelism, including tensor parallel, sequence parallel and DistriFusion. PipeFusion also exhibits superior memory efficiency, because it can distribute model parameters across multiple devices, making it more suitable for DiTs with large parameter sizes, such as Flux.1. Experimental results demonstrate that PipeFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8xL40 PCIe GPUs for Pixart, Stable-Diffusion 3 and Flux.1 models.Our Source code is available at https://github.com/xdit-project/xDiT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyue Jia, Yiding Liu, Xiaopeng Li, Yuhao Wang, Yantong Du, Xiao Han, Xuetao Wei, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Xiangyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Worldwide geolocalization aims to locate the precise location at the coordinate level of photos taken anywhere on the Earth. It is very challenging due to 1) the difficulty of capturing subtle location-aware visual semantics, and 2) the heterogeneous geographical distribution of image data. As a result, existing studies have clear limitations when scaled to a worldwide context. They may easily confuse distant images with similar visual contents, or cannot adapt to various locations worldwide with different amounts of relevant data. To resolve these limitations, we propose G3, a novel framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In particular, G3 consists of three steps, i.e., Geo-alignment, Geo-diversification, and Geo-verification to optimize both retrieval and generation phases of worldwide geolocalization. During Geo-alignment, our solution jointly learns expressive multi-modal representations for images, GPS and textual descriptions, which allows us to capture location-aware semantics for retrieving nearby images for a given query. During Geo-diversification, we leverage a prompt ensembling method that is robust to inconsistent retrieval performance for different image queries. Finally, we combine both retrieved and generated GPS candidates in Geo-verification for location prediction. Experiments on two well-established datasets IM2GPS3k and YFCC4k verify the superiority of G3 compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our code and data are available online for reproduction.</p>

<p>Abstract: World models empower model-based agents to interactively explore, reason, and plan within imagined environments for real-world decision-making. However, the high demand for interactivity poses challenges in harnessing recent advancements in video generative models for developing world models at scale. This work introduces Interactive VideoGPT (iVideoGPT), a scalable autoregressive transformer framework that integrates multimodal signals--visual observations, actions, and rewards--into a sequence of tokens, facilitating an interactive experience of agents via next-token prediction. iVideoGPT features a novel compressive tokenization technique that efficiently discretizes high-dimensional visual observations. Leveraging its scalable architecture, we are able to pre-train iVideoGPT on millions of human and robotic manipulation trajectories, establishing a versatile foundation that is adaptable to serve as interactive world models for a wide range of downstream tasks. These include action-conditioned video prediction, visual planning, and model-based reinforcement learning, where iVideoGPT achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ted Lentsch, Holger Caesar, Dariu M. Gavrila</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised 3D object detection methods have emerged to leverage vast amounts of data without requiring manual labels for training. Recent approaches rely on dynamic objects for learning to detect mobile objects but penalize the detections of static instances during training. Multiple rounds of (self) training are used to add detected static instances to the set of training targets; this procedure to improve performance is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose the method UNION. We use spatial clustering and self-supervised scene flow to obtain a set of static and dynamic object proposals from LiDAR. Subsequently, object proposals' visual appearances are encoded to distinguish static objects in the foreground and background by selecting static instances that are visually similar to dynamic objects. As a result, static and dynamic mobile objects are obtained together, and existing detectors can be trained with a single training. In addition, we extend 3D object discovery to detection by using object appearance-based cluster labels as pseudo-class labels for training object classification. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset and increase the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D object discovery, i.e. UNION more than doubles the average precision to 38.4.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Moskalenko, Anastasiia Kornilova, Gonzalo Ferrer</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerial imagery and its direct application to visual localization is an essential problem for many Robotics and Computer Vision tasks. While Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are the standard default solution for solving the aerial localization problem, it is subject to a number of limitations, such as, signal instability or solution unreliability that make this option not so desirable. Consequently, visual geolocalization is emerging as a viable alternative. However, adapting Visual Place Recognition (VPR) task to aerial imagery presents significant challenges, including weather variations and repetitive patterns. Current VPR reviews largely neglect the specific context of aerial data. This paper introduces a methodology tailored for evaluating VPR techniques specifically in the domain of aerial imagery, providing a comprehensive assessment of various methods and their performance. However, we not only compare various VPR methods, but also demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate zoom and overlap levels when constructing map tiles to achieve maximum efficiency of VPR algorithms in the case of aerial imagery.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingzhen Huang, Jialing Cai, Shan Jia, Vishnu Suresh Lokhande, Siwei Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-driven image synthesis has made significant advancements with the development of diffusion models, transforming how visual content is generated from text prompts. Despite these advances, text-driven image editing, a key area in computer graphics, faces unique challenges. A major challenge is making simultaneous edits across multiple objects or attributes. Applying these methods sequentially for multi-attribute edits increases computational demands and efficiency losses. In this paper, we address these challenges with significant contributions. Our main contribution is the development of ParallelEdits, a method that seamlessly manages simultaneous edits across multiple attributes. In contrast to previous approaches, ParallelEdits not only preserves the quality of single attribute edits but also significantly improves the performance of multitasking edits. This is achieved through innovative attention distribution mechanism and multi-branch design that operates across several processing heads. Additionally, we introduce the PIE-Bench++ dataset, an expansion of the original PIE-Bench dataset, to better support evaluating image-editing tasks involving multiple objects and attributes simultaneously. This dataset is a benchmark for evaluating text-driven image editing methods in multifaceted scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Hu, Bowen Song, Xiaojian Xu, Liyue Shen, Jeffrey A. Fessler</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models can learn strong image priors from underlying data distribution and use them to solve inverse problems, but the training process is computationally expensive and requires lots of data. Such bottlenecks prevent most existing works from being feasible for high-dimensional and high-resolution data such as 3D images. This paper proposes a method to learn an efficient data prior for the entire image by training diffusion models only on patches of images. Specifically, we propose a patch-based position-aware diffusion inverse solver, called PaDIS, where we obtain the score function of the whole image through scores of patches and their positional encoding and utilize this as the prior for solving inverse problems. First of all, we show that this diffusion model achieves an improved memory efficiency and data efficiency while still maintaining the capability to generate entire images via positional encoding. Additionally, the proposed PaDIS model is highly flexible and can be plugged in with different diffusion inverse solvers (DIS). We demonstrate that the proposed PaDIS approach enables solving various inverse problems in both natural and medical image domains, including CT reconstruction, deblurring, and superresolution, given only patch-based priors. Notably, PaDIS outperforms previous DIS methods trained on entire image priors in the case of limited training data, demonstrating the data efficiency of our proposed approach by learning patch-based prior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew J Allen, Francisco Dorr, Joseph Alejandro Gallego Mejia, Laura Mart\'inez-Ferrer, Anna Jungbluth, Freddie Kalaitzis, Ra\'ul Ramos-Poll\'an</p>
<p>Abstract: Satellite-based remote sensing has revolutionised the way we address global challenges. Huge quantities of Earth Observation (EO) data are generated by satellite sensors daily, but processing these large datasets for use in ML pipelines is technically and computationally challenging. While some preprocessed Earth observation datasets exist, their content is often limited to optical or near-optical wavelength data, which is ineffective at night or in adverse weather conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), an active sensing technique based on microwave length radiation, offers a viable alternative. However, the application of machine learning to SAR has been limited due to a lack of ML-ready data and pipelines, particularly for the full diversity of SAR data, including polarimetry, coherence and interferometry. In this work, we introduce M3LEO, a multi-modal, multi-label Earth observation dataset that includes polarimetric, interferometric, and coherence SAR data derived from Sentinel-1, alongside multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery and auxiliary data describing terrain properties such as land use. M3LEO spans approximately 17M 4x4 km data chips from six diverse geographic regions. The dataset is complemented by a flexible PyTorch Lightning framework configured using Hydra to accommodate its use across diverse ML applications in Earth observation. We provide tools to process any dataset available on popular platforms such as Google Earth Engine for seamless integration with our framework. We show that the distribution shift in self-supervised embeddings is substantial across geographic regions, even when controlling for terrain properties.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Eyring, Shyamgopal Karthik, Karsten Roth, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Zeynep Akata</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made significant advancements in recent years, but they still struggle to accurately capture intricate details specified in complex compositional prompts. While fine-tuning T2I models with reward objectives has shown promise, it suffers from "reward hacking" and may not generalize well to unseen prompt distributions. In this work, we propose Reward-based Noise Optimization (ReNO), a novel approach that enhances T2I models at inference by optimizing the initial noise based on the signal from one or multiple human preference reward models. Remarkably, solving this optimization problem with gradient ascent for 50 iterations yields impressive results on four different one-step models across two competitive benchmarks, T2I-CompBench and GenEval. Within a computational budget of 20-50 seconds, ReNO-enhanced one-step models consistently surpass the performance of all current open-source Text-to-Image models. Extensive user studies demonstrate that our model is preferred nearly twice as often compared to the popular SDXL model and is on par with the proprietary Stable Diffusion 3 with 8B parameters. Moreover, given the same computational resources, a ReNO-optimized one-step model outperforms widely-used open-source models such as SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$, highlighting the efficiency and effectiveness of ReNO in enhancing T2I model performance at inference time.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Chen, Haotong Qin, Yong Guo, Xiongfei Su, Xin Yuan, Linghe Kong, Yulun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced diffusion models (DMs) perform impressively in image super-resolution (SR), but the high memory and computational costs hinder their deployment. Binarization, an ultra-compression algorithm, offers the potential for effectively accelerating DMs. Nonetheless, due to the model structure and the multi-step iterative attribute of DMs, existing binarization methods result in significant performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce a novel binarized diffusion model, BI-DiffSR, for image SR. First, for the model structure, we design a UNet architecture optimized for binarization. We propose the consistent-pixel-downsample (CP-Down) and consistent-pixel-upsample (CP-Up) to maintain dimension consistent and facilitate the full-precision information transfer. Meanwhile, we design the channel-shuffle-fusion (CS-Fusion) to enhance feature fusion in skip connection. Second, for the activation difference across timestep, we design the timestep-aware redistribution (TaR) and activation function (TaA). The TaR and TaA dynamically adjust the distribution of activations based on different timesteps, improving the flexibility and representation alability of the binarized module. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our BI-DiffSR outperforms existing binarization methods. Code is released at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/BI-DiffSR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingsong Xie, Zhenyi Liao, Zhijie Deng, Chen chen, Haonan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Distilling latent diffusion models (LDMs) into ones that are fast to sample from is attracting growing research interest. However, the majority of existing methods face two critical challenges: (1) They hinge on long training using a huge volume of real data. (2) They routinely lead to quality degradation for generation, especially in text-image alignment. This paper proposes a novel training-efficient Latent Consistency Model (TLCM) to overcome these challenges. Our method first accelerates LDMs via data-free multistep latent consistency distillation (MLCD), and then data-free latent consistency distillation is proposed to efficiently guarantee the inter-segment consistency in MLCD. Furthermore, we introduce bags of techniques, e.g., distribution matching, adversarial learning, and preference learning, to enhance TLCM's performance at few-step inference without any real data. TLCM demonstrates a high level of flexibility by enabling adjustment of sampling steps within the range of 2 to 8 while still producing competitive outputs compared to full-step approaches. Notably, TLCM enjoys the data-free merit by employing synthetic data from the teacher for distillation. With just 70 training hours on an A100 GPU, a 3-step TLCM distilled from SDXL achieves an impressive CLIP Score of 33.68 and an Aesthetic Score of 5.97 on the MSCOCO-2017 5K benchmark, surpassing various accelerated models and even outperforming the teacher model in human preference metrics. We also demonstrate the versatility of TLCMs in applications including image style transfer, controllable generation, and Chinese-to-image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongzhen Huang, Yankai Jiang, Rongzhao Zhang, Shaoting Zhang, Xiaofan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing promptable segmentation methods in the medical imaging field primarily consider either textual or visual prompts to segment relevant objects, yet they often fall short when addressing anomalies in medical images, like tumors, which may vary greatly in shape, size, and appearance. Recognizing the complexity of medical scenarios and the limitations of textual or visual prompts, we propose a novel dual-prompt schema that leverages the complementary strengths of visual and textual prompts for segmenting various organs and tumors. Specifically, we introduce CAT, an innovative model that Coordinates Anatomical prompts derived from 3D cropped images with Textual prompts enriched by medical domain knowledge. The model architecture adopts a general query-based design, where prompt queries facilitate segmentation queries for mask prediction. To synergize two types of prompts within a unified framework, we implement a ShareRefiner, which refines both segmentation and prompt queries while disentangling the two types of prompts. Trained on a consortium of 10 public CT datasets, CAT demonstrates superior performance in multiple segmentation tasks. Further validation on a specialized in-house dataset reveals the remarkable capacity of segmenting tumors across multiple cancer stages. This approach confirms that coordinating multimodal prompts is a promising avenue for addressing complex scenarios in the medical domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianle Zhang, Langtian Ma, Yuchen Yan, Yuchen Zhang, Kai Wang, Yue Yang, Ziyao Guo, Wenqi Shao, Yang You, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) technology advancements, as demonstrated by models such as Gen2, Pika, and Sora, have significantly broadened its applicability and popularity. Despite these strides, evaluating these models poses substantial challenges. Primarily, due to the limitations inherent in automatic metrics, manual evaluation is often considered a superior method for assessing T2V generation. However, existing manual evaluation protocols face reproducibility, reliability, and practicality issues. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Text-to-Video Human Evaluation (T2VHE) protocol, a comprehensive and standardized protocol for T2V models. The T2VHE protocol includes well-defined metrics, thorough annotator training, and an effective dynamic evaluation module. Experimental results demonstrate that this protocol not only ensures high-quality annotations but can also reduce evaluation costs by nearly 50\%. We will open-source the entire setup of the T2VHE protocol, including the complete protocol workflow, the dynamic evaluation component details, and the annotation interface code. This will help communities establish more sophisticated human assessment protocols.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingming Long, Jie Zhang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmarks classify samples with novel labels as the OOD data. However, some marginal OOD samples actually have close semantic contents to the in-distribution (ID) sample, which makes determining the OOD sample a Sorites Paradox. In this paper, we construct a benchmark named Incremental Shift OOD (IS-OOD) to address the issue, in which we divide the test samples into subsets with different semantic and covariate shift degrees relative to the ID dataset. The data division is achieved through a shift measuring method based on our proposed Language Aligned Image feature Decomposition (LAID). Moreover, we construct a Synthetic Incremental Shift (Syn-IS) dataset that contains high-quality generated images with more diverse covariate contents to complement the IS-OOD benchmark. We evaluate current OOD detection methods on our benchmark and find several important insights: (1) The performance of most OOD detection methods significantly improves as the semantic shift increases; (2) Some methods like GradNorm may have different OOD detection mechanisms as they rely less on semantic shifts to make decisions; (3) Excessive covariate shifts in the image are also likely to be considered as OOD for some methods.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal interleaved datasets featuring free-form interleaved sequences of images and text are crucial for training frontier large multimodal models (LMMs). Despite the rapid progression of open-source LMMs, there remains a pronounced scarcity of large-scale, diverse open-source multimodal interleaved datasets. In response, we introduce MINT-1T, the most extensive and diverse open-source Multimodal INTerleaved dataset to date. MINT-1T comprises one trillion text tokens and 3.4 billion images, a 10x scale-up from existing open-source datasets. Additionally, we include previously untapped sources such as PDFs and ArXiv papers. As scaling multimodal interleaved datasets requires substantial engineering effort, sharing the data curation process and releasing the dataset greatly benefits the community. Our experiments show that LMMs trained on MINT-1T rival the performance of models trained on the previous leading dataset, OBELICS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Letian Wang, Seung Wook Kim, Jiawei Yang, Cunjun Yu, Boris Ivanovic, Steven L. Waslander, Yue Wang, Sanja Fidler, Marco Pavone, Peter Karkus</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose DistillNeRF, a self-supervised learning framework addressing the challenge of understanding 3D environments from limited 2D observations in outdoor autonomous driving scenes. Our method is a generalizable feedforward model that predicts a rich neural scene representation from sparse, single-frame multi-view camera inputs with limited view overlap, and is trained self-supervised with differentiable rendering to reconstruct RGB, depth, or feature images. Our first insight is to exploit per-scene optimized Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) by generating dense depth and virtual camera targets from them, which helps our model to learn enhanced 3D geometry from sparse non-overlapping image inputs. Second, to learn a semantically rich 3D representation, we propose distilling features from pre-trained 2D foundation models, such as CLIP or DINOv2, thereby enabling various downstream tasks without the need for costly 3D human annotations. To leverage these two insights, we introduce a novel model architecture with a two-stage lift-splat-shoot encoder and a parameterized sparse hierarchical voxel representation. Experimental results on the NuScenes and Waymo NOTR datasets demonstrate that DistillNeRF significantly outperforms existing comparable state-of-the-art self-supervised methods for scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and depth estimation; and it allows for competitive zero-shot 3D semantic occupancy prediction, as well as open-world scene understanding through distilled foundation model features.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Li, Heyang Jiang, Akio Kodaira, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Kurt Keutzer, Chenfeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we point out that suboptimal noise-data mapping leads to slow training of diffusion models. During diffusion training, current methods diffuse each image across the entire noise space, resulting in a mixture of all images at every point in the noise layer. We emphasize that this random mixture of noise-data mapping complicates the optimization of the denoising function in diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the immiscibility phenomenon in physics, we propose Immiscible Diffusion, a simple and effective method to improve the random mixture of noise-data mapping. In physics, miscibility can vary according to various intermolecular forces. Thus, immiscibility means that the mixing of molecular sources is distinguishable. Inspired by this concept, we propose an assignment-then-diffusion training strategy to achieve Immiscible Diffusion. As one example, prior to diffusing the image data into noise, we assign diffusion target noise for the image data by minimizing the total image-noise pair distance in a mini-batch. The assignment functions analogously to external forces to expel the diffuse-able areas of images, thus mitigating the inherent difficulties in diffusion training. Our approach is remarkably simple, requiring only one line of code to restrict the diffuse-able area for each image while preserving the Gaussian distribution of noise. In this way, each image is preferably projected to nearby noise. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve up to 3x faster training for unconditional Consistency Models on the CIFAR dataset, as well as for DDIM and Stable Diffusion on CelebA and ImageNet dataset, and in class-conditional training and fine-tuning. In addition, we conducted a thorough analysis that sheds light on how it improves diffusion training speed while improving fidelity.

<p>Abstract: We propose a new comprehensive benchmark to revolutionize the current deepfake detection field to the next generation. Predominantly, existing works identify top-notch detection algorithms and models by adhering to the common practice: training detectors on one specific dataset (e.g., FF++) and testing them on other prevalent deepfake datasets. This protocol is often regarded as a "golden compass" for navigating SoTA detectors. But can these stand-out "winners" be truly applied to tackle the myriad of realistic and diverse deepfakes lurking in the real world? If not, what underlying factors contribute to this gap? In this work, we found the dataset (both train and test) can be the "primary culprit" due to: (1) forgery diversity: Deepfake techniques are commonly referred to as both face forgery and entire image synthesis. Most existing datasets only contain partial types of them, with limited forgery methods implemented; (2) forgery realism: The dominated training dataset, FF++, contains out-of-date forgery techniques from the past four years. "Honing skills" on these forgeries makes it difficult to guarantee effective detection generalization toward nowadays' SoTA deepfakes; (3) evaluation protocol: Most detection works perform evaluations on one type, which hinders the development of universal deepfake detectors. To address this dilemma, we construct a highly diverse deepfake detection dataset called DF40, which comprises 40 distinct deepfake techniques. We then conduct comprehensive evaluations using 4 standard evaluation protocols and 8 representative detection methods, resulting in over 2,000 evaluations. Through these evaluations, we provide an extensive analysis from various perspectives, leading to 7 new insightful findings. We also open up 4 valuable yet previously underexplored research questions to inspire future works. Our project page is https://github.com/YZY-stack/DF40.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Sarch, Lawrence Jang, Michael J. Tarr, William W. Cohen, Kenneth Marino, Katerina Fragkiadaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale generative language and vision-language models excel in in-context learning for decision making. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a task demonstration that may contain inefficiencies or mistakes, a VLM abstracts the trajectory into a generalized program by correcting inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task-relevant visual elements. These abstractions are iteratively improved through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory. The resulting examples, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Moreover, as the agent's library of examples grows, it becomes more efficient, relying less on human feedback and requiring fewer environment interactions per demonstration. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7% using GPT4V. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on manual prompt engineering and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such abstractions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of estimating physical properties (system identification) through visual observations. To facilitate geometry-aware guidance in physical property estimation, we introduce a novel hybrid framework that leverages 3D Gaussian representation to not only capture explicit shapes but also enable the simulated continuum to render object masks as 2D shape surrogates during training. We propose a new dynamic 3D Gaussian framework based on motion factorization to recover the object as 3D Gaussian point sets across different time states. Furthermore, we develop a coarse-to-fine filling strategy to generate the density fields of the object from the Gaussian reconstruction, allowing for the extraction of object continuums along with their surfaces and the integration of Gaussian attributes into these continuum. In addition to the extracted object surfaces, the Gaussian-informed continuum also enables the rendering of object masks during simulations, serving as 2D-shape guidance for physical property estimation. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and metrics. Additionally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through real-world demonstrations, showcasing its practical utility.

<p>Abstract: Benchmarking vision-based driving policies is challenging. On one hand, open-loop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflect closed-loop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible in simulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands. Further, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to real data. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from the rapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms, where we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator to enable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gather simulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrolling bird's eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon. Our simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment do not influence each other. As we demonstrate empirically, this decoupling allows open-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loop evaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM enabled a new competition held at CVPR 2024, where 143 teams submitted 463 entries, resulting in several new insights. On a large set of challenging scenarios, we observe that simple methods with moderate compute requirements such as TransFuser can match recent large-scale end-to-end driving architectures such as UniAD. Our modular framework can potentially be extended with new datasets, data curation strategies, and metrics, and will be continually maintained to host future challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Zhang, Chang Li, Yongjun Zhang, Rongjun Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Remotely sensed imagery interpretation (RSII) faces the three major problems: (1) objective representation of spatial distribution patterns; (2) edge uncertainty problem caused by downsampling encoder and intrinsic edge noises (e.g., mixed pixel and edge occlusion etc.); and (3) false detection problem caused by geometric registration error in change detection. To solve the aforementioned problems, uncertainty-diffusion-model-based high-Frequency TransFormer network (UDHF2-Net) is the first to be proposed, whose superiorities are as follows: (1) a spatially-stationary-and-non-stationary high-frequency connection paradigm (SHCP) is proposed to enhance the interaction of spatially frequency-wise stationary and non-stationary features to yield high-fidelity edge extraction result. Inspired by HRFormer, SHCP proposes high-frequency-wise stream to replace high-resolution-wise stream in HRFormer through the whole encoder-decoder process with parallel frequency-wise high-to-low streams, so it improves the edge extraction accuracy by continuously remaining high-frequency information; (2) a mask-and-geo-knowledge-based uncertainty diffusion module (MUDM), which is a self-supervised learning strategy, is proposed to improve the edge accuracy of extraction and change detection by gradually removing the simulated spectrum noises based on geo-knowledge and the generated diffused spectrum noises; (3) a frequency-wise semi-pseudo-Siamese UDHF2-Net is the first to be proposed to balance accuracy and complexity for change detection. Besides the aforementioned spectrum noises in semantic segmentation, MUDM is also a self-supervised learning strategy to effectively reduce the edge false change detection from the generated imagery with geometric registration error.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Vivoli, Marco Bertini, Dimosthenis Karatzas</p>
<p>Abstract: The comic domain is rapidly advancing with the development of single-page analysis and synthesis models. However, evaluation metrics and datasets lag behind, often limited to small-scale or single-style test sets. We introduce a novel benchmark, CoMix, designed to evaluate the multi-task capabilities of models in comic analysis. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated tasks such as object detection or text recognition, CoMix addresses a broader range of tasks including object detection, speaker identification, character re-identification, reading order, and multi-modal reasoning tasks like character naming and dialogue generation. Our benchmark comprises three existing datasets with expanded annotations to support multi-task evaluation. To mitigate the over-representation of manga-style data, we have incorporated a new dataset of carefully selected American comic-style books, thereby enriching the diversity of comic styles. CoMix is designed to assess pre-trained models in zero-shot and limited fine-tuning settings, probing their transfer capabilities across different comic styles and tasks. The validation split of the benchmark is publicly available for research purposes, and an evaluation server for the held-out test split is also provided. Comparative results between human performance and state-of-the-art models reveal a significant performance gap, highlighting substantial opportunities for advancements in comic understanding. The dataset, baseline models, and code are accessible at https://github.com/emanuelevivoli/CoMix-dataset. This initiative sets a new standard for comprehensive comic analysis, providing the community with a common benchmark for evaluation on a large and varied set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Kulhanek, Songyou Peng, Zuzana Kukelova, Marc Pollefeys, Torsten Sattler</p>
<p>Abstract: While the field of 3D scene reconstruction is dominated by NeRFs due to their photorealistic quality, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged, offering similar quality with real-time rendering speeds. However, both methods primarily excel with well-controlled 3D scenes, while in-the-wild data - characterized by occlusions, dynamic objects, and varying illumination - remains challenging. NeRFs can adapt to such conditions easily through per-image embedding vectors, but 3DGS struggles due to its explicit representation and lack of shared parameters. To address this, we introduce WildGaussians, a novel approach to handle occlusions and appearance changes with 3DGS. By leveraging robust DINO features and integrating an appearance modeling module within 3DGS, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate that WildGaussians matches the real-time rendering speed of 3DGS while surpassing both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in handling in-the-wild data, all within a simple architectural framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runzhao Yao, Shaoyi Du, Wenting Cui, Canhui Tang, Chengwu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning rotation-invariant distinctive features is a fundamental requirement for point cloud registration. Existing methods often use rotation-sensitive networks to extract features, while employing rotation augmentation to learn an approximate invariant mapping rudely. This makes networks fragile to rotations, overweight, and hinders the distinctiveness of features. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel position-aware rotation-equivariant network, for efficient, light-weighted, and robust registration. The network can provide a strong model inductive bias to learn rotation-equivariant/invariant features, thus addressing the aforementioned limitations. To further improve the distinctiveness of descriptors, we propose a position-aware convolution, which can better learn spatial information of local structures. Moreover, we also propose a feature-based hypothesis proposer. It leverages rotation-equivariant features that encode fine-grained structure orientations to generate reliable model hypotheses. Each correspondence can generate a hypothesis, thus it is more efficient than classic estimators that require multiple reliable correspondences. Accordingly, a contrastive rotation loss is presented to enhance the robustness of rotation-equivariant features against data degradation. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the SOTA methods in terms of registration recall while being lightweight and keeping a fast speed. Moreover, experiments on rotated datasets demonstrate its robustness against rotation variations. Code is available at https://github.com/yaorz97/PARENet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanting Miao, William Loh, Suraj Kothawade, Pascal Poupart, Abdullah Rashwan, Yeqing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have recently attracted considerable interest, enabling the synthesis of high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these models often lack the capability to generate specific subjects from given reference images or to synthesize novel renditions under varying conditions. Methods like DreamBooth and Subject-driven Text-to-Image (SuTI) have made significant progress in this area. Yet, both approaches primarily focus on enhancing similarity to reference images and require expensive setups, often overlooking the need for efficient training and avoiding overfitting to the reference images. In this work, we present the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, which provides a reliable reward signal and enables early stopping for faster training and effective regularization. By combining the Bradley-Terry preference model, the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function also provides preference labels for subject-driven generation tasks. We propose Reward Preference Optimization (RPO), which offers a simpler setup (requiring only $3\%$ of the negative samples used by DreamBooth) and fewer gradient steps for fine-tuning. Unlike most existing methods, our approach does not require training a text encoder or optimizing text embeddings and achieves text-image alignment by fine-tuning only the U-Net component. Empirically, $\lambda$-Harmonic proves to be a reliable approach for model selection in subject-driven generation tasks. Based on preference labels and early stopping validation from the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, our algorithm achieves a state-of-the-art CLIP-I score of 0.833 and a CLIP-T score of 0.314 on DreamBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hu Cao, Zehua Zhang, Yan Xia, Xinyi Li, Jiahao Xia, Guang Chen, Alois Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: In frame-based vision, object detection faces substantial performance degradation under challenging conditions due to the limited sensing capability of conventional cameras. Event cameras output sparse and asynchronous events, providing a potential solution to solve these problems. However, effectively fusing two heterogeneous modalities remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical feature refinement network for event-frame fusion. The core concept is the design of the coarse-to-fine fusion module, denoted as the cross-modality adaptive feature refinement (CAFR) module. In the initial phase, the bidirectional cross-modality interaction (BCI) part facilitates information bridging from two distinct sources. Subsequently, the features are further refined by aligning the channel-level mean and variance in the two-fold adaptive feature refinement (TAFR) part. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmarks: the low-resolution PKU-DDD17-Car dataset and the high-resolution DSEC dataset. Experimental results show that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art by an impressive margin of $\textbf{8.0}\%$ on the DSEC dataset. Besides, our method exhibits significantly better robustness (\textbf{69.5}\% versus \textbf{38.7}\%) when introducing 15 different corruption types to the frame images.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16430">Rethinking Out-of-Distribution Detection on Imbalanced Data Distribution</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Liu, Zhihang Fu, Sheng Jin, Chao Chen, Ze Chen, Rongxin Jiang, Fan Zhou, Yaowu Chen, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting and rejecting unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is critical for deployed neural networks to void unreliable predictions. In real-world scenarios, however, the efficacy of existing OOD detection methods is often impeded by the inherent imbalance of in-distribution (ID) data, which causes significant performance decline. Through statistical observations, we have identified two common challenges faced by different OOD detectors: misidentifying tail class ID samples as OOD, while erroneously predicting OOD samples as head class from ID. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a generalized statistical framework, termed ImOOD, to formulate the OOD detection problem on imbalanced data distribution. Consequently, the theoretical analysis reveals that there exists a class-aware bias item between balanced and imbalanced OOD detection, which contributes to the performance gap. Building upon this finding, we present a unified training-time regularization technique to mitigate the bias and boost imbalanced OOD detectors across architecture designs. Our theoretically grounded method translates into consistent improvements on the representative CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT benchmarks against several state-of-the-art OOD detection approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Zhou, Chunsheng Liu, Faliang Chang, Wenqian Wang, Penghui Hao, Yiming Huang, Zhiqiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Associating driver attention with driving scene across two fields of views (FOVs) is a hard cross-domain perception problem, which requires comprehensive consideration of cross-view mapping, dynamic driving scene analysis, and driver status tracking. Previous methods typically focus on a single view or map attention to the scene via estimated gaze, failing to exploit the implicit connection between them. Moreover, simple fusion modules are insufficient for modeling the complex relationships between the two views, making information integration challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for end-to-end scene-associated driver attention estimation, called EraW-Net. This method enhances the most discriminative dynamic cues, refines feature representations, and facilitates semantically aligned cross-domain integration through a W-shaped architecture, termed W-Net. Specifically, a Dynamic Adaptive Filter Module (DAF-Module) is proposed to address the challenges of frequently changing driving environments by extracting vital regions. It suppresses the indiscriminately recorded dynamics and highlights crucial ones by innovative joint frequency-spatial analysis, enhancing the model's ability to parse complex dynamics. Additionally, to track driver states during non-fixed facial poses, we propose a Global Context Sharing Module (GCS-Module) to construct refined feature representations by capturing hierarchical features that adapt to various scales of head and eye movements. Finally, W-Net achieves systematic cross-view information integration through its "Encoding-Independent Partial Decoding-Fusion Decoding" structure, addressing semantic misalignment in heterogeneous data integration. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method robustly and accurately estimates the mapping of driver attention in scene on large public datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan-Niklas Dihlmann, Arjun Majumdar, Andreas Engelhardt, Raphael Braun, Hendrik P. A. Lensch</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction and relighting of objects made from scattering materials present a significant challenge due to the complex light transport beneath the surface. 3D Gaussian Splatting introduced high-quality novel view synthesis at real-time speeds. While 3D Gaussians efficiently approximate an object's surface, they fail to capture the volumetric properties of subsurface scattering. We propose a framework for optimizing an object's shape together with the radiance transfer field given multi-view OLAT (one light at a time) data. Our method decomposes the scene into an explicit surface represented as 3D Gaussians, with a spatially varying BRDF, and an implicit volumetric representation of the scattering component. A learned incident light field accounts for shadowing. We optimize all parameters jointly via ray-traced differentiable rendering. Our approach enables material editing, relighting and novel view synthesis at interactive rates. We show successful application on synthetic data and introduce a newly acquired multi-view multi-light dataset of objects in a light-stage setup. Compared to previous work we achieve comparable or better results at a fraction of optimization and rendering time while enabling detailed control over material attributes.

<p>Abstract: Deep supervised learning models require high volume of labeled data to attain sufficiently good results. Although, the practice of gathering and annotating such big data is costly and laborious. Recently, the application of self supervised learning (SSL) in vision tasks has gained significant attention. The intuition behind SSL is to exploit the synchronous relationships within the data as a form of self-supervision, which can be versatile. In the current big data era, most of the data is unlabeled, and the success of SSL thus relies in finding ways to utilize this vast amount of unlabeled data available. Thus it is better for deep learning algorithms to reduce reliance on human supervision and instead focus on self-supervision based on the inherent relationships within the data. With the advent of ViTs, which have achieved remarkable results in computer vision, it is crucial to explore and understand the various SSL mechanisms employed for training these models specifically in scenarios where there is limited labelled data available. In this survey, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of systematically classifying the SSL techniques based upon their representations and pre-training tasks being applied. Additionally, we discuss the motivations behind SSL, review popular pre-training tasks, and highlight the challenges and advancements in this field. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of different SSL methods, evaluate their strengths and limitations, and identify potential avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutaka Endo, Minoru Oikawa, Timothy D. Wilkinson, Tomoyoshi Shimobaba, Tomoyoshi Ito</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) is a promising technology for augmented reality displays, such as head-mounted or head-up displays. However, its high computational demand makes it impractical for implementation. Recent efforts to integrate neural networks into CGH have successfully accelerated computing speed, demonstrating the potential to overcome the trade-off between computational cost and image quality. Nevertheless, deploying neural network-based CGH algorithms on computationally limited embedded systems requires more efficient models with lower computational cost, memory footprint, and power consumption. In this study, we developed a lightweight model for complex hologram generation by introducing neural network quantization. Specifically, we built a model based on tensor holography and quantized it from 32-bit floating-point precision (FP32) to 8-bit integer precision (INT8). Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed INT8 model achieves hologram quality comparable to that of the FP32 model while reducing the model size by approximately 70% and increasing the speed fourfold. Additionally, we implemented the INT8 model on a system-on-module to demonstrate its deployability on embedded platforms and high power efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sichun Wu, Kazi Injamamul Haque, Zerrin Yumak</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation synthesis has been an active field of research with attention from both academia and industry. While there are promising results in this area, recent approaches largely focus on lip-sync and identity control, neglecting the role of emotions and emotion control in the generative process. That is mainly due to the lack of emotionally rich facial animation data and algorithms that can synthesize speech animations with emotional expressions at the same time. In addition, majority of the models are deterministic, meaning given the same audio input, they produce the same output motion. We argue that emotions and non-determinism are crucial to generate diverse and emotionally-rich facial animations. In this paper, we propose ProbTalk3D a non-deterministic neural network approach for emotion controllable speech-driven 3D facial animation synthesis using a two-stage VQ-VAE model and an emotionally rich facial animation dataset 3DMEAD. We provide an extensive comparative analysis of our model against the recent 3D facial animation synthesis approaches, by evaluating the results objectively, qualitatively, and with a perceptual user study. We highlight several objective metrics that are more suitable for evaluating stochastic outputs and use both in-the-wild and ground truth data for subjective evaluation. To our knowledge, that is the first non-deterministic 3D facial animation synthesis method incorporating a rich emotion dataset and emotion control with emotion labels and intensity levels. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art emotion-controlled, deterministic and non-deterministic models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiabao Wang, Zhaojiang Liu, Qiang Meng, Liujiang Yan, Ke Wang, Jie Yang, Wei Liu, Qibin Hou, Ming-Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Occupancy prediction, aiming at predicting the occupancy status within voxelized 3D environment, is quickly gaining momentum within the autonomous driving community. Mainstream occupancy prediction works first discretize the 3D environment into voxels, then perform classification on such dense grids. However, inspection on sample data reveals that the vast majority of voxels is unoccupied. Performing classification on these empty voxels demands suboptimal computation resource allocation, and reducing such empty voxels necessitates complex algorithm designs. To this end, we present a novel perspective on the occupancy prediction task: formulating it as a streamlined set prediction paradigm without the need for explicit space modeling or complex sparsification procedures. Our proposed framework, called OPUS, utilizes a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to simultaneously predict occupied locations and classes using a set of learnable queries. Firstly, we employ the Chamfer distance loss to scale the set-to-set comparison problem to unprecedented magnitudes, making training such model end-to-end a reality. Subsequently, semantic classes are adaptively assigned using nearest neighbor search based on the learned locations. In addition, OPUS incorporates a suite of non-trivial strategies to enhance model performance, including coarse-to-fine learning, consistent point sampling, and adaptive re-weighting, etc. Finally, compared with current state-of-the-art methods, our lightest model achieves superior RayIoU on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset at near 2x FPS, while our heaviest model surpasses previous best results by 6.1 RayIoU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Sun, Bo Xia, Yongzhe Chang, Xueqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently expanded its successful application from aligning large language models (LLMs) to aligning text-to-image models with human preferences, which has generated considerable interest within the community. However, we have observed that these approaches rely solely on minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence during alignment process between the fine-tuned model and the reference model, neglecting the incorporation of other divergence constraints. In this study, we focus on extending reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence in the alignment paradigm of text-to-image models to $f$-divergence, which aims to garner better alignment performance as well as good generation diversity. We provide the generalized formula of the alignment paradigm under the $f$-divergence condition and thoroughly analyze the impact of different divergence constraints on alignment process from the perspective of gradient fields. We conduct comprehensive evaluation on image-text alignment performance, human value alignment performance and generation diversity performance under different divergence constraints, and the results indicate that alignment based on Jensen-Shannon divergence achieves the best trade-off among them. The option of divergence employed for aligning text-to-image models significantly impacts the trade-off between alignment performance (especially human value alignment) and generation diversity, which highlights the necessity of selecting an appropriate divergence for practical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Privacy issue is a main concern in developing face recognition techniques. Although synthetic face images can partially mitigate potential legal risks while maintaining effective face recognition (FR) performance, FR models trained by face images synthesized by existing generative approaches frequently suffer from performance degradation problems due to the insufficient discriminative quality of these synthesized samples. In this paper, we systematically investigate what contributes to solid face recognition model training, and reveal that face images with certain degree of similarities to their identity centers show great effectiveness in the performance of trained FR models. Inspired by this, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach (namely Center-based Semi-hard Synthetic Face Generation (CemiFace)) which produces facial samples with various levels of similarity to the subject center, thus allowing to generate face datasets containing effective discriminative samples for training face recognition. Experimental results show that with a modest degree of similarity, training on the generated dataset can produce competitive performance compared to previous generation methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The swift advancement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) also presents significant challenges for effective knowledge editing. Current methods, including intrinsic knowledge editing and external knowledge resorting, each possess strengths and weaknesses, struggling to balance the desired properties of reliability, generality, and locality when applied to MLLMs. In this paper, we propose UniKE, a novel multimodal editing method that establishes a unified perspective and paradigm for intrinsic knowledge editing and external knowledge resorting. Both types of knowledge are conceptualized as vectorized key-value memories, with the corresponding editing processes resembling the assimilation and accommodation phases of human cognition, conducted at the same semantic levels. Within such a unified framework, we further promote knowledge collaboration by disentangling the knowledge representations into the semantic and truthfulness spaces. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, which ensures that the post-edit MLLM simultaneously maintains excellent reliability, generality, and locality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michal Balcerak, Tamaz Amiranashvili, Andreas Wagner, Jonas Weidner, Petr Karnakov, Johannes C. Paetzold, Ivan Ezhov, Petros Koumoutsakos, Benedikt Wiestler, Bjoern Menze</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical models in the form of partial differential equations serve as important priors for many under-constrained problems. One such application is tumor treatment planning, which relies on accurately estimating the spatial distribution of tumor cells within a patient's anatomy. While medical imaging can detect the bulk of a tumor, it cannot capture the full extent of its spread, as low-concentration tumor cells often remain undetectable, particularly in glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor. Machine learning approaches struggle to estimate the complete tumor cell distribution due to a lack of appropriate training data. Consequently, most existing methods rely on physics-based simulations to generate anatomically and physiologically plausible estimations. However, these approaches face challenges with complex and unknown initial conditions and are constrained by overly rigid physical models. In this work, we introduce a novel method that integrates data-driven and physics-based cost functions, akin to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, our approach parametrizes the solution directly on a dynamic discrete mesh, allowing for the effective modeling of complex biomechanical behaviors. Specifically, we propose a unique discretization scheme that quantifies how well the learned spatiotemporal distributions of tumor and brain tissues adhere to their respective growth and elasticity equations. This quantification acts as a regularization term, offering greater flexibility and improved integration of patient data compared to existing models. We demonstrate enhanced coverage of tumor recurrence areas using real-world data from a patient cohort, highlighting the potential of our method to improve model-driven treatment planning for glioblastoma in clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ci Li, Yi Yang, Zehang Weng, Elin Hernlund, Silvia Zuffi, Hedvig Kjellstr\"om</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, 3D parametric animal models have been developed to aid in estimating 3D shape and pose from images and video. While progress has been made for humans, it's more challenging for animals due to limited annotated data. To address this, we introduce the first method using synthetic data generation and disentanglement to learn to regress 3D shape and pose. Focusing on horses, we use text-based texture generation and a synthetic data pipeline to create varied shapes, poses, and appearances, learning disentangled spaces. Our method, Dessie, surpasses existing 3D horse reconstruction methods and generalizes to other large animals like zebras, cows, and deer.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingfeng Yao, Wang Cheng, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have attracted significant attention in research. However, they suffer from a slow convergence rate. In this paper, we aim to accelerate DiT training without any architectural modification. We identify the following issues in the training process: firstly, certain training strategies do not consistently perform well across different data. Secondly, the effectiveness of supervision at specific timesteps is limited. In response, we propose the following contributions: (1) We introduce a new perspective for interpreting the failure of the strategies. Specifically, we slightly extend the definition of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and suggest observing the Probability Density Function (PDF) of SNR to understand the essence of the data robustness of the strategy. (2) We conduct numerous experiments and report over one hundred experimental results to empirically summarize a unified accelerating strategy from the perspective of PDF. (3) We develop a new supervision method that further accelerates the training process of DiT. Based on them, we propose FasterDiT, an exceedingly simple and practicable design strategy. With few lines of code modifications, it achieves 2.30 FID on ImageNet 256 resolution at 1000k iterations, which is comparable to DiT (2.27 FID) but 7 times faster in training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juexiao Zhang, Gao Zhu, Sihang Li, Xinhao Liu, Haorui Song, Xinran Tang, Chen Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: A proper scene representation is central to the pursuit of spatial intelligence where agents can robustly reconstruct and efficiently understand 3D scenes. A scene representation is either metric, such as landmark maps in 3D reconstruction, 3D bounding boxes in object detection, or voxel grids in occupancy prediction, or topological, such as pose graphs with loop closures in SLAM or visibility graphs in SfM. In this work, we propose to build Multiview Scene Graphs (MSG) from unposed images, representing a scene topologically with interconnected place and object nodes. The task of building MSG is challenging for existing representation learning methods since it needs to jointly address both visual place recognition, object detection, and object association from images with limited fields of view and potentially large viewpoint changes. To evaluate any method tackling this task, we developed an MSG dataset and annotation based on a public 3D dataset. We also propose an evaluation metric based on the intersection-over-union score of MSG edges. Moreover, we develop a novel baseline method built on mainstream pretrained vision models, combining visual place recognition and object association into one Transformer decoder architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method has superior performance compared to existing relevant baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Zhu, Bocheng Li, Hang Zhang, Xin Li, Linli Xu, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent-based image generative models, such as Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and Mask Image Models (MIMs), have achieved notable success in image generation tasks. These models typically leverage reconstructive autoencoders like VQGAN or VAE to encode pixels into a more compact latent space and learn the data distribution in the latent space instead of directly from pixels. However, this practice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In response, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same latent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in image generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where the autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship between latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent space in image generative modeling. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image generative modeling by applying K-Means on the latent features of self-supervised learning models. Experimental results show that image autoregressive modeling with our tokenizer (DiGIT) benefits both image understanding and image generation with the next token prediction principle, which is inherently straightforward for GPT models but challenging for other generative models. Remarkably, for the first time, a GPT-style autoregressive model for images outperforms LDMs, which also exhibits substantial improvement akin to GPT when scaling up model size. Our findings underscore the potential of an optimized latent space and the integration of discrete tokenization in advancing the capabilities of image generative models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianchao Ci, Eldert J. van Henten, Xin Wang, Akshay K. Burusa, Gert Kootstra</p>
<p>Abstract: The 3D reconstruction of plants is challenging due to their complex shape causing many occlusions. Next-Best-View (NBV) methods address this by iteratively selecting new viewpoints to maximize information gain (IG). Deep-learning-based NBV (DL-NBV) methods demonstrate higher computational efficiency over classic voxel-based NBV approaches but current methods require extensive training using ground-truth plant models, making them impractical for real-world plants. These methods, moreover, rely on offline training with pre-collected data, limiting adaptability in changing agricultural environments. This paper proposes a self-supervised learning-based NBV method (SSL-NBV) that uses a deep neural network to predict the IG for candidate viewpoints. The method allows the robot to gather its own training data during task execution by comparing new 3D sensor data to the earlier gathered data and by employing weakly-supervised learning and experience replay for efficient online learning. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted in simulation and real-world environments using cross-validation. The results showed that SSL-NBV required fewer views for plant reconstruction than non-NBV methods and was over 800 times faster than a voxel-based method. SSL-NBV reduced training annotations by over 90% compared to a baseline DL-NBV. Furthermore, SSL-NBV could adapt to novel scenarios through online fine-tuning. Also using real plants, the results showed that the proposed method can learn to effectively plan new viewpoints for 3D plant reconstruction. Most importantly, SSL-NBV automated the entire network training and uses continuous online learning, allowing it to operate in changing agricultural environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Zhou, Huangjie Zheng, Yi Gu, Zhendong Wang, Hai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Score identity Distillation (SiD) is a data-free method that has achieved state-of-the-art performance in image generation by leveraging only a pretrained diffusion model, without requiring any training data. However, the ultimate performance of SiD is constrained by the accuracy with which the pretrained model captures the true data scores at different stages of the diffusion process. In this paper, we introduce SiDA (SiD with Adversarial Loss), which not only enhances generation quality but also improves distillation efficiency by incorporating real images and adversarial loss. SiDA utilizes the encoder from the generator's score network as a discriminator, boosting its ability to distinguish between real images and those generated by SiD. The adversarial loss is batch-normalized within each GPU and then combined with the original SiD loss. This integration effectively incorporates the average "fakeness" per GPU batch into the pixel-based SiD loss, enabling SiDA to distill a single-step generator either from scratch or by fine-tuning an existing one. SiDA converges significantly faster than its predecessor when trained from scratch, and swiftly improves upon the original model's performance after an initial warmup period during fine-tuning from a pre-distilled SiD generator. This one-step adversarial distillation method establishes new benchmarks in generation performance when distilling EDM diffusion models pretrained on CIFAR-10 (32x32) and ImageNet (64x64), achieving FID score of 1.110 on ImageNet 64x64. It sets record-low FID scores when distilling EDM2 models trained on ImageNet (512x512), surpassing even the largest teacher model, EDM2-XXL. Our SiDA's results record FID scores of 2.156 for EDM2-XS, 1.669 for EDM2-S, 1.488 for EDM2-M, and 1.465 for EDM2-L, demonstrating significant improvements across all model sizes. Our open-source code will be integrated into the SiD codebase.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing and understanding 3D structures from a limited number of images is a well-established problem in computer vision. Traditional methods usually break this task into multiple subtasks, each requiring complex transformations between different data representations. For instance, dense reconstruction through Structure-from-Motion (SfM) involves converting images into key points, optimizing camera parameters, and estimating structures. Afterward, accurate sparse reconstructions are required for further dense modeling, which is subsequently fed into task-specific neural networks. This multi-step process results in considerable processing time and increased engineering complexity.
  In this work, we present the Large Spatial Model (LSM), which processes unposed RGB images directly into semantic radiance fields. LSM simultaneously estimates geometry, appearance, and semantics in a single feed-forward operation, and it can generate versatile label maps by interacting with language at novel viewpoints. Leveraging a Transformer-based architecture, LSM integrates global geometry through pixel-aligned point maps. To enhance spatial attribute regression, we incorporate local context aggregation with multi-scale fusion, improving the accuracy of fine local details. To tackle the scarcity of labeled 3D semantic data and enable natural language-driven scene manipulation, we incorporate a pre-trained 2D language-based segmentation model into a 3D-consistent semantic feature field. An efficient decoder then parameterizes a set of semantic anisotropic Gaussians, facilitating supervised end-to-end learning. Extensive experiments across various tasks show that LSM unifies multiple 3D vision tasks directly from unposed images, achieving real-time semantic 3D reconstruction for the first time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shabalin Carmel, Shenkman Israel, Shelef Ilan, Ben-Arie Gal, Alex Geftler, Shahar Yuval</p>
<p>Abstract: Low back pain is the symptom that is the second most frequently reported to primary care physicians, effecting 50 to 80 percent of the population in a lifetime, resulting in multiple referrals of patients suffering from back problems, to CT and MRI scans, which are then examined by radiologists. The radiologists examining these spinal scans naturally focus on spinal pathologies and might miss other types of abnormalities, and in particular, abdominal ones, such as malignancies. Nevertheless, the patients whose spine was scanned might as well have malignant and other abdominal pathologies. Thus, clinicians have suggested the need for computerized assistance and decision support in screening spinal scans for additional abnormalities. In the current study, We have addressed the important case of detecting suspicious lesions in the adrenal glands as an example for the overall methodology we have developed. A patient CT scan is integrated from multiple slices with an axial orientation. Our method determines whether a patient has an abnormal adrenal gland, and localises the abnormality if it exists. Our method is composed of three deep learning models; each model has a different task for achieving the final goal. We call our compound method the Multi Model Graph Aggregation MMGA method. The novelty in this study is twofold. First, the use, for an important screening task, of CT scans that are originally focused and tuned for imaging the spine, which were acquired from patients with potential spinal disorders, for detection of a totally different set of abnormalities such as abdominal Adrenal glands pathologies. Second, we have built a complex pipeline architecture composed from three deep learning models that can be utilized for other organs (such as the pancreas or the kidney), or for similar applications, but using other types of imaging, such as MRI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Yang, Donglin Di, Baorui Ma, Xun Yang, Yongjia Ma, Wenzhang Sun, Wei Chen, Jianxun Cui, Zhou Xue, Meng Wang, Yebin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, advancements in generative models have significantly expanded the capabilities of text-to-3D generation. Many approaches rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) technology. However, SDS struggles to accommodate multi-condition inputs, such as text and visual prompts, in customized generation tasks. To explore the core reasons, we decompose SDS into a difference term and a classifier-free guidance term. Our analysis identifies the core issue as arising from the difference term and the random noise addition during the optimization process, both contributing to deviations from the target mode during distillation. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm, Classifier Score Matching (CSM), which removes the difference term in SDS and uses a deterministic noise addition process to reduce noise during optimization, effectively overcoming the low-quality limitations of SDS in our customized generation framework. Based on CSM, we integrate visual prompt information with an attention fusion mechanism and sampling guidance techniques, forming the Visual Prompt CSM (VPCSM) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a Semantic-Geometry Calibration (SGC) module to enhance quality through improved textual information integration. We present our approach as TV-3DG, with extensive experiments demonstrating its capability to achieve stable, high-quality, customized 3D generation.

<p>Abstract: The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in computer vision has given promising results. It is widely applied in many areas, from medicine, agriculture, self-driving car, biometric system, and almost all computer vision-based applications. Filters or weights are the critical elements responsible for learning in DCNN. Backpropagation has been the primary learning algorithm for DCNN and provides promising results, but the size and numbers of the filters remain hyper-parameters. Various studies have been done in the last decade on semi-supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised methods and their properties. The effects of filter initialization, size-shape selection, and the number of filters on learning and optimization have not been investigated in a separate publication to collate all the options. Such attributes are often treated as hyper-parameters and lack mathematical understanding. Computer vision algorithms have many limitations in real-life applications, and understanding the learning process is essential to have some significant improvement. To the best of our knowledge, no separate investigation has been published discussing the filters; this is our primary motivation. This study focuses on arguments for choosing specific physical parameters of filters, initialization, and learning technic over scattered methods. The promising unsupervised approaches have been evaluated. Additionally, the limitations, current challenges, and future scope have been discussed in this paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Dong Jiang, Chih-Yung Chang, Hsiang-Chuan Chang, Diptendu Sinha Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, research based on pre-trained models has demonstrated outstanding performance in violence surveillance tasks. However, these black-box systems face challenges regarding explainability during training and inference processes. An important question is how to incorporate explicit knowledge into these implicit models, thereby designing expert-driven and interpretable violence surveillance systems. This paper proposes a new paradigm for weakly supervised violence monitoring (WSVM) called Rule base Violence monitoring (RuleVM). The proposed RuleVM uses a dual-branch structure for different designs for images and text. One of the branches is called the implicit branch, which uses only visual features for coarse-grained binary classification. In this branch, image feature extraction is divided into two channels: one responsible for extracting scene frames and the other focusing on extracting actions. The other branch is called the explicit branch, which utilizes language-image alignment to perform fine-grained classification. For the language channel design in the explicit branch, the proposed RuleCLIP uses the state-of-the-art YOLO-World model to detect objects and actions in video frames, and association rules are identified through data mining methods as descriptions of the video. Leveraging the dual-branch architecture, RuleVM achieves interpretable coarse-grained and fine-grained violence surveillance. Extensive experiments were conducted on two commonly used benchmarks, and the results show that RuleCLIP achieved the best performance in both coarse-grained and fine-grained detection, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, interpretability experiments uncovered some interesting rules, such as the observation that as the number of people increases, the risk level of violent behavior also rises.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Quesada, Zoe Fowler, Mohammad Alotaibi, Mohit Prabhushankar, Ghassan AlRegib</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for tackling image segmentation tasks in an intuitive and interactive manner has sparked interest in the design of effective visual prompts. Such interest has led to the creation of automated point prompt selection strategies, typically motivated from a feature extraction perspective. However, there is still very little understanding of how appropriate these automated visual prompting strategies are, particularly when compared to humans, across diverse image domains. Additionally, the performance benefits of including such automated visual prompting strategies within the finetuning process of SAM also remains unexplored, as does the effect of interpretable factors like distance between the prompt points on segmentation performance. To bridge these gaps, we leverage a recently released visual prompting dataset, PointPrompt, and introduce a number of benchmarking tasks that provide an array of opportunities to improve the understanding of the way human prompts differ from automated ones and what underlying factors make for effective visual prompts. We demonstrate that the resulting segmentation scores obtained by humans are approximately 29% higher than those given by automated strategies and identify potential features that are indicative of prompting performance with $R^2$ scores over 0.5. Additionally, we demonstrate that performance when using automated methods can be improved by up to 68% via a finetuning approach. Overall, our experiments not only showcase the existing gap between human prompts and automated methods, but also highlight potential avenues through which this gap can be leveraged to improve effective visual prompt design.

<p>Abstract: Brain imaging studies have demonstrated that diffusion MRI tractography geometric shape descriptors can inform the study of the brain's white matter pathways and their relationship to brain function. In this work, we investigate the possibility of utilizing a deep learning model to compute shape measures of the brain's white matter connections. We introduce a novel framework, TractShapeNet, that leverages a point cloud representation of tractography to compute five shape measures: length, span, volume, total surface area, and irregularity. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. Experiments for shape measure computation demonstrate that our proposed TractShapeNet outperforms other point cloud-based neural network models in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and normalized error metrics. We compare the inference runtime results with the conventional shape computation tool DSI-Studio. Our results demonstrate that a deep learning approach enables faster and more efficient shape measure computation. We also conduct experiments on two downstream language cognition prediction tasks, showing that shape measures from TractShapeNet perform similarly to those computed by DSI-Studio.

<p>Abstract: Our work tackles the computational challenges of contrastive learning methods, particularly for the pretraining of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Despite the effectiveness of contrastive learning, the substantial computational resources required for training often hinder their practical application. To mitigate this issue, we propose an acceleration framework, leveraging ViT's unique ability to generalize across inputs of varying sequence lengths. Our method employs a mix of sequence compression strategies, including randomized token dropout and flexible patch scaling, to reduce the cost of gradient estimation and accelerate convergence. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the gradient estimation error of various acceleration strategies as well as their impact on downstream tasks, offering valuable insights into the trade-offs between acceleration and performance.
  We also propose a novel procedure to identify an optimal acceleration schedule to adjust the sequence compression ratios to the training progress, ensuring efficient training without sacrificing downstream performance. Our approach significantly reduces computational overhead across various self-supervised learning algorithms on large-scale datasets. In ImageNet, our method achieves speedups of 4$\times$ in MoCo, 3.3$\times$ in SimCLR, and 2.5$\times$ in DINO, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image generation is a prevailing technique for clinical data augmentation for advancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing healthcare disparities. Diffusion Model (DM) has become a leading method in generating synthetic medical images, but it suffers from a critical twofold bias: (1) The quality of images generated for Caucasian individuals is significantly higher, as measured by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). (2) The ability of the downstream-task learner to learn critical features from disease images varies across different skin tones. These biases pose significant risks, particularly in skin disease detection, where underrepresentation of certain skin tones can lead to misdiagnosis or neglect of specific conditions. To address these challenges, we propose FairSkin, a novel DM framework that mitigates these biases through a three-level resampling mechanism, ensuring fairer representation across racial and disease categories. Our approach significantly improves the diversity and quality of generated images, contributing to more equitable skin disease detection in clinical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of Remote Sensing Domain Generalization (RSDG) has emerged as a critical and valuable research frontier, focusing on developing models that generalize effectively across diverse scenarios. Despite the substantial domain gaps in RS images that are characterized by variabilities such as location, wavelength, and sensor type, research in this area remains underexplored: (1) Current cross-domain methods primarily focus on Domain Adaptation (DA), which adapts models to predefined domains rather than to unseen ones; (2) Few studies targeting the RSDG issue, especially for semantic segmentation tasks, where existing models are developed for specific unknown domains, struggling with issues of underfitting on other unknown scenarios; (3) Existing RS foundation models tend to prioritize in-domain performance over cross-domain generalization. To this end, we introduce the first vision foundation model for RSDG semantic segmentation, CrossEarth. CrossEarth demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization through a specially designed data-level Earth-Style Injection pipeline and a model-level Multi-Task Training pipeline. In addition, for the semantic segmentation task, we have curated an RSDG benchmark comprising 28 cross-domain settings across various regions, spectral bands, platforms, and climates, providing a comprehensive framework for testing the generalizability of future RSDG models. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the superiority of CrossEarth over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Guo, Wenbo Jiang, Rui Zhang, Guoming Lu, Hongwei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the success of Text-to-Image (T2I) models has led to the rise of numerous third-party platforms, which claim to provide cheaper API services and more flexibility in model options. However, this also raises a new security concern: Are these third-party services truly offering the models they claim? To address this problem, we propose the first T2I model verification method named Text-to-Image Model Verification via Non-Transferable Adversarial Attacks (TVN). The non-transferability of adversarial examples means that these examples are only effective on a target model and ineffective on other models, thereby allowing for the verification of the target model. TVN utilizes the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to optimize the cosine similarity of a prompt's text encoding, generating non-transferable adversarial prompts. By calculating the CLIP-text scores between the non-transferable adversarial prompts without perturbations and the images, we can verify if the model matches the claimed target model, based on a 3-sigma threshold. The experiments showed that TVN performed well in both closed-set and open-set scenarios, achieving a verification accuracy of over 90\%. Moreover, the adversarial prompts generated by TVN significantly reduced the CLIP-text scores of the target model, while having little effect on other models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Ni, Guofeng Zhang, Guanglin Li, Yijin Li, Xinyang Liu, Zhaoyang Huang, Hujun Bao</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the efficiency problem of learning local feature matching. Recent advancements have given rise to purely CNN-based and transformer-based approaches, each augmented with deep learning techniques. While CNN-based methods often excel in matching speed, transformer-based methods tend to provide more accurate matches. We propose an efficient transformer-based network architecture for local feature matching. This technique is built on constructing multiple homography hypotheses to approximate the continuous correspondence in the real world and uni-directional cross-attention to accelerate the refinement. On the YFCC100M dataset, our matching accuracy is competitive with LoFTR, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture, while the inference speed is boosted to 4 times, even outperforming the CNN-based methods. Comprehensive evaluations on other open datasets such as Megadepth, ScanNet, and HPatches demonstrate our method's efficacy, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance a wide array of downstream applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Min, Yawei Luo, Jianwen Sun, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian splitting (3DGS) can reconstruct new scenes from sparse-view observations in a feed-forward inference manner, eliminating the need for scene-specific retraining required in conventional 3DGS. However, existing methods rely heavily on epipolar priors, which can be unreliable in complex realworld scenes, particularly in non-overlapping and occluded regions. In this paper, we propose eFreeSplat, an efficient feed-forward 3DGS-based model for generalizable novel view synthesis that operates independently of epipolar line constraints. To enhance multiview feature extraction with 3D perception, we employ a selfsupervised Vision Transformer (ViT) with cross-view completion pre-training on large-scale datasets. Additionally, we introduce an Iterative Cross-view Gaussians Alignment method to ensure consistent depth scales across different views. Our eFreeSplat represents an innovative approach for generalizable novel view synthesis. Different from the existing pure geometry-free methods, eFreeSplat focuses more on achieving epipolar-free feature matching and encoding by providing 3D priors through cross-view pretraining. We evaluate eFreeSplat on wide-baseline novel view synthesis tasks using the RealEstate10K and ACID datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that eFreeSplat surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that rely on epipolar priors, achieving superior geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shentong Mo, Yibing Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications. While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation. We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference. Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations. The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Wu, Yujian Betterest Li, Jian Lou, Xiaoyu Zhang, Handing Wang, Jing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of daily services, the deployment of deep neural networks underscores the paramount importance of their reliability. However, the vulnerability of these networks to adversarial attacks, primarily evasion-based, poses a concerning threat to their functionality. Common methods for enhancing robustness involve heavy adversarial training or leveraging learned knowledge from clean data, both necessitating substantial computational resources. This inherent time-intensive nature severely limits the agility of large foundational models to swiftly counter adversarial perturbations. To address this challenge, this paper focuses on the Rapid Plug-in Defender (RaPiD) problem, aiming to rapidly counter adversarial perturbations without altering the deployed model. Drawing inspiration from the generalization and the universal computation ability of pre-trained transformer models, we propose a novel method termed CeTaD (Considering Pre-trained Transformers as Defenders) for RaPiD, optimized for efficient computation. CeTaD strategically fine-tunes the normalization layer parameters within the defender using a limited set of clean and adversarial examples. Our evaluation centers on assessing CeTaD's effectiveness, transferability, and the impact of different components in scenarios involving one-shot adversarial examples. The proposed method is capable of rapidly adapting to various attacks and different application scenarios without altering the target model and clean training data. We also explore the influence of varying training data conditions on CeTaD's performance. Notably, CeTaD exhibits adaptability across differentiable service models and proves the potential of continuous learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuandong Zhao, Kexun Zhang, Zihao Su, Saastha Vasan, Ilya Grishchenko, Christopher Kruegel, Giovanni Vigna, Yu-Xiang Wang, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Invisible watermarks safeguard images' copyrights by embedding hidden messages only detectable by owners. They also prevent people from misusing images, especially those generated by AI models. We propose a family of regeneration attacks to remove these invisible watermarks. The proposed attack method first adds random noise to an image to destroy the watermark and then reconstructs the image. This approach is flexible and can be instantiated with many existing image-denoising algorithms and pre-trained generative models such as diffusion models. Through formal proofs and extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that pixel-level invisible watermarks are vulnerable to this regeneration attack. Our results reveal that, across four different pixel-level watermarking schemes, the proposed method consistently achieves superior performance compared to existing attack techniques, with lower detection rates and higher image quality. However, watermarks that keep the image semantically similar can be an alternative defense against our attacks. Our finding underscores the need for a shift in research/industry emphasis from invisible watermarks to semantic-preserving watermarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiji Zhao, Ranjie Duan, Xizhe Wang, Xingxing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) has been widely proved to be an effective method to improve the adversarial robustness against adversarial examples for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). As a variant of AT, Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has demonstrated its superior performance in improving the robustness of small student models with the guidance of large teacher models. However, both AT and ARD encounter the robust fairness problem: these models exhibit strong robustness when facing part of classes (easy class), but weak robustness when facing others (hard class). In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis of the potential factors and argue that the smoothness degree of samples' soft labels for different classes (i.e., hard class or easy class) will affect the robust fairness of DNNs from both empirical observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above finding, we propose an Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) method to mitigate the adversarial robust fairness problem within the framework of Knowledge Distillation (KD). Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between different classes to achieve fairness by adjusting the class-wise smoothness degree of samples' soft labels during the training process, and the smoothness degree of soft labels is controlled by assigning different temperatures in KD to different classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art AT, ARD, and robust fairness methods in the comprehensive metric (Normalized Standard Deviation) of robustness and fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaichen Zhou, Lanqing Hong, Enze Xie, Yongxin Yang, Zhenguo Li, Wei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although significant progress has been made in the field of 2D-based interactive editing, fine-grained 3D-based interactive editing remains relatively unexplored. This limitation can be attributed to two main challenges: the lack of an efficient 3D representation robust to different modifications and the absence of an effective 3D interactive segmentation method. In this paper, we introduce a novel fine-grained interactive 3D segmentation and editing algorithm with radiance fields, which we refer to as SERF. Our method entails creating a neural mesh representation by integrating multi-view algorithms with pre-trained 2D models. Building upon this representation, we introduce a novel surface rendering technique that preserves local information and is robust to deformation. Moreover, this representation forms the basis for achieving accurate and interactive 3D segmentation without requiring 3D supervision. Harnessing this representation facilitates a range of interactive 3D editing operations, encompassing tasks such as interactive geometry editing and texture painting. Extensive experiments and visualization examples of editing on both real and synthetic data demonstrate the superiority of our method on representation quality and editing ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang-Yuan Hao, Jiji Zhang, Biwei Huang, Hao Wang, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning is pivotal in human cognition and especially important for providing explanations and making decisions. While Judea Pearl's influential approach is theoretically elegant, its generation of a counterfactual scenario often requires too much deviation from the observed scenarios to be feasible, as we show using simple examples. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose a framework of \emph{natural counterfactuals} and a method for generating counterfactuals that are more feasible with respect to the actual data distribution. Our methodology incorporates a certain amount of backtracking when needed, allowing changes in causally preceding variables to minimize deviations from realistic scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a novel optimization framework that permits but also controls the extent of backtracking with a naturalness criterion. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/GuangyuanHao/natural_counterfactuals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artem Vysogorets, Kartik Ahuja, Julia Kempe</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of exceptionally data-hungry models, careful selection of the training data is essential to mitigate the extensive costs of deep learning. Data pruning offers a solution by removing redundant or uninformative samples from the dataset, which yields faster convergence and improved neural scaling laws. However, little is known about its impact on classification bias of the trained models. We conduct the first systematic study of this effect and reveal that existing data pruning algorithms can produce highly biased classifiers. We present theoretical analysis of the classification risk in a mixture of Gaussians to argue that choosing appropriate class pruning ratios, coupled with random pruning within classes has potential to improve worst-class performance. We thus propose DRoP, a distributionally robust approach to pruning and empirically demonstrate its performance on standard computer vision benchmarks. In sharp contrast to existing algorithms, our proposed method continues improving distributional robustness at a tolerable drop of average performance as we prune more from the datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Legouhy, Ross Callaghan, Whitney Stee, Philippe Peigneux, Hojjat Azadbakht, Hui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern diffusion MRI sequences commonly acquire a large number of volumes with diffusion sensitization gradients of differing strengths or directions. Such sequences rely on echo-planar imaging (EPI) to achieve reasonable scan duration. However, EPI is vulnerable to off-resonance effects, leading to tissue susceptibility and eddy-current induced distortions. The latter is particularly problematic because it causes misalignment between volumes, disrupting downstream modelling and analysis. The essential correction of eddy distortions is typically done post-acquisition, with image registration. However, this is non-trivial because correspondence between volumes can be severely disrupted due to volume-specific signal attenuations induced by varying directions and strengths of the applied gradients. This challenge has been successfully addressed by the popular FSL~Eddy tool but at considerable computational cost. We propose an alternative approach, leveraging recent advances in image processing enabled by deep learning (DL). It consists of two convolutional neural networks: 1) An image translator to restore correspondence between images; 2) A registration model to align the translated images. Results demonstrate comparable distortion estimates to FSL~Eddy, while requiring only modest training sample sizes. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to tackle this problem with deep learning. Together with recently developed DL-based susceptibility correction techniques, they pave the way for real-time preprocessing of diffusion MRI, facilitating its wider uptake in the clinic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soufiane Belharbi, Mara KM Whitford, Phuong Hoang, Shakeeb Murtaza, Luke McCaffrey, Eric Granger</p>
<p>Abstract: Confocal fluorescence microscopy is one of the most accessible and widely used imaging techniques for the study of biological processes at the cellular and subcellular levels. Scanning confocal microscopy allows the capture of high-quality images from thick three-dimensional (3D) samples, yet suffers from well-known limitations such as photobleaching and phototoxicity of specimens caused by intense light exposure, limiting its applications. Cellular damage can be alleviated by changing imaging parameters to reduce light exposure, often at the expense of image quality. Machine/deep learning methods for single-image super-resolution (SISR) can be applied to restore image quality by upscaling lower-resolution (LR) images to yield high-resolution images (HR). These SISR methods have been successfully applied to photo-realistic images due partly to the abundance of publicly available data. In contrast, the lack of publicly available data partly limits their application and success in scanning confocal microscopy. In this paper, we introduce a large scanning confocal microscopy dataset named SR-CACO-2 that is comprised of low- and high-resolution image pairs marked for three different fluorescent markers. It allows the evaluation of performance of SISR methods on three different upscaling levels (X2, X4, X8). SR-CACO-2 contains the human epithelial cell line Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37), and it is composed of 2,200 unique images, captured with four resolutions and three markers, forming 9,937 image patches for SISR methods. We provide benchmarking results for 16 state-of-the-art methods of the main SISR families. Results show that these methods have limited success in producing high-resolution textures. The dataset is freely accessible under a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel S. Y. Teo, Tan M. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers in sequence modeling tasks, spanning various applications in natural language processing and computer vision, is attributed to the critical role of self-attention. Similar to the development of most deep learning models, the construction of these attention mechanisms relies on heuristics and experience. In our work, we derive self-attention from kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) and show that self-attention projects its query vectors onto the principal component axes of its key matrix in a feature space. We then formulate the exact formula for the value matrix in self-attention, theoretically and empirically demonstrating that this value matrix captures the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix of the key vectors in self-attention. Leveraging our kernel PCA framework, we propose Attention with Robust Principal Components (RPC-Attention), a novel class of robust attention that is resilient to data contamination. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of RPC-Attention over softmax attention on the ImageNet-1K object classification, WikiText-103 language modeling, and ADE20K image segmentation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pietro Mazzaglia, Tim Verbelen, Bart Dhoedt, Aaron Courville, Sai Rajeswar</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning generalist embodied agents, able to solve multitudes of tasks in different domains is a long-standing problem. Reinforcement learning (RL) is hard to scale up as it requires a complex reward design for each task. In contrast, language can specify tasks in a more natural way. Current foundation vision-language models (VLMs) generally require fine-tuning or other adaptations to be adopted in embodied contexts, due to the significant domain gap. However, the lack of multimodal data in such domains represents an obstacle to developing foundation models for embodied applications. In this work, we overcome these problems by presenting multimodal-foundation world models, able to connect and align the representation of foundation VLMs with the latent space of generative world models for RL, without any language annotations. The resulting agent learning framework, GenRL, allows one to specify tasks through vision and/or language prompts, ground them in the embodied domain's dynamics, and learn the corresponding behaviors in imagination. As assessed through large-scale multi-task benchmarking in locomotion and manipulation domains, GenRL enables multi-task generalization from language and visual prompts. Furthermore, by introducing a data-free policy learning strategy, our approach lays the groundwork for foundational policy learning using generative world models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Calvin Luo, Mandy He, Zilai Zeng, Chen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Training an agent to achieve particular goals or perform desired behaviors is often accomplished through reinforcement learning, especially in the absence of expert demonstrations. However, supporting novel goals or behaviors through reinforcement learning requires the ad-hoc design of appropriate reward functions, which quickly becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose Text-Aware Diffusion for Policy Learning (TADPoLe), which uses a pretrained, frozen text-conditioned diffusion model to compute dense zero-shot reward signals for text-aligned policy learning. We hypothesize that large-scale pretrained generative models encode rich priors that can supervise a policy to behave not only in a text-aligned manner, but also in alignment with a notion of naturalness summarized from internet-scale training data. In our experiments, we demonstrate that TADPoLe is able to learn policies for novel goal-achievement and continuous locomotion behaviors specified by natural language, in both Humanoid and Dog environments. The behaviors are learned zero-shot without ground-truth rewards or expert demonstrations, and are qualitatively more natural according to human evaluation. We further show that TADPoLe performs competitively when applied to robotic manipulation tasks in the Meta-World environment, without having access to any in-domain demonstrations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models generate new samples by progressively decreasing the noise from the initially provided random distribution. This inference procedure generally utilizes a trained neural network numerous times to obtain the final output, creating significant latency and energy consumption on digital electronic hardware such as GPUs. In this study, we demonstrate that the propagation of a light beam through a semi-transparent medium can be programmed to implement a denoising diffusion model on image samples. This framework projects noisy image patterns through passive diffractive optical layers, which collectively only transmit the predicted noise term in the image. The optical transparent layers, which are trained with an online training approach, backpropagating the error to the analytical model of the system, are passive and kept the same across different steps of denoising. Hence this method enables high-speed image generation with minimal power consumption, benefiting from the bandwidth and energy efficiency of optical information processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical imaging analysis faces challenges such as data scarcity, high annotation costs, and privacy concerns. This paper introduces the Medical AI for Synthetic Imaging (MAISI), an innovative approach using the diffusion model to generate synthetic 3D computed tomography (CT) images to address those challenges. MAISI leverages the foundation volume compression network and the latent diffusion model to produce high-resolution CT images (up to a landmark volume dimension of 512 x 512 x 768 ) with flexible volume dimensions and voxel spacing. By incorporating ControlNet, MAISI can process organ segmentation, including 127 anatomical structures, as additional conditions and enables the generation of accurately annotated synthetic images that can be used for various downstream tasks. Our experiment results show that MAISI's capabilities in generating realistic, anatomically accurate images for diverse regions and conditions reveal its promising potential to mitigate challenges using synthetic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions. Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP, and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best viewed at https://dynamo-ssl.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satyananda Kashyap, Niharika S. D'Souza, Luyao Shi, Ken C. L. Wong, Hongzhi Wang, Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood</p>
<p>Abstract: Content-addressable memories such as Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) have been studied as mathematical models of auto-association and storage/retrieval in the human declarative memory, yet their practical use for large-scale content storage faces challenges. Chief among them is the occurrence of meta-stable states, particularly when handling large amounts of high dimensional content. This paper introduces Hopfield Encoding Networks (HEN), a framework that integrates encoded neural representations into MHNs to improve pattern separability and reduce meta-stable states. We show that HEN can also be used for retrieval in the context of hetero association of images with natural language queries, thus removing the limitation of requiring access to partial content in the same domain. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reduction in meta-stable states and increased storage capacity while still enabling perfect recall of a significantly larger number of inputs advancing the practical utility of associative memory networks for real-world tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxiang Han, Xinyu Li, Jiang Shang, Yiman Liu, Keyan Chen, Shugong Xu, Qiaohong Liu, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmenting anatomical structures and lesions from ultrasound images contributes to disease assessment. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) based on sparse annotation has achieved encouraging performance and demonstrated the potential to reduce annotation costs. This study attempts to introduce scribble-based WSL into ultrasound image segmentation tasks. However, ultrasound images often suffer from poor contrast and unclear edges, coupled with insufficient supervison signals for edges, posing challenges to edge prediction. Uncertainty modeling has been proven to facilitate models in dealing with these issues. Nevertheless, existing uncertainty estimation paradigms are not robust enough and often filter out predictions near decision boundaries, resulting in unstable edge predictions. Therefore, we propose leveraging predictions near decision boundaries effectively. Specifically, we introduce Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence to design an Evidence-Guided Consistency strategy. This strategy utilizes high-evidence predictions, which are more likely to occur near high-density regions, to guide the optimization of low-evidence predictions that may appear near decision boundaries. Furthermore, the diverse sizes and locations of lesions in ultrasound images pose a challenge for CNNs with local receptive fields, as they struggle to model global information. Therefore, we introduce Visual Mamba based on structured state space sequence models, which achieves long-range dependency with linear computational complexity, and we construct a novel hybrid CNN-Mamba framework. During training, the collaboration between the CNN branch and the Mamba branch in the proposed framework draws inspiration from each other based on the EGC strategy. Experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method. Dataset and code will be available on https://github.com/GtLinyer/MambaEviScrib.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04680">Next Best Sense: Guiding Vision and Touch with FisherRF for 3D Gaussian Splatting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Strong, Boshu Lei, Aiden Swann, Wen Jiang, Kostas Daniilidis, Monroe Kennedy III</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a framework for active next best view and touch selection for robotic manipulators using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). 3DGS is emerging as a useful explicit 3D scene representation for robotics, as it has the ability to represent scenes in a both photorealistic and geometrically accurate manner. However, in real-world, online robotic scenes where the number of views is limited given efficiency requirements, random view selection for 3DGS becomes impractical as views are often overlapping and redundant. We address this issue by proposing an end-to-end online training and active view selection pipeline, which enhances the performance of 3DGS in few-view robotics settings. We first elevate the performance of few-shot 3DGS with a novel semantic depth alignment method using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) that we supplement with Pearson depth and surface normal loss to improve color and depth reconstruction of real-world scenes. We then extend FisherRF, a next-best-view selection method for 3DGS, to select views and touch poses based on depth uncertainty. We perform online view selection on a real robot system during live 3DGS training. We motivate our improvements to few-shot GS scenes, and extend depth-based FisherRF to them, where we demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements on challenging robot scenes.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12419">Mind the Context: Attention-Guided Weak-to-Strong Consistency for Enhanced Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Cheng, Chenxi Shao, Jie Ma, Guoliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a pivotal step in diagnostic and therapeutic processes, relying on high-quality annotated data that is often challenging and costly to obtain. Semi-supervised learning offers a promising approach to enhance model performance by leveraging unlabeled data. Although weak-to-strong consistency is a prevalent method in semi-supervised image segmentation, there is a scarcity of research on perturbation strategies specifically tailored for semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a simple yet efficient semi-supervised learning framework named Attention-Guided weak-to-strong Consistency Match (AIGCMatch). The AIGCMatch framework incorporates attention-guided perturbation strategies at both the image and feature levels to achieve weak-to-strong consistency regularization. This method not only preserves the structural information of medical images but also enhances the model's ability to process complex semantic information. Extensive experiments conducted on the ACDC and ISIC-2017 datasets have validated the effectiveness of AIGCMatch. Our method achieved a 90.4\% Dice score in the 7-case scenario on the ACDC dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating its potential and efficacy in clinical settings. Additionally, on the ISIC-2017 dataset, we significantly outperformed our baseline, indicating the robustness and generalizability of AIGCMatch across different medical image segmentation tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21898">A Longitudinal Analysis of Racial and Gender Bias in New York Times and Fox News Images and Articles</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hazem Ibrahim, Nouar AlDahoul, Syed Mustafa Ali Abbasi, Fareed Zaffar, Talal Rahwan, Yasir Zaki</p>
<p>Abstract: The manner in which different racial and gender groups are portrayed in news coverage plays a large role in shaping public opinion. As such, understanding how such groups are portrayed in news media is of notable societal value, and has thus been a significant endeavour in both the computer and social sciences. Yet, the literature still lacks a longitudinal study examining both the frequency of appearance of different racial and gender groups in online news articles, as well as the context in which such groups are discussed. To fill this gap, we propose two machine learning classifiers to detect the race and age of a given subject. Next, we compile a dataset of 123,337 images and 441,321 online news articles from New York Times (NYT) and Fox News (Fox), and examine representation through two computational approaches. Firstly, we examine the frequency and prominence of appearance of racial and gender groups in images embedded in news articles, revealing that racial and gender minorities are largely under-represented, and when they do appear, they are featured less prominently compared to majority groups. Furthermore, we find that NYT largely features more images of racial minority groups compared to Fox. Secondly, we examine both the frequency and context with which racial minority groups are presented in article text. This reveals the narrow scope in which certain racial groups are covered and the frequency with which different groups are presented as victims and/or perpetrators in a given conflict. Taken together, our analysis contributes to the literature by providing two novel open-source classifiers to detect race and age from images, and shedding light on the racial and gender biases in news articles from venues on opposite ends of the American political spectrum.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22637">Consistency Diffusion Bridge Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guande He, Kaiwen Zheng, Jianfei Chen, Fan Bao, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become the dominant paradigm of generative modeling in a variety of domains by learning stochastic processes from noise to data. Recently, diffusion denoising bridge models (DDBMs), a new formulation of generative modeling that builds stochastic processes between fixed data endpoints based on a reference diffusion process, have achieved empirical success across tasks with coupled data distribution, such as image-to-image translation. However, DDBM's sampling process typically requires hundreds of network evaluations to achieve decent performance, which may impede their practical deployment due to high computational demands. In this work, inspired by the recent advance of consistency models in DMs, we tackle this problem by learning the consistency function of the probability-flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) of DDBMs, which directly predicts the solution at a starting step given any point on the ODE trajectory. Based on a dedicated general-form ODE solver, we propose two paradigms: consistency bridge distillation and consistency bridge training, which is flexible to apply on DDBMs with broad design choices. Experimental results show that our proposed method could sample $4\times$ to $50\times$ faster than the base DDBM and produce better visual quality given the same step in various tasks with pixel resolution ranging from $64 \times 64$ to $256 \times 256$, as well as supporting downstream tasks such as semantic interpolation in the data space.</p>
