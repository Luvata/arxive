<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenny Peng, Nikhil Garg, Jon Kleinberg</p>
<p>Abstract: The gold standard in human-AI collaboration is complementarity -- when combined performance exceeds both the human and algorithm alone. We investigate this challenge in binary classification settings where the goal is to maximize 0-1 accuracy. Given two or more agents who can make calibrated probabilistic predictions, we show a "No Free Lunch"-style result. Any deterministic collaboration strategy (a function mapping calibrated probabilities into binary classifications) that does not essentially always defer to the same agent will sometimes perform worse than the least accurate agent. In other words, complementarity cannot be achieved "for free." The result does suggest one model of collaboration with guarantees, where one agent identifies "obvious" errors of the other agent. We also use the result to understand the necessary conditions enabling the success of other collaboration techniques, providing guidance to human-AI collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Han, Zekun Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of regulatory updates from global authorities presents significant challenges for medical device manufacturers, necessitating agile strategies to sustain compliance and maintain market access. Concurrently, regulatory bodies must effectively monitor manufacturers' responses and develop strategic surveillance plans. This study employs a multi-agent modeling approach, enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), to simulate regulatory dynamics and examine the adaptive behaviors of key actors, including regulatory bodies, manufacturers, and competitors. These agents operate within a simulated environment governed by regulatory flow theory, capturing the impacts of regulatory changes on compliance decisions, market adaptation, and innovation strategies. Our findings illuminate the influence of regulatory shifts on industry behaviour and identify strategic opportunities for improving regulatory practices, optimizing compliance, and fostering innovation. By leveraging the integration of multi-agent systems and LLMs, this research provides a novel perspective and offers actionable insights for stakeholders navigating the evolving regulatory landscape of the medical device industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Kutub Uddin, Md. Saiful Islam, Md Abrar Jahin, Md. Tanjid Hossen Irfan, Md. Saiful Islam Seam, M. F. Mridha</p>
<p>Abstract: In the design of cellular manufacturing systems (CMS), numerous technological and managerial decisions must be made at both the design and operational stages. The first step in designing a CMS involves grouping parts and machines. In this paper, four integer programming formulations are presented for grouping parts and machines in a CMS at both the design and operational levels for a generalized grouping problem, where each part has more than one process plan, and each operation of a process plan can be performed on more than one machine. The minimization of inter-cell and intra-cell movements is achieved by assigning the maximum possible number of consecutive operations of a part type to the same cell and to the same machine, respectively. The suitability of minimizing inter-cell and intra-cell movements as an objective, compared to other objectives such as minimizing investment costs on machines, operating costs, etc., is discussed. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the workings of the formulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artem Karpov, Seong Hah Cho, Austin Meek, Raymond Koopmanschap, Lucy Farnik, Bogdan-Ionut Cirstea</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the alignment (BrainScore) of large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for moral reasoning on behavioral data and/or brain data of humans performing the same task. We also explore if fine-tuning several LLMs on the fMRI data of humans performing moral reasoning can improve the BrainScore. We fine-tune several LLMs (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa) on moral reasoning behavioral data from the ETHICS benchmark [Hendrycks et al., 2020], on the moral reasoning fMRI data from Koster-Hale et al. [2013], or on both. We study both the accuracy on the ETHICS benchmark and the BrainScores between model activations and fMRI data. While larger models generally performed better on both metrics, BrainScores did not significantly improve after fine-tuning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15560">Do LLMs Agree on the Creativity Evaluation of Alternative Uses?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Al Rabeyah, Fabr\'icio G\'oes, Marco Volpe, Talles Medeiros</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) show agreement in assessing creativity in responses to the Alternative Uses Test (AUT). While LLMs are increasingly used to evaluate creative content, previous studies have primarily focused on a single model assessing responses generated by the same model or humans. This paper explores whether LLMs can impartially and accurately evaluate creativity in outputs generated by both themselves and other models. Using an oracle benchmark set of AUT responses, categorized by creativity level (common, creative, and highly creative), we experiment with four state-of-the-art LLMs evaluating these outputs. We test both scoring and ranking methods and employ two evaluation settings (comprehensive and segmented) to examine if LLMs agree on the creativity evaluation of alternative uses. Results reveal high inter-model agreement, with Spearman correlations averaging above 0.7 across models and reaching over 0.77 with respect to the oracle, indicating a high level of agreement and validating the reliability of LLMs in creativity assessment of alternative uses. Notably, models do not favour their own responses, instead they provide similar creativity assessment scores or rankings for alternative uses generated by other models. These findings suggest that LLMs exhibit impartiality and high alignment in creativity evaluation, offering promising implications for their use in automated creativity assessment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in AI -- including generative approaches -- have resulted in technology that can support humans in scientific discovery and decision support but may also disrupt democracies and target individuals. The responsible use of AI increasingly shows the need for human-AI teaming, necessitating effective interaction between humans and machines. A crucial yet often overlooked aspect of these interactions is the different ways in which humans and machines generalise. In cognitive science, human generalisation commonly involves abstraction and concept learning. In contrast, AI generalisation encompasses out-of-domain generalisation in machine learning, rule-based reasoning in symbolic AI, and abstraction in neuro-symbolic AI. In this perspective paper, we combine insights from AI and cognitive science to identify key commonalities and differences across three dimensions: notions of generalisation, methods for generalisation, and evaluation of generalisation. We map the different conceptualisations of generalisation in AI and cognitive science along these three dimensions and consider their role in human-AI teaming. This results in interdisciplinary challenges across AI and cognitive science that must be tackled to provide a foundation for effective and cognitively supported alignment in human-AI teaming scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15737">TableTime: Reformulating Time Series Classification as Zero-Shot Table Understanding via Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Wang, Mingyue Cheng, Qingyang Mao, Qi Liu, Feiyang Xu, Xin Li, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Wang, Chao Liang, Yunfan Gao, Yang Liu, Jing Li, Haofen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial parks are critical to urban economic growth. Yet, their development often encounters challenges stemming from imbalances between industrial requirements and urban services, underscoring the need for strategic planning and operations. This paper introduces IndustryScopeKG, a pioneering large-scale multi-modal, multi-level industrial park knowledge graph, which integrates diverse urban data including street views, corporate, socio-economic, and geospatial information, capturing the complex relationships and semantics within industrial parks. Alongside this, we present the IndustryScopeGPT framework, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte Carlo Tree Search to enhance tool-augmented reasoning and decision-making in Industrial Park Planning and Operation (IPPO). Our work significantly improves site recommendation and functional planning, demonstrating the potential of combining LLMs with structured datasets to advance industrial park management. This approach sets a new benchmark for intelligent IPPO research and lays a robust foundation for advancing urban industrial development.

<p>Abstract: Effective extraction of the world knowledge in LLMs for complex decision-making tasks remains a challenge. We propose a framework PIANIST for decomposing the world model into seven intuitive components conducive to zero-shot LLM generation. Given only the natural language description of the game and how input observations are formatted, our method can generate a working world model for fast and efficient MCTS simulation. We show that our method works well on two different games that challenge the planning and decision making skills of the agent for both language and non-language based action taking, without any training on domain-specific training data or explicitly defined world model.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16120">Why the Agent Made that Decision: Explaining Deep Reinforcement Learning with Vision Masks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zuo, Zifan Wang, Simon Khan, Garrett Ethan Katz, Qinru Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the inherent lack of transparency in deep neural networks, it is challenging for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to gain trust and acceptance from users, especially in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnosis and military operations. Existing methods for explaining an agent's decision either require to retrain the agent using models that support explanation generation or rely on perturbation-based techniques to reveal the significance of different input features in the decision making process. However, retraining the agent may compromise its integrity and performance, while perturbation-based methods have limited performance and lack knowledge accumulation or learning capabilities. Moreover, since each perturbation is performed independently, the joint state of the perturbed inputs may not be physically meaningful. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{VisionMask}$, a standalone explanation model trained end-to-end to identify the most critical regions in the agent's visual input that can explain its actions. VisionMask is trained in a self-supervised manner without relying on human-generated labels. Importantly, its training does not alter the agent model, hence preserving the agent's performance and integrity. We evaluate VisionMask on Super Mario Bros (SMB) and three Atari games. Compared to existing methods, VisionMask achieves a 14.9% higher insertion accuracy and a 30.08% higher F1-Score in reproducing original actions from the selected visual explanations. We also present examples illustrating how VisionMask can be used for counterfactual analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmoud M. Kishky, Hesham M. Eraqi, Khaled F. Elsayed</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving involves complex tasks such as data fusion, object and lane detection, behavior prediction, and path planning. As opposed to the modular approach which dedicates individual subsystems to tackle each of those tasks, the end-to-end approach treats the problem as a single learnable task using deep neural networks, reducing system complexity and minimizing dependency on heuristics. Conditional imitation learning (CIL) trains the end-to-end model to mimic a human expert considering the navigational commands guiding the vehicle to reach its destination, CIL adopts specialist network branches dedicated to learn the driving task for each navigational command. Nevertheless, the CIL model lacked generalization when deployed to unseen environments. This work introduces the conditional imitation co-learning (CIC) approach to address this issue by enabling the model to learn the relationships between CIL specialist branches via a co-learning matrix generated by gated hyperbolic tangent units (GTUs). Additionally, we propose posing the steering regression problem as classification, we use a classification-regression hybrid loss to bridge the gap between regression and classification, we also propose using co-existence probability to consider the spatial tendency between the steering classes. Our model is demonstrated to improve autonomous driving success rate in unseen environment by 62% on average compared to the CIL method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihua Duan, Jialin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges when dealing with complex reasoning tasks, often resulting in hallucinations, which limit the practical application of LLMs. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new method that integrates different LLMs to expand the knowledge boundary, reduce dependence on a single model, and promote in-depth debate among agents. The main contributions include: 1) Introducing third-party LLMs to adjust the attention weights of agents through uncertainty estimation and confidence analysis, optimizing consensus formation in multi-agent systems; 2) Experiments on arithmetic datasets have validated the effectiveness of the method, surpassing traditional multi-agent baselines. This research provides a new perspective for large models to alleviate hallucination phenomena when dealing with complex tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathis Immertreu, Achim Schilling, Andreas Maier, Patrick Krauss</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the potential for artificial agents to develop core consciousness, as proposed by Antonio Damasio's theory of consciousness. According to Damasio, the emergence of core consciousness relies on the integration of a self model, informed by representations of emotions and feelings, and a world model. We hypothesize that an artificial agent, trained via reinforcement learning (RL) in a virtual environment, can develop preliminary forms of these models as a byproduct of its primary task. The agent's main objective is to learn to play a video game and explore the environment. To evaluate the emergence of world and self models, we employ probes-feedforward classifiers that use the activations of the trained agent's neural networks to predict the spatial positions of the agent itself. Our results demonstrate that the agent can form rudimentary world and self models, suggesting a pathway toward developing machine consciousness. This research provides foundational insights into the capabilities of artificial agents in mirroring aspects of human consciousness, with implications for future advancements in artificial intelligence.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16313">CATP-LLM: Empowering Large Language Models for Cost-Aware Tool Planning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Duo Wu, Jinghe Wang, Yuan Meng, Yanning Zhang, Le Sun, Zhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for tool planning has emerged as a promising avenue for developing general AI systems, where LLMs automatically schedule external tools (e.g. vision models) to tackle complex tasks based on task descriptions. To push this paradigm toward practical applications, it is crucial for LLMs to consider tool execution costs (e.g. execution time) for tool planning. Unfortunately, prior studies overlook the tool execution costs, leading to the generation of expensive plans of which the costs outweigh task performance. To fill this gap, we propose the Cost-Aware Tool Planning with LLMs (CATP-LLM) framework, which for the first time provides a coherent design to empower LLMs for cost-aware tool planning. Specifically, CATP-LLM incorporates a tool planning language to enhance the LLM to generate non-sequential plans of multiple branches for efficient concurrent tool execution and cost reduction. Moreover, it further designs a cost-aware offline reinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the LLM to optimize the performance-cost trade-off in tool planning. In lack of public cost-related datasets, we further present OpenCATP, the first platform for cost-aware planning evaluation. Experiments on OpenCATP show that CATP-LLM outperforms GPT-4 even when using Llama2-7B as its backbone, with the average improvement of 28.2%-30.2% higher plan performance and 24.7%-45.8% lower costs even on the challenging planning tasks. The codes of CATP-LLM and OpenCATP will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assessment and evaluation have long been critical challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable insights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

The model is based on the foundational ontology DOLCE+DnS Ultralite (DUL) and provides comprehensive support to represent time and space, objects and persons, as well as mereological, causal, and correlative relationships between events. In addition, the Event-Model-F provides a flexible means for event composition, modeling event causality and event correlation, and representing different interpretations of the same event. The Event-Model-F is developed following the pattern-oriented approach of DUL, is modularized in different ontologies, and can be easily extended by domain specific ontologies.</p>

Here, we explore using a combination of Large Language Models and search to build dafny-annotator: a tool that adds logical annotations to a Dafny method until the verifier can prove it correct. On a test set from the DafnyBench collection of programs, greedy search guided by LLaMa 3.1 8B successfully annotates only 15.7% of the methods. Since this data-driven approach is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data, we propose a method for open-ended synthesis of new Dafny programs in a flexible pipeline where LLMs formulate high-level ideas, implement them, and incrementally propose changes to existing programs, which Dafny validates. This gives us a synthetic dataset, DafnySynth, which we use to augment DafnyBench for training. Fine-tuning on both datasets boosts LLaMa 8B's success rate to 50.6% -- significantly better than the base model, or training on either dataset alone. Our results suggest a path towards capable AI assistants for languages that don't yet have large-scale human-generated examples. In turn, such assistants might reduce friction for users and ultimately drive adoption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic, Gianfranco Basti, Tobias Holstein</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI systems increasingly operate with autonomy and adaptability, the traditional boundaries of moral responsibility in techno-social systems are being challenged. This paper explores the evolving discourse on the delegation of responsibilities to intelligent autonomous agents and the ethical implications of such practices. Synthesizing recent developments in AI ethics, including concepts of distributed responsibility and ethical AI by design, the paper proposes a functionalist perspective as a framework. This perspective views moral responsibility not as an individual trait but as a role within a socio-technical system, distributed among human and artificial agents. As an example of 'AI ethical by design,' we present Basti and Vitiello's implementation. They suggest that AI can act as artificial moral agents by learning ethical guidelines and using Deontic Higher-Order Logic to assess decisions ethically. Motivated by the possible speed and scale beyond human supervision and ethical implications, the paper argues for 'AI ethical by design', while acknowledging the distributed, shared, and dynamic nature of responsibility. This functionalist approach offers a practical framework for navigating the complexities of AI ethics in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Mantelero</p>
<p>Abstract: What is the context which gave rise to the obligation to carry out a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA) in the AI Act? How has assessment of the impact on fundamental rights been framed by the EU legislator in the AI Act? What methodological criteria should be followed in developing the FRIA? These are the three main research questions that this article aims to address, through both legal analysis of the relevant provisions of the AI Act and discussion of various possible models for assessment of the impact of AI on fundamental rights. The overall objective of this article is to fill existing gaps in the theoretical and methodological elaboration of the FRIA, as outlined in the AI Act. In order to facilitate the future work of EU and national bodies and AI operators in placing this key tool for human-centric and trustworthy AI at the heart of the EU approach to AI design and development, this article outlines the main building blocks of a model template for the FRIA. While this proposal is consistent with the rationale and scope of the AI Act, it is also applicable beyond the cases listed in Article 27 and can serve as a blueprint for other national and international regulatory initiatives to ensure that AI is fully consistent with human rights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salar Farahmand-Tabar</p>
<p>Abstract: Metaheuristics are stochastic optimization algorithms that mimic natural processes to find optimal solutions to complex problems. The success of metaheuristics largely depends on the ability to effectively explore and exploit the search space. Memory mechanisms have been introduced in several popular metaheuristic algorithms to enhance their performance. This chapter explores the significance of memory in metaheuristic algorithms and provides insights from well-known algorithms. The chapter begins by introducing the concept of memory, and its role in metaheuristic algorithms. The key factors influencing the effectiveness of memory mechanisms are discussed, such as the size of the memory, the information stored in memory, and the rate of information decay. A comprehensive analysis of how memory mechanisms are incorporated into popular metaheuristic algorithms is presented and concludes by highlighting the importance of memory in metaheuristic performance and providing future research directions for improving memory mechanisms. The key takeaways are that memory mechanisms can significantly enhance the performance of metaheuristics by enabling them to explore and exploit the search space effectively and efficiently, and that the choice of memory mechanism should be tailored to the problem domain and the characteristics of the search space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixian Su, Jingwei Guo, Xi Yang, Qiufeng Wang, Kaizhu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: While Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has shown promise in addressing distribution shifts between training and testing data, its effectiveness diminishes with heterogeneous data streams due to uniform target estimation. As previous attempts merely stabilize model fine-tuning over time to handle continually changing environments, they fundamentally assume a homogeneous target domain at any moment, leaving the intrinsic real-world data heterogeneity unresolved. This paper delves into TTA under heterogeneous data streams, moving beyond current model-centric limitations. By revisiting TTA from a data-centric perspective, we discover that decomposing samples into Fourier space facilitates an accurate data separation across different frequency levels. Drawing from this insight, we propose a novel Frequency-based Decentralized Adaptation (FreDA) framework, which transitions data from globally heterogeneous to locally homogeneous in Fourier space and employs decentralized adaptation to manage diverse distribution shifts.Interestingly, we devise a novel Fourier-based augmentation strategy to assist in decentralizing adaptation, which individually enhances sample quality for capturing each type of distribution shifts. Extensive experiments across various settings (corrupted, natural, and medical environments) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Hui, Zhaoxiao Guo, Hang Zhao, Juanyong Duan, Lin Ai, Yinheng Li, Julia Hirschberg, Congrui Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality, diverse harmful data is essential to addressing real-time applications in content moderation. Current state-of-the-art approaches to toxic content detection using GPT series models are costly and lack explainability. This paper investigates the use of prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques on open-source LLMs to enhance harmful data augmentation specifically for toxic content detection. We conduct a two-stage empirical study, with stage 1 evaluating six open-source LLMs across multiple datasets using only prompt engineering and stage 2 focusing on fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that Mistral can excel in generating harmful data with minimal hallucination. While fine-tuning these models improves data quality and diversity, challenges such as data duplication and overfitting persist. Our experimental results highlight scalable, cost-effective strategies for enhancing toxic content detection systems. These findings not only demonstrate the potential of open-source LLMs in creating robust content moderation tools. The application of this method in real industrial scenarios further proves the feasibility and efficiency of the fine-tuned open-source LLMs for data augmentation. We hope our study will aid in understanding the capabilities and limitations of current models in toxic content detection and drive further advancements in this field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) underpin many scientific phenomena, yet traditional computational approaches often struggle with complex, nonlinear systems and irregular geometries. This paper introduces the \textbf{AMG} method, a \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{G}raph neural operator approach designed for efficiently solving PDEs on \textbf{A}rbitrary geometries. AMG leverages advanced graph-based techniques and dynamic attention mechanisms within a novel GraphFormer architecture, enabling precise management of diverse spatial domains and complex data interdependencies. By constructing multi-scale graphs to handle variable feature frequencies and a physics graph to encapsulate inherent physical properties, AMG significantly outperforms previous methods, which are typically limited to uniform grids. We present a comprehensive evaluation of AMG across six benchmarks, demonstrating its consistent superiority over existing state-of-the-art models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingxuan Ren, Fengtao Ren, Bo Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cancer, with its inherent heterogeneity, is commonly categorized into distinct subtypes based on unique traits, cellular origins, and molecular markers specific to each type. However, current studies primarily rely on complete multi-omics datasets for predicting cancer subtypes, often overlooking predictive performance in cases where some omics data may be missing and neglecting implicit relationships across multiple layers of omics data integration. This paper introduces Multi-Layer Matrix Factorization (MLMF), a novel approach for cancer subtyping that employs multi-omics data clustering. MLMF initially processes multi-omics feature matrices by performing multi-layer linear or nonlinear factorization, decomposing the original data into latent feature representations unique to each omics type. These latent representations are subsequently fused into a consensus form, on which spectral clustering is performed to determine subtypes. Additionally, MLMF incorporates a class indicator matrix to handle missing omics data, creating a unified framework that can manage both complete and incomplete multi-omics data. Extensive experiments conducted on 10 multi-omics cancer datasets, both complete and with missing values, demonstrate that MLMF achieves results that are comparable to or surpass the performance of several state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: As recruitment and talent acquisition have become more and more competitive, recruitment firms have become more sophisticated in using machine learning (ML) methodologies for optimizing their day to day activities. But, most of published ML based methodologies in this area have been limited to the tasks like candidate matching, job to skill matching, job classification and normalization. In this work, we discuss a novel task in the recruitment domain, namely, application count forecasting, motivation of which comes from designing of effective outreach activities to attract qualified applicants. We show that existing auto-regressive based time series forecasting methods perform poorly for this task. Henceforth, we propose a multimodal LM-based model which fuses job-posting metadata of various modalities through a simple encoder. Experiments from large real-life datasets from CareerBuilder LLC show the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Xia, Yajie Zhang, Xiangxiang Zeng, Xingyi Zhang, Chunhou Zheng, Yansen Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular optimization, which aims to discover improved molecules from a vast chemical search space, is a critical step in chemical development. Various artificial intelligence technologies have demonstrated high effectiveness and efficiency on molecular optimization tasks. However, few of these technologies focus on balancing property optimization with constraint satisfaction, making it difficult to obtain high-quality molecules that not only possess desirable properties but also meet various constraints. To address this issue, we propose a constrained multi-property molecular optimization framework (CMOMO), which is a flexible and efficient method to simultaneously optimize multiple molecular properties while satisfying several drug-like constraints. CMOMO improves multiple properties of molecules with constraints based on dynamic cooperative optimization, which dynamically handles the constraints across various scenarios. Besides, CMOMO evaluates multiple properties within discrete chemical spaces cooperatively with the evolution of molecules within an implicit molecular space to guide the evolutionary search. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed CMOMO over five state-of-the-art molecular optimization methods on two benchmark tasks of simultaneously optimizing multiple non-biological activity properties while satisfying two structural constraints. Furthermore, the practical applicability of CMOMO is verified on two practical tasks, where it identified a collection of candidate ligands of $\beta$2-adrenoceptor GPCR and candidate inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3$\beta$ with high properties and under drug-like constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: The estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a pivotal role in intelligent manufacturing systems and Industry 4.0 technologies. While recent advancements have improved RUL prediction, many models still face interpretability and compelling uncertainty modeling challenges. This paper introduces a modified Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model for RUL interval prediction, tailored for the complexities of manufacturing process development. The modified GPR predicts confidence intervals by learning from historical data and addresses uncertainty modeling in a more structured way. The approach effectively captures intricate time-series patterns and dynamic behaviors inherent in modern manufacturing systems by coupling GPR with deep adaptive learning-enhanced AI process models. Moreover, the model evaluates feature significance to ensure more transparent decision-making, which is crucial for optimizing manufacturing processes. This comprehensive approach supports more accurate RUL predictions and provides transparent, interpretable insights into uncertainty, contributing to robust process development and management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqun Zhang, Mingjie Zhao, Hong Jia, Yiu-ming Cheung</p>
<p>Abstract: Categorical data composed of nominal valued attributes are ubiquitous in knowledge discovery and data mining tasks. Due to the lack of well-defined metric space, categorical data distributions are difficult to intuitively understand. Clustering is a popular technique suitable for data analysis. However, the success of clustering often relies on reasonable distance metrics, which happens to be what categorical data naturally lack. Therefore, the cluster analysis of categorical data is considered a critical but challenging problem. This paper introduces the new finding that the order relation among attribute values is the decisive factor in clustering accuracy, and is also the key to understanding the categorical data clusters. To automatically obtain the orders, we propose a new learning paradigm that allows joint learning of clusters and the orders. It turns out that clustering with order learning achieves superior clustering accuracy, and the learned orders provide intuition for understanding the cluster distribution of categorical data. Extensive experiments with statistical evidence and case studies have verified the effectiveness of the new ``order is all you need'' insight and the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan Hudson, Jurgen van den Hoogen, Martin Atzmueller</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art algorithms are reported to be almost perfect at distinguishing the vibrations arising from healthy and damaged machine bearings, according to benchmark datasets at least. However, what about their application to new data? In this paper, we are able to confirm that neural networks for bearing fault detection can be crippled by incorrect hyperparameterisation, and also that the correct hyperparameter settings can actually change when transitioning to new data. The paper weaves together multiple methods to explain the behaviour of the hyperparameters of a wide-kernel convolutional neural network and how to set them. Since guidance already exists for generic hyperparameters like minibatch size, we focus on how to set architecture-specific hyperparameters such as the width of the convolutional kernels, a topic which might otherwise be obscure. We reflect different data properties by fusing information from seven different benchmark datasets, and our results show that the kernel size in the first layer in particular is sensitive to changes in the data. Looking deeper, we use manipulated copies of one dataset in an attempt to spot why the kernel size sometimes needs to change. The relevance of sampling rate is studied by using different levels of resampling, and spectral content is studied by increasingly filtering out high frequencies. At the end of our paper we conclude by stating clear guidance on how to set the hyperparameters of our neural network architecture.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a Graph Neural Network-guided algorithm for solving word equations, based on the well-known Nielsen transformation for splitting equations. The algorithm iteratively rewrites the first terms of each side of an equation, giving rise to a tree-like search space. The choice of path at each split point of the tree significantly impacts solving time, motivating the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for efficient split decision-making. Split decisions are encoded as multi-classification tasks, and five graph representations of word equations are introduced to encode their structural information for GNNs. The algorithm is implemented as a solver named DragonLi. Experiments are conducted on artificial and real-world benchmarks. The algorithm performs particularly well on satisfiable problems. For single word \mbox{equations}, DragonLi can solve significantly more problems than well-established string solvers. For the conjunction of multiple word equations, DragonLi is competitive with state-of-the-art string solvers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Feature selection is important for high-dimensional data analysis and is non-trivial in unsupervised learning problems such as dimensionality reduction and clustering. The goal of unsupervised feature selection is finding a subset of features such that the data points from different clusters are well separated. This paper presents a novel method called K-means Derived Unsupervised Feature Selection (K-means UFS). Unlike most existing spectral analysis based unsupervised feature selection methods, we select features using the objective of K-means. We develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the NP-hard optimization problem of our K-means UFS model. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that our K-means UFS is more effective than the baselines in selecting features for clustering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucheng Xing, Xiaodong Liu, Xin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence, more and more attention has been put onto generative models, which represent the creativity, a very important aspect of intelligence. In recent years, diffusion models have been studied and proven to be more reasonable and effective than previous methods. However, common diffusion frameworks suffer from controllability problems. Although extra conditions have been considered by some work to guide the diffusion process for a specific target generation, it only controls the generation result but not its process. In this work, we propose a new adaptive framework, $\textit{Adaptively Controllable Diffusion (AC-Diff) Model}$, to automatically and fully control the generation process, including not only the type of generation result but also the length and parameters of the generation process. Both inputs and conditions will be first fed into a $\textit{Conditional Time-Step (CTS) Module}$ to determine the number of steps needed for a generation. Then according to the length of the process, the diffusion rate parameters will be estimated through our $\textit{Adaptive Hybrid Noise Schedule (AHNS) Module}$. We further train the network with the corresponding adaptive sampling mechanism to learn how to adjust itself according to the conditions for the overall performance improvement. To enable its practical applications, AC-Diff is expected to largely reduce the average number of generation steps and execution time while maintaining the same performance as done in the literature diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nandika Ramamurthy, Dr Daniel Lumsden, Dr Rachel Sparks</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperkinetic movement disorders (HMDs) in children, including dystonia (abnormal twisting) and chorea (irregular, random movements), pose significant diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical features. The prevalence of dystonia ranges from 2 to 50 per million, and chorea from 5 to 10 per 100,000. These conditions are often diagnosed with delays averaging 4.75 to 7.83 years. Traditional diagnostic methods depend on clinical history and expert physical examinations, but specialized tests are ineffective due to the complex pathophysiology of these disorders. This study develops a neural network model to differentiate between dystonia and chorea from video recordings of paediatric patients performing motor tasks. The model integrates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture spatial relationships and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to account for temporal dynamics. Attention mechanisms were incorporated to improve model interpretability. The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 50 videos (31 chorea-predominant, 19 dystonia-predominant) collected under regulatory approval from Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. The model achieved 85% accuracy, 81% sensitivity, and 88% specificity at 15 frames per second. Attention maps highlighted the model's ability to correctly identify involuntary movement patterns, with misclassifications often due to occluded body parts or subtle movement variations. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of HMD diagnosis and could contribute to more reliable, interpretable clinical tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Vision Language Models (VLMs) often fall short in thoroughly assessing model abilities to understand and process complex visual and textual content. They typically focus on simple tasks that do not require deep reasoning or the integration of multiple data modalities to solve an original problem. To address this gap, we introduce the PARROT-360V Benchmark, a novel and comprehensive benchmark featuring 2487 challenging visual puzzles designed to test VLMs on complex visual reasoning tasks. We evaluated leading models: GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, using PARROT-360V to assess their capabilities in combining visual clues with language skills to solve tasks in a manner akin to human problem-solving. Our findings reveal a notable performance gap: state-of-the-art models scored between 28 to 56 percentage on our benchmark, significantly lower than their performance on popular benchmarks. This underscores the limitations of current VLMs in handling complex, multi-step reasoning tasks and highlights the need for more robust evaluation frameworks to advance the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guofeng Yang, Yu Li, Yong He, Zhenjiang Zhou, Lingzhen Ye, Hui Fang, Yiqi Luo, Xuping Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: UAV remote sensing technology has become a key technology in crop breeding, which can achieve high-throughput and non-destructive collection of crop phenotyping data. However, the multidisciplinary nature of breeding has brought technical barriers and efficiency challenges to knowledge mining. Therefore, it is important to develop a smart breeding goal tool to mine cross-domain multimodal data. Based on different pre-trained open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g., Qwen-VL, InternVL, Deepseek-VL), this study used supervised fine-tuning (SFT), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) technologies to inject cross-domain knowledge into MLLMs, thereby constructing multiple multimodal large language models for wheat breeding (WBLMs). The above WBLMs were evaluated using the newly created evaluation benchmark in this study. The results showed that the WBLM constructed using SFT, RAG and RLHF technologies and InternVL2-8B has leading performance. Then, subsequent experiments were conducted using the WBLM. Ablation experiments indicated that the combination of SFT, RAG, and RLHF technologies can improve the overall generation performance, enhance the generated quality, balance the timeliness and adaptability of the generated answer, and reduce hallucinations and biases. The WBLM performed best in wheat yield prediction using cross-domain data (remote sensing, phenotyping, weather, germplasm) simultaneously, with R2 and RMSE of 0.821 and 489.254 kg/ha, respectively. Furthermore, the WBLM can generate professional decision support answers for phenotyping estimation, environmental stress assessment, target germplasm screening, cultivation technique recommendation, and seed price query tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minguk Jang, Hye Won Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) is an effective approach to mitigate performance degradation of trained models when encountering input distribution shifts at test time. However, existing TTA methods often suffer significant performance drops when facing additional class distribution shifts. We first analyze TTA methods under label distribution shifts and identify the presence of class-wise confusion patterns commonly observed across different covariate shifts. Based on this observation, we introduce label Distribution shift-Aware prediction Refinement for Test-time adaptation (DART), a novel TTA method that refines the predictions by focusing on class-wise confusion patterns. DART trains a prediction refinement module during an intermediate time by exposing it to several batches with diverse class distributions using the training dataset. This module is then used during test time to detect and correct class distribution shifts, significantly improving pseudo-label accuracy for test data. Our method exhibits 5-18% gains in accuracy under label distribution shifts on CIFAR-10C, without any performance degradation when there is no label distribution shift. Extensive experiments on CIFAR, PACS, OfficeHome, and ImageNet benchmarks demonstrate DART's ability to correct inaccurate predictions caused by test-time distribution shifts. This improvement leads to enhanced performance in existing TTA methods, making DART a valuable plug-in tool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Chen, Hua Mao, Yuanbiao Gou, Zhu Wang, Xi Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has shown promising performance in semisupervised graph classification. However, existing studies still encounter significant challenges in GCL. First, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while GCL aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism of GNNs and the contrastive learning of negative pairs via intraviews. Second, leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised conditional distribution learning (SSCDL) method designed to learn graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment effectively reduces the risk of disrupting intrinsic semantic information through graph-structured data augmentation. To avoid conflict between the message-passing mechanism and contrastive learning of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SSCDL method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language pre-training via contrastive learning have significantly improved performance across computer vision tasks. However, in the medical domain, obtaining multimodal data is often costly and challenging due to privacy, sensitivity, and annotation complexity. To mitigate data scarcity while boosting model performance, we introduce \textbf{Uni-Mlip}, a unified self-supervision framework specifically designed to enhance medical vision-language pre-training. Uni-Mlip seamlessly integrates cross-modality, uni-modality, and fused-modality self-supervision techniques at the data-level and the feature-level. Additionally, Uni-Mlip tailors uni-modal image self-supervision to accommodate the unique characteristics of medical images. Our experiments across datasets of varying scales demonstrate that Uni-Mlip significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in three key downstream tasks: image-text retrieval, image classification, and visual question answering (VQA).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengzhu Guo, Zhiqi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Peptides are biomolecules comprised of amino acids that play an important role in our body. In recent years, peptides have received extensive attention in drug design and synthesis, and peptide prediction tasks help us better search for functional peptides. Typically, we use the primary sequence and structural information of peptides for model encoding. However, recent studies have focused more on single-modal information (structure or sequence) for prediction without multi-modal approaches. We found that single-modal models are not good at handling datasets with less information in that particular modality. Therefore, this paper proposes the M2oE multi-modal collaborative expert peptide model. Based on previous work, by integrating sequence and spatial structural information, employing expert model and Cross-Attention Mechanism, the model's capabilities are balanced and improved. Experimental results indicate that the M2oE model performs excellently in complex task predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Xie, Weijie Zheng, Hanxun Huang, Guangnan Ye, Xingjun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, evaluating their vulnerabilities to adversarial perturbations is essential for ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness. Over the past decade, a large number of white-box adversarial robustness evaluation methods (i.e., attacks) have been proposed, ranging from single-step to multi-step methods and from individual to ensemble methods. Despite these advances, challenges remain in conducting meaningful and comprehensive robustness evaluations, particularly when it comes to large-scale testing and ensuring evaluations reflect real-world adversarial risks. In this work, we focus on image classification models and propose a novel individual attack method, Probability Margin Attack (PMA), which defines the adversarial margin in the probability space rather than the logits space. We analyze the relationship between PMA and existing cross-entropy or logits-margin-based attacks, and show that PMA can outperform the current state-of-the-art individual methods. Building on PMA, we propose two types of ensemble attacks that balance effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we create a million-scale dataset, CC1M, derived from the existing CC3M dataset, and use it to conduct the first million-scale white-box adversarial robustness evaluation of adversarially-trained ImageNet models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the robustness gaps between individual versus ensemble attacks and small-scale versus million-scale evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Hu, Hong Jia, Mahbub Hassan, Lina Yao, Brano Kusy, Wen Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose LightLLM, a model that fine tunes pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for light-based sensing tasks. It integrates a sensor data encoder to extract key features, a contextual prompt to provide environmental information, and a fusion layer to combine these inputs into a unified representation. This combined input is then processed by the pre-trained LLM, which remains frozen while being fine-tuned through the addition of lightweight, trainable components, allowing the model to adapt to new tasks without altering its original parameters. This approach enables flexible adaptation of LLM to specialized light sensing tasks with minimal computational overhead and retraining effort. We have implemented LightLLM for three light sensing tasks: light-based localization, outdoor solar forecasting, and indoor solar estimation. Using real-world experimental datasets, we demonstrate that LightLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 4.4x improvement in localization accuracy and 3.4x improvement in indoor solar estimation when tested in previously unseen environments. We further demonstrate that LightLLM outperforms ChatGPT-4 with direct prompting, highlighting the advantages of LightLLM's specialized architecture for sensor data fusion with textual prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Basso, Luca Bortolussi, Mirjana Videnovic-Misic, Husni Habal</p>
<p>Abstract: Analog integrated circuit (IC) floorplanning is typically a manual process with the placement of components (devices and modules) planned by a layout engineer. This process is further complicated by the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps, numerous electric and layout-dependent constraints, as well as the high level of customization expected in analog design. This paper presents a novel automatic floorplanning algorithm based on reinforcement learning. It is augmented by a relational graph convolutional neural network model for encoding circuit features and positional constraints. The combination of these two machine learning methods enables knowledge transfer across different circuit designs with distinct topologies and constraints, increasing the \emph{generalization ability} of the solution. Applied to $6$ industrial circuits, our approach surpassed established floorplanning techniques in terms of speed, area and half-perimeter wire length. When integrated into a \emph{procedural generator} for layout completion, overall layout time was reduced by $67.3\%$ with a $8.3\%$ mean area reduction compared to manual layout.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advent of advanced 4G/5G mobile networks, mobile phone data collected by operators now includes detailed, service-specific traffic information with high spatio-temporal resolution. In this paper, we leverage this type of data to explore its potential for generating high-quality representations of urban regions. To achieve this, we present a methodology for creating urban region embeddings from service-specific mobile traffic data, employing a temporal convolutional network-based autoencoder, transformers, and learnable weighted sum models to capture key urban features. In the extensive experimental evaluation conducted using a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that the embeddings generated by our methodology effectively capture urban characteristics. Specifically, our embeddings are compared against those of a state-of-the-art competitor across two downstream tasks. Additionally, through clustering techniques, we investigate how well the embeddings produced by our methodology capture the temporal dynamics and characteristics of the underlying urban regions. Overall, this work highlights the potential of service-specific mobile traffic data for urban research and emphasizes the importance of making such data accessible to support public innovation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Antibodies safeguard our health through their precise and potent binding to specific antigens, demonstrating promising therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of numerous diseases, including COVID-19. Recent advancements in biomedical language models have shown the great potential to interpret complex biological structures and functions. However, existing antibody specific models have a notable limitation that they lack explicit consideration for antibody structural information, despite the fact that both 1D sequence and 3D structure carry unique and complementary insights into antibody behavior and functionality. This paper proposes Sequence-Structure multi-level pre-trained Antibody Language Model (S$^2$ALM), combining holistic sequential and structural information in one unified, generic antibody foundation model. We construct a hierarchical pre-training paradigm incorporated with two customized multi-level training objectives to facilitate the modeling of comprehensive antibody representations. S$^2$ALM's representation space uncovers inherent functional binding mechanisms, biological evolution properties and structural interaction patterns. Pre-trained over 75 million sequences and 11.7 million structures, S$^2$ALM can be adopted for diverse downstream tasks: accurately predicting antigen-antibody binding affinities, precisely distinguishing B cell maturation stages, identifying antibody crucial binding positions, and specifically designing novel coronavirus-binding antibodies. Remarkably, S$^2$ALM outperforms well-established and renowned baselines and sets new state-of-the-art performance across extensive antibody specific understanding and generation tasks. S$^2$ALM's ability to model comprehensive and generalized representations further positions its potential to advance real-world therapeutic antibody development, potentially addressing unmet academic, industrial, and clinical needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangkun Nie, Gongzheng Tang, Shenda Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Imbalanced data distributions are prevalent in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in both imbalanced classification and imbalanced regression tasks. They often cause deep learning models to overfit in areas of high sample density (many-shot regions) while underperforming in areas of low sample density (few-shot regions). This characteristic restricts the utility of deep learning models in various sectors, notably healthcare, where areas with few-shot data hold greater clinical relevance. While recent studies have shown the benefits of incorporating distribution information in imbalanced classification tasks, such strategies are rarely explored in imbalanced regression. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a novel loss function, termed Dist Loss, designed to minimize the distribution distance between the model's predictions and the target labels in a differentiable manner, effectively integrating distribution information into model training. Dist Loss enables deep learning models to regularize their output distribution during training, effectively enhancing their focus on few-shot regions. We have conducted extensive experiments across three datasets spanning computer vision and healthcare: IMDB-WIKI-DIR, AgeDB-DIR, and ECG-Ka-DIR. The results demonstrate that Dist Loss effectively mitigates the negative impact of imbalanced data distribution on model performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in sparse data regions. Furthermore, Dist Loss is easy to integrate, complementing existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreen Gul, Mohamed Elmahallawy, Sanjay Madria, Ardhendu Tripathy</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly being utilized across various fields and tasks due to their outstanding performance and strong generalization capabilities. Nonetheless, their success hinges on the availability of large volumes of annotated data, the creation of which is often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Many active learning (AL) approaches have been proposed to address these challenges, but they often fail to fully leverage the information from the core phases of AL, such as training on the labeled set and querying new unlabeled samples. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AL approach, Loss Prediction Loss with Gradient Norm (LPLgrad), designed to quantify model uncertainty effectively and improve the accuracy of image classification tasks. LPLgrad operates in two distinct phases: (i) {\em Training Phase} aims to predict the loss for input features by jointly training a main model and an auxiliary model. Both models are trained on the labeled data to maximize the efficiency of the learning process, an aspect often overlooked in previous AL methods. This dual-model approach enhances the ability to extract complex input features and learn intrinsic patterns from the data effectively; (ii) {\em Querying Phase} that quantifies the uncertainty of the main model to guide sample selection. This is achieved by calculating the gradient norm of the entropy values for samples in the unlabeled dataset. Samples with the highest gradient norms are prioritized for labeling and subsequently added to the labeled set, improving the model's performance with minimal labeling effort. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that the LPLgrad approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by order of magnitude in terms of accuracy on a small number of labeled images, yet achieving comparable training and querying times in multiple image classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Since generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT became widely available, researchers have used them in the writing process. The consensus of the academic publishing community is that such usage must be declared in the published article. Academ-AI documents examples of suspected undeclared AI usage in the academic literature, discernible primarily due to the appearance in research papers of idiosyncratic verbiage characteristic of large language model (LLM)-based chatbots. This analysis of the first 500 examples collected reveals that the problem is widespread, penetrating the journals and conference proceedings of highly respected publishers. Undeclared AI seems to appear in journals with higher citation metrics and higher article processing charges (APCs), precisely those outlets that should theoretically have the resources and expertise to avoid such oversights. An extremely small minority of cases are corrected post publication, and the corrections are often insufficient to rectify the problem. The 500 examples analyzed here likely represent a small fraction of the undeclared AI present in the academic literature, much of which may be undetectable. Publishers must enforce their policies against undeclared AI usage in cases that are detectable; this is the best defense currently available to the academic publishing community against the proliferation of undisclosed AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language-conditioned robotic learning has significantly enhanced robot adaptability by enabling a single model to execute diverse tasks in response to verbal commands. Despite these advancements, security vulnerabilities within this domain remain largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel adversarial prompt attack tailored to language-conditioned robotic models. Our approach involves crafting a universal adversarial prefix that induces the model to perform unintended actions when added to any original prompt. We demonstrate that existing adversarial techniques exhibit limited effectiveness when directly transferred to the robotic domain due to the inherent robustness of discretized robotic action spaces. To overcome this challenge, we propose to optimize adversarial prefixes based on continuous action representations, circumventing the discretization process. Additionally, we identify the beneficial impact of intermediate features on adversarial attacks and leverage the negative gradient of intermediate self-attention features to further enhance attack efficacy. Extensive experiments on VIMA models across 13 robot manipulation tasks validate the superiority of our method over existing approaches and demonstrate its transferability across different model variants.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the growing interest in Mamba architecture as a potential replacement for Transformer architecture, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches for Mamba remain largely unexplored. In our study, we introduce two key insights-driven strategies for PEFT in Mamba architecture: (1) While state-space models (SSMs) have been regarded as the cornerstone of Mamba architecture, then expected to play a primary role in transfer learning, our findings reveal that Projectors -- not SSMs -- are the predominant contributors to transfer learning, and (2) Based on our observation that adapting pretrained Projectors to new tasks can be effectively approximated through a near-diagonal linear transformation, we propose a novel PEFT method specialized to Mamba architecture: Projector-targeted Diagonal-centric Linear Transformation (ProDiaL). ProDiaL focuses on optimizing only diagonal-centric linear transformation matrices, without directly fine-tuning the pretrained Projector weights. This targeted approach allows efficient task adaptation, utilizing less than 1% of the total parameters, and exhibits strong performance across both vision and language Mamba models, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxu Chen, Runshi Li, Bowei Zhu, Zhen Wang, Long Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are widely used to fine-tune large models across various domains for specific downstream tasks. While task-specific LoRAs are often available, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property can restrict access to training data, limiting the acquisition of a multi-task model through gradient-based training. In response, LoRA merging presents an effective solution by combining multiple LoRAs into a unified adapter while maintaining data privacy. Prior works on LoRA merging primarily frame it as an optimization problem, yet these approaches face several limitations, including the rough assumption about input features utilized in optimization, massive sample requirements, and the unbalanced optimization objective. These limitations can significantly degrade performance. To address these, we propose a novel optimization-based method, named IterIS: 1) We formulate LoRA merging as an advanced optimization problem to mitigate the rough assumption. Additionally, we employ an iterative inference-solving framework in our algorithm. It can progressively refine the optimization objective for improved performance. 2) We introduce an efficient regularization term to reduce the need for massive sample requirements (requiring only 1-5% of the unlabeled samples compared to prior methods). 3) We utilize adaptive weights in the optimization objective to mitigate potential unbalances in LoRA merging process. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over multiple baselines and state-of-the-art methods in composing tasks for text-to-image diffusion, vision-language models, and large language models. Furthermore, our layer-wise algorithm can achieve convergence with minimal steps, ensuring efficiency in both memory and computation.</p>

The next frontier is to go beyond traditional AI to develop "adaptive intelligence," defined here as harnessing insights from biological intelligence to build agents that can learn online, generalize, and rapidly adapt to changes in their environment. Recent advances in neuroscience offer inspiration through studies that increasingly focus on how animals naturally learn and adapt their world models. In this Perspective, I will review the behavioral and neural foundations of adaptive biological intelligence, the parallel progress in AI, and explore brain-inspired approaches for building more adaptive algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Paul E. Apolinario, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning, or the ability to progressively integrate new concepts, is fundamental to intelligent beings, enabling adaptability in dynamic environments. In contrast, artificial deep neural networks face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks sequentially. To alleviate the problem of forgetting, recent approaches aim to preserve essential weight subspaces for previous tasks by limiting updates to orthogonal subspaces via gradient projection. While effective, this approach can lead to suboptimal performance, particularly when tasks are highly correlated. In this work, we introduce COnceptor-based gradient projection for DEep Continual Learning (CODE-CL), a novel method that leverages conceptor matrix representations, a computational model inspired by neuroscience, to more flexibly handle highly correlated tasks. CODE-CL encodes directional importance within the input space of past tasks, allowing new knowledge integration in directions modulated by $1-S$, where $S$ represents the direction's relevance for prior tasks. Additionally, we analyze task overlap using conceptor-based representations to identify highly correlated tasks, facilitating efficient forward knowledge transfer through scaled projection within their intersecting subspace. This strategy enhances flexibility, allowing learning in correlated tasks without significantly disrupting previous knowledge. Extensive experiments on continual learning image classification benchmarks validate CODE-CL's efficacy, showcasing superior performance with minimal forgetting, outperforming most state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The process of digitising histology slides involves multiple factors that can affect a whole slide image's (WSI) final appearance, including the staining protocol, scanner, and tissue type. This variability constitutes a domain shift and results in significant problems when training and testing deep learning (DL) algorithms in multi-cohort settings. As such, developing robust and generalisable DL models in computational pathology (CPath) remains an open challenge. In this regard, we propose a framework that generates stain-augmented versions of the training images using stain matrix perturbation. Thereafter, we employed a stain regularisation loss to enforce consistency between the feature representations of the source and augmented images. Doing so encourages the model to learn stain-invariant and, consequently, domain-invariant feature representations. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on cross-domain multi-class tissue type classification of colorectal cancer images and have achieved improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

To address this, we developed the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT)--the first pretrained and fully attention-based model designed specifically to handle actigraphy. PAT was pretrained on actigraphy from 29,307 participants in NHANES, enabling it to deliver state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuned across various actigraphy prediction tasks in the mental health domain, even in data-limited scenarios. For example, when trained to predict benzodiazepine usage using actigraphy from only 500 labeled participants, PAT achieved an 8.8 percentage-point AUC improvement over the best baseline. With fewer than 2 million parameters and built-in model explainability, PAT is robust yet easy to deploy in health research settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nima Dehghani, Michael Levin</p>
<p>Abstract: The pursuit of creating artificial intelligence (AI) mirrors our longstanding fascination with understanding our own intelligence. From the myths of Talos to Aristotelian logic and Heron's inventions, we have sought to replicate the marvels of the mind. While recent advances in AI hold promise, singular approaches often fall short in capturing the essence of intelligence. This paper explores how fundamental principles from biological computation--particularly context-dependent, hierarchical information processing, trial-and-error heuristics, and multi-scale organization--can guide the design of truly intelligent systems. By examining the nuanced mechanisms of biological intelligence, such as top-down causality and adaptive interaction with the environment, we aim to illuminate potential limitations in artificial constructs. Our goal is to provide a framework inspired by biological systems for designing more adaptable and robust artificial intelligent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Luo, Xin Wang, Bojia Zi, Shihao Zhao, Xingjun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their deployment in safety-critical scenarios like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. One promising approach for improving the robustness of pre-trained VLMs is Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), which combines adversarial training with prompt tuning. However, existing APT methods are mostly single-modal methods that design prompt(s) for only the visual or textual modality, limiting their effectiveness in either robustness or clean accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel method called Adversarial Prompt Distillation (APD) that combines APT with knowledge distillation to boost the adversarial robustness of CLIP. Specifically, APD is a bimodal method that adds prompts for both the visual and textual modalities while leveraging a cleanly pre-trained teacher CLIP model to distill and boost the performance of the student CLIP model on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our APD over the current state-of-the-art APT methods in terms of both natural and adversarial performances. The effectiveness of our APD method validates the possibility of using a non-robust teacher to improve the generalization and robustness of VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Lu, Chengrong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Log-system is an important mechanism for recording the runtime status and events of Web service systems, and anomaly detection in logs is an effective method of detecting problems. However, manual anomaly detection in logs is inefficient, error-prone, and unrealistic. Existing log anomaly detection methods either use the indexes of event templates, or form vectors by embedding the fixed string part of the template as a sentence, or use time parameters for sequence analysis. However, log entries often contain features and semantic information that cannot be fully represented by these methods, resulting in missed and false alarms. In this paper, we propose TPLogAD, a universal unsupervised method for analyzing unstructured logs, which performs anomaly detection based on event templates and key parameters. The itemplate2vec and para2vec included in TPLogAD are two efficient and easy-to-implement semantic representation methods for logs, detecting anomalies in event templates and parameters respectively, which has not been achieved in previous work. Additionally, TPLogAD can avoid the interference of log diversity and dynamics on anomaly detection. Our experiments on four public log datasets show that TPLogAD outperforms existing log anomaly detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongning Song, Weijian Huang, Jiarun Liu, Md Jahidul Islam, Hao Yang, Shanshan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels is essential for various clinical assessments and postoperative analyses. However, the inherent challenges of vascular imaging, such as sparsity, fine granularity, low contrast, data distribution variability, and the critical need for preserving topological structure, making generalized vessel segmentation particularly complex. While specialized segmentation methods have been developed for specific anatomical regions, their over-reliance on tailored models hinders broader applicability and generalization. General-purpose segmentation models introduced in medical imaging often fail to address critical vascular characteristics, including the connectivity of segmentation results. To overcome these limitations, we propose an optimized vessel segmentation framework: a structure-agnostic approach incorporating small vessel enhancement and morphological correction for multi-modality vessel segmentation. To train and validate this framework, we compiled a comprehensive multi-modality dataset spanning 17 datasets and benchmarked our model against six SAM-based methods and 17 expert models. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy, generalization, and a 34.6% improvement in connectivity, underscoring its clinical potential. An ablation study further validates the effectiveness of the proposed improvements. We will release the code and dataset at github following the publication of this work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, text-to-image models based on diffusion have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images. However, the challenge of personalized, controllable generation of instances within these images remains an area in need of further development. In this paper, we present LocRef-Diffusion, a novel, tuning-free model capable of personalized customization of multiple instances' appearance and position within an image. To enhance the precision of instance placement, we introduce a Layout-net, which controls instance generation locations by leveraging both explicit instance layout information and an instance region cross-attention module. To improve the appearance fidelity to reference images, we employ an appearance-net that extracts instance appearance features and integrates them into the diffusion model through cross-attention mechanisms. We conducted extensive experiments on the COCO and OpenImages datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout and appearance guided generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dafang Zhao, Xihao Piao, Zheng Chen, Zhengmao Li, Ittetsu Taniguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate forecasting of the electrical load, such as the magnitude and the timing of peak power, is crucial to successful power system management and implementation of smart grid strategies like demand response and peak shaving. In multi-time-scale optimization scheduling, rolling optimization is a common solution. However, rolling optimization needs to consider the coupling of different optimization objectives across time scales. It is challenging to accurately capture the mid- and long-term dependencies in time series data. This paper proposes Multi-pofo, a multi-scale power load forecasting framework, that captures such dependency via a novel architecture equipped with a temporal positional encoding layer. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct experiments on real-world electricity load data. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms compared to several strong baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the Explabox: an open-source toolkit for transparent and responsible machine learning (ML) model development and usage. Explabox aids in achieving explainable, fair and robust models by employing a four-step strategy: explore, examine, explain and expose. These steps offer model-agnostic analyses that transform complex 'ingestibles' (models and data) into interpretable 'digestibles'. The toolkit encompasses digestibles for descriptive statistics, performance metrics, model behavior explanations (local and global), and robustness, security, and fairness assessments. Implemented in Python, Explabox supports multiple interaction modes and builds on open-source packages. It empowers model developers and testers to operationalize explainability, fairness, auditability, and security. The initial release focuses on text data and models, with plans for expansion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Hu, Tianxiong Zhong, Xuebo Wang, Boyuan Jiang, Xingye Tian, Fei Yang, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based image editing models have made remarkable progress in recent years. However, achieving high-quality video editing remains a significant challenge. One major hurdle is the absence of open-source, large-scale video editing datasets based on real-world data, as constructing such datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Moreover, video data requires a significantly larger number of tokens for representation, which substantially increases the training costs for video editing models. Lastly, current video editing models offer limited interactivity, often making it difficult for users to express their editing requirements effectively in a single attempt. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a dataset VIVID-10M and a baseline model VIVID. VIVID-10M is the first large-scale hybrid image-video local editing dataset aimed at reducing data construction and model training costs, which comprises 9.7M samples that encompass a wide range of video editing tasks. VIVID is a Versatile and Interactive VIdeo local eDiting model trained on VIVID-10M, which supports entity addition, modification, and deletion. At its core, a keyframe-guided interactive video editing mechanism is proposed, enabling users to iteratively edit keyframes and propagate it to other frames, thereby reducing latency in achieving desired outcomes. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video local editing, surpassing baseline methods in both automated metrics and user studies. The VIVID-10M dataset and the VIVID editing model will be available at \url{https://inkosizhong.github.io/VIVID/}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carl Chalmers, Paul Fergus, Serge Wich, Steven N Longmore, Naomi Davies Walsh, Lee Oliver, James Warrington, Julieanne Quinlan, Katie Appleby</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective monitoring of wildlife is critical for assessing biodiversity and ecosystem health, as declines in key species often signal significant environmental changes. Birds, particularly ground-nesting species, serve as important ecological indicators due to their sensitivity to environmental pressures. Camera traps have become indispensable tools for monitoring nesting bird populations, enabling data collection across diverse habitats. However, the manual processing and analysis of such data are resource-intensive, often delaying the delivery of actionable conservation insights. This study presents an AI-driven approach for real-time species detection, focusing on the curlew (Numenius arquata), a ground-nesting bird experiencing significant population declines. A custom-trained YOLOv10 model was developed to detect and classify curlews and their chicks using 3/4G-enabled cameras linked to the Conservation AI platform. The system processes camera trap data in real-time, significantly enhancing monitoring efficiency. Across 11 nesting sites in Wales, the model achieved high performance, with a sensitivity of 90.56%, specificity of 100%, and F1-score of 95.05% for curlew detections, and a sensitivity of 92.35%, specificity of 100%, and F1-score of 96.03% for curlew chick detections. These results demonstrate the capability of AI-driven monitoring systems to deliver accurate, timely data for biodiversity assessments, facilitating early conservation interventions and advancing the use of technology in ecological research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linrui Gong, Jiuming Liu, Junyi Ma, Lihao Liu, Yaonan Wang, Hesheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown the great potential in the point cloud registration (PCR) task, especially for enhancing the robustness to challenging cases. However, existing diffusion-based PCR methods primarily focus on instance-level scenarios and struggle with outdoor LiDAR points, where the sparsity, irregularity, and huge point scale inherent in LiDAR points pose challenges to establishing dense global point-to-point correspondences. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named EADReg for efficient and robust registration of LiDAR point clouds based on autoregressive diffusion models. EADReg follows a coarse-to-fine registration paradigm. In the coarse stage, we employ a Bi-directional Gaussian Mixture Model (BGMM) to reject outlier points and obtain purified point cloud pairs. BGMM establishes correspondences between the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) from the source and target frames, enabling reliable coarse registration based on filtered features and geometric information. In the fine stage, we treat diffusion-based PCR as an autoregressive process to generate robust point correspondences, which are then iteratively refined on upper layers. Despite common criticisms of diffusion-based methods regarding inference speed, EADReg achieves runtime comparable to convolutional-based methods. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and NuScenes benchmark datasets highlight the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method. Codes will be released upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Barbalau</p>
<p>Abstract: In subpopulation shift scenarios, a Curriculum Learning (CL) approach would only serve to imprint the model weights, early on, with the easily learnable spurious correlations featured. To the best of our knowledge, none of the current state-of-the-art subpopulation shift approaches employ any kind of curriculum. To overcome this, we design a CL approach aimed at initializing the model weights in an unbiased vantage point in the hypothesis space which sabotages easy convergence towards biased hypotheses during the final optimization based on the entirety of the available data. We hereby propose a Curriculum-enhanced Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (CeGDRO) approach, which prioritizes the hardest bias-confirming samples and the easiest bias-conflicting samples, leveraging GroupDRO to balance the initial discrepancy in terms of difficulty. We benchmark our proposed method against the most popular subpopulation shift datasets, showing an increase over the state-of-the-art results across all scenarios, up to 6.2% on Waterbirds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) is a distinct invasion pattern in lung cancer, crucial for prognosis assessment and guiding surgical decisions. Histopathology is the gold standard for STAS detection, yet traditional methods are subjective, time-consuming, and prone to misdiagnosis, limiting large-scale applications. We present VERN, an image analysis model utilizing a feature-interactive Siamese graph encoder to predict STAS from lung cancer histopathological images. VERN captures spatial topological features with feature sharing and skip connections to enhance model training. Using 1,546 histopathology slides, we built a large single-cohort STAS lung cancer dataset. VERN achieved an AUC of 0.9215 in internal validation and AUCs of 0.8275 and 0.8829 in frozen and paraffin-embedded test sections, respectively, demonstrating clinical-grade performance. Validated on a single-cohort and three external datasets, VERN showed robust predictive performance and generalizability, providing an open platform (http://plr.20210706.xyz:5000/) to enhance STAS diagnosis efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Event cameras, as an emerging imaging technology, offer distinct advantages over traditional RGB cameras, including reduced energy consumption and higher frame rates. However, the limited quantity of available event data presents a significant challenge, hindering their broader development. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a tailored U-shaped State Space Model Knowledge Transfer (USKT) framework for Event-to-RGB knowledge transfer. This framework generates inputs compatible with RGB frames, enabling event data to effectively reuse pre-trained RGB models and achieve competitive performance with minimal parameter tuning. Within the USKT architecture, we also propose a bidirectional reverse state space model. Unlike conventional bidirectional scanning mechanisms, the proposed Bidirectional Reverse State Space Model (BiR-SSM) leverages a shared weight strategy, which facilitates efficient modeling while conserving computational resources. In terms of effectiveness, integrating USKT with ResNet50 as the backbone improves model performance by 0.95%, 3.57%, and 2.9% on DVS128 Gesture, N-Caltech101, and CIFAR-10-DVS datasets, respectively, underscoring USKT's adaptability and effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhang Liu, Tingkai Liu, Yueyuan Sui, Stephen Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce ElastiFormer, a post-training technique that adapts pretrained Transformer models into an elastic counterpart with variable inference time compute. ElastiFormer introduces small routing modules (as low as .00006% additional trainable parameters) to dynamically selects subsets of network parameters and input tokens to be processed by each layer of the pretrained network in an inputdependent manner. The routing modules are trained using self-distillation losses to minimize the differences between the output of the pretrained-model and their elastic counterparts. As ElastiFormer makes no assumption regarding the modality of the pretrained Transformer model, it can be readily applied to all modalities covering causal language modeling, image modeling as well as visual-language modeling tasks. We show that 20% to 50% compute saving could be achieved for different components of the transformer layer, which could be further reduced by adding very low rank LoRA weights (rank 1) trained via the same distillation objective. Finally, by comparing routing trained on different subsets of ImageNet, we show that ElastiFormer is robust against the training domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyao Li, Shang-Ling Hsu, Cyrus Shahabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding human mobility behavior is crucial for numerous applications, including crowd management, location-based recommendations, and the estimation of pandemic spread. Machine learning models can predict the Points of Interest (POIs) that individuals are likely to visit in the future by analyzing their historical visit patterns. Previous studies address this problem by learning a POI classifier, where each class corresponds to a POI. However, this limits their applicability to predict a new POI that was not in the training data, such as the opening of new restaurants. To address this challenge, we propose a model designed to predict a new POI outside the training data as long as its context is aligned with the user's interests. Unlike existing approaches that directly predict specific POIs, our model first forecasts the semantic context of potential future POIs, then combines this with a proximity-based prior probability distribution to determine the exact POI. Experimental results on real-world visit data demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline methods that do not account for semantic contexts, achieving a 17% improvement in accuracy. Notably, as new POIs are introduced over time, our model remains robust, exhibiting a lower decline rate in prediction accuracy compared to existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their tendency to exhibit sycophantic behavior - excessively agreeing with or flattering users - poses significant risks to their reliability and ethical deployment. This paper provides a technical survey of sycophancy in LLMs, analyzing its causes, impacts, and potential mitigation strategies. We review recent work on measuring and quantifying sycophantic tendencies, examine the relationship between sycophancy and other challenges like hallucination and bias, and evaluate promising techniques for reducing sycophancy while maintaining model performance. Key approaches explored include improved training data, novel fine-tuning methods, post-deployment control mechanisms, and decoding strategies. We also discuss the broader implications of sycophancy for AI alignment and propose directions for future research. Our analysis suggests that mitigating sycophancy is crucial for developing more robust, reliable, and ethically-aligned language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederik Eaton</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we describe an efficient method for providing a regression model with a sense of curiosity about its data. In the field of machine learning, our framework for representing curiosity is called Active Learning, which means automatically choosing data points for which to query labels in the semisupervised setting. The methods we propose are based on computing a "regularity tangent" vector that can be calculated (with only a constant slow-down) together with the model's parameter vector during training. We then take the inner product of this tangent vector with the gradient vector of the model's loss at a given data point to obtain a measure of the influence of that point on the complexity of the model. There is only a single regularity tangent vector, of the same dimension as the parameter vector. Thus, in the proposed technique, once training is complete, evaluating our "curiosity" about a potential query data point can be done as quickly as calculating the model's loss gradient at that point. The new vector only doubles the amount of storage required by the model. We show that the quantity computed by our technique is an example of an "influence function", and that it measures the expected squared change in model complexity incurred by up-weighting a given data point. We propose a number of ways for using this quantity to choose new training data for a model in the framework of active learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: As a prominent direction of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have garnered increased attention from both industry and academia. Building upon pre-trained LLMs, this family of models further develops multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities that are impressive, such as writing code given a flow chart or creating stories based on an image. In the development process, evaluation is critical since it provides intuitive feedback and guidance on improving models. Distinct from the traditional train-eval-test paradigm that only favors a single task like image classification, the versatility of MLLMs has spurred the rise of various new benchmarks and evaluation methods. In this paper, we aim to present a comprehensive survey of MLLM evaluation, discussing four key aspects: 1) the summarised benchmarks types divided by the evaluation capabilities, including foundation capabilities, model self-analysis, and extented applications; 2) the typical process of benchmark counstruction, consisting of data collection, annotation, and precautions; 3) the systematic evaluation manner composed of judge, metric, and toolkit; 4) the outlook for the next benchmark. This work aims to offer researchers an easy grasp of how to effectively evaluate MLLMs according to different needs and to inspire better evaluation methods, thereby driving the progress of MLLM research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerald Friedland, Xin Huang, Yueying Cui, Vishaal Kapoor, Ashish Khetan, Sanjiv Das</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose PPLqa, an easy to compute, language independent, information-theoretic metric to measure the quality of responses of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) in an unsupervised way, without requiring ground truth annotations or human supervision. The method and metric enables users to rank generative language models for quality of responses, so as to make a selection of the best model for a given task. Our single metric assesses LLMs with an approach that subsumes, but is not explicitly based on, coherence and fluency (quality of writing) and relevance and consistency (appropriateness of response) to the query. PPLqa performs as well as other related metrics, and works better with long-form Q\&A. Thus, PPLqa enables bypassing the lengthy annotation process required for ground truth evaluations, and it also correlates well with human and LLM rankings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdeljalil Zoubir, Badr Missaoui</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper tackles the pressing challenge of mutagenicity prediction by introducing three ground-breaking approaches. First, it showcases the superior performance of 2D scattering coefficients extracted from molecular images, compared to traditional molecular descriptors. Second, it presents a hybrid approach that combines geometric graph scattering (GGS), Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), and machine learning models, achieving strong results in mutagenicity prediction. Third, it introduces a novel graph neural network architecture, MOLG3-SAGE, which integrates GGS node features into a fully connected graph structure, delivering outstanding predictive accuracy. Experimental results on the ZINC dataset demonstrate significant improvements, emphasizing the effectiveness of blending 2D and geometric scattering techniques with graph neural networks. This study illustrates the potential of GNNs and GGS for mutagenicity prediction, with broad implications for drug discovery and chemical safety assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Ren, Guile Wu, Runhao Li, Zheyuan Yang, Yibo Liu, Xingxin Chen, Tongtong Cao, Bingbing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban scene reconstruction is crucial for real-world autonomous driving simulators. Although existing methods have achieved photorealistic reconstruction, they mostly focus on pinhole cameras and neglect fisheye cameras. In fact, how to effectively simulate fisheye cameras in driving scene remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose UniGaussian, a novel approach that learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation from multiple camera models for urban scene reconstruction in autonomous driving. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that distorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to fisheye camera models. This addresses the compatibility issue of 3D Gaussian splatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion caused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering while ensuring differentiability. Second, built on the differentiable rendering method, we design a new framework that learns a unified Gaussian representation from multiple camera models. By applying affine transformations to adapt different camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision from different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation with input data from multiple sources and achieves holistic driving scene understanding. As a result, our approach models multiple sensors (pinhole and fisheye cameras) and modalities (depth, semantic, normal and LiDAR point clouds). Our experiments show that our method achieves superior rendering quality and fast rendering speed for driving scene simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moses Charikar, Chirag Pabbaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent work of Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] provides a concrete model for language generation in the limit: given a sequence of examples from an unknown target language, the goal is to generate new examples from the target language such that no incorrect examples are generated beyond some point. In sharp contrast to strong negative results for the closely related problem of language identification, they establish positive results for language generation in the limit for all countable collections of languages. Follow-up work by Raman and Tewari [RT24] studies bounds on the number of distinct inputs required by an algorithm before correct language generation is achieved -- namely, whether this is a constant for all languages in the collection (uniform generation) or a language-dependent constant (non-uniform generation).
  We show that every countable language collection has a generator which has the stronger property of non-uniform generation in the limit. However, while the generation algorithm of [KM24] can be implemented using membership queries, we show that any algorithm cannot non-uniformly generate even for collections of just two languages, using only membership queries.
  We also formalize the tension between validity and breadth in the generation algorithm of [KM24] by introducing a definition of exhaustive generation, and show a strong negative result for exhaustive generation. Our result shows that a tradeoff between validity and breadth is inherent for generation in the limit. Finally, inspired by algorithms that can choose to obtain feedback, we consider a model of uniform generation with feedback, completely characterizing language collections for which such uniform generation with feedback is possible in terms of a complexity measure of the collection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumil Datta, Shih-Chieh Dai, Leo Yu, Guanhong Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have shown exceptional potential in generating high-quality images. However, recent studies highlight concerns over the use of unauthorized data in training these models, which may lead to intellectual property infringement or privacy violations. A promising approach to mitigate these issues is to apply a watermark to images and subsequently check if generative models reproduce similar watermark features. In this paper, we examine the robustness of various watermark-based protection methods applied to text-to-image models. We observe that common image transformations are ineffective at removing the watermark effect. Therefore, we propose \tech{}, that leverages the diffusion process to conduct controlled image generation on the protected input, preserving the high-level features of the input while ignoring the low-level details utilized by watermarks. A small number of generated images are then used to fine-tune protected models. Our experiments on three datasets and 140 text-to-image diffusion models reveal that existing state-of-the-art protections are not robust against RATTAN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gautham Vasan, Mohamed Elsayed, Alireza Azimi, Jiamin He, Fahim Shariar, Colin Bellinger, Martha White, A. Rupam Mahmood</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern deep policy gradient methods achieve effective performance on simulated robotic tasks, but they all require large replay buffers or expensive batch updates, or both, making them incompatible for real systems with resource-limited computers. We show that these methods fail catastrophically when limited to small replay buffers or during incremental learning, where updates only use the most recent sample without batch updates or a replay buffer. We propose a novel incremental deep policy gradient method -- Action Value Gradient (AVG) and a set of normalization and scaling techniques to address the challenges of instability in incremental learning. On robotic simulation benchmarks, we show that AVG is the only incremental method that learns effectively, often achieving final performance comparable to batch policy gradient methods. This advancement enabled us to show for the first time effective deep reinforcement learning with real robots using only incremental updates, employing a robotic manipulator and a mobile robot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mostafa Varzaneh, Pooja Voladoddi, Tanmay Bakshi, Uma Gunturi</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time conversational AI agents face challenges in performing Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in dynamic, outdoor environments like automated drive-thru systems. These settings require NLU models to handle background noise, diverse accents, and multi-intent queries while operating under strict latency and memory constraints on edge devices. Additionally, robustness to errors from upstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is crucial, as ASR outputs in these environments are often noisy. We introduce Babylon, a transformer-based architecture that tackles NLU as an intent translation task, converting natural language inputs into sequences of regular language units ('transcodes') that encode both intents and slot information. This formulation allows Babylon to manage multi-intent scenarios in a single dialogue turn. Furthermore, Babylon incorporates an LSTM-based token pooling mechanism to preprocess phoneme sequences, reducing input length and optimizing for low-latency, low-memory edge deployment. This also helps mitigate inaccuracies in ASR outputs, enhancing system robustness. While this work focuses on drive-thru ordering, Babylon's design extends to similar noise-prone scenarios, for e.g. ticketing kiosks. Our experiments show that Babylon achieves significantly better accuracy-latency-memory footprint trade-offs over typically employed NMT models like Flan-T5 and BART, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time NLU in edge deployment settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: AdamZ is an advanced variant of the Adam optimiser, developed to enhance convergence efficiency in neural network training. This optimiser dynamically adjusts the learning rate by incorporating mechanisms to address overshooting and stagnation, that are common challenges in optimisation. Specifically, AdamZ reduces the learning rate when overshooting is detected and increases it during periods of stagnation, utilising hyperparameters such as overshoot and stagnation factors, thresholds, and patience levels to guide these adjustments. While AdamZ may lead to slightly longer training times compared to some other optimisers, it consistently excels in minimising the loss function, making it particularly advantageous for applications where precision is critical. Benchmarking results demonstrate the effectiveness of AdamZ in maintaining optimal learning rates, leading to improved model performance across diverse tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models often require specially designed architectures to process data of different dimensions, such as 1D time series, 2D images, and 3D volumetric data. Existing bidirectional models mainly focus on sequential data, making it difficult to scale effectively to higher dimensions. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-dimensional bidirectional neural network architecture, named Nd-BiMamba2, which efficiently handles 1D, 2D, and 3D data. Nd-BiMamba2 is based on the Mamba2 module and introduces innovative bidirectional processing mechanisms and adaptive padding strategies to capture bidirectional information in multi-dimensional data while maintaining computational efficiency. Unlike existing methods that require designing specific architectures for different dimensional data, Nd-BiMamba2 adopts a unified architecture with a modular design, simplifying development and maintenance costs. To verify the portability and flexibility of Nd-BiMamba2, we successfully exported it to ONNX and TorchScript and tested it on different hardware platforms (e.g., CPU, GPU, and mobile devices). Experimental results show that Nd-BiMamba2 runs efficiently on multiple platforms, demonstrating its potential in practical applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Shenoy, Zhihong Pan, Kaushik Balakrishnan, Qisen Cheng, Yongmoon Jeon, Heejune Yang, Jaewon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Image generation using diffusion models have demonstrated outstanding learning capabilities, effectively capturing the full distribution of the training dataset. They are known to generate wide variations in sampled images, albeit with a trade-off in image fidelity. Guided sampling methods, such as classifier guidance (CG) and classifier-free guidance (CFG), focus sampling in well-learned high-probability regions to generate images of high fidelity, but each has its limitations. CG is computationally expensive due to the use of back-propagation for classifier gradient descent, while CFG, being gradient-free, is more efficient but compromises class label alignment compared to CG. In this work, we propose an efficient guidance method that fully utilizes a pre-trained classifier without using gradient descent. By using the classifier solely in inference mode, a time-adaptive reference class label and corresponding guidance scale are determined at each time step for guided sampling. Experiments on both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation diffusion models demonstrate that the proposed Gradient-free Classifier Guidance (GFCG) method consistently improves class prediction accuracy. We also show GFCG to be complementary to other guided sampling methods like CFG. When combined with the state-of-the-art Autoguidance (ATG), without additional computational overhead, it enhances image fidelity while preserving diversity. For ImageNet 512$\times$512, we achieve a record $\text{FD}_{\text{DINOv2}}$ of 23.09, while simultaneously attaining a higher classification Precision (94.3%) compared to ATG (90.2%)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazhen Hong, Weinan Wang, Laleh Najafizadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: P300 speller BCIs allow users to compose sentences by selecting target keys on a GUI through the detection of P300 component in their EEG signals following visual stimuli. Most P300 speller BCIs require users to spell words letter by letter, or the first few initial letters, resulting in high keystroke demands that increase time, cognitive load, and fatigue. This highlights the need for more efficient, user-friendly methods for faster sentence composition. In this work, we introduce ChatBCI, a P300 speller BCI that leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to suggest words from user-spelled initial letters or predict the subsequent word(s), reducing keystrokes and accelerating sentence composition. ChatBCI retrieves word suggestions through remote queries to the GPT-3.5 API. A new GUI, displaying GPT-3.5 word suggestions as extra keys is designed. SWLDA is used for the P300 classification. Seven subjects completed two online spelling tasks: 1) copy-spelling a self-composed sentence using ChatBCI, and 2) improvising a sentence using ChatBCI's word suggestions. Results demonstrate that in Task 1, on average, ChatBCI outperforms letter-by-letter BCI spellers, reducing time and keystrokes by 62.14% and 53.22%, respectively, and increasing information transfer rate by 198.96%. In Task 2, ChatBCI achieves 80.68% keystroke savings and a record 8.53 characters/min for typing speed. Overall, ChatBCI, by employing remote LLM queries, enhances sentence composition in realistic scenarios, significantly outperforming traditional spellers without requiring local model training or storage. ChatBCI's (multi-) word predictions, combined with its new GUI, pave the way for developing next-generation speller BCIs that are efficient and effective for real-time communication, especially for users with communication and motor disabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiqun Liu, Jiangen He</p>
<p>Abstract: Can AI be cognitively biased in automated information judgment tasks? Despite recent progresses in measuring and mitigating social and algorithmic biases in AI and large language models (LLMs), it is not clear to what extent LLMs behave "rationally", or if they are also vulnerable to human cognitive bias triggers. To address this open problem, our study, consisting of a crowdsourcing user experiment and a LLM-enabled simulation experiment, compared the credibility assessments by LLM and human judges under potential decoy effects in an information retrieval (IR) setting, and empirically examined the extent to which LLMs are cognitively biased in COVID-19 medical (mis)information assessment tasks compared to traditional human assessors as a baseline. The results, collected from a between-subject user experiment and a LLM-enabled replicate experiment, demonstrate that 1) Larger and more recent LLMs tend to show a higher level of consistency and accuracy in distinguishing credible information from misinformation. However, they are more likely to give higher ratings for misinformation due to the presence of a more salient, decoy misinformation result; 2) While decoy effect occurred in both human and LLM assessments, the effect is more prevalent across different conditions and topics in LLM judgments compared to human credibility ratings. In contrast to the generally assumed "rationality" of AI tools, our study empirically confirms the cognitive bias risks embedded in LLM agents, evaluates the decoy impact on LLMs against human credibility assessments, and thereby highlights the complexity and importance of debiasing AI agents and developing psychology-informed AI audit techniques and policies for automated judgment tasks and beyond.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) aims to extract aspect terms and their corresponding sentiment polarities from multimodal information, including text and images. While traditional supervised learning methods have shown effectiveness in this task, the adaptability of large language models (LLMs) to MABSA remains uncertain. Recent advances in LLMs, such as Llama2, LLaVA, and ChatGPT, demonstrate strong capabilities in general tasks, yet their performance in complex and fine-grained scenarios like MABSA is underexplored. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the suitability of LLMs for MABSA. To this end, we construct a benchmark to evaluate the performance of LLMs on MABSA tasks and compare them with state-of-the-art supervised learning methods. Our experiments reveal that, while LLMs demonstrate potential in multimodal understanding, they face significant challenges in achieving satisfactory results for MABSA, particularly in terms of accuracy and inference time. Based on these findings, we discuss the limitations of current LLMs and outline directions for future research to enhance their capabilities in multimodal sentiment analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing an interpretable system for generating reports in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis is becoming increasingly crucial in Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, enabling radiologists to comprehend the decisions made by these systems. Despite the growth of diverse datasets and methods focusing on report generation, there remains a notable gap in how closely these models' generated reports align with the interpretations of real radiologists. In this study, we tackle this challenge by initially introducing Fine-Grained CXR (FG-CXR) dataset, which provides fine-grained paired information between the captions generated by radiologists and the corresponding gaze attention heatmaps for each anatomy. Unlike existing datasets that include a raw sequence of gaze alongside a report, with significant misalignment between gaze location and report content, our FG-CXR dataset offers a more grained alignment between gaze attention and diagnosis transcript. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that simply applying black-box image captioning methods to generate reports cannot adequately explain which information in CXR is utilized and how long needs to attend to accurately generate reports. Consequently, we propose a novel explainable radiologist's attention generator network (Gen-XAI) that mimics the diagnosis process of radiologists, explicitly constraining its output to closely align with both radiologist's gaze attention and transcript. Finally, we perform extensive experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of our method. Our datasets and checkpoint is available at https://github.com/UARK-AICV/FG-CXR.</p>

This paper explores the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for operating grid-scale batteries co-located with solar power. Our results show RL achieves an average of 61% (and up to 96%) of the approximate theoretical optimal (non-causal) operation, outperforming advanced control methods on average. Our findings suggest RL may be preferred when future signals are hard to predict. Moreover, RL has two significant advantages compared to simpler rules-based control: (1) that solar energy is more effectively shifted towards high demand periods, and (2) increased diversity of battery dispatch across different locations, reducing potential ramping issues caused by super-position of many similar actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunlei Liang, Jiawei Zhu, Wen Ye, Song Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial networks are useful for modeling geographic phenomena where spatial interaction plays an important role. To analyze the spatial networks and their internal structures, graph-based methods such as community detection have been widely used. Community detection aims to extract strongly connected components from the network and reveal the hidden relationships between nodes, but they usually do not involve the attribute information. To consider edge-based interactions and node attributes together, this study proposed a family of GeoAI-enhanced unsupervised community detection methods called region2vec based on Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). The region2vec methods generate node neural embeddings based on attribute similarity, geographic adjacency and spatial interactions, and then extract network communities based on node embeddings using agglomerative clustering. The proposed GeoAI-based methods are compared with multiple baselines and perform the best when one wants to maximize node attribute similarity and spatial interaction intensity simultaneously within the spatial network communities. It is further applied in the shortage area delineation problem in public health and demonstrates its promise in regionalization problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Formal Property Verification (FPV), using SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA), is crucial for ensuring the completeness of design with respect to the specification. However, writing SVA is a laborious task and has a steep learning curve. In this work, we present a large language model (LLM) -based flow to automatically generate high-quality SVA from the design specification documents, named \ToolName. We introduce a novel sub-task-focused fine-tuning approach that effectively addresses functionally incorrect assertions produced by baseline LLMs, leading to a remarkable 7.3-fold increase in the number of functionally correct assertions. Recognizing the prevalence of syntax and semantic errors, we also developed an iterative refinement method that enhances the LLM's initial outputs by systematically re-prompting it to correct identified issues. This process is further strengthened by a custom compiler that generates meaningful error messages, guiding the LLM towards improved accuracy. The experiments demonstrate a 26\% increase in the number of assertions free from syntax errors using this approach, showcasing its potential to streamline the FPV process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingxin Xu, Yuzhang Shang, Yunhao Ge, Qian Lou, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in visual-language tasks but face significant deployment challenges due to their high computational demands. While recent token reduction methods show promise for accelerating LMMs, they typically require extensive retraining or fine-tuning, making them impractical for many state-of-the-art models, especially those with proprietary training data. We propose freePruner, a training-free token reduction approach that can be directly applied to any open-source LMM without additional training. Unlike existing methods that rely heavily on token merging operations, freePruner employs a two-stage token selection strategy: (1) identifying pivotal tokens that capture high-level semantic information using our designed contribution degree metric, and (2) selecting complementary tokens that preserve essential low-level visual details through attention pattern analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that freePruner achieves 2x acceleration while maintaining comparable performance across mainstream visual question-answering benchmarks in the training-free setting. Moreover, freePruner is orthogonal to and can be combined with other post-training acceleration techniques, such as post-training quantization, providing a practical solution for efficient LMM deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Te Yang, Jian Jia, Xiangyu Zhu, Weisong Zhao, Bo Wang, Yanhua Cheng, Yan Li, Shengyuan Liu, Quan Chen, Peng Jiang, Kun Gai, Zhen Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong instruction-following capability to interpret and execute tasks as directed by human commands. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inferior instruction-following ability compared to LLMs. However, there is a significant gap in the instruction-following capabilities between the MLLMs and LLMs. In this study, we conduct a pilot experiment, which demonstrates that spatially down-sampling visual tokens significantly enhances the instruction-following capability of MLLMs. This is attributed to the substantial redundancy in visual modality. However, this intuitive method severely impairs the MLLM's multimodal understanding capability. In this paper, we propose Visual-Modality Token Compression (VMTC) and Cross-Modality Attention Inhibition (CMAI) strategies to alleviate this gap between MLLMs and LLMs by inhibiting the influence of irrelevant visual tokens during content generation, increasing the instruction-following ability of the MLLMs while retaining their multimodal understanding capacity. In VMTC module, the primary tokens are retained and the redundant tokens are condensed by token clustering and merging. In CMAI process, we aggregate text-to-image attentions by text-to-text attentions to obtain a text-to-image focus score. Attention inhibition is performed on the text-image token pairs with low scores. Our comprehensive experiments over instruction-following capabilities and VQA-V2, GQA, TextVQA, MME and MMBench five benchmarks, demonstrate that proposed strategy significantly enhances the instruction following capability of MLLMs while preserving the ability to understand and process multimodal inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Lu, Mingyuan Xiao, Weijian Wang, Yuxin Du, Yi Cui, Jingnan Zhao, Cheng Hua</p>
<p>Abstract: The surge in micro-videos is transforming the concept of popularity. As researchers delve into vast multi-modal datasets, there is a growing interest in understanding the origins of this popularity and the forces driving its rapid expansion. Recent studies suggest that the virality of short videos is not only tied to their inherent multi-modal content but is also heavily influenced by the strength of platform recommendations driven by audience feedback. In this paper, we introduce a framework for capturing long-term dependencies in user feedback and dynamic event interactions, based on the Mamba Hawkes process. Our experiments on the large-scale open-source multi-modal dataset show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various metrics by 23.2%. We believe our model's capability to map the relationships within user feedback behavior sequences will not only contribute to the evolution of next-generation recommendation algorithms and platform applications but also enhance our understanding of micro video dissemination and its broader societal impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sukhandeep Kaur, Mubashir Buhari, Naman Khandelwal, Priyansh Tyagi, Kiran Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Deepfakes offer great potential for innovation and creativity, but they also pose significant risks to privacy, trust, and security. With a vast Hindi-speaking population, India is particularly vulnerable to deepfake-driven misinformation campaigns. Fake videos or speeches in Hindi can have an enormous impact on rural and semi-urban communities, where digital literacy tends to be lower and people are more inclined to trust video content. The development of effective frameworks and detection tools to combat deepfake misuse requires high-quality, diverse, and extensive datasets. The existing popular datasets like FF-DF (FaceForensics++), and DFDC (DeepFake Detection Challenge) are based on English language.. Hence, this paper aims to create a first novel Hindi deep fake dataset, named ``Hindi audio-video-Deepfake'' (HAV-DF). The dataset has been generated using the faceswap, lipsyn and voice cloning methods. This multi-step process allows us to create a rich, varied dataset that captures the nuances of Hindi speech and facial expressions, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluating deepfake detection models in a Hindi language context. It is unique of its kind as all of the previous datasets contain either deepfake videos or synthesized audio. This type of deepfake dataset can be used for training a detector for both deepfake video and audio datasets. Notably, the newly introduced HAV-DF dataset demonstrates lower detection accuracy's across existing detection methods like Headpose, Xception-c40, etc. Compared to other well-known datasets FF-DF, and DFDC. This trend suggests that the HAV-DF dataset presents deeper challenges to detect, possibly due to its focus on Hindi language content and diverse manipulation techniques. The HAV-DF dataset fills the gap in Hindi-specific deepfake datasets, aiding multilingual deepfake detection development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei E, Yinglong Zhang, Xuewen Xia, Xing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformer models, with their outstanding performance and flexible architectural designs, have become leading technologies for processing structured data, especially graph data. Traditional GNNs often face challenges in capturing information from distant vertices effectively. In contrast, Graph Transformer models are particularly adept at managing long-distance node relationships. Despite these advantages, Graph Transformer models still encounter issues with computational and storage efficiency when scaled to large graph datasets. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that integrates a Top-m attention mechanism aggregation component and a neighborhood aggregation component, effectively enhancing the model's ability to aggregate relevant information from both local and extended neighborhoods at each layer. This method not only improves computational efficiency but also enriches the node features, facilitating a deeper analysis of complex graph structures. Additionally, to assess the effectiveness of our proposed model, we have applied it to citation sentiment prediction, a novel task previously unexplored in the GNN field. Accordingly, we constructed a dedicated citation network, ArXivNet. In this dataset, we specifically annotated the sentiment polarity of the citations (positive, neutral, negative) to enable in-depth sentiment analysis. Our approach has shown superior performance across a variety of tasks including vertex classification, link prediction, sentiment prediction, graph regression, and visualization. It outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness, as demonstrated by experimental results on multiple datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohit Dandamudi, Gema Rodr\'iguez-P\'erez</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the performance of Code Language Models (CLMs) for software engineering tasks, especially in multilingual and low-resource programming language settings, poses significant challenges. These challenges are primarily due to the lack of high-quality benchmarks across various programming languages and the imbalanced nature of the CLMs training corpus. Although recent advances in one of the common downstream tasks, code generation, have shown promise by introducing translated benchmarks using different methodologies, there is a current lack of empirical evidence assessing these benchmarks. To address this gap, we conducted a preliminary study to evaluate the performance of Poly-Coder, a pioneering open-source, multilingual CLM built for code generation. We utilized two existing state-of-the-art translations of the popular code generation benchmark, HumanEval, facilitated by the OctoPack and MultiPL-E studies. Our results suggest that the outcomes observed in these translated benchmarks align well with evaluation metrics used during the training phase, such as perplexity, thereby validating their effectiveness in estimating the performance of CLMs. However, we identified several inconsistencies in the CLMs' performance across the translated benchmarks and encountered challenges in replicating the results. These initial insights highlight the need for more comprehensive empirical studies to fully understand translated benchmarks' methodological approaches, limitations, and reproducibility. Such studies are essential to ensure their reliability before they are widely adopted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Zhang, Pinxin Liu, Hyeongwoo Kim, Pablo Garrido, Bindita Chaudhuri</p>
<p>Abstract: Controlling human motion based on text presents an important challenge in computer vision. Traditional approaches often rely on holistic action descriptions for motion synthesis, which struggle to capture subtle movements of local body parts. This limitation restricts the ability to isolate and manipulate specific movements. To address this, we propose a novel motion representation that decomposes motion into distinct body joint group movements and interactions from a kinematic perspective. We design an automatic dataset collection pipeline that enhances the existing text-motion benchmark by incorporating fine-grained local joint-group motion and interaction descriptions. To bridge the gap between text and motion domains, we introduce a hierarchical motion semantics approach that progressively fuses joint-level interaction information into the global action-level semantics for modality alignment. With this hierarchy, we introduce a coarse-to-fine motion synthesis procedure for various generation and editing downstream applications. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed formulation enhances text-motion retrieval by improving joint-spatial understanding, and enables more precise joint-motion generation and control.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Joshi, Shaswati Saha, Divyaksh Shukla, Sriram Vema, Harsh Jhamtani, Manas Gaur, Ashutosh Modi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be a great success in a wide range of applications ranging from regular NLP-based use cases to AI agents. LLMs have been trained on a vast corpus of texts from various sources; despite the best efforts during the data pre-processing stage while training the LLMs, they may pick some undesirable information such as personally identifiable information (PII). Consequently, in recent times research in the area of Machine Unlearning (MUL) has become active, the main idea is to force LLMs to forget (unlearn) certain information (e.g., PII) without suffering from performance loss on regular tasks. In this work, we examine the robustness of the existing MUL techniques for their ability to enable leakage-proof forgetting in LLMs. In particular, we examine the effect of data transformation on forgetting, i.e., is an unlearned LLM able to recall forgotten information if there is a change in the format of the input? Our findings on the TOFU dataset highlight the necessity of using diverse data formats to quantify unlearning in LLMs more reliably.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong-Cheng Tu, Zi-Ao Ma, Tian Lan, Yuehao Zhao, Heyan Huang, Xian-Ling Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Driven by the remarkable progress in diffusion models, text-to-image generation has made significant strides, creating a pressing demand for automatic quality evaluation of generated images. Current state-of-the-art automatic evaluation methods heavily rely on Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly powerful commercial models like GPT-4o. While these models are highly effective, their substantial costs limit scalability in large-scale evaluations. Adopting open-source MLLMs is an alternative; however, their performance falls short due to significant limitations in processing multi-modal data compared to commercial MLLMs. To tackle these problems, we first propose a task decomposition evaluation framework based on GPT-4o to automatically construct a new training dataset, where the complex evaluation task is decoupled into simpler sub-tasks, effectively reducing the learning complexity. Based on this dataset, we design innovative training strategies to effectively distill GPT-4o's evaluation capabilities into a 7B open-source MLLM, MiniCPM-V-2.6. Furthermore, to reliably and comprehensively assess prior works and our proposed model, we manually annotate a meta-evaluation benchmark that includes chain-of-thought explanations alongside quality scores for generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that our distilled open-source MLLM significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art GPT-4o-base baseline, VIEScore, with over 4.6\% improvement in Spearman and Kendall correlations with human judgments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanghaoran Zhang, Yue Yu, Xinjun Mao, Shangwen Wang, Kang Yang, Yao Lu, Zhang Zhang, Yuxin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Code snippet adaptation is a fundamental activity in the software development process. Unlike code generation, code snippet adaptation is not a "free creation", which requires developers to tailor a given code snippet in order to fit specific requirements and the code context. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have confirmed their effectiveness in the code generation task with promising results. However, their performance on adaptation, a reuse-oriented and context-dependent code change prediction task, is still unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance and issues of LLMs on the adaptation task. We first evaluate the adaptation performances of three popular LLMs and compare them to the code generation task. Our result indicates that their adaptation ability is weaker than generation, with a nearly 15% decrease on pass@1 and more context-related errors. By manually inspecting 200 cases, we further investigate the causes of LLMs' sub-optimal performance, which can be classified into three categories, i.e., Unclear Requirement, Requirement Misalignment and Context Misapplication. Based on the above empirical research, we propose an interactive prompting approach to eliciting LLMs' adaptation ability. Experimental result reveals that our approach greatly improve LLMs' adaptation performance. The best-performing Human-LLM interaction successfully solves 159 out of the 202 identified defects and improves the pass@1 and pass@5 by over 40% compared to the initial instruction-based prompt. Considering human efforts, we suggest multi-agent interaction as a trade-off, which can achieve comparable performance with excellent generalization ability. We deem that our approach could provide methodological assistance for autonomous code snippet reuse and adaptation with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyue Mi, Fan Tang, Juan Cao, Qiang Sheng, Ziyao Huang, Peng Li, Yang Liu, Tong-Yee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual generation models have achieved remarkable progress in computer graphics applications but still face significant challenges in real-world deployment. Current assessment approaches for visual generation tasks typically follow an isolated three-phase framework: test input collection, model output generation, and user assessment. These fashions suffer from fixed coverage, evolving difficulty, and data leakage risks, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensively evaluating increasingly complex generation models. To address these limitations, we propose DyEval, an LLM-powered dynamic interactive visual assessment framework that facilitates collaborative evaluation between humans and generative models for text-to-image systems. DyEval features an intuitive visual interface that enables users to interactively explore and analyze model behaviors, while adaptively generating hierarchical, fine-grained, and diverse textual inputs to continuously probe the capability boundaries of the models based on their feedback. Additionally, to provide interpretable analysis for users to further improve tested models, we develop a contextual reflection module that mines failure triggers of test inputs and reflects model potential failure patterns supporting in-depth analysis using the logical reasoning ability of LLM. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DyEval can effectively help users identify max up to 2.56 times generation failures than conventional methods, and uncover complex and rare failure patterns, such as issues with pronoun generation and specific cultural context generation. Our framework provides valuable insights for improving generative models and has broad implications for advancing the reliability and capabilities of visual generation systems across various domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Nihalani, Kushal Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an improved LLM based model for Grammatical Error Detection (GED), which is a very challenging and equally important problem for many applications. The traditional approach to GED involved hand-designed features, but recently, Neural Networks (NN) have automated the discovery of these features, improving performance in GED. Traditional rule-based systems have an F1 score of 0.50-0.60 and earlier machine learning models give an F1 score of 0.65-0.75, including decision trees and simple neural networks. Previous deep learning models, for example, Bi-LSTM, have reported F1 scores within the range from 0.80 to 0.90. In our study, we have fine-tuned various transformer models using the Lang8 dataset rigorously cleaned by us. In our experiments, the BERT-base-uncased model gave an impressive performance with an F1 score of 0.91 and accuracy of 98.49% on training data and 90.53% on testing data, also showcasing the importance of data cleaning. Increasing model size using BERT-large-uncased or RoBERTa-large did not give any noticeable improvements in performance or advantage for this task, underscoring that larger models are not always better. Our results clearly show how far rigorous data cleaning and simple transformer-based models can go toward significantly improving the quality of GED.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixuan Chen, Yequan Bie, Haibo Jin, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) report generation is crucial to assist radiologists in interpreting CT volumes, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Existing methods primarily only consider the global features of the entire volume, making it struggle to focus on specific regions and potentially missing abnormalities. To address this issue, we propose Reg2RG, the first region-guided referring and grounding framework for CT report generation, which enhances diagnostic performance by focusing on anatomical regions within the volume. Specifically, we utilize masks from a universal segmentation module to capture local features for each referring region. A local feature decoupling (LFD) strategy is proposed to preserve the local high-resolution details with little computational overhead. Then the local features are integrated with global features to capture inter-regional relationships within a cohesive context. Moreover, we propose a novel region-report alignment (RRA) training strategy. It leverages the recognition of referring regions to guide the generation of region-specific reports, enhancing the model's referring and grounding capabilities while also improving the report's interpretability. A large language model (LLM) is further employed as the language decoder to generate reports from integrated visual features, facilitating region-level comprehension. Extensive experiments on two large-scale chest CT-report datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics while preserving promising interpretability. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: While text-to-video diffusion models have made significant strides, many still face challenges in generating videos with temporal consistency. Within diffusion frameworks, guidance techniques have proven effective in enhancing output quality during inference; however, applying these methods to video diffusion models introduces additional complexity of handling computations across entire sequences. To address this, we propose a novel framework called MotionPrompt that guides the video generation process via optical flow. Specifically, we train a discriminator to distinguish optical flow between random pairs of frames from real videos and generated ones. Given that prompts can influence the entire video, we optimize learnable token embeddings during reverse sampling steps by using gradients from a trained discriminator applied to random frame pairs. This approach allows our method to generate visually coherent video sequences that closely reflect natural motion dynamics, without compromising the fidelity of the generated content. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various models.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the core challenges of research in quantum computing is concerned with the question whether quantum advantages can be found for near-term quantum circuits that have implications for practical applications. Motivated by this mindset, in this work, we prove an unconditional quantum advantage in the probably approximately correct (PAC) distribution learning framework with shallow quantum circuit hypotheses. We identify a meaningful generative distribution learning problem where constant-depth quantum circuits using one and two qubit gates (QNC^0) are superior compared to constant-depth bounded fan-in classical circuits (NC^0) as a choice for hypothesis classes. We hence prove a PAC distribution learning separation for shallow quantum circuits over shallow classical circuits. We do so by building on recent results by Bene Watts and Parham on unconditional quantum advantages for sampling tasks with shallow circuits, which we technically uplift to a hyperplane learning problem, identifying non-local correlations as the origin of the quantum advantage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are crucial for applications requiring integrated understanding textual and visual information. However, existing VLMs struggle with long videos due to computational inefficiency, memory limitations, and difficulties in maintaining coherent understanding across extended sequences. To address these challenges, we introduce ReWind, a novel memory-based VLM designed for efficient long video understanding while preserving temporal fidelity. ReWind operates in a two-stage framework. In the first stage, ReWind maintains a dynamic learnable memory module with a novel \textbf{read-perceive-write} cycle that stores and updates instruction-relevant visual information as the video unfolds. This module utilizes learnable queries and cross-attentions between memory contents and the input stream, ensuring low memory requirements by scaling linearly with the number of tokens. In the second stage, we propose an adaptive frame selection mechanism guided by the memory content to identify instruction-relevant key moments. It enriches the memory representations with detailed spatial information by selecting a few high-resolution frames, which are then combined with the memory contents and fed into a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the final answer. We empirically demonstrate ReWind's superior performance in visual question answering (VQA) and temporal grounding tasks, surpassing previous methods on long video benchmarks. Notably, ReWind achieves a +13\% score gain and a +12\% accuracy improvement on the MovieChat-1K VQA dataset and an +8\% mIoU increase on Charades-STA for temporal grounding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation remains a critical challenge in enabling the knowledge transfer of models across unseen domains. Existing methods struggle to balance the need for domain-invariant representations with preserving domain-specific features, which is often due to alignment approaches that impose the projection of samples with similar semantics close in the latent space despite their drastic domain differences. We introduce \mnamelong, a novel approach that shifts the focus from aligning representations in absolute coordinates to aligning the relative positioning of equivalent concepts in latent spaces. \mname defines a domain-agnostic structure upon the semantic/geometric relationships between class labels in language space and guides adaptation, ensuring that the organization of samples in visual space reflects reference inter-class relationships while preserving domain-specific characteristics. %We empirically demonstrate \mname's superiority in domain adaptation tasks across four diverse images and video datasets. Remarkably, \mname surpasses previous works in 18 different adaptation scenarios across four diverse image and video datasets with average accuracy improvements of +3.32% on DomainNet, +5.75% in GeoPlaces, +4.77% on GeoImnet, and +1.94% mean class accuracy improvement on EgoExo4D.</p>

<p>Abstract: An efficient channel estimation is of vital importance to help THz communication systems achieve their full potential. Conventional uplink channel estimation methods, such as least square estimation, are practically inefficient for THz systems because of their large computation overhead. In this paper, we propose an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) based THz channel estimator that estimates the THz channel factors using uplink sub-6GHz channel. Further, we use the estimated THz channel factors to predict the optimal beamformer from a pre-given codebook, using a dense neural network. We not only get rid of the overhead associated with the conventional methods, but also achieve near-optimal spectral efficiency rates using the proposed beamformer predictor. The proposed method also outperforms deep learning based beamformer predictors accepting THz channel matrices as input, thus proving the validity and efficiency of our sub-6GHz based approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaojiang Liu, Jiajun Zou, Zhendan Liu, Meixia Dong, Zhiping Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread application of human body 3D reconstruction technology across various fields, the demands for data transmission and processing efficiency continue to rise, particularly in scenarios where network bandwidth is limited and low latency is required. This paper introduces an Adversarial Feature Learning-based Semantic Communication method (AFLSC) for human body 3D reconstruction, which focuses on extracting and transmitting semantic information crucial for the 3D reconstruction task, thereby significantly optimizing data flow and alleviating bandwidth pressure. At the sender's end, we propose a multitask learning-based feature extraction method to capture the spatial layout, keypoints, posture, and depth information from 2D human images, and design a semantic encoding technique based on adversarial feature learning to encode these feature information into semantic data. We also develop a dynamic compression technique to efficiently transmit this semantic data, greatly enhancing transmission efficiency and reducing latency. At the receiver's end, we design an efficient multi-level semantic feature decoding method to convert semantic data back into key image features. Finally, an improved ViT-diffusion model is employed for 3D reconstruction, producing human body 3D mesh models. Experimental results validate the advantages of our method in terms of data transmission efficiency and reconstruction quality, demonstrating its excellent potential for application in bandwidth-limited environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuchen Li, Shiyu Hu, Xiaokun Feng, Dailing Zhang, Meiqi Wu, Jing Zhang, Kaiqi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language tracking (VLT) extends traditional single object tracking by incorporating textual information, providing semantic guidance to enhance tracking performance under challenging conditions like fast motion and deformations. However, current VLT trackers often underperform compared to single-modality methods on multiple benchmarks, with semantic information sometimes becoming a "distraction." To address this, we propose VLTVerse, the first fine-grained evaluation framework for VLT trackers that comprehensively considers multiple challenge factors and diverse semantic information, hoping to reveal the role of language in VLT. Our contributions include: (1) VLTVerse introduces 10 sequence-level challenge labels and 6 types of multi-granularity semantic information, creating a flexible and multi-dimensional evaluation space for VLT; (2) leveraging 60 subspaces formed by combinations of challenge factors and semantic types, we conduct systematic fine-grained evaluations of three mainstream SOTA VLT trackers, uncovering their performance bottlenecks across complex scenarios and offering a novel perspective on VLT evaluation; (3) through decoupled analysis of experimental results, we examine the impact of various semantic types on specific challenge factors in relation to different algorithms, providing essential guidance for enhancing VLT across data, evaluation, and algorithmic dimensions. The VLTVerse, toolkit, and results will be available at \url{http://metaverse.aitestunion.com}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Hardy</p>
<p>Abstract: "Gold" and "ground truth" human-mediated labels have error. The effects of this error can escape commonly reported metrics of label quality or obscure questions of accuracy, bias, fairness, and usefulness during model evaluation. This study demonstrates methods for answering such questions even in the context of very low reliabilities from expert humans. We analyze human labels, GPT model ratings, and transformer encoder model annotations describing the quality of classroom teaching, an important, expensive, and currently only human task. We answer the question of whether such a task can be automated using two Large Language Model (LLM) architecture families--encoders and GPT decoders, using novel approaches to evaluating label quality across six dimensions: Concordance, Confidence, Validity, Bias, Fairness, and Helpfulness. First, we demonstrate that using standard metrics in the presence of poor labels can mask both label and model quality: the encoder family of models achieve state-of-the-art, even "super-human", results across all classroom annotation tasks. But not all these positive results remain after using more rigorous evaluation measures which reveal spurious correlations and nonrandom racial biases across models and humans. This study then expands these methods to estimate how model use would change to human label quality if models were used in a human-in-the-loop context, finding that the variance captured in GPT model labels would worsen reliabilities for humans influenced by these models. We identify areas where some LLMs, within the generalizability of the current data, could improve the quality of expensive human ratings of classroom instruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaya Mehenni, Amal Zouaq</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for text summarization. However, some domains require specific information to be available in the summaries. Generating these domain-adapted summaries is still an open challenge. Similarly, hallucinations in generated content is a major drawback of current approaches, preventing their deployment. This study proposes a novel approach that leverages ontologies to create domain-adapted summaries both structured and unstructured. We employ an ontology-guided constrained decoding process to reduce hallucinations while improving relevance. When applied to the medical domain, our method shows potential in summarizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) across different specialties, allowing doctors to focus on the most relevant information to their domain. Evaluation on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrates improvements in generating domain-adapted summaries of clinical notes and hallucination reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damodar Panigrahi, Shaswata Mitra, Subash Neupane, Sudip Mittal, Benjamin A. Blakely</p>
<p>Abstract: Cyberattacks are becoming increasingly difficult to detect and prevent due to their sophistication. In response, Autonomous Intelligent Cyber-defense Agents (AICAs) are emerging as crucial solutions. One prominent AICA agent is the Intrusion Response System (IRS), which is critical for mitigating threats after detection. IRS uses several Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to mitigate attacks and restore the infrastructure to normal operations. Continuous monitoring of the enterprise infrastructure is an essential TTP the IRS uses. However, each system serves different purposes to meet operational needs. Integrating these disparate sources for continuous monitoring increases pre-processing complexity and limits automation, eventually prolonging critical response time for attackers to exploit. We propose a unified IRS Knowledge Graph ontology (IRSKG) that streamlines the onboarding of new enterprise systems as a source for the AICAs. Our ontology can capture system monitoring logs and supplemental data, such as a rules repository containing the administrator-defined policies to dictate the IRS responses. Besides, our ontology permits us to incorporate dynamic changes to adapt to the evolving cyber-threat landscape. This robust yet concise design allows machine learning models to train effectively and recover a compromised system to its desired state autonomously with explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jimmy Cheung, Smruthi Rangarajan, Amelia Maddocks, Xizhe Chen, Rohitash Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is crucial in time series prediction, and quantile regression offers a valuable mechanism for uncertainty quantification which is useful for extreme value forecasting. Although deep learning models have been prominent in multi-step ahead prediction, the development and evaluation of quantile deep learning models have been limited. We present a novel quantile regression deep learning framework for multi-step time series prediction. In this way, we elevate the capabilities of deep learning models by incorporating quantile regression, thus providing a more nuanced understanding of predictive values. We provide an implementation of prominent deep learning models for multi-step ahead time series prediction and evaluate their performance under high volatility and extreme conditions. We include multivariate and univariate modelling, strategies and provide a comparison with conventional deep learning models from the literature. Our models are tested on two cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum, using daily close-price data and selected benchmark time series datasets. The results show that integrating a quantile loss function with deep learning provides additional predictions for selected quantiles without a loss in the prediction accuracy when compared to the literature. Our quantile model has the ability to handle volatility more effectively and provides additional information for decision-making and uncertainty quantification through the use of quantiles when compared to conventional deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saurabhchand Bhati, Yuan Gong, Leonid Karlinsky, Hilde Kuehne, Rogerio Feris, James Glass</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALM) combine the audio perception models and the Large Language Models (LLM) and show a remarkable ability to reason about the input audio, infer the meaning, and understand the intent. However, these systems rely on Transformers which scale quadratically with the input sequence lengths which poses computational challenges in deploying these systems in memory and time-constrained scenarios. Recently, the state-space models (SSMs) have emerged as an alternative to transformer networks.
  While there have been successful attempts to replace transformer-based audio perception models with state-space ones, state-space-based LALMs remain unexplored. First, we begin by replacing the transformer-based audio perception module and then replace the transformer-based LLM and propose the first state-space-based LALM. Experimental results demonstrate that space-based LALM despite having a significantly lower number of parameters performs competitively with transformer-based LALMs on close-ended tasks on a variety of datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaifu Zhan, Shuang Zhou, Mingchen Li, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: \textbf{Objective:} We aimed to develop an advanced multi-task large language model (LLM) framework to extract multiple types of information about dietary supplements (DS) from clinical records.
  \textbf{Methods:} We used four core DS information extraction tasks - namely, named entity recognition (NER: 2,949 clinical sentences), relation extraction (RE: 4,892 sentences), triple extraction (TE: 2,949 sentences), and usage classification (UC: 2,460 sentences) as our multitasks. We introduced a novel Retrieval-Augmented Multi-task Information Extraction (RAMIE) Framework, including: 1) employed instruction fine-tuning techniques with task-specific prompts, 2) trained LLMs for multiple tasks with improved storage efficiency and lower training costs, and 3) incorporated retrieval augmentation generation (RAG) techniques by retrieving similar examples from the training set. We compared RAMIE's performance to LLMs with instruction fine-tuning alone and conducted an ablation study to assess the contributions of multi-task learning and RAG to improved multitasking performance.
  \textbf{Results:} With the aid of the RAMIE framework, Llama2-13B achieved an F1 score of 87.39 (3.51\% improvement) on the NER task and demonstrated outstanding performance on the RE task with an F1 score of 93.74 (1.15\% improvement). For the TE task, Llama2-7B scored 79.45 (14.26\% improvement), and MedAlpaca-7B achieved the highest F1 score of 93.45 (0.94\% improvement) on the UC task. The ablation study revealed that while MTL increased efficiency with a slight trade-off in performance, RAG significantly boosted overall accuracy.
  \textbf{Conclusion:} This study presents a novel RAMIE framework that demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-task information extraction for DS-related data from clinical records. Our framework can potentially be applied to other domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyi Li, Kang Yang, Jin Tan, Wen-jie Lu, Haoqi Wu, Xiao Wang, Yu Yu, Derun Zhao, Yancheng Zheng, Minyi Guo, Jingwen Leng</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer models have gained significant attention due to their power in machine learning tasks. Their extensive deployment has raised concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information during inference. However, when being applied to Transformers, existing approaches based on secure two-party computation (2PC) bring about efficiency limitations in two folds: (1) resource-intensive matrix multiplications in linear layers, and (2) complex non-linear activation functions like $\mathsf{GELU}$ and $\mathsf{Softmax}$. This work presents a new two-party inference framework $\mathsf{Nimbus}$ for Transformer models. For the linear layer, we propose a new 2PC paradigm along with an encoding approach to securely compute matrix multiplications based on an outer-product insight, which achieves $2.9\times \sim 12.5\times$ performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) protocol. For the non-linear layer, through a new observation of utilizing the input distribution, we propose an approach of low-degree polynomial approximation for $\mathsf{GELU}$ and $\mathsf{Softmax}$, which improves the performance of the SOTA polynomial approximation by $2.9\times \sim 4.0\times$, where the average accuracy loss of our approach is 0.08\% compared to the non-2PC inference without privacy. Compared with the SOTA two-party inference, $\mathsf{Nimbus}$ improves the end-to-end performance of \bert{} inference by $2.7\times \sim 4.7\times$ across different network settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have broadened the applicability of AI-generated images across various sectors, including the creative industry and design. However, their utilization in educational contexts, particularly among undergraduate students in computer science and software engineering, remains underexplored. This study adopts an exploratory approach, employing questionnaires and interviews, to assess students' acceptance, trust, and positive attitudes towards AI-generated images for educational tasks such as presentations, reports, and web design. The results reveal high acceptance, trust, and positive attitudes among students who value the ease of use and potential academic benefits. However, concerns regarding the lack of technical precision, where the AI fails to accurately produce images as specified by prompts, moderately impact their practical application in detail-oriented educational tasks. These findings suggest a need for developing comprehensive guidelines that address ethical considerations and intellectual property issues, while also setting quality standards for AI-generated images to enhance their educational use. Enhancing the capabilities of AI tools to meet precise user specifications could foster creativity and improve educational outcomes in technical disciplines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kexin Zhang, Fuyuan Lyu, Xing Tang, Dugang Liu, Chen Ma, Kaize Ding, Xiuqiang He, Xue Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of previous Click-Through Rate (CTR) models has mainly been driven by proposing complex components, whether shallow or deep, that are adept at modeling feature interactions. However, there has been less focus on improving fusion design. Instead, two naive solutions, stacked and parallel fusion, are commonly used. Both solutions rely on pre-determined fusion connections and fixed fusion operations. It has been repetitively observed that changes in fusion design may result in different performances, highlighting the critical role that fusion plays in CTR models. While there have been attempts to refine these basic fusion strategies, these efforts have often been constrained to specific settings or dependent on specific components. Neural architecture search has also been introduced to partially deal with fusion design, but it comes with limitations. The complexity of the search space can lead to inefficient and ineffective results. To bridge this gap, we introduce OptFusion, a method that automates the learning of fusion, encompassing both the connection learning and the operation selection. We have proposed a one-shot learning algorithm tackling these tasks concurrently. Our experiments are conducted over three large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments prove both the effectiveness and efficiency of OptFusion in improving CTR model performance.

<p>Abstract: We introduce LTCF-Net, a novel network architecture designed for enhancing low-light images. Unlike Retinex-based methods, our approach utilizes two color spaces - LAB and YUV - to efficiently separate and process color information, by leveraging the separation of luminance from chromatic components in color images. In addition, our model incorporates the Transformer architecture to comprehensively understand image content while maintaining computational efficiency. To dynamically balance the brightness in output images, we also introduce a Fourier transform module that adjusts the luminance channel in the frequency domain. This mechanism could uniformly balance brightness across different regions while eliminating background noises, and thereby enhancing visual quality. By combining these innovative components, LTCF-Net effectively improves low-light image quality while keeping the model lightweight. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics and datasets, achieving more natural color restoration and a balanced brightness distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tavis Shore, Oscar Mendez, Simon Hadfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-view Geo-localisation is typically performed at a coarse granularity, because densely sampled satellite image patches overlap heavily. This heavy overlap would make disambiguating patches very challenging. However, by opting for sparsely sampled patches, prior work has placed an artificial upper bound on the localisation accuracy that is possible. Even a perfect oracle system cannot achieve accuracy greater than the average separation of the tiles. To solve this limitation, we propose combining cross-view geo-localisation and relative pose estimation to increase precision to a level practical for real-world application. We develop PEnG, a 2-stage system which first predicts the most likely edges from a city-scale graph representation upon which a query image lies. It then performs relative pose estimation within these edges to determine a precise position. PEnG presents the first technique to utilise both viewpoints available within cross-view geo-localisation datasets to enhance precision to a sub-metre level, with some examples achieving centimetre level accuracy. Our proposed ensemble achieves state-of-the-art precision - with relative Top-5m retrieval improvements on previous works of 213%. Decreasing the median euclidean distance error by 96.90% from the previous best of 734m down to 22.77m, when evaluating with 90 degree horizontal FOV images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liran Nochumsohn, Michal Moshkovitz, Orly Avner, Dotan Di Castro, Omri Azencot</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical in numerous real-world applications, requiring accurate predictions of future values based on observed patterns. While traditional forecasting techniques work well in in-domain scenarios with ample data, they struggle when data is scarce or not available at all, motivating the emergence of zero-shot and few-shot learning settings. Recent advancements often leverage large-scale foundation models for such tasks, but these methods require extensive data and compute resources, and their performance may be hindered by ineffective learning from the available training set. This raises a fundamental question: What factors influence effective learning from data in time series forecasting? Toward addressing this, we propose using Fourier analysis to investigate how models learn from synthetic and real-world time series data. Our findings reveal that forecasters commonly suffer from poor learning from data with multiple frequencies and poor generalization to unseen frequencies, which impedes their predictive performance. To alleviate these issues, we present a novel synthetic data generation framework, designed to enhance real data or replace it completely by creating task-specific frequency information, requiring only the sampling rate of the target data. Our approach, Freq-Synth, improves the robustness of both foundation as well as nonfoundation forecast models in zero-shot and few-shot settings, facilitating more reliable time series forecasting under limited data scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yassine Machta, Omar Ali, Kevin Hakkakian, Ana Vlascenau, Amaury Facque, Nicolas Golse, Irene Vignon-Clementel</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical assessment of liver cancer patients requires identification of the vessel trees from medical images. Specifically, the venous trees - the portal (perfusing) and the hepatic (draining) trees are important for understanding the liver anatomy and disease state, and perform surgery planning. This research aims to improve the 3D segmentation, skeletonization, and subsequent analysis of vessel trees, by creating an automatic pipeline based on deep learning and image processing techniques.
  The first part of this work explores the impact of differentiable skeletonization methods such as ClDice and morphological skeletonization loss, on the overall liver vessel segmentation performance. To this aim, it studies how to improve vessel tree connectivity.
  The second part of this study converts a single class vessel segmentation into multi-class ones, separating the two venous trees. It builds on the previous two-class vessel segmentation model, which vessel tree outputs might be entangled, and on connected components and skeleton analyses of the trees.
  After providing sub-labeling of the specific anatomical branches of each venous tree, these algorithms also enable a morphometric analysis of the vessel trees by extracting various geometrical markers.
  In conclusion, we propose a method that successfully improves current skeletonization methods, for extensive vascular trees that contain vessels of different calibers. The separation algorithm creates a clean multi-class segmentation of the vessels, validated by surgeons to provide low error. A new, publicly shared high-quality liver vessel dataset of 77 cases is thus created. Finally a method to annotate vessel trees according to anatomy is provided, enabling a unique liver vessel morphometry analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Li, Cheng-Long Wang, Yinzhi Cao, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we systematically explore the data privacy issues of dataset pruning in machine learning systems. Our findings reveal, for the first time, that even if data in the redundant set is solely used before model training, its pruning-phase membership status can still be detected through attacks. Since this is a fully upstream process before model training, traditional model output-based privacy inference methods are completely unsuitable. To address this, we introduce a new task called Data-Centric Membership Inference and propose the first ever data-centric privacy inference paradigm named Data Lineage Inference (DaLI). Under this paradigm, four threshold-based attacks are proposed, named WhoDis, CumDis, ArraDis and SpiDis. We show that even without access to downstream models, adversaries can accurately identify the redundant set with only limited prior knowledge. Furthermore, we find that different pruning methods involve varying levels of privacy leakage, and even the same pruning method can present different privacy risks at different pruning fractions. We conducted an in-depth analysis of these phenomena and introduced a metric called the Brimming score to offer guidance for selecting pruning methods with privacy protection in mind.</p>

<p>Abstract: The multimedia content and streaming are a major means of information exchange in the modern era and there is an increasing demand for such services. This coupled with the advancement of future wireless networks B5G/6G and the proliferation of intelligent handheld mobile devices, has facilitated the availability of multimedia content to heterogeneous mobile users. Apart from the conventional video, the 360$^o$ videos have gained popularity with the emerging virtual reality applications. All formats of videos (conventional and 360$^o$) undergo processing, compression, and transmission across dynamic wireless channels with restricted bandwidth to facilitate the streaming services. This causes video impairments, leading to quality degradation and poses challenges in delivering good Quality-of-Experience (QoE) to the viewers. The QoE is a prominent subjective quality measure to assess multimedia services. This requires end-to-end QoE evaluation. Efficient multimedia streaming techniques can improve the service quality while dealing with dynamic network and end-user challenges. A paradigm shift in user-centric multimedia services is envisioned with a focus on Machine Learning (ML) based QoE modeling and streaming strategies. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of the overall and continuous, time varying QoE modeling for the purpose of QoE management in multimedia services. It also examines the recent research on intelligent and adaptive multimedia streaming strategies, with a special emphasis on ML based techniques for video (conventional and 360$^o$) streaming. This paper discusses the overall and continuous QoE modeling to optimize the end-user viewing experience, efficient video streaming with a focus on user-centric strategies, associated datasets for modeling and streaming, along with existing shortcoming and open challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: MRI and CT are essential clinical cross-sectional imaging techniques for diagnosing complex conditions. However, large 3D datasets with annotations for deep learning are scarce. While methods like DINOv2 are encouraging for 2D image analysis, these methods have not been applied to 3D medical images. Furthermore, deep learning models often lack explainability due to their "black-box" nature. This study aims to extend 2D self-supervised models, specifically DINOv2, to 3D medical imaging while evaluating their potential for explainable outcomes. We introduce the Medical Slice Transformer (MST) framework to adapt 2D self-supervised models for 3D medical image analysis. MST combines a Transformer architecture with a 2D feature extractor, i.e., DINOv2. We evaluate its diagnostic performance against a 3D convolutional neural network (3D ResNet) across three clinical datasets: breast MRI (651 patients), chest CT (722 patients), and knee MRI (1199 patients). Both methods were tested for diagnosing breast cancer, predicting lung nodule dignity, and detecting meniscus tears. Diagnostic performance was assessed by calculating the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). Explainability was evaluated through a radiologist's qualitative comparison of saliency maps based on slice and lesion correctness. P-values were calculated using Delong's test. MST achieved higher AUC values compared to ResNet across all three datasets: breast (0.94$\pm$0.01 vs. 0.91$\pm$0.02, P=0.02), chest (0.95$\pm$0.01 vs. 0.92$\pm$0.02, P=0.13), and knee (0.85$\pm$0.04 vs. 0.69$\pm$0.05, P=0.001). Saliency maps were consistently more precise and anatomically correct for MST than for ResNet. Self-supervised 2D models like DINOv2 can be effectively adapted for 3D medical imaging using MST, offering enhanced diagnostic accuracy and explainability compared to convolutional neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Singh, Rajdeep Aher, Shivank Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, creating an increased need for efficient, task-specific fine-tuning methods. Traditional fine-tuning of LLMs involves updating a large number of parameters, which is computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning by reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, while LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters, LoRA modules still create significant storage challenges. We propose LoRA-Mini, an optimized adaptation of LoRA that improves parameter efficiency by splitting low-rank matrices into four parts, with only the two inner matrices being trainable. This approach achieves upto a 20x reduction compared to standard LoRA in the number of trainable parameters while preserving performance levels comparable to standard LoRA, addressing both computational and storage efficiency in LLM fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruv Patel, Ankita Kumari Jain, Haikoo Khandor, Xhitij Choudhary, Nipun Batra</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) focuses on disaggregating total household power consumption into appliance-specific usage. Many advanced NILM methods are based on neural networks that typically require substantial amounts of labeled appliance data, which can be challenging and costly to collect in real-world settings. We hypothesize that appliance data from all households does not uniformly contribute to NILM model improvements. Thus, we propose an active learning approach to selectively install appliance monitors in a limited number of houses. This work is the first to benchmark the use of active learning for strategically selecting appliance-level data to optimize NILM performance. We first develop uncertainty-aware neural networks for NILM and then install sensors in homes where disaggregation uncertainty is highest. Benchmarking our method on the publicly available Pecan Street Dataport dataset, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms a standard random baseline and achieves performance comparable to models trained on the entire dataset. Using this approach, we achieve comparable NILM accuracy with approximately 30% of the data, and for a fixed number of sensors, we observe up to a 2x reduction in disaggregation errors compared to random sampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiron Thalagala, Pak Kin Wong, Xiaozheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of continuous control, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) demonstrates promising results. However, the dependence of DRL on deep neural networks (DNNs) results in the demand for extensive data and increased computational complexity. To address this issue, a novel hybrid architecture for actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms is introduced. The proposed architecture integrates the broad learning system (BLS) with DNN, aiming to merge the strengths of both distinct architectural paradigms. Specifically, the critic network is implemented using BLS, while the actor network is constructed with a DNN. For the estimations of the critic network parameters, ridge regression is employed, and the parameters of the actor network are optimized through gradient descent. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by applying it to two classic continuous control tasks, and its performance is compared with the widely recognized deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the DDPG algorithm in terms of computational efficiency, along with an accelerated learning trajectory. Application of the proposed algorithm in other actor-critic RL algorithms is suggested for investigation in future studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pan Liao, Feng Yang, Di Wu, Jinwen Yu, Wenhui Zhao, Bo Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have captured the attention of many researchers in recent years. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds due to their structure or other issues. To address this problem, we revisited the Joint Detection and Tracking (JDT) method by looking back at past approaches. By integrating the original JDT approach with some advanced theories, this paper employs an efficient method of information transfer between frames on the DETR, constructing a fast and novel JDT-type MOT framework: FastTrackTr. Thanks to the superiority of this information transfer method, our approach not only reduces the number of queries required during tracking but also avoids the excessive introduction of network structures, ensuring model simplicity. Experimental results indicate that our method has the potential to achieve real-time tracking and exhibits competitive tracking accuracy across multiple datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Sajith, Krishna Chaitanya Rao Kathala</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the relative impact of training data quality versus quantity on the performance of small language models (SLMs), utilizing the TinyStories dataset for empirical analysis. Analysis of dataset variations with respect to size (25% and 50% of the original size) and duplication (controlled rates of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) were performed. Model performance was evaluated based on the validation loss, accuracy, and perplexity metrics. Results indicate training data quality plays a more significant role in the overall performance of SLMs, especially given scale of this experiment. Minimal duplication positively impacted model accuracy (+0.87% increase in accuracy at 25% duplication) without significantly increasing perplexity (+0.52% increase going from 0% to 25% duplication) but excessive duplication led to pronounced performance degradation (-40% drop in accuracy at 100% duplication). The implications of this exploration extend beyond just model performance; training large-scale models imposes significant financial and computational burdens, which can be prohibitive for organizations, individuals, and the public at large, especially in developing countries. Additionally, the energy consumption associated with large-scale training raises environmental concerns. Understanding the relative importance of data quality versus quantity could democratize AI technology, making advanced models more accessible and sustainable for all.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivia Ma, Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach, Dmitrii Usynin</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks introduces privacy risks, as models may inadvertently memorise and leak sensitive training data. While Differential Privacy (DP) offers a solution to mitigate these risks, it introduces significant computational and performance trade-offs, particularly with standard fine-tuning approaches. Previous work has primarily focused on full-parameter updates, which are computationally intensive and may not fully leverage DPs potential in large models. In this work, we address these shortcomings by investigating Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods under DP constraints. We show that PEFT methods achieve comparable performance to standard fine-tuning while requiring fewer parameters and significantly reducing privacy leakage. Furthermore, we incorporate a data poisoning experiment involving intentional mislabelling to assess model memorisation and directly measure privacy risks. Our findings indicate that PEFT methods not only provide a promising alternative but also serve as a complementary approach for privacy-preserving, resource-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Wang, Zhongyi Han, Xingbo Liu, Xin Gao, Yilong Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: In domain adaptation, there are two popular paradigms: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), which aligns distributions using source data, and Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), which leverages pre-trained source models without accessing source data. Evaluating the superiority of UDA versus SFDA is an open and timely question with significant implications for deploying adaptive algorithms in practical applications. In this study, we demonstrate through predictive coding theory and extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets that SFDA generally outperforms UDA in real-world scenarios. Specifically, SFDA offers advantages in time efficiency, storage requirements, targeted learning objectives, reduced risk of negative transfer, and increased robustness against overfitting. Notably, SFDA is particularly effective in mitigating negative transfer when there are substantial distribution discrepancies between source and target domains. Additionally, we introduce a novel data-model fusion scenario, where data sharing among stakeholders varies (e.g., some provide raw data while others provide only models), and reveal that traditional UDA and SFDA methods do not fully exploit their potential in this context. To address this limitation and capitalize on the strengths of SFDA, we propose a novel weight estimation method that effectively integrates available source data into multi-SFDA (MSFDA) approaches, thereby enhancing model performance within this scenario. This work provides a thorough analysis of UDA versus SFDA and advances a practical approach to model adaptation across diverse real-world environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijiong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: It has been well-known that Chain-of-Thought can remarkably enhance LLMs' performance on complex tasks. However, because it also introduces slower inference speeds and higher computational costs, many researches have attempted to use implicit CoT, which does not need LLMs to explicitly generate the intermediate steps. But there is still gap between their efficacy and typical explicit CoT methods. This leaves us a doubt that, does implicit CoT really equal to explicit CoT? Therefore, in this study, we address this question through experiments. We probe the information of intermediate steps from the model's hidden states when it is performing implicit CoT. The results surprisingly indicate that LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning. Moreover, we find LLMs' implicit reasoning capabilities are susceptible and unstable, reaffirming the necessity of explicit CoT to effectively support complex tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengxin Wang, Gary Tan, Swagato Barman Roy, Beng Chin Ooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban spatio-temporal (ST) forecasting is crucial for various urban applications such as intelligent scheduling and trip planning. Previous studies focus on modeling ST correlations among urban locations in offline settings, which often neglect the non-stationary nature of urban ST data, particularly, distribution shifts over time. This oversight can lead to degraded performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we first analyze the distribution shifts in urban ST data, and then introduce DOST, a novel online continual learning framework tailored for ST data characteristics. DOST employs an adaptive ST network equipped with a variable-independent adapter to address the unique distribution shifts at each urban location dynamically. Further, to accommodate the gradual nature of these shifts, we also develop an awake-hibernate learning strategy that intermittently fine-tunes the adapter during the online phase to reduce computational overhead. This strategy integrates a streaming memory update mechanism designed for urban ST sequential data, enabling effective network adaptation to new patterns while preventing catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results confirm DOST's superiority over state-of-the-art models on four real-world datasets, providing online forecasts within an average of 0.1 seconds and achieving a 12.89% reduction in forecast errors compared to baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Huang, Yingfan Wang, Cynthia Rudin</p>
<p>Abstract: Parametric dimensionality reduction methods have gained prominence for their ability to generalize to unseen datasets, an advantage that traditional approaches typically lack. Despite their growing popularity, there remains a prevalent misconception among practitioners about the equivalence in performance between parametric and non-parametric methods. Here, we show that these methods are not equivalent -- parametric methods retain global structure but lose significant local details. To explain this, we provide evidence that parameterized approaches lack the ability to repulse negative pairs, and the choice of loss function also has an impact. Addressing these issues, we developed a new parametric method, ParamRepulsor, that incorporates Hard Negative Mining and a loss function that applies a strong repulsive force. This new method achieves state-of-the-art performance on local structure preservation for parametric methods without sacrificing the fidelity of global structural representation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> C. Xiao, W. An, Y. Zhang, Z. Su, M. Li, W. Sheng, M. Pietik\"ainen, L. Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Moving object detection in satellite videos (SVMOD) is a challenging task due to the extremely dim and small target characteristics. Current learning-based methods extract spatio-temporal information from multi-frame dense representation with labor-intensive manual labels to tackle SVMOD, which needs high annotation costs and contains tremendous computational redundancy due to the severe imbalance between foreground and background regions. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient unsupervised framework for SVMOD. Specifically, we propose a generic unsupervised framework for SVMOD, in which pseudo labels generated by a traditional method can evolve with the training process to promote detection performance. Furthermore, we propose a highly efficient and effective sparse convolutional anchor-free detection network by sampling the dense multi-frame image form into a sparse spatio-temporal point cloud representation and skipping the redundant computation on background regions. Coping these two designs, we can achieve both high efficiency (label and computation efficiency) and effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can not only process 98.8 frames per second on 1024x1024 images but also achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<p>Abstract: Humans naturally perform bimanual skills to handle large and heavy objects. To enhance robots' object manipulation capabilities, generating effective bimanual grasp poses is essential. Nevertheless, bimanual grasp synthesis for dexterous hand manipulators remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the BimanGrasp algorithm for synthesizing bimanual grasps on 3D objects. The BimanGrasp algorithm generates grasp poses by optimizing an energy function that considers grasp stability and feasibility. Furthermore, the synthesized grasps are verified using the Isaac Gym physics simulation engine. These verified grasp poses form the BimanGrasp-Dataset, the first large-scale synthesized bimanual dexterous hand grasp pose dataset to our knowledge. The dataset comprises over 150k verified grasps on 900 objects, facilitating the synthesis of bimanual grasps through a data-driven approach. Last, we propose BimanGrasp-DDPM, a diffusion model trained on the BimanGrasp-Dataset. This model achieved a grasp synthesis success rate of 69.87\% and significant acceleration in computational speed compared to BimanGrasp algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of multi-temporal satellite imagery for better functional field boundary delineation using deep learning semantic segmentation architecture on two distinct geographical and multi-scale farming systems of Netherlands and Pakistan. Multidate images of April, August and October 2022 were acquired for PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 in sub regions of Netherlands and November 2022, February and March 2023 for selected area of Dunyapur in Pakistan. For Netherlands, Basic registration crop parcels (BRP) vector layer was used as labeled training data. while self-crafted field boundary vector data were utilized for Pakistan. Four deep learning models with UNET architecture were evaluated using different combinations of multi-date images and NDVI stacks in the Netherlands subregions. A comparative analysis of IoU scores assessed the effectiveness of the proposed multi-date NDVI stack approach. These findings were then applied for transfer learning, using pre-trained models from the Netherlands on the selected area in Pakistan. Additionally, separate models were trained using self-crafted field boundary data for Pakistan, and combined models were developed using data from both the Netherlands and Pakistan. Results indicate that multi-date NDVI stacks provide additional temporal context, reflecting crop growth over different times of the season. The study underscores the critical role of multi-scale ground information from diverse geographical areas in developing robust and universally applicable models for field boundary delineation. The results also highlight the importance of fine spatial resolution for extraction of field boundaries in regions with small scale framing. The findings can be extended to multi-scale implementations for improved automatic field boundary delineation in heterogeneous agricultural environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simply by rearranging the regions of an image, we can create a new image of any subject matter. The definition of regions is user definable, ranging from regularly and irregularly-shaped blocks, concentric rings, or even individual pixels. Our method extends and improves recent work in the generation of optical illusions by simultaneously learning not only the content of the images, but also the parameterized transformations required to transform the desired images into each other. By learning the image transforms, we allow any source image to be pre-specified; any existing image (e.g. the Mona Lisa) can be transformed to a novel subject. We formulate this process as a constrained optimization problem and address it through interleaving the steps of image diffusion with an energy minimization step. Unlike previous methods, increasing the number of regions actually makes the problem easier and improves results. We demonstrate our approach in both pixel and latent spaces. Creative extensions, such as using infinite copies of the source image and employing multiple source images, are also given.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompts used in recent large language model based applications are often fixed and lengthy, leading to significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Generative Context Distillation (GCD), a lightweight prompt internalization method that employs a joint training approach. This method not only replicates the behavior of models with prompt inputs but also generates the content of the prompt along with reasons for why the model's behavior should change accordingly. We demonstrate that our approach effectively internalizes complex prompts across various agent-based application scenarios. For effective training without interactions with the dedicated environments, we introduce a data synthesis technique that autonomously collects conversational datasets by swapping the roles of the agent and environment. This method is especially useful in scenarios where only a predefined prompt is available without a corresponding training dataset. By internalizing complex prompts, Generative Context Distillation enables high-performance and efficient inference without the need for explicit prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joar Skalse, Alessandro Abate</p>
<p>Abstract: The aim of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is to infer a reward function $R$ from a policy $\pi$. This problem is difficult, for several reasons. First of all, there are typically multiple reward functions which are compatible with a given policy; this means that the reward function is only *partially identifiable*, and that IRL contains a certain fundamental degree of ambiguity. Secondly, in order to infer $R$ from $\pi$, an IRL algorithm must have a *behavioural model* of how $\pi$ relates to $R$. However, the true relationship between human preferences and human behaviour is very complex, and practically impossible to fully capture with a simple model. This means that the behavioural model in practice will be *misspecified*, which raises the worry that it might lead to unsound inferences if applied to real-world data. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis of partial identifiability and misspecification in IRL. Specifically, we fully characterise and quantify the ambiguity of the reward function for all of the behavioural models that are most common in the current IRL literature. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions that describe precisely how the observed demonstrator policy may differ from each of the standard behavioural models before that model leads to faulty inferences about the reward function $R$. In addition to this, we introduce a cohesive framework for reasoning about partial identifiability and misspecification in IRL, together with several formal tools that can be used to easily derive the partial identifiability and misspecification robustness of new IRL models, or analyse other kinds of reward learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqiang Xiao, Songning Lai, Yijun Yang, Jiemin Wu, Yutao Yue, Lei Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to new domains without labeled data, especially when source data is inaccessible, is a critical challenge in applications like medical imaging, autonomous driving, and remote sensing. This task, known as Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA), involves adapting a pre-trained model to a target domain using only unlabeled target data, which can lead to issues such as overfitting, underfitting, and poor generalization due to domain discrepancies and noise. Existing SFUDA methods often rely on single-model architectures, struggling with uncertainty and variability in the target domain. To address these challenges, we propose DRIVE (Dual-Robustness through Information Variability and Entropy), a novel SFUDA framework leveraging a dual-model architecture. The two models, initialized with identical weights, work in parallel to capture diverse target domain characteristics. One model is exposed to perturbations via projection gradient descent (PGD) guided by mutual information, focusing on high-uncertainty regions. We also introduce an entropy-aware pseudo-labeling strategy that adjusts label weights based on prediction uncertainty, ensuring the model focuses on reliable data while avoiding noisy regions. The adaptation process has two stages: the first aligns the models on stable features using a mutual information consistency loss, and the second dynamically adjusts the perturbation level based on the loss from the first stage, encouraging the model to explore a broader range of the target domain while preserving existing performance. This enhances generalization capabilities and robustness against interference. Evaluations on standard SFUDA benchmarks show that DRIVE consistently outperforms previous methods, delivering improved adaptation accuracy and stability across complex target domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Fang, Man Shi, Robin Geens, Arne Symons, Zhongfeng Wang, Marian Verhelst</p>
<p>Abstract: The widely-used, weight-only quantized large language models (LLMs), which leverage low-bit integer (INT) weights and retain floating-point (FP) activations, reduce storage requirements while maintaining accuracy. However, this shifts the energy and latency bottlenecks towards the FP activations that are associated with costly memory accesses and computations. Existing LLM accelerators focus primarily on computation optimizations, overlooking the potential of jointly optimizing FP computations and data movement, particularly for the dominant FP-INT GeMM operations in LLM inference.
  To address these challenges, we investigate the sensitivity of activation precision across various LLM modules and its impact on overall model accuracy. Based on our findings, we first propose the Anda data type: an adaptive data format with group-shared exponent bits and dynamic mantissa bit allocation. Secondly, we develop an iterative post-training adaptive precision search algorithm that optimizes the bit-width for different LLM modules to balance model accuracy, energy efficiency, and inference speed. Lastly, a suite of hardware optimization techniques is proposed to maximally exploit the benefits of the Anda format. These include a bit-plane-based data organization scheme, Anda-enhanced processing units with bit-serial computation, and a runtime bit-plane Anda compressor to simultaneously optimize storage, computation, and memory footprints. Our evaluations on FPINT GeMM operations show that Anda achieves a 2.4x speedup, 4.0x area efficiency, and 3.1x energy efficiency improvement on average for popular LLMs including OPT, LLaMA, and LLaMA-2 series over the GPU-like FP-FP baseline. Anda demonstrates strong adaptability across various application scenarios, accuracy requirements, and system performance, enabling efficient LLM inference across a wide range of deployment scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: In a multi-tenant large language model (LLM) serving platform hosting diverse applications, some users may submit an excessive number of requests, causing the service to become unavailable to other users and creating unfairness. Existing fairness approaches do not account for variations in token lengths across applications and multiple LLM calls, making them unsuitable for such platforms. To address the fairness challenge, this paper analyzes millions of requests from thousands of users on MS CoPilot, a real-world multi-tenant LLM platform hosted by Microsoft. Our analysis confirms the inadequacy of existing methods and guides the development of FairServe, a system that ensures fair LLM access across diverse applications. FairServe proposes application-characteristic aware request throttling coupled with a weighted service counter based scheduling technique to curb abusive behavior and ensure fairness. Our experimental results on real-world traces demonstrate FairServe's superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method in ensuring fairness. We are actively working on deploying our system in production, expecting to benefit millions of customers world-wide.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengwen Ding, Chenhui Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) herald a transformative era in artificial intelligence (AI). However, the expansive scale of data and parameters of LLMs requires high-demand computational and memory resources, restricting their accessibility to a broader range of users and researchers. This paper introduces an effective approach that enhances the operational efficiency and affordability of LLM inference. By utilizing transformer-based federated learning (FL) with model-parallel distributed training, our model efficiently distributes the computational loads and memory requirements across a network of participants. This strategy permits users, especially those with limited resources to train state-of-the-art LLMs collaboratively. We also innovate an incentive mechanism within the FL framework, rewarding constructive contributions and filtering out malicious activities, thereby safeguarding the integrity and reliability of the training process. Concurrently, we leverage memory hierarchy strategies and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on weight matrices to boost computational and memory efficiencies further. Our results, derived from formulaic analyses and numerical calculations, demonstrate significant optimization of resource use and democratize access to cutting-edge LLMs, ensuring that a wide scale of users can both contribute to and benefit from these advanced models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohanad Odema, Luke Chen, Hyoukjun Kwon, Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the application of emerging chiplet-based Neural Processing Units to accelerate vehicular AI perception workloads in constrained automotive settings. The motivation stems from how chiplets technology is becoming integral to emerging vehicular architectures, providing a cost-effective trade-off between performance, modularity, and customization; and from perception models being the most computationally demanding workloads in a autonomous driving system. Using the Tesla Autopilot perception pipeline as a case study, we first breakdown its constituent models and profile their performance on different chiplet accelerators. From the insights, we propose a novel scheduling strategy to efficiently deploy perception workloads on multi-chip AI accelerators. Our experiments using a standard DNN performance simulator, MAESTRO, show our approach realizes 82% and 2.8x increase in throughput and processing engines utilization compared to monolithic accelerator designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Miao, Georgios Fainekos, Bardh Hoxha, Hideki Okamoto, Danil Prokhorov, Sayan Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Testing Automated Driving Systems (ADS) in simulation with realistic driving scenarios is important for verifying their performance. However, converting real-world driving videos into simulation scenarios is a significant challenge due to the complexity of interpreting high-dimensional video data and the time-consuming nature of precise manual scenario reconstruction. In this work, we propose a novel framework that automates the conversion of real-world car crash videos into detailed simulation scenarios for ADS testing. Our approach leverages prompt-engineered Video Language Models(VLM) to transform dashcam footage into SCENIC scripts, which define the environment and driving behaviors in the CARLA simulator, enabling the generation of realistic simulation scenarios. Importantly, rather than solely aiming for one-to-one scenario reconstruction, our framework focuses on capturing the essential driving behaviors from the original video while offering flexibility in parameters such as weather or road conditions to facilitate search-based testing. Additionally, we introduce a similarity metric that helps iteratively refine the generated scenario through feedback by comparing key features of driving behaviors between the real and simulated videos. Our preliminary results demonstrate substantial time efficiency, finishing the real-to-sim conversion in minutes with full automation and no human intervention, while maintaining high fidelity to the original driving events.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangzhao Dai, Jian Zhao, Yuantao Chen, Yusen Qin, Hao Zhao, Guosen Xie, Yazhou Yao, Xiangbo Shu, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), where an agent follows instructions to reach a target destination, has recently seen significant advancements. In contrast to navigation in discrete environments with predefined trajectories, VLN in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents greater challenges, as the agent is free to navigate any unobstructed location and is more vulnerable to visual occlusions or blind spots. Recent approaches have attempted to address this by imagining future environments, either through predicted future visual images or semantic features, rather than relying solely on current observations. However, these RGB-based and feature-based methods lack intuitive appearance-level information or high-level semantic complexity crucial for effective navigation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable 3DGS-based pre-training paradigm, called UnitedVLN, which enables agents to better explore future environments by unitedly rendering high-fidelity 360 visual images and semantic features. UnitedVLN employs two key schemes: search-then-query sampling and separate-then-united rendering, which facilitate efficient exploitation of neural primitives, helping to integrate both appearance and semantic information for more robust navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnitedVLN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on existing VLN-CE benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haeyong Kang, Chang D. Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by Well-initialized Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (WLTH), which provides suboptimal fine-tuning solutions, we propose a novel fully fine-tuned continual learning (CL) method referred to as Soft-TransFormers (Soft-TF). Soft-TF sequentially learns and selects an optimal soft-network or subnetwork for each task. During sequential training in CL, Soft-TF jointly optimizes the weights of sparse layers to obtain task-adaptive soft (real-valued) networks or subnetworks (binary masks), while keeping the well-pre-trained layer parameters frozen. In inference, the identified task-adaptive network of Soft-TF masks the parameters of the pre-trained network, mapping to an optimal solution for each task and minimizing Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) - the soft-masking preserves the knowledge of the pre-trained network. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformer (ViT) and CLIP demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft-TF, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various CL scenarios, including Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) and Task-Incremental Learning (TIL), supported by convergence theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shogo Ohmae, Keiko Ohmae</p>
<p>Abstract: AI's significant recent advances using general-purpose circuit computations offer a potential window into how the neocortex and cerebellum of the brain are able to achieve a diverse range of functions across sensory, cognitive, and motor domains, despite their uniform circuit structures. However, comparing the brain and AI is challenging unless clear similarities exist, and past reviews have been limited to comparison of brain-inspired vision AI and the visual neocortex. Here, to enable comparisons across diverse functional domains, we subdivide circuit computation into three elements -- circuit structure, input/outputs, and the learning algorithm -- and evaluate the similarities for each element. With this novel approach, we identify wide-ranging similarities and convergent evolution in the brain and AI, providing new insights into key concepts in neuroscience. Furthermore, inspired by processing mechanisms of AI, we propose a new theory that integrates established neuroscience theories, particularly the theories of internal models and the mirror neuron system. Both the neocortex and cerebellum predict future world events from past information and learn from prediction errors, thereby acquiring models of the world. These models enable three core processes: (1) Prediction -- generating future information, (2) Understanding -- interpreting the external world via compressed and abstracted sensory information, and (3) Generation -- repurposing the future-information generation mechanism to produce other types of outputs. The universal application of these processes underlies the ability of the neocortex and cerebellum to accomplish diverse functions with uniform circuits. Our systematic approach, insights, and theory promise groundbreaking advances in understanding the brain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donggeun Ko, Dongjun Lee, Namjun Park, Wonkyeong Shim, Jaekwang Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks struggle with image classification when biases are learned and misleads correlations, affecting their generalization and performance. Previous methods require attribute labels (e.g. background, color) or utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to mitigate biases. We introduce DiffuBias, a novel pipeline for text-to-image generation that enhances classifier robustness by generating bias-conflict samples, without requiring training during the generation phase. Utilizing pretrained diffusion and image captioning models, DiffuBias generates images that challenge the biases of classifiers, using the top-$K$ losses from a biased classifier ($f_B$) to create more representative data samples. This method not only debiases effectively but also boosts classifier generalization capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, DiffuBias is the first approach leveraging a stable diffusion model to generate bias-conflict samples in debiasing tasks. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that DiffuBias achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. We also conduct a comparative analysis of various generative models in terms of carbon emissions and energy consumption to highlight the significance of computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitong Wang, Xudong Xu, Li Ma, Haoran Wang, Bo Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic 3D content creation has gained increasing attention recently, due to its potential in various applications such as video games, film industry, and AR/VR. Recent advancements in diffusion models and multimodal models have notably improved the quality and efficiency of 3D object generation given a single RGB image. However, 3D objects generated even by state-of-the-art methods are still unsatisfactory compared to human-created assets. Considering only textures instead of materials makes these methods encounter challenges in photo-realistic rendering, relighting, and flexible appearance editing. And they also suffer from severe misalignment between geometry and high-frequency texture details. In this work, we propose a novel approach to boost the quality of generated 3D objects from the perspective of Physics-Based Rendering (PBR) materials. By analyzing the components of PBR materials, we choose to consider albedo, roughness, metalness, and bump maps. For albedo and bump maps, we leverage Stable Diffusion fine-tuned on synthetic data to extract these values, with novel usages of these fine-tuned models to obtain 3D consistent albedo UV and bump UV for generated objects. In terms of roughness and metalness maps, we adopt a semi-automatic process to provide room for interactive adjustment, which we believe is more practical. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model is generally beneficial for various state-of-the-art generation methods, significantly boosting the quality and realism of their generated 3D objects, with natural relighting effects and substantially improved geometry.</p>

In this work, we propose a \textbf{single-line modification in Pytorch} to any momentum-based optimizer, which we rename Cautious Optimizer, e.g. C-AdamW and C-Lion.

In addition, a whole new family of optimizers is revealed by our theoretical insight. Among them, we pick the simplest one for empirical experiments, showing speed-up on Llama and MAE pretraining up to $1.47\times$. Code is available at https://github.com/kyleliang919/C-Optim</p>

<p>Abstract: Edge inference techniques partition and distribute Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference tasks among multiple edge nodes for low latency inference, without considering the core-level heterogeneity of edge nodes. Further, default DNN inference frameworks also do not fully utilize the resources of heterogeneous edge nodes, resulting in higher inference latency. In this work, we propose a hierarchical DNN partitioning strategy (HiDP) for distributed inference on heterogeneous edge nodes. Our strategy hierarchically partitions DNN workloads at both global and local levels by considering the core-level heterogeneity of edge nodes. We evaluated our proposed HiDP strategy against relevant distributed inference techniques over widely used DNN models on commercial edge devices. On average our strategy achieved 38% lower latency, 46% lower energy, and 56% higher throughput in comparison with other relevant approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal search has revolutionized the fashion industry, providing a seamless and intuitive way for users to discover and explore fashion items. Based on their preferences, style, or specific attributes, users can search for products by combining text and image information. Text-to-image searches enable users to find visually similar items or describe products using natural language. This paper presents an innovative approach called ENCLIP, for enhancing the performance of the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, specifically in Multimodal Search targeted towards the domain of fashion intelligence. This method focuses on addressing the challenges posed by limited data availability and low-quality images. This paper proposes an algorithm that involves training and ensembling multiple instances of the CLIP model, and leveraging clustering techniques to group similar images together. The experimental findings presented in this study provide evidence of the effectiveness of the methodology. This approach unlocks the potential of CLIP in the domain of fashion intelligence, where data scarcity and image quality issues are prevalent. Overall, the ENCLIP method represents a valuable contribution to the field of fashion intelligence and provides a practical solution for optimizing the CLIP model in scenarios with limited data and low-quality images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiheng Zhou, Ming Hu, Xingrun Quan, Yawen Peng, Xiaofei Xie, Yanxin Yang, Chengwei Liu, Yueming Wu, Mingsong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Deep Learning (DL) methods becoming increasingly popular in vulnerability detection, their performance is seriously limited by insufficient training data. This is mainly because few existing software organizations can maintain a complete set of high-quality samples for DL-based vulnerability detection. Due to the concerns about privacy leakage, most of them are reluctant to share data, resulting in the data silo problem. Since enables collaboratively model training without data sharing, Federated Learning (FL) has been investigated as a promising means of addressing the data silo problem in DL-based vulnerability detection. However, since existing FL-based vulnerability detection methods focus on specific applications, it is still far unclear i) how well FL adapts to common vulnerability detection tasks and ii) how to design a high-performance FL solution for a specific vulnerability detection task. To answer these two questions, this paper first proposes VulFL, an effective evaluation framework for FL-based vulnerability detection. Then, based on VulFL, this paper conducts a comprehensive study to reveal the underlying capabilities of FL in dealing with different types of CWEs, especially when facing various data heterogeneity scenarios. Our experimental results show that, compared to independent training, FL can significantly improve the detection performance of common AI models on all investigated CWEs, though the performance of FL-based vulnerability detection is limited by heterogeneous data. To highlight the performance differences between different FL solutions for vulnerability detection, we extensively investigate the impacts of different configuration strategies for each framework component of VulFL. Our study sheds light on the potential of FL in vulnerability detection, which can be used to guide the design of FL-based solutions for vulnerability detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jatin Nainani, Sankaran Vaidyanathan, AJ Yeung, Kartik Gupta, David Jensen</p>
<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the inner workings of large neural networks by identifying circuits, or minimal subgraphs within the model that implement algorithms responsible for performing specific tasks. These circuits are typically discovered and analyzed using a narrowly defined prompt format. However, given the abilities of large language models (LLMs) to generalize across various prompt formats for the same task, it remains unclear how well these circuits generalize. For instance, it is unclear whether the models generalization results from reusing the same circuit components, the components behaving differently, or the use of entirely different components. In this paper, we investigate the generality of the indirect object identification (IOI) circuit in GPT-2 small, which is well-studied and believed to implement a simple, interpretable algorithm. We evaluate its performance on prompt variants that challenge the assumptions of this algorithm. Our findings reveal that the circuit generalizes surprisingly well, reusing all of its components and mechanisms while only adding additional input edges. Notably, the circuit generalizes even to prompt variants where the original algorithm should fail; we discover a mechanism that explains this which we term S2 Hacking. Our findings indicate that circuits within LLMs may be more flexible and general than previously recognized, underscoring the importance of studying circuit generalization to better understand the broader capabilities of these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasudev Gohil, Matthew DeLorenzo, Veera Vishwa Achuta Sai Venkat Nallam, Joey See, Jeyavijayan Rajendran</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the ability to effectively analyze and generate code nearly instantaneously, resulting in their widespread adoption in software development. Following this advancement, researchers and companies have begun integrating LLMs across the hardware design and verification process. However, these highly potent LLMs can also induce new attack scenarios upon security vulnerabilities across the hardware development process. One such attack vector that has not been explored is intellectual property (IP) piracy. Given that this attack can manifest as rewriting hardware designs to evade piracy detection, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate LLM capabilities in performing this task and assess the mitigation abilities of current IP piracy detection tools.
  Therefore, in this work, we propose LLMPirate, the first LLM-based technique able to generate pirated variations of circuit designs that successfully evade detection across multiple state-of-the-art piracy detection tools. We devise three solutions to overcome challenges related to integration of LLMs for hardware circuit designs, scalability to large circuits, and effectiveness, resulting in an end-to-end automated, efficient, and practical formulation. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of LLMPirate using eight LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities and assess their performance in pirating various circuit designs against four state-of-the-art, widely-used piracy detection tools. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMPirate is able to consistently evade detection on 100% of tested circuits across every detection tool. Additionally, we showcase the ramifications of LLMPirate using case studies on IBEX and MOR1KX processors and a GPS module, that we successfully pirate. We envision that our work motivates and fosters the development of better IP piracy detection tools.</p>

Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we highlight how LLMs, as-is, are still inadequate to support intelligence analysts and offer recommendations to improve LLMs for such intricate reasoning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangyul Yoon, Doohyuk Jang, Jungeun Kim, Eunho Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging pre-trained models with tailored prompts for in-context learning has proven highly effective in NLP tasks. Building on this success, recent studies have applied a similar approach to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) within a ``one-shot" framework, where only a single reference image and its label are employed. However, these methods face limitations in the medical domain, primarily due to SAM's essential requirement for visual prompts and the over-reliance on pixel similarity for generating them. This dependency may lead to (1) inaccurate prompt generation and (2) clustering of point prompts, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{Med-PerSAM}, a novel and straightforward one-shot framework designed for the medical domain. Med-PerSAM uses only visual prompt engineering and eliminates the need for additional training of the pretrained SAM or human intervention, owing to our novel automated prompt generation process. By integrating our lightweight warping-based prompt tuning model with SAM, we enable the extraction and iterative refinement of visual prompts, enhancing the performance of the pre-trained SAM. This advancement is particularly meaningful in the medical domain, where creating visual prompts poses notable challenges for individuals lacking medical expertise. Our model outperforms various foundational models and previous SAM-based approaches across diverse 2D medical imaging datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation rely on the availability of extensive, accurately annotated datasets. In this work, We present CIA, a modular pipeline, for (1) generating synthetic images for dataset augmentation using Stable Diffusion, (2) filtering out low quality samples using defined quality metrics, (3) forcing the existence of specific patterns in generated images using accurate prompting and ControlNet. In order to show how CIA can be used to search for an optimal augmentation pipeline of training data, we study human object detection in a data constrained scenario, using YOLOv8n on COCO and Flickr30k datasets. We have recorded significant improvement using CIA-generated images, approaching the performances obtained when doubling the amount of real images in the dataset. Our findings suggest that our modular framework can significantly enhance object detection systems, and make it possible for future research to be done on data-constrained scenarios. The framework is available at: github.com/multitel-ai/CIA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngjun Sim, Jinsung Yoon, Young-Joo Suh</p>
<p>Abstract: One-shot voice conversion (VC) is a method that enables the transformation between any two speakers using only a single target speaker utterance. Existing methods often rely on complex architectures and pre-trained speaker verification (SV) models to improve the fidelity of converted speech. Recent works utilizing K-means quantization (KQ) with self-supervised learning (SSL) features have proven capable of capturing content information from speech. However, they often struggle to preserve speaking variation, such as prosodic detail and phonetic variation, particularly with smaller codebooks. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective one-shot VC model that utilizes the characteristics of SSL features and speech attributes. Our approach addresses the issue of losing speaking variation, enabling high-fidelity voice conversion trained with only reconstruction losses, without requiring external speaker embeddings. We demonstrate the performance of our model across 6 evaluation metrics, with results highlighting the benefits of the speaking variation compensation method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toyotaro Suzumura, Hiroki Kanezashi, Shotaro Akahori</p>
<p>Abstract: In diagnosing mental diseases from electroencephalography (EEG) data, neural network models such as Transformers have been employed to capture temporal dynamics. Additionally, it is crucial to learn the spatial relationships between EEG sensors, for which Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are commonly used. However, fine-tuning large-scale complex neural network models simultaneously to capture both temporal and spatial features increases computational costs due to the more significant number of trainable parameters. It causes the limited availability of EEG datasets for downstream tasks, making it challenging to fine-tune large models effectively. We propose EEG-GraphAdapter (EGA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach to address these challenges. EGA is integrated into pre-trained temporal backbone models as a GNN-based module and fine-tuned itself alone while keeping the backbone model parameters frozen. This enables the acquisition of spatial representations of EEG signals for downstream tasks, significantly reducing computational overhead and data requirements. Experimental evaluations on healthcare-related downstream tasks of Major Depressive Disorder and Abnormality Detection demonstrate that our EGA improves performance by up to 16.1% in the F1-score compared with the backbone BENDR model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhang, Mingzi Wang, Lancheng Zou, Wulong Liu, Hui-Ling Zhen, Mingxuan Yuan, Bei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success as model sizes continue to grow, yet their deployment remains challenging due to significant computational and memory demands. Quantization has emerged as a promising solution, and state-of-the-art quantization algorithms for LLMs introduce the need for mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM), where lower-precision weights are multiplied with higher-precision activations. Despite its benefits, current hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs lack native support for efficient mpGEMM, leading to inefficient dequantization operations in the main sequential loop. To address this limitation, we introduce MixPE, a specialized mixed-precision processing element designed for efficient low-bit quantization in LLM inference. MixPE leverages two key innovations to minimize dequantization overhead and unlock the full potential of low-bit quantization. First, recognizing that scale and zero point are shared within each quantization group, we propose performing dequantization after per-group mpGEMM, significantly reducing dequantization overhead. Second, instead of relying on conventional multipliers, MixPE utilizes efficient shift\&add operations for multiplication, optimizing both computation and energy efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that MixPE surpasses the state-of-the-art quantization accelerators by $2.6\times$ speedup and $1.4\times$ energy reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Yu, Wei Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognition of low-quality face images remains a challenge due to invisible or deformation in partial facial regions. For low-quality images dominated by missing partial facial regions, local region similarity contributes more to face recognition (FR). Conversely, in cases dominated by local face deformation, excessive attention to local regions may lead to misjudgments, while global features exhibit better robustness. However, most of the existing FR methods neglect the bias in feature quality of low-quality images introduced by different factors. To address this issue, we propose a Local and Global Feature Attention Fusion (LGAF) network based on feature quality. The network adaptively allocates attention between local and global features according to feature quality and obtains more discriminative and high-quality face features through local and global information complementarity. In addition, to effectively obtain fine-grained information at various scales and increase the separability of facial features in high-dimensional space, we introduce a Multi-Head Multi-Scale Local Feature Extraction (MHMS) module. Experimental results demonstrate that the LGAF achieves the best average performance on $4$ validation sets (CFP-FP, CPLFW, AgeDB, and CALFW), and the performance on TinyFace and SCFace outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (SoTA).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junho Kim, Hyunjun Kim, Hosu Lee, Yong Man Ro</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advances in Large Multi-modal Models, applying them to long and untrimmed video content remains challenging due to limitations in context length and substantial memory overhead. These constraints often lead to significant information loss and reduced relevance in the model responses. With the exponential growth of video data across web platforms, understanding long-form video is crucial for advancing generalized intelligence. In this paper, we introduce SALOVA: Segment-Augmented LOng Video Assistant, a novel video-LLM framework designed to enhance the comprehension of lengthy video content through targeted retrieval process. We address two main challenges to achieve it: (i) We present the SceneWalk dataset, a high-quality collection of 87.8K long videos, each densely captioned at the segment level to enable models to capture scene continuity and maintain rich descriptive context. (ii) We develop robust architectural designs integrating dynamic routing mechanism and spatio-temporal projector to efficiently retrieve and process relevant video segments based on user queries. Our framework mitigates the limitations of current video-LMMs by allowing for precise identification and retrieval of relevant video segments in response to queries, thereby improving the contextual relevance of the generated responses. Through extensive experiments, SALOVA demonstrates enhanced capability in processing complex long-form videos, showing significant capability to maintain contextual integrity across extended sequences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawei Zhan, Zhaoxi Zeng, Shuoxiao Wei, Ping Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Extending Bayesian optimization to batch evaluation can enable the designer to make the most use of parallel computing technology. Most of current batch approaches use artificial functions to simulate the sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm's behavior to select a batch of points for parallel evaluation. However, as the batch size grows, the accumulated error introduced by these artificial functions increases rapidly, which dramatically decreases the optimization efficiency of the algorithm. In this work, we propose a simple and efficient approach to extend Bayesian optimization to batch evaluation. Different from existing batch approaches, the idea of the new approach is to draw a batch of subspaces of the original problem and select one acquisition point from each subspace. To achieve this, we propose the expected subspace improvement criterion to measure the amount of the improvement that a candidate point can achieve within a certain subspace. By optimizing these expected subspace improvement functions simultaneously, we can get a batch of query points for expensive evaluation. Numerical experiments show that our proposed approach can achieve near-linear speedup when compared with the sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm, and performs very competitively when compared with eight state-of-the-art batch algorithms. This work provides a simple yet efficient approach for batch Bayesian optimization. A Matlab implementation of our approach is available at https://github.com/zhandawei/Expected_Subspace_Improvement_Batch_Bayesian_Optimization</p>

<p>Abstract: Fundus images are widely used for diagnosing various eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration. However, manual analysis of fundus images is time-consuming and prone to errors. In this report, we propose a novel method for fundus detection using object detection and machine learning classification techniques. We use a YOLO_V8 to perform object detection on fundus images and locate the regions of interest (ROIs) such as optic disc, optic cup and lesions. We then use machine learning SVM classification algorithms to classify the ROIs into different DR stages based on the presence or absence of pathological signs such as exudates, microaneurysms, and haemorrhages etc. Our method achieves 84% accuracy and efficiency for fundus detection and can be applied for retinal fundus disease triage, especially in remote areas around the world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaolei Zhang, Kehao Zhang, Qingkai Fang, Shoutao Guo, Yan Zhou, Xiaodong Liu, Yang Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), with their powerful generative capabilities and vast knowledge, empower various tasks in everyday life. However, these abilities are primarily concentrated in high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages with weaker generative capabilities and relatively limited knowledge. Enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs is therefore crucial for serving over 100 linguistic communities worldwide. An intuitive approach to enhance the multilingual capabilities would be to construct instruction data for various languages, but constructing instruction data for over 100 languages is prohibitively costly. In this paper, we introduce BayLing 2, which efficiently transfers generative capabilities and knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages through language alignment. To achieve this, we constructed a dataset of 3.2 million instructions, comprising high-resource language instructions (Chinese and English) and cross-lingual instructions for 100+ languages and performed instruction tuning based on the dataset to facilitate the capability transfer between languages. Using Llama as the foundation model, we developed BayLing-2-7B, BayLing-2-13B, and BayLing-3-8B, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of BayLing. For multilingual translation across 100+ languages, BayLing shows superior performance compared to open-source models of similar scale. For multilingual knowledge and understanding benchmarks, BayLing achieves significant improvements across over 20 low-resource languages, demonstrating its capability of effective knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages. Furthermore, results on English benchmarks indicate that BayLing maintains high performance in highresource languages while enhancing the performance in low-resource languages. Demo, homepage, code and models of BayLing are available.</p>

In this work, we propose SUIT (SUbgoal-aware ITerative Training), an iterative training approach for improving ToD systems. We sample dialogs from the model we aim to improve and determine subgoals that contribute to dialog success using distant supervision to obtain high quality training samples. We show how this data improves supervised fine-tuning or, alternatively, preference learning results. SUIT is able to iteratively generate more data instead of relying on fixed static sets. SUIT reaches new state-of-the-art performance on a popular ToD benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce OneDiffusion, a versatile, large-scale diffusion model that seamlessly supports bidirectional image synthesis and understanding across diverse tasks. It enables conditional generation from inputs such as text, depth, pose, layout, and semantic maps, while also handling tasks like image deblurring, upscaling, and reverse processes such as depth estimation and segmentation. Additionally, OneDiffusion allows for multi-view generation, camera pose estimation, and instant personalization using sequential image inputs. Our model takes a straightforward yet effective approach by treating all tasks as frame sequences with varying noise scales during training, allowing any frame to act as a conditioning image at inference time. Our unified training framework removes the need for specialized architectures, supports scalable multi-task training, and adapts smoothly to any resolution, enhancing both generalization and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance across tasks in both generation and prediction such as text-to-image, multiview generation, ID preservation, depth estimation and camera pose estimation despite relatively small training dataset.

<p>Abstract: Despite the rapid pace at which deep networks are improving on standardized vision benchmarks, they are still outperformed by humans on real-world vision tasks. This paradoxical lack of generalization could be addressed by making deep networks more brain-like. Although several benchmarks have compared the ability of deep networks to predict brain responses to natural images, they do not capture subtle but important brain-like emergent properties. To resolve this issue, we report several well-known perceptual and neural emergent properties that can be tested on deep networks. To evaluate how various design factors impact brain-like properties, we systematically evaluated over 30 state-of-the-art networks with varying network architectures, training datasets and training regimes. Our main findings are as follows. First, network architecture had the strongest impact on brain-like properties compared to dataset and training regime variations. Second, networks varied widely in their alignment to the brain with no single network outperforming all others. Taken together, our results complement existing benchmarks by revealing brain-like properties that are either emergent or lacking in state-of-the-art deep networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The manual assessment and grading of student writing is a time-consuming yet critical task for teachers. Recent developments in generative AI, such as large language models, offer potential solutions to facilitate essay-scoring tasks for teachers. In our study, we evaluate the performance and reliability of both open-source and closed-source LLMs in assessing German student essays, comparing their evaluations to those of 37 teachers across 10 pre-defined criteria (i.e., plot logic, expression). A corpus of 20 real-world essays from Year 7 and 8 students was analyzed using five LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, o1, LLaMA 3-70B, and Mixtral 8x7B, aiming to provide in-depth insights into LLMs' scoring capabilities. Closed-source GPT models outperform open-source models in both internal consistency and alignment with human ratings, particularly excelling in language-related criteria. The novel o1 model outperforms all other LLMs, achieving Spearman's $r = .74$ with human assessments in the overall score, and an internal consistency of $ICC=.80$. These findings indicate that LLM-based assessment can be a useful tool to reduce teacher workload by supporting the evaluation of essays, especially with regard to language-related criteria. However, due to their tendency for higher scores, the models require further refinement to better capture aspects of content quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikita Balesni, Tomek Korbak, Owain Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: While LLMs excel at multi-hop questions (e.g. "Who is the spouse of the performer of Imagine?") when using chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT), they struggle when forced to reason internally (without CoT). Previous work on the size and nature of this gap produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results. In this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop reasoning in LLMs, where the above-chance performance constitutes undeniable evidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B Instruct and GPT-4o) on fictional facts and confirm that they generalize to answering two-hop questions about them using CoT. We find that models can perform latent reasoning when facts appear together during training or in the prompt. However, to our surprise, models completely fail at two-hop reasoning without CoT when learned facts only appear in different documents, achieving chance-level accuracy and chance-level test loss. We call this complete failure to compose separately learned facts the Two-Hop Curse. Moreover, we evaluate 9 frontier LLMs on real-world facts, finding that models completely fail at two-hop no-CoT reasoning for over half of question categories while maintaining partial success with CoT across most categories. These results suggest that LLMs lack a general capability for latent multi-hop reasoning independent of the question type.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Ai, Yu-xi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: To demonstrate supremacy of quantum computing, increasingly large-scale superconducting quantum computing chips are being designed and fabricated, sparking the demand for electronic design automation in pursuit of better efficiency and effectiveness. However, the complexity of simulating quantum systems poses a significant challenge to computer-aided design of quantum chips. Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here propose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called 'three-stair scaling' mechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly trained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a designer unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to large-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk errors, which are commonly present and closely related to the graph structures and parameter assignments of superconducting quantum circuits. Parameters for both single- and two-qubit gates are considered simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages not only in efficiency but also in effectiveness, especially for large-scale circuits. For example, in superconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, the trained designer requires only 27 seconds to complete the frequency designing task which necessitates 90 minutes for the traditional Snake algorithm. More importantly, the crosstalk errors using our algorithm are only 51% of those produced by the Snake algorithm. Overall, this study initially demonstrates the advantages of applying graph neural networks to design parameters in quantum processors, and provides insights for systems where large-scale numerical simulations are challenging in electronic design automation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the greater scope of Deep Learning-based computer vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has given rise to challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation by discussing fundamental concepts in uncertainty that govern advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. We identify that quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty approximates Bayesian inference w.r.t. to either latent variables or model parameters, respectively. Moreover, literature on both uncertainties trace back to four key applications; (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) active learning. Then, a discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and comparison of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty-based active learning, standardization and benchmarking, and recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in clinical diagnosis due to its non-invasive nature and real-time capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnostics face several limitations, including high dependence on physician expertise and suboptimal image quality, which complicates interpretation and increases the likelihood of diagnostic errors. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance clinical diagnosis, particularly in detecting abnormalities across various biomedical imaging modalities. Nonetheless, current AI models for ultrasound imaging face critical challenges. First, these models often require large volumes of labeled medical data, raising concerns over patient privacy breaches. Second, most existing models are task-specific, which restricts their broader clinical utility. To overcome these challenges, we present UltraFedFM, an innovative privacy-preserving ultrasound foundation model. UltraFedFM is collaboratively pre-trained using federated learning across 16 distributed medical institutions in 9 countries, leveraging a dataset of over 1 million ultrasound images covering 19 organs and 10 ultrasound modalities. This extensive and diverse data, combined with a secure training framework, enables UltraFedFM to exhibit strong generalization and diagnostic capabilities. It achieves an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.927 for disease diagnosis and a dice similarity coefficient of 0.878 for lesion segmentation. Notably, UltraFedFM surpasses the diagnostic accuracy of mid-level ultrasonographers and matches the performance of expert-level sonographers in the joint diagnosis of 8 common systemic diseases. These findings indicate that UltraFedFM can significantly enhance clinical diagnostics while safeguarding patient privacy, marking an advancement in AI-driven ultrasound imaging for future clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agus Sudjianto, Aijun Zhang, Srinivas Neppalli, Tarun Joshi, Michal Malohlava</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for the evaluation and validation of generative language models (GLMs), with a focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed in high-stakes domains such as banking. GLM evaluation is challenging due to open-ended outputs and subjective quality assessments. Leveraging the structured nature of RAG systems, where generated responses are grounded in a predefined document collection, we propose the Human-Calibrated Automated Testing (HCAT) framework. HCAT integrates a) automated test generation using stratified sampling, b) embedding-based metrics for explainable assessment of functionality, risk and safety attributes, and c) a two-stage calibration approach that aligns machine-generated evaluations with human judgments through probability calibration and conformal prediction.
  In addition, the framework includes robustness testing to evaluate model performance against adversarial, out-of-distribution, and varied input conditions, as well as targeted weakness identification using marginal and bivariate analysis to pinpoint specific areas for improvement. This human-calibrated, multi-layered evaluation framework offers a scalable, transparent, and interpretable approach to GLM assessment, providing a practical and reliable solution for deploying GLMs in applications where accuracy, transparency, and regulatory compliance are paramount.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Fichtl, Juraj Vladika, Georg Groh</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge-enhanced language models (KELMs) have emerged as promising tools to bridge the gap between large-scale language models and domain-specific knowledge. KELMs can achieve higher factual accuracy and mitigate hallucinations by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs). They are frequently combined with adapter modules to reduce the computational load and risk of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) on adapter-based approaches to KELMs. We provide a structured overview of existing methodologies in the field through quantitative and qualitative analysis and explore the strengths and potential shortcomings of individual approaches. We show that general knowledge and domain-specific approaches have been frequently explored along with various adapter architectures and downstream tasks. We particularly focused on the popular biomedical domain, where we provided an insightful performance comparison of existing KELMs. We outline the main trends and propose promising future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elona Shatri, Kalikidhar Palavala, George Fazekas</p>
<p>Abstract: The generation of handwritten music sheets is a crucial step toward enhancing Optical Music Recognition (OMR) systems, which rely on large and diverse datasets for optimal performance. However, handwritten music sheets, often found in archives, present challenges for digitisation due to their fragility, varied handwriting styles, and image quality. This paper addresses the data scarcity problem by applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to synthesise realistic handwritten music sheets. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of three GAN models - DCGAN, ProGAN, and CycleWGAN - comparing their ability to generate diverse and high-quality handwritten music images. The proposed CycleWGAN model, which enhances style transfer and training stability, significantly outperforms DCGAN and ProGAN in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. CycleWGAN achieves superior performance, with an FID score of 41.87, an IS of 2.29, and a KID of 0.05, making it a promising solution for improving OMR systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Schwonberg, Claus Werner, Hanno Gottschalk, Carsten Meyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent progress in deep learning based computer vision, domain shifts are still one of the major challenges. Semantic segmentation for autonomous driving faces a wide range of domain shifts, e.g. caused by changing weather conditions, new geolocations and the frequent use of synthetic data in model training. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have emerged which adapt a model to a new target domain by only using unlabeled data of that domain. The variety of UDA methods is large but all of them use ImageNet pre-trained models. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities which may facilitate domain adaptation. We show that simply replacing the encoder of existing UDA methods like DACS by a vision-language pre-trained encoder can result in significant performance improvements of up to 10.0% mIoU on the GTA5-to-Cityscapes domain shift. For the generalization performance to unseen domains, the newly employed vision-language pre-trained encoder provides a gain of up to 13.7% mIoU across three unseen datasets. However, we find that not all UDA methods can be easily paired with the new encoder and that the UDA performance does not always likewise transfer into generalization performance. Finally, we perform our experiments on an adverse weather condition domain shift to further verify our findings on a pure real-to-real domain shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elona Shatri, Daniel Raymond, George Fazekas</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the intersection of technology and cultural preservation by developing a self-supervised learning framework for the classification of musical symbols in historical manuscripts. Optical Music Recognition (OMR) plays a vital role in digitising and preserving musical heritage, but historical documents often lack the labelled data required by traditional methods. We overcome this challenge by training a neural-based feature extractor on unlabelled data, enabling effective classification with minimal samples. Key contributions include optimising crop preprocessing for a self-supervised Convolutional Neural Network and evaluating classification methods, including SVM, multilayer perceptrons, and prototypical networks. Our experiments yield an accuracy of 87.66\%, showcasing the potential of AI-driven methods to ensure the survival of historical music for future generations through advanced digital archiving techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abedin Sherifi</p>
<p>Abstract: The aviation industry is rapidly evolving, driven by advancements in technology. Turbofan engines used in commercial aerospace are very complex systems. The majority of turbofan engine components are susceptible to degradation over the life of their operation. Turbofan engine degradation has an impact to engine performance, operability, and reliability. Predicting accurate remaining useful life (RUL) of a commercial turbofan engine based on a variety of complex sensor data is of paramount importance for the safety of the passengers, safety of flight, and for cost effective operations. That is why it is essential for turbofan engines to be monitored, controlled, and maintained. RUL predictions can either come from model-based or data-based approaches. The model-based approach can be very expensive due to the complexity of the mathematical models and the deep expertise that is required in the domain of physical systems. The data-based approach is more frequently used nowadays thanks to the high computational complexity of computers, the advancements in Machine Learning (ML) models, and advancements in sensors. This paper is going to be focused on Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) models but will also provide a benchmark of several RUL prediction databased models. The proposed RUL prediction models are going to be evaluated based on engine failure prediction benchmark dataset Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (CMAPSS). The CMAPSS dataset is from NASA which contains turbofan engine run to failure events.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linqing Zhong, Chen Gao, Zihan Ding, Yue Liao, Si Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Zero-Shot Object Navigation (ZSON) task requires embodied agents to find a previously unseen object by navigating in unfamiliar environments. Such a goal-oriented exploration heavily relies on the ability to perceive, understand, and reason based on the spatial information of the environment. However, current LLM-based approaches convert visual observations to language descriptions and reason in the linguistic space, leading to the loss of spatial information. In this paper, we introduce TopV-Nav, a MLLM-based method that directly reasons on the top-view map with complete spatial information. To fully unlock the MLLM's spatial reasoning potential in top-view perspective, we propose the Adaptive Visual Prompt Generation (AVPG) method to adaptively construct semantically-rich top-view map. It enables the agent to directly utilize spatial information contained in the top-view map to conduct thorough reasoning. Besides, we design a Dynamic Map Scaling (DMS) mechanism to dynamically zoom top-view map at preferred scales, enhancing local fine-grained reasoning. Additionally, we devise a Target-Guided Navigation (TGN) mechanism to predict and to utilize target locations, facilitating global and human-like exploration. Experiments on MP3D and HM3D benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TopV-Nav, e.g., $+3.9\%$ SR and $+2.0\%$ SPL absolute improvements on HM3D.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somjit Nath, Yik Chau Lui, Siqi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Event sequence data record the occurrences of events in continuous time. Event sequence forecasting based on temporal point processes (TPPs) has been extensively studied, but outlier or anomaly detection, especially without any supervision from humans, is still underexplored. In this work, we develop, to the best our knowledge, the first unsupervised outlier detection approach to detecting abnormal events. Our novel unsupervised outlier detection framework is based on ideas from generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning (RL). We train a 'generator' that corrects outliers in the data with a 'discriminator' that learns to discriminate the corrected data from the real data, which may contain outliers. A key insight is that if the generator made a mistake in the correction, it would generate anomalies that are different from the anomalies in the real data, so it serves as data augmentation for the discriminator learning. Different from typical GAN-based outlier detection approaches, our method employs the generator to detect outliers in an online manner. The experimental results show that our method can detect event outliers more accurately than the state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Colombo, Alessandro Falcetta, Manuel Roveri</p>
<p>Abstract: Training machine and deep learning models directly on extremely resource-constrained devices is the next challenge in the field of tiny machine learning. The related literature in this field is very limited, since most of the solutions focus only on on-device inference or model adaptation through online learning, leaving the training to be carried out on external Cloud services. An interesting technological perspective is to exploit Federated Learning (FL), which allows multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model in a distributed way. However, the main drawback of state-of-the-art FL algorithms is that they are not suitable for running on tiny devices. For the first time in the literature, in this paper we introduce TIFeD, a Tiny Integer-based Federated learning algorithm with Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) entirely implemented by using an integer-only arithmetic and being specifically designed to operate on devices with limited resources in terms of memory, computation and energy. Besides the traditional full-network operating modality, in which each device of the FL setting trains the entire neural network on its own local data, we propose an innovative single-layer TIFeD implementation, which enables each device to train only a portion of the neural network model and opens the door to a new way of distributing the learning procedure across multiple devices. The experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution. The proposed TIFeD algorithm, with its full-network and single-layer implementations, is made available to the scientific community as a public repository.</p>

Our method builds upon deep mutual learning, introducing a student model search for diverse initialization. We address the limitation of treating students equally by formulating weighted mutual learning as a bi-level optimization problem. The inner loop learns compact students through online distillation, while the outer loop optimizes weights for better knowledge distillation from diverse students. This dynamic weighting strategy eliminates the need for a teacher model, reducing computational requirements.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a critical examination of current approaches to replicating OpenAI's O1 model capabilities, with particular focus on the widespread but often undisclosed use of knowledge distillation techniques. While our previous work explored the fundamental technical path to O1 replication, this study reveals how simple distillation from O1's API, combined with supervised fine-tuning, can achieve superior performance on complex mathematical reasoning tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show that a base model fine-tuned on simply tens of thousands of samples O1-distilled long-thought chains outperforms O1-preview on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) with minimal technical complexity. Moreover, our investigation extends beyond mathematical reasoning to explore the generalization capabilities of O1-distilled models across diverse tasks: hallucination, safety and open-domain QA. Notably, despite training only on mathematical problem-solving data, our models demonstrated strong generalization to open-ended QA tasks and became significantly less susceptible to sycophancy after fine-tuning. We deliberately make this finding public to promote transparency in AI research and to challenge the current trend of obscured technical claims in the field. Our work includes: (1) A detailed technical exposition of the distillation process and its effectiveness, (2) A comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and categorizing O1 replication attempts based on their technical transparency and reproducibility, (3) A critical discussion of the limitations and potential risks of over-relying on distillation approaches, our analysis culminates in a crucial bitter lesson: while the pursuit of more capable AI systems is important, the development of researchers grounded in first-principles thinking is paramount.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junqi Jiang, Tom Bewley, Saumitra Mishra, Freddy Lecue, Manuela Veloso</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are a crucial component in the alignment of large language models' (LLMs) outputs with human values. RMs approximate human preferences over possible LLM responses to the same prompt by predicting and comparing reward scores. However, as they are typically modified versions of LLMs with scalar output heads, RMs are large black boxes whose predictions are not explainable. More transparent RMs would enable improved trust in the alignment of LLMs. In this work, we propose to use contrastive explanations to explain any binary response comparison made by an RM. Specifically, we generate a diverse set of new comparisons similar to the original one to characterise the RM's local behaviour. The perturbed responses forming the new comparisons are generated to explicitly modify manually specified high-level evaluation attributes, on which analyses of RM behaviour are grounded. In quantitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method for finding high-quality contrastive explanations. We then showcase the qualitative usefulness of our method for investigating global sensitivity of RMs to each evaluation attribute, and demonstrate how representative examples can be automatically extracted to explain and compare behaviours of different RMs. We see our method as a flexible framework for RM explanation, providing a basis for more interpretable and trustworthy LLM alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Wei-Po Wang, Ammar Gilani, Chenyang Li, Zhao Song, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the statistical and computational limits of prompt tuning for transformer-based foundation models. Our key contributions are prompt tuning on \textit{single-head} transformers with only a \textit{single} self-attention layer: (i) is universal, and (ii) supports efficient (even almost-linear time) algorithms under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Statistically, we prove that prompt tuning on such simplest possible transformers are universal approximators for sequence-to-sequence Lipschitz functions. In addition, we provide an exponential-in-$dL$ and -in-$(1/\epsilon)$ lower bound on the required soft-prompt tokens for prompt tuning to memorize any dataset with 1-layer, 1-head transformers. Computationally, we identify a phase transition in the efficiency of prompt tuning, determined by the norm of the \textit{soft-prompt-induced} keys and queries, and provide an upper bound criterion. Beyond this criterion, no sub-quadratic (efficient) algorithm for prompt tuning exists under SETH. Within this criterion, we showcase our theory by proving the existence of almost-linear time prompt tuning inference algorithms. These fundamental limits provide important necessary conditions for designing expressive and efficient prompt tuning methods for practitioners.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial understanding is a crucial capability for robots to make grounded decisions based on their environment. This foundational skill enables robots not only to perceive their surroundings but also to reason about and interact meaningfully within the world. In modern robotics, these capabilities are taken on by visual language models, and they face significant challenges when applied to spatial reasoning context due to their training data sources. These sources utilize general-purpose image datasets, and they often lack sophisticated spatial scene understanding capabilities. For example, the datasets do not address reference frame comprehension - spatial relationships require clear contextual understanding, whether from an ego-centric, object-centric, or world-centric perspective, which allow for effective real-world interaction. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale spatial understanding dataset consisting of real indoor and tabletop scenes captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5K 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, with paired 2D egocentric images and 3D scans to make it both 2D and 3D ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robotics manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Zhao, Qiran Zou, Rushi Shah, Dianbo Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector quantization is a technique in machine learning that discretizes continuous representations into a set of discrete vectors. It is widely employed in tokenizing data representations for large language models, diffusion models, and other generative models. Despite its prevalence, the characteristics and behaviors of vector quantization in generative models remain largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate representation collapse in vector quantization - a critical degradation where codebook tokens or latent embeddings lose their discriminative power by converging to a limited subset of values. This collapse fundamentally compromises the model's ability to capture diverse data patterns. By leveraging both synthetic and real datasets, we identify the severity of each type of collapses and triggering conditions. Our analysis reveals that restricted initialization and limited encoder capacity result in tokens collapse and embeddings collapse. Building on these findings, we propose potential solutions aimed at mitigating each collapse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study examining representation collapsing problems in vector quantization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Connor Douglas, Foster Provost, Arun Sundararajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic agents are used in a variety of competitive decision settings, notably in making pricing decisions in contexts that range from online retail to residential home rentals. Business managers, algorithm designers, legal scholars, and regulators alike are all starting to consider the ramifications of "algorithmic collusion." We study the emergent behavior of multi-armed bandit machine learning algorithms used in situations where agents are competing, but they have no information about the strategic interaction they are engaged in. Using a general-form repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game, agents engage in online learning with no prior model of game structure and no knowledge of competitors' states or actions (e.g., no observation of competing prices). We show that these context-free bandits, with no knowledge of opponents' choices or outcomes, still will consistently learn collusive behavior - what we call "naive collusion." We primarily study this system through an analytical model and examine perturbations to the model through simulations.
  Our findings have several notable implications for regulators. First, calls to limit algorithms from conditioning on competitors' prices are insufficient to prevent algorithmic collusion. This is a direct result of collusion arising even in the naive setting. Second, symmetry in algorithms can increase collusion potential. This highlights a new, simple mechanism for "hub-and-spoke" algorithmic collusion. A central distributor need not imbue its algorithm with supra-competitive tendencies for apparent collusion to arise; it can simply arise by using certain (common) machine learning algorithms. Finally, we highlight that collusive outcomes depend starkly on the specific algorithm being used, and we highlight market and algorithmic conditions under which it will be unknown a priori whether collusion occurs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to spend more time thinking and reflection before responding is crucial for effectively solving complex reasoning tasks in fields such as science, coding, and mathematics. However, the effectiveness of mechanisms like self-reflection and self-correction depends on the model's capacity to accurately assess its own performance, which can be limited by factors such as initial accuracy, question difficulty, and the lack of external feedback. In this paper, we delve into a two-player paradigm that separates the roles of reasoning and critique models, where the critique model provides step-level feedback to supervise the reasoning (actor) model during both test-time and train-time. We first propose AutoMathCritique, an automated and scalable framework for collecting critique data, resulting in a dataset of $76,321$ responses paired with step-level feedback. Fine-tuning language models with this dataset enables them to generate natural language feedback for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate that the critique models consistently improve the actor's performance on difficult queries at test-time, especially when scaling up inference-time computation. Motivated by these findings, we introduce the critique-based supervision to the actor's self-training process, and propose a critique-in-the-loop self-improvement method. Experiments show that the method improves the actor's exploration efficiency and solution diversity, especially on challenging queries, leading to a stronger reasoning model. Lastly, we take the preliminary step to explore training self-talk reasoning models via critique supervision and showcase its potential.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weilin Xu, Sebastian Szyller, Cory Cornelius, Luis Murillo Rojas, Marius Arvinte, Alvaro Velasquez, Jason Martin, Nageen Himayat</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial examples in the digital domain against deep learning-based computer vision models allow for perturbations that are imperceptible to human eyes. However, producing similar adversarial examples in the physical world has been difficult due to the non-differentiable image distortion functions in visual sensing systems. The existing algorithms for generating physically realizable adversarial examples often loosen their definition of adversarial examples by allowing unbounded perturbations, resulting in obvious or even strange visual patterns. In this work, we make adversarial examples imperceptible in the physical world using a straight-through estimator (STE, a.k.a. BPDA). We employ STE to overcome the non-differentiability -- applying exact, non-differentiable distortions in the forward pass of the backpropagation step, and using the identity function in the backward pass. Our differentiable rendering extension to STE also enables imperceptible adversarial patches in the physical world. Using printout photos, and experiments in the CARLA simulator, we show that STE enables fast generation of $\ell_\infty$ bounded adversarial examples despite the non-differentiable distortions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating imperceptible adversarial examples bounded by small $\ell_\infty$ norms in the physical world that force zero classification accuracy in the global perturbation threat model and cause near-zero ($4.22\%$) AP50 in object detection in the patch perturbation threat model. We urge the community to re-evaluate the threat of adversarial examples in the physical world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanwei Wang, Lirui Wang, Yilun Du, Balakumar Sundaralingam, Xuning Yang, Yu-Wei Chao, Claudia Perez-D'Arpino, Dieter Fox, Julie Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative policies trained with human demonstrations can autonomously accomplish multimodal, long-horizon tasks. However, during inference, humans are often removed from the policy execution loop, limiting the ability to guide a pre-trained policy towards a specific sub-goal or trajectory shape among multiple predictions. Naive human intervention may inadvertently exacerbate distribution shift, leading to constraint violations or execution failures. To better align policy output with human intent without inducing out-of-distribution errors, we propose an Inference-Time Policy Steering (ITPS) framework that leverages human interactions to bias the generative sampling process, rather than fine-tuning the policy on interaction data. We evaluate ITPS across three simulated and real-world benchmarks, testing three forms of human interaction and associated alignment distance metrics. Among six sampling strategies, our proposed stochastic sampling with diffusion policy achieves the best trade-off between alignment and distribution shift.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16638">Do Automatic Factuality Metrics Measure Factuality? A Critical Evaluation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjana Ramprasad, Byron C. Wallace</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern LLMs can now produce highly readable abstractive summaries, to the point where traditional automated metrics for evaluating summary quality, such as ROUGE, have become saturated. However, LLMs still sometimes introduce unwanted content into summaries, i.e., information inconsistent with or unsupported by their source. Measuring the occurrence of these often subtle ``hallucinations'' automatically has proved to be challenging. This in turn has motivated development of a variety of metrics intended to measure the factual consistency of generated summaries against their source. But are these approaches measuring what they purport to do? In this work, we stress-test automatic factuality metrics. Specifically, we investigate whether and to what degree superficial attributes of summary texts suffice to predict ``factuality'', finding that a (supervised) model using only such shallow features is reasonably competitive with SOTA factuality scoring methods. We then evaluate how factuality metrics respond to factual corrections in inconsistent summaries and find that only a few show meaningful improvements. In contrast, some metrics are more sensitive to benign, non-factual edits. Motivated by these insights, we show that one can ``game'' (most) automatic factuality metrics, i.e., reliably inflate ``factuality'' scores by appending innocuous sentences to generated summaries.Taken together, our results raise questions about the degree to which we should rely on existing automated factuality metrics and what exactly we want ``factuality metrics'' to measure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dietmar Jannach, Alan Said, Marko Tkal\v{c}i\v{c}, Markus Zanker</p>
<p>Abstract: In the area of recommender systems, the vast majority of research efforts is spent on developing increasingly sophisticated recommendation models, also using increasingly more computational resources. Unfortunately, most of these research efforts target a very small set of application domains, mostly e-commerce and media recommendation. Furthermore, many of these models are never evaluated with users, let alone put into practice. The scientific, economic and societal value of much of these efforts by scholars therefore remains largely unclear. To achieve a stronger positive impact resulting from these efforts, we posit that we as a research community should more often address use cases where recommender systems contribute to societal good (RS4Good). In this opinion piece, we first discuss a number of examples where the use of recommender systems for problems of societal concern has been successfully explored in the literature. We then proceed by outlining a paradigmatic shift that is needed to conduct successful RS4Good research, where the key ingredients are interdisciplinary collaborations and longitudinal evaluation approaches with humans in the loop.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Yu, Zhengxing Chen, Aston Zhang, Liang Tan, Chenguang Zhu, Richard Yuanzhe Pang, Yundi Qian, Xuewei Wang, Suchin Gururangan, Chao Zhang, Melanie Kambadur, Dhruv Mahajan, Rui Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward modeling is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, current reward models mainly produce scalar scores and struggle to incorporate critiques in a natural language format. We hypothesize that predicting both critiques and the scalar reward would improve reward modeling ability. Motivated by this, we propose Critic-RM, a framework that improves reward models using self-generated critiques without extra supervision. Critic-RM employs a two-stage process: generating and filtering high-quality critiques, followed by joint fine-tuning on reward prediction and critique generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Critic-RM improves reward modeling accuracy by 3.7%-7.3% compared to standard reward models and LLM judges, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency. Additional studies further validate the effectiveness of generated critiques in rectifying flawed reasoning steps with 2.5%-3.2% gains in improving reasoning accuracy.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16657">DreamRunner: Fine-Grained Storytelling Video Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Motion Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zun Wang, Jialu Li, Han Lin, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Storytelling video generation (SVG) has recently emerged as a task to create long, multi-motion, multi-scene videos that consistently represent the story described in the input text script. SVG holds great potential for diverse content creation in media and entertainment; however, it also presents significant challenges: (1) objects must exhibit a range of fine-grained, complex motions, (2) multiple objects need to appear consistently across scenes, and (3) subjects may require multiple motions with seamless transitions within a single scene. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next, DreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame semantic control. We compare DreamRunner with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DreamRunner exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DreamRunner's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaan Han, Junxiao Chen, Yanzhe Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce CatNet, an algorithm that effectively controls False Discovery Rate (FDR) and selects significant features in LSTM with the Gaussian Mirror (GM) method. To evaluate the feature importance of LSTM in time series, we introduce a vector of the derivative of the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to measure feature importance. We also propose a new kernel-based dependence measure to avoid multicollinearity in the GM algorithm, to make a robust feature selection with controlled FDR. We use simulated data to evaluate CatNet's performance in both linear models and LSTM models with different link functions. The algorithm effectively controls the FDR while maintaining a high statistical power in all cases. We also evaluate the algorithm's performance in different low-dimensional and high-dimensional cases, demonstrating its robustness in various input dimensions. To evaluate CatNet's performance in real world applications, we construct a multi-factor investment portfolio to forecast the prices of S\&P 500 index components. The results demonstrate that our model achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional LSTM models without feature selection and FDR control. Additionally, CatNet effectively captures common market-driving features, which helps informed decision-making in financial markets by enhancing the interpretability of predictions. Our study integrates of the Gaussian Mirror algorithm with LSTM models for the first time, and introduces SHAP values as a new feature importance metric for FDR control methods, marking a significant advancement in feature selection and error control for neural networks.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16667">OPMOS: Ordered Parallel Multi-Objective Shortest-Path</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leo Gold, Adam Bienkowski, David Sidoti, Krishna Pattipati, Omer Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: The Multi-Objective Shortest-Path (MOS) problem finds a set of Pareto-optimal solutions from a start node to a destination node in a multi-attribute graph. To solve the NP-hard MOS problem, the literature explores heuristic multi-objective A*-style algorithmic approaches. A generalized MOS algorithm maintains a "frontier" of partial paths at each node and performs ordered processing to ensure that Pareto-optimal paths are generated to reach the goal node. The algorithm becomes computationally intractable as the number of objectives increases due to a rapid increase in the non-dominated paths, and the concomitantly large increase in Pareto-optimal solutions. While prior works have focused on algorithmic methods to reduce the complexity, we tackle this challenge by exploiting parallelism using an algorithm-architecture approach. The key insight is that MOS algorithms rely on the ordered execution of partial paths to maintain high work efficiency. The OPMOS framework, proposed herein, unlocks ordered parallelism and efficiently exploits the concurrent execution of multiple paths in MOS. Experimental evaluation using the NVIDIA GH200 Superchip shows the performance scaling potential of OPMOS on work efficiency and parallelism using a real-world application to ship routing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ferdinando Fioretto, Cuong Tran, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
<p>Abstract: Agencies, such as the U.S. Census Bureau, release data sets and statistics about groups of individuals that are used as input to a number of critical decision processes. To conform to privacy and confidentiality requirements, these agencies are often required to release privacy-preserving versions of the data. This paper studies the release of differentially private data sets and analyzes their impact on some critical resource allocation tasks under a fairness perspective. {The paper shows that, when the decisions take as input differentially private data}, the noise added to achieve privacy disproportionately impacts some groups over others. The paper analyzes the reasons for these disproportionate impacts and proposes guidelines to mitigate these effects. The proposed approaches are evaluated on critical decision problems that use differentially private census data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li-Hsiang Shen, An-Hung Hsiao, Kai-Jui Chen, Tsung-Ting Tsai, Kai-Ten Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, indoor human presence detection based on supervised learning (SL) and channel state information (CSI) has attracted much attention. However, existing studies that rely on spatial information of CSI are susceptible to environmental changes which degrade prediction accuracy. Moreover, SL-based methods require time-consuming data labeling for retraining models. Therefore, it is imperative to design a continuously monitored model using a semi-supervised learning (SSL) based scheme. In this paper, we conceive a bifold teacher-student (BTS) learning approach for indoor human presence detection in an adjoining two-room scenario. The proposed SSL-based primal-dual teacher-student network intelligently learns spatial and temporal features from labeled and unlabeled CSI datasets. Additionally, the enhanced penalized loss function leverages entropy and distance measures to distinguish drifted data, i.e., features of new datasets affected by time-varying effects and altered from the original distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BTS system accomplishes an averaged accuracy of around 98% after retraining the model with unlabeled data. BTS can sustain an accuracy of 93% under the changed layout and environments. Furthermore, BTS outperforms existing SSL-based models in terms of the highest detection accuracy of around 98% while achieving the asymptotic performance of SL-based methods.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10313">How Far Are We From AGI: Are LLMs All We Need?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Feng, Chuanyang Jin, Jingyu Liu, Kunlun Zhu, Haoqin Tu, Zirui Cheng, Guanyu Lin, Jiaxuan You</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly impacted human society, driving significant advancements in multiple sectors. AGI, distinguished by its ability to execute diverse real-world tasks with efficiency and effectiveness comparable to human intelligence, reflects a paramount milestone in AI evolution. While existing studies have reviewed specific advancements in AI and proposed potential paths to AGI, such as large language models (LLMs), they fall short of providing a thorough exploration of AGI's definitions, objectives, and developmental trajectories. Unlike previous survey papers, this work goes beyond summarizing LLMs by addressing key questions about our progress toward AGI and outlining the strategies essential for its realization through comprehensive analysis, in-depth discussions, and novel insights. We start by articulating the requisite capability frameworks for AGI, integrating the internal, interface, and system dimensions. As the realization of AGI requires more advanced capabilities and adherence to stringent constraints, we further discuss necessary AGI alignment technologies to harmonize these factors. Notably, we emphasize the importance of approaching AGI responsibly by first defining the key levels of AGI progression, followed by the evaluation framework that situates the status quo, and finally giving our roadmap of how to reach the pinnacle of AGI. Moreover, to give tangible insights into the ubiquitous impact of the integration of AI, we outline existing challenges and potential pathways toward AGI in multiple domains. In sum, serving as a pioneering exploration into the current state and future trajectory of AGI, this paper aims to foster a collective comprehension and catalyze broader public discussions among researchers and practitioners on AGI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Hu, Xibin Wu, Zilin Zhu,  Xianyu, Weixun Wang, Dehao Zhang, Yu Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow by scaling laws, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has gained significant attention due to its outstanding performance. However, unlike pretraining or fine-tuning a single model, scaling reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training large language models poses coordination challenges across four models. We present OpenRLHF, an open-source framework enabling efficient RLHF scaling. Unlike existing RLHF frameworks that co-locate four models on the same GPUs, OpenRLHF re-designs scheduling for the models beyond 70B parameters using Ray, vLLM, and DeepSpeed, leveraging improved resource utilization and diverse training approaches. Integrating seamlessly with Hugging Face, OpenRLHF provides an out-of-the-box solution with optimized algorithms and launch scripts, which ensures user-friendliness. OpenRLHF implements RLHF, DPO, rejection sampling, and other alignment techniques. Empowering state-of-the-art LLM development, OpenRLHF's code is available at \url{https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF}.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of AI alignment aims to steer AI systems toward human goals, preferences, and ethical principles. Its contributions have been instrumental for improving the output quality, safety, and trustworthiness of today's AI models. This perspective article draws attention to a fundamental challenge we see in all AI alignment endeavors, which we term the "AI alignment paradox": The better we align AI models with our values, the easier we may make it for adversaries to misalign the models. We illustrate the paradox by sketching three concrete example incarnations for the case of language models, each corresponding to a distinct way in which adversaries might exploit the paradox. With AI's increasing real-world impact, it is imperative that a broad community of researchers be aware of the AI alignment paradox and work to find ways to mitigate it, in order to ensure the beneficial use of AI for the good of humanity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meghyn Bienvenu, Diego Figueira, Pierre Lafourcade</p>
<p>Abstract: The Shapley value, originally introduced in cooperative game theory for wealth distribution, has found use in KR and databases for the purpose of assigning scores to formulas and database tuples based upon their contribution to obtaining a query result or inconsistency. In the present paper, we explore the use of Shapley values in ontology-mediated query answering (OMQA) and present a detailed complexity analysis of Shapley value computation (SVC) in the OMQA setting. In particular, we establish a PF/#P-hard dichotomy for SVC for ontology-mediated queries (T,q) composed of an ontology T formulated in the description logic ELHI_\bot and a connected constant-free homomorphism-closed query q. We further show that the #P-hardness side of the dichotomy can be strengthened to cover possibly disconnected queries with constants. Our results exploit recently discovered connections between SVC and probabilistic query evaluation and allow us to generalize existing results on probabilistic OMQA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Zhu, Bingzhe Wu, Zhengyou Zhang, Lei Han, Baoyuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EAIRiskBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EAIRiskDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangcheng Qiang, Kerry Taylor, Weiqing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of the semantic web, ontology version control is required to capture time-varying information, most importantly for widely-used ontologies. Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial component for efficient ontology management, the growing size of ontologies and accumulating errors caused by manual labour overwhelm current OV approaches. In this paper, we propose yet another approach to performing OV using existing ontology matching (OM) techniques and systems. We introduce a unified OM4OV pipeline. From an OM perspective, we reconstruct a new task formulation, measurement, and testbed for OV tasks. Reusing the prior alignment(s) from OM, we propose a pipeline optimisation method called cross-reference (CR) mechanism to improve overall OV performance. We experimentally validate the OM4OV pipeline and the cross-reference mechanism in modified Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets. We also discuss the insights on OM used for OV tasks, where some false mappings detected by OV systems are not actually false.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alain Andres, Javier Del Ser</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploration remains a significant challenge in reinforcement learning, especially in environments where extrinsic rewards are sparse or non-existent. The recent rise of foundation models, such as CLIP, offers an opportunity to leverage pretrained, semantically rich embeddings that encapsulate broad and reusable knowledge. In this work we explore the potential of these foundation models not just to drive exploration, but also to analyze the critical role of the episodic novelty term in enhancing exploration effectiveness of the agent. We also investigate whether providing the intrinsic module with complete state information -- rather than just partial observations -- can improve exploration, despite the difficulties in handling small variations within large state spaces. Our experiments in the MiniGrid domain reveal that intrinsic modules can effectively utilize full state information, significantly increasing sample efficiency while learning an optimal policy. Moreover, we show that the embeddings provided by foundation models are sometimes even better than those constructed by the agent during training, further accelerating the learning process, especially when coupled with the episodic novelty term to enhance exploration.</p>

<p>Abstract: As machine intelligence evolves, the need to test and compare the problem-solving abilities of different AI models grows. However, current benchmarks are often simplistic, allowing models to perform uniformly well and making it difficult to distinguish their capabilities. Additionally, benchmarks typically rely on static question-answer pairs that the models might memorize or guess. To address these limitations, we introduce Dynamic Intelligence Assessment (DIA), a novel methodology for testing AI models using dynamic question templates and improved metrics across multiple disciplines such as mathematics, cryptography, cybersecurity, and computer science. The accompanying dataset, DIA-Bench, contains a diverse collection of challenge templates with mutable parameters presented in various formats, including text, PDFs, compiled binaries, visual puzzles, and CTF-style cybersecurity challenges. Our framework introduces four new metrics to assess a model's reliability and confidence across multiple attempts. These metrics revealed that even simple questions are frequently answered incorrectly when posed in varying forms, highlighting significant gaps in models' reliability. Notably, API models like GPT-4o often overestimated their mathematical capabilities, while ChatGPT-4o demonstrated better performance due to effective tool usage. In self-assessment, OpenAI's o1-mini proved to have the best judgement on what tasks it should attempt to solve. We evaluated 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using DIA-Bench, showing that current models struggle with complex tasks and often display unexpectedly low confidence, even with simpler questions. The DIA framework sets a new standard for assessing not only problem-solving but also a model's adaptive intelligence and ability to assess its limitations. The dataset is publicly available on the project's page: https://github.com/DIA-Bench.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creating reinforcement learning agents that generalise effectively to new tasks is a key challenge in AI research. This paper introduces Fracture Cluster Options (FraCOs), a multi-level hierarchical reinforcement learning method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on difficult generalisation tasks. FraCOs identifies patterns in agent behaviour and forms options based on the expected future usefulness of those patterns, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. In tabular settings, FraCOs demonstrates effective transfer and improves performance as it grows in hierarchical depth. We evaluate FraCOs against state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms in several complex procedurally generated environments. Our results show that FraCOs achieves higher in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance than competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Kutub Uddin, Md. Saiful Islam, Md Abrar Jahin, Md. Saiful Islam Seam, M. F. Mridha</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the generalized grouping problem in the context of cellular manufacturing systems (CMS), where parts may have more than one process route. A process route lists the machines corresponding to each part of the operation. Inspired by the extensive and widespread use of network flow algorithms, this research formulates the process route family formation for generalized grouping as a unit capacity minimum cost network flow model. The objective is to minimize dissimilarity (based on the machines required) among the process routes within a family. The proposed model optimally solves the process route family formation problem without pre-specifying the number of part families to be formed. The process route of family formation is the first stage in a hierarchical procedure. For the second stage (machine cell formation), two procedures, a quadratic assignment programming (QAP) formulation, and a heuristic procedure, are proposed. The QAP simultaneously assigns process route families and machines to a pre-specified number of cells in such a way that total machine utilization is maximized. The heuristic procedure for machine cell formation is hierarchical in nature. Computational results for some test problems show that the QAP and the heuristic procedure yield the same results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohit Bokade, Xiaoning Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient traffic control (TSC) is essential for urban mobility, but traditional systems struggle to handle the complexity of real-world traffic. Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers adaptive solutions, but online MARL requires extensive interactions with the environment, making it costly and impractical. Offline MARL mitigates these challenges by using historical traffic data for training but faces significant difficulties with heterogeneous behavior policies in real-world datasets, where mixed-quality data complicates learning. We introduce OffLight, a novel offline MARL framework designed to handle heterogeneous behavior policies in TSC datasets. To improve learning efficiency, OffLight incorporates Importance Sampling (IS) to correct for distributional shifts and Return-Based Prioritized Sampling (RBPS) to focus on high-quality experiences. OffLight utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Variational Graph Autoencoder (GMM-VGAE) to capture the diverse distribution of behavior policies from local observations. Extensive experiments across real-world urban traffic scenarios show that OffLight outperforms existing offline RL methods, achieving up to a 7.8% reduction in average travel time and 11.2% decrease in queue length. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of OffLight's components in handling heterogeneous data and improving policy performance. These results highlight OffLight's scalability and potential to improve urban traffic management without the risks of online learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshar Prabhu Desai, Tejasvi Ravi, Mohammad Luqman, Mohit Sharma, Nithya Kota, Pranjul Yadav</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning and data mining techniques (i.e. supervised and unsupervised techniques) are used across domains to detect user safety violations. Examples include classifiers used to detect whether an email is spam or a web-page is requesting bank login information. However, existing ML/DM classifiers are limited in their ability to understand natural languages w.r.t the context and nuances. The aforementioned challenges are overcome with the arrival of Gen-AI techniques, along with their inherent ability w.r.t translation between languages, fine-tuning between various tasks and domains.
  In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive overview of the various work done while using Gen-AI techniques w.r.t user safety. In particular, we first provide the various domains (e.g. phishing, malware, content moderation, counterfeit, physical safety) across which Gen-AI techniques have been applied. Next, we provide how Gen-AI techniques can be used in conjunction with various data modalities i.e. text, images, videos, audio, executable binaries to detect violations of user-safety. Further, also provide an overview of how Gen-AI techniques can be used in an adversarial setting. We believe that this work represents the first summarization of Gen-AI techniques for user-safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Li, Xinyue Liang, Yizhe Yang, Chong Feng, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Process supervision enhances the performance of large language models in reasoning tasks by providing feedback at each step of chain-of-thought reasoning. However, due to the lack of effective process supervision methods, even advanced large language models are prone to logical errors and redundant reasoning. We claim that the effectiveness of process supervision significantly depends on both the accuracy and the length of reasoning chains. Moreover, we identify that these factors exhibit a nonlinear relationship with the overall reward score of the reasoning process. Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel process supervision paradigm, PSPO*, which systematically outlines the workflow from reward model training to policy optimization, and highlights the importance of nonlinear rewards in process supervision. Based on PSPO*, we develop the PSPO-WRS, which considers the number of reasoning steps in determining reward scores and utilizes an adjusted Weibull distribution for nonlinear reward shaping. Experimental results on six mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that PSPO-WRS consistently outperforms current mainstream models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adem Alparslan</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines conversational business analytics, an approach that utilizes AI to address the technical competency gaps that hinder end users from effectively using traditional self-service analytics. By facilitating natural language interactions, conversational business analytics aims to empower end users to independently retrieve data and generate insights. The analysis focuses on Text-to-SQL as a representative technology for translating natural language requests into SQL statements. Developing theoretical models grounded in expected utility theory, this study identifies the conditions under which conversational business analytics, through partial or full support, can outperform delegation to human experts. The results indicate that partial support, focusing solely on information generation by AI, is viable when the accuracy of AI-generated SQL queries leads to a profit that surpasses the performance of a human expert. In contrast, full support includes not only information generation but also validation through explanations provided by the AI, and requires sufficiently high validation effectiveness to be reliable. However, user-based validation presents challenges, such as misjudgment and rejection of valid SQL queries, which may limit the effectiveness of conversational business analytics. These challenges underscore the need for robust validation mechanisms, including improved user support, automated processes, and methods for assessing quality independent of the technical competency of end users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Yin, Qiang Zhou, Zongsheng Cao, Mei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerical reasoning is pivotal in various artificial intelligence applications, such as natural language processing and recommender systems, where it involves using entities, relations, and attribute values (e.g., weight, length) to infer new factual relations (e.g., the Nile is longer than the Amazon). However, existing approaches encounter two critical challenges in modeling: (1) semantic relevance-the challenge of insufficiently capturing the necessary contextual interactions among entities, relations, and numerical attributes, often resulting in suboptimal inference; and (2) semantic ambiguity-the difficulty in accurately distinguishing ordinal relationships during numerical reasoning, which compromises the generation of high-quality samples and limits the effectiveness of contrastive learning. To address these challenges, we propose the novel Knowledge-Aware Attributes Embedding model (KAAE) for knowledge graph embeddings in numerical reasoning. Specifically, to overcome the challenge of semantic relevance, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts-Knowledge-Aware (MoEKA) Encoder, designed to integrate the semantics of entities, relations, and numerical attributes into a joint semantic space. To tackle semantic ambiguity, we implement a new ordinal knowledge contrastive learning (OKCL) strategy that generates high-quality ordinal samples from the original data with the aid of ordinal relations, capturing fine-grained semantic nuances essential for accurate numerical reasoning. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KAAE across various attribute value distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mircea Lic\u{a}, Ojas Shirekar, Baptiste Colle, Chirag Raman</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary embodied agents, such as Voyager in Minecraft, have demonstrated promising capabilities in open-ended individual learning. However, when powered with open large language models (LLMs), these agents often struggle with rudimentary tasks, even when fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge. Inspired by human cultural learning, we present \collabvoyager, a novel framework that enhances Voyager with lifelong collaborative learning through explicit perspective-taking. \collabvoyager introduces three key innovations: (1) theory of mind representations linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural language communication between agents; and (3) semantic memory of task and environment knowledge and episodic memory of collaboration episodes. These advancements enable agents to reason about their and others' mental states, empirically addressing two prevalent failure modes: false beliefs and faulty task executions. In mixed-expertise Minecraft experiments, \collabvoyager agents outperform Voyager counterparts, significantly improving task completion rate by $66.6\% (+39.4\%)$ for collecting one block of dirt and $70.8\% (+20.8\%)$ for collecting one wood block. They exhibit emergent behaviors like knowledge transfer from expert to novice agents and collaborative code correction. \collabvoyager agents also demonstrate the ability to adapt to out-of-distribution tasks by using their previous experiences and beliefs obtained through collaboration. In this open-ended social learning paradigm, \collabvoyager paves the way for the democratic development of embodied AI, where agents learn in deployment from both peer and environmental feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Shardlow, Piotr Przyby{\l}a</p>
<p>Abstract: This work is intended as a voice in the discussion over previous claims that a pretrained large language model (LLM) based on the Transformer model architecture can be sentient. Such claims have been made concerning the LaMDA model and also concerning the current wave of LLM-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT. This claim, if confirmed, would have serious ramifications in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community due to wide-spread use of similar models. However, here we take the position that such a large language model cannot be sentient, or conscious, and that LaMDA in particular exhibits no advances over other similar models that would qualify it. We justify this by analysing the Transformer architecture through Integrated Information Theory of consciousness. We see the claims of sentience as part of a wider tendency to use anthropomorphic language in NLP reporting. Regardless of the veracity of the claims, we consider this an opportune moment to take stock of progress in language modelling and consider the ethical implications of the task. In order to make this work helpful for readers outside the NLP community, we also present the necessary background in language modelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duzhen Zhang, Tielin Zhang, Shuncheng Jia, Qingyu Wang, Bo Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from interaction is the primary way that biological agents acquire knowledge about their environment and themselves. Modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) explores a computational approach to learning from interaction and has made significant progress in solving various tasks. However, despite its power, DRL still falls short of biological agents in terms of energy efficiency. Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, we believe that the integration of spiking communication between neurons and biologically-plausible synaptic plasticity plays a prominent role in achieving greater energy efficiency. Following this biological intuition, we optimized a spiking policy network (SPN) using a genetic algorithm as an energy-efficient alternative to DRL. Our SPN mimics the sensorimotor neuron pathway of insects and communicates through event-based spikes. Inspired by biological research showing that the brain forms memories by creating new synaptic connections and rewiring these connections based on new experiences, we tuned the synaptic connections instead of weights in the SPN to solve given tasks. Experimental results on several robotic control tasks demonstrate that our method can achieve the same level of performance as mainstream DRL methods while exhibiting significantly higher energy efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delong Liu, Haiwen Li, Zhicheng Zhao, Yuan Dong, Nikolaos V. Boulgouris</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) is to retrieve specific person images according to the given textual descriptions. A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian B. Moser, Stanislav Frolov, Federico Raue, Sebastian Palacio, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models in image Super-Resolution (SR) treat all image regions uniformly, which risks compromising the overall image quality by potentially introducing artifacts during denoising of less-complex regions. To address this, we propose ``You Only Diffuse Areas'' (YODA), a dynamic attention-guided diffusion process for image SR. YODA selectively focuses on spatial regions defined by attention maps derived from the low-resolution images and the current denoising time step. This time-dependent targeting enables a more efficient conversion to high-resolution outputs by focusing on areas that benefit the most from the iterative refinement process, i.e., detail-rich objects. We empirically validate YODA by extending leading diffusion-based methods SR3, DiffBIR, and SRDiff. Our experiments demonstrate new state-of-the-art performances in face and general SR tasks across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. As a side effect, we find that YODA reduces color shift issues and stabilizes training with small batches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yawei Li, Yang Zhang, Kenji Kawaguchi, Ashkan Khakzar, Bernd Bischl, Mina Rezaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature attribution methods attempt to explain neural network predictions by identifying relevant features. However, establishing a cohesive framework for assessing feature attribution remains a challenge. There are several views through which we can evaluate attributions. One principal lens is to observe the effect of perturbing attributed features on the model's behavior (i.e., faithfulness). While providing useful insights, existing faithfulness evaluations suffer from shortcomings that we reveal in this paper. In this work, we propose two new perspectives within the faithfulness paradigm that reveal intuitive properties: soundness and completeness. Soundness assesses the degree to which attributed features are truly predictive features, while completeness examines how well the resulting attribution reveals all the predictive features. The two perspectives are based on a firm mathematical foundation and provide quantitative metrics that are computable through efficient algorithms. We apply these metrics to mainstream attribution methods, offering a novel lens through which to analyze and compare feature attribution methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyin Li, Prashant Khanduri, Yao Qiang, Rafi Ibn Sultan, Indrin Chetty, Dongxiao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) is one of the pioneering prompt-based foundation models for image segmentation and has been rapidly adopted for various medical imaging applications. However, in clinical settings, creating effective prompts is notably challenging and time-consuming, requiring the expertise of domain specialists such as physicians. This requirement significantly diminishes SAM's primary advantage, its interactive capability with end users, in medical applications. Moreover, recent studies have indicated that SAM, originally designed for 2D natural images, performs suboptimally on 3D medical image segmentation tasks. This subpar performance is attributed to the domain gaps between natural and medical images and the disparities in spatial arrangements between 2D and 3D images, particularly in multi-organ segmentation applications. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel technique termed AutoProSAM. This method automates 3D multi-organ CT-based segmentation by leveraging SAM's foundational model capabilities without relying on domain experts for prompts. The approach utilizes parameter-efficient adaptation techniques to adapt SAM for 3D medical imagery and incorporates an effective automatic prompt learning paradigm specific to this domain. By eliminating the need for manual prompts, it enhances SAM's capabilities for 3D medical image segmentation and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in CT-based multi-organ segmentation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ge Gao, Jonathan D. Chang, Claire Cardie, Kiant\'e Brantley, Thorsten Joachim</p>
<p>Abstract: Text retrieval plays a crucial role in incorporating factual knowledge for decision making into language processing pipelines, ranging from chat-based web search to question answering systems. Current state-of-the-art text retrieval models leverage pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to achieve competitive performance, but training LLM-based retrievers via typical contrastive losses requires intricate heuristics, including selecting hard negatives and using additional supervision as learning signals. This reliance on heuristics stems from the fact that the contrastive loss itself is heuristic and does not directly optimize the downstream metrics of decision quality at the end of the processing pipeline. To address this issue, we introduce Neural PG-RANK, a novel training algorithm that learns to rank by instantiating a LLM as a Plackett-Luce ranking policy. Neural PG-RANK provides a principled method for end-to-end training of retrieval models as part of larger decision systems via policy gradient, with little reliance on complex heuristics, and it effectively unifies the training objective with downstream decision-making quality. We conduct extensive experiments on various text retrieval benchmarks. The results demonstrate that when the training objective aligns with the evaluation setup, Neural PG-RANK yields remarkable in-domain performance improvement, with substantial out-of-domain generalization to some critical datasets employed in downstream question answering tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueyang Kang, Fengze Han, Abdur R. Fayjie, Patrick Vandewalle, Kourosh Khoshelham, Dong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing methods for depth estimation from a focal stack of images employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using 2D or 3D convolutions over a fixed set of images. However, their effectiveness is constrained by the local properties of CNN kernels, which restricts them to process only focal stacks of fixed number of images during both training and inference. This limitation hampers their ability to generalize to stacks of arbitrary lengths. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel Transformer-based network, FocDepthFormer, which integrates a Transformer with an LSTM module and a CNN decoder. The Transformer's self-attention mechanism allows for the learning of more informative spatial features by implicitly performing non-local cross-referencing. The LSTM module is designed to integrate representations across image stacks of varying lengths. Additionally, we employ multi-scale convolutional kernels in an early-stage encoder to capture low-level features at different degrees of focus/defocus. By incorporating the LSTM, FocDepthFormer can be pre-trained on large-scale monocular RGB depth estimation datasets, improving visual pattern learning and reducing reliance on difficult-to-obtain focal stack data. Extensive experiments on diverse focal stack benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupei Liu, Yuqi Jia, Runpeng Geng, Jinyuan Jia, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: A prompt injection attack aims to inject malicious instruction/data into the input of an LLM-Integrated Application such that it produces results as an attacker desires. Existing works are limited to case studies. As a result, the literature lacks a systematic understanding of prompt injection attacks and their defenses. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. In particular, we propose a framework to formalize prompt injection attacks. Existing attacks are special cases in our framework. Moreover, based on our framework, we design a new attack by combining existing ones. Using our framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation on 5 prompt injection attacks and 10 defenses with 10 LLMs and 7 tasks. Our work provides a common benchmark for quantitatively evaluating future prompt injection attacks and defenses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Zhao, Gus Xia, Ziyu Wang, Ye Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of music AI, arranging rich and structured multi-track accompaniments from a simple lead sheet presents significant challenges. Such challenges include maintaining track cohesion, ensuring long-term coherence, and optimizing computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel system that leverages prior modelling over disentangled style factors to address these challenges. Our method presents a two-stage process: initially, a piano arrangement is derived from the lead sheet by retrieving piano texture styles; subsequently, a multi-track orchestration is generated by infusing orchestral function styles into the piano arrangement. Our key design is the use of vector quantization and a unique multi-stream Transformer to model the long-term flow of the orchestration style, which enables flexible, controllable, and structured music generation. Experiments show that by factorizing the arrangement task into interpretable sub-stages, our approach enhances generative capacity while improving efficiency. Additionally, our system supports a variety of music genres and provides style control at different composition hierarchies. We further show that our system achieves superior coherence, structure, and overall arrangement quality compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Buckley, James A. Diao, Pranav Rajpurkar, Adam Rodman, Arjun K. Manrai</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have shown compelling but conflicting performance in medical image interpretation. However, the mechanisms by which these models integrate and prioritize different data modalities, including images and text, remain poorly understood. Here, using a diverse collection of 1014 multimodal medical cases, we evaluate the unimodal and multimodal image interpretation abilities of proprietary (GPT-4, Gemini Pro 1.0) and open-source (Llama-3.2-90B, LLaVA-Med-v1.5) multimodal foundational models with and without the use of text descriptions. Across all models, image predictions were largely driven by exploiting text, with accuracy increasing monotonically with the amount of informative text. By contrast, human performance on medical image interpretation did not improve with informative text. Exploitation of text is a double-edged sword; we show that even mild suggestions of an incorrect diagnosis in text diminishes image-based classification, reducing performance dramatically in cases the model could previously answer with images alone. Finally, we conducted a physician evaluation of model performance on long-form medical cases, finding that the provision of images either reduced or had no effect on model performance when text is already highly informative. Our results suggest that multimodal AI models may be useful in medical diagnostic reasoning but that their accuracy is largely driven, for better and worse, by their exploitation of text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Feng, Qi Liu, Hao Liu, Jingqun Tang, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li, Can Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents DocPedia, a novel large multimodal model (LMM) for versatile OCR-free document understanding, capable of parsing images up to 2,560$\times$2,560 resolution. Unlike existing work either struggle with high-resolution documents or give up the large language model thus vision or language ability constrained, our DocPedia directly processes visual input in the frequency domain rather than the pixel space. The unique characteristic enables DocPedia to capture a greater amount of visual and textual information using a limited number of visual tokens. To consistently enhance both perception and comprehension abilities of our model, we develop a dual-stage training strategy and enrich instructions/annotations of all training tasks covering multiple document types. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on various publicly available benchmarks confirm the mutual benefits of jointly learning perception and comprehension tasks. The results provide further evidence of the effectiveness and superior performance of our DocPedia over other methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delong Liu, Haiwen Li, Zhicheng Zhao, Fei Su, Yuan Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Searching for specific person has great social benefits and security value, and it often involves a combination of visual and textual information. Conventional person retrieval methods, whether image-based or text-based, usually fall short in effectively harnessing both types of information, leading to the loss of accuracy. In this paper, a whole new task called Composed Person Retrieval (CPR) is proposed to jointly utilize both image and text information for target person retrieval. However, the supervised CPR requires very costly manual annotation dataset, while there are currently no available resources. To mitigate this issue, we firstly introduce the Zero-shot Composed Person Retrieval (ZS-CPR), which leverages existing domain-related data to resolve the CPR problem without expensive annotations. Secondly, to learn ZS-CPR model, we propose a two-stage learning framework, Word4Per, where a lightweight Textual Inversion Network (TINet) and a text-based person retrieval model based on fine-tuned Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) network are learned without utilizing any CPR data. Thirdly, a finely annotated Image-Text Composed Person Retrieval (ITCPR) dataset is built as the benchmark to assess the performance of the proposed Word4Per framework. Extensive experiments under both Rank-1 and mAP demonstrate the effectiveness of Word4Per for the ZS-CPR task, surpassing the comparative methods by over 10\%. The code and ITCPR dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/Word4Per.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senkang Hu, Zhengru Fang, Yiqin Deng, Xianhao Chen, Yuguang Fang, Sam Kwong</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative perception has recently gained significant attention in autonomous driving, improving perception quality by enabling the exchange of additional information among vehicles. However, deploying collaborative perception systems can lead to domain shifts due to diverse environmental conditions and data heterogeneity among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To address these challenges, we propose a unified domain generalization framework to be utilized during the training and inference stages of collaborative perception. In the training phase, we introduce an Amplitude Augmentation (AmpAug) method to augment low-frequency image variations, broadening the model's ability to learn across multiple domains. We also employ a meta-consistency training scheme to simulate domain shifts, optimizing the model with a carefully designed consistency loss to acquire domain-invariant representations. In the inference phase, we introduce an intra-system domain alignment mechanism to reduce or potentially eliminate the domain discrepancy among CAVs prior to inference. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our method in comparison with the existing state-of-the-art works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyuan Yin, Zhiqiang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation or condensation aims to generate a smaller but representative subset from a large dataset, which allows a model to be trained more efficiently, meanwhile evaluating on the original testing data distribution to achieve decent performance. Previous decoupled methods like SRe$^2$L simply use a unified gradient update scheme for synthesizing data from Gaussian noise, while, we notice that the initial several update iterations will determine the final outline of synthesis, thus an improper gradient update strategy may dramatically affect the final generation quality. To address this, we introduce a simple yet effective global-to-local gradient refinement approach enabled by curriculum data augmentation ($\texttt{CDA}$) during data synthesis. The proposed framework achieves the current published highest accuracy on both large-scale ImageNet-1K and 21K with 63.2% under IPC (Images Per Class) 50 and 36.1% under IPC 20, using a regular input resolution of 224$\times$224 with faster convergence speed and less synthetic time. The proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods like SRe$^2$L, TESLA, and MTT by more than 4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K/21K and for the first time, reduces the gap to its full-data training counterparts to less than absolute 15%. Moreover, this work represents the inaugural success in dataset distillation on the larger-scale ImageNet-21K dataset under the standard 224$\times$224 resolution.

In this paper, we introduce BenchMARL, the first MARL training library created to enable standardized benchmarking across different algorithms, models, and environments. BenchMARL uses TorchRL as its backend, granting it high performance and maintained state-of-the-art implementations while addressing the broad community of MARL PyTorch users.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyang Zhou, Zhiyang Dou, Zeyu Cao, Zhouyingcheng Liao, Jingbo Wang, Wenjia Wang, Yuan Liu, Taku Komura, Wenping Wang, Lingjie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Efficient Motion Diffusion Model (EMDM) for fast and high-quality human motion generation. Current state-of-the-art generative diffusion models have produced impressive results but struggle to achieve fast generation without sacrificing quality. On the one hand, previous works, like motion latent diffusion, conduct diffusion within a latent space for efficiency, but learning such a latent space can be a non-trivial effort. On the other hand, accelerating generation by naively increasing the sampling step size, e.g., DDIM, often leads to quality degradation as it fails to approximate the complex denoising distribution. To address these issues, we propose EMDM, which captures the complex distribution during multiple sampling steps in the diffusion model, allowing for much fewer sampling steps and significant acceleration in generation. This is achieved by a conditional denoising diffusion GAN to capture multimodal data distributions among arbitrary (and potentially larger) step sizes conditioned on control signals, enabling fewer-step motion sampling with high fidelity and diversity. To minimize undesired motion artifacts, geometric losses are imposed during network learning. As a result, EMDM achieves real-time motion generation and significantly improves the efficiency of motion diffusion models compared to existing methods while achieving high-quality motion generation. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngwan Lee, Kwanyong Park, Yoorhim Cho, Yong-Ju Lee, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: As text-to-image (T2I) synthesis models increase in size, they demand higher inference costs due to the need for more expensive GPUs with larger memory, which makes it challenging to reproduce these models in addition to the restricted access to training datasets. Our study aims to reduce these inference costs and explores how far the generative capabilities of T2I models can be extended using only publicly available datasets and open-source models. To this end, by using the de facto standard text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), we present three key practices in building an efficient T2I model: (1) Knowledge distillation: we explore how to effectively distill the generation capability of SDXL into an efficient U-Net and find that self-attention is the most crucial part. (2) Data: despite fewer samples, high-resolution images with rich captions are more crucial than a larger number of low-resolution images with short captions. (3) Teacher: Step-distilled Teacher allows T2I models to reduce the noising steps. Based on these findings, we build two types of efficient text-to-image models, called KOALA-Turbo &-Lightning, with two compact U-Nets (1B & 700M), reducing the model size up to 54% and 69% of the SDXL U-Net. In particular, the KOALA-Lightning-700M is 4x faster than SDXL while still maintaining satisfactory generation quality. Moreover, unlike SDXL, our KOALA models can generate 1024px high-resolution images on consumer-grade GPUs with 8GB of VRAMs (3060Ti). We believe that our KOALA models will have a significant practical impact, serving as cost-effective alternatives to SDXL for academic researchers and general users in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqi Dong, Xingmin Lu, Ruohan Li, Wei Song, Bart van Arem, Haneen Farah</p>
<p>Abstract: The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian B\"other, Ties Robroek, Viktor Gsteiger, Robin Holzinger, Xianzhe Ma, P{\i}nar T\"oz\"un, Ana Klimovic</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world machine learning (ML) pipelines, datasets are continuously growing. Models must incorporate this new training data to improve generalization and adapt to potential distribution shifts. The cost of model retraining is proportional to how frequently the model is retrained and how much data it is trained on, which makes the naive approach of retraining from scratch each time impractical.
  We present Modyn, a data-centric end-to-end machine learning platform. Modyn's ML pipeline abstraction enables users to declaratively describe policies for continuously training a model on a growing dataset. Modyn pipelines allow users to apply data selection policies (to reduce the number of data points) and triggering policies (to reduce the number of trainings). Modyn executes and orchestrates these continuous ML training pipelines. The system is open-source and comes with an ecosystem of benchmark datasets, models, and tooling. We formally discuss how to measure the performance of ML pipelines by introducing the concept of composite models, enabling fair comparison of pipelines with different data selection and triggering policies. We empirically analyze how various data selection and triggering policies impact model accuracy, and also show that Modyn enables high throughput training with sample-level data selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hung-Chun Hsu, Bo-Jun Wu, Ming-Yi Hong, Che Lin, Chih-Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) face significant challenges with class imbalance, leading to biased inference results. To address this issue in heterogeneous graphs, we propose a novel framework that combines Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to enhance classification for underrepresented node classes. The framework incorporates an advanced edge generation and selection module, enabling the simultaneous creation of synthetic nodes and edges through adversarial learning. Unlike previous methods, which predominantly focus on homogeneous graphs due to the difficulty of representing heterogeneous graph structures in matrix form, this approach is specifically designed for heterogeneous data. Existing solutions often rely on pre-trained models to incorporate synthetic nodes, which can lead to optimization inconsistencies and mismatches in data representation. Our framework avoids these pitfalls by generating data that aligns closely with the inherent graph topology and attributes, ensuring a more cohesive integration. Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the method's superiority over baseline models, particularly in tasks focused on identifying minority node classes, with notable improvements in performance metrics such as F-score and AUC-PRC score. These findings highlight the potential of this approach for addressing critical challenges in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Haimovich, Dima Karamshuk, Fridolin Linder, Niek Tax, Milan Vojnovic</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the convergence rates and data sample sizes required for training a machine learning model using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, where data points are sampled based on either their loss value or uncertainty value. These training methods are particularly relevant for active learning and data subset selection problems. For SGD with a constant step size update, we present convergence results for linear classifiers and linearly separable datasets using squared hinge loss and similar training loss functions. Additionally, we extend our analysis to more general classifiers and datasets, considering a wide range of loss-based sampling strategies and smooth convex training loss functions. We propose a novel algorithm called Adaptive-Weight Sampling (AWS) that utilizes SGD with an adaptive step size that achieves stochastic Polyak's step size in expectation. We establish convergence rate results for AWS for smooth convex training loss functions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of AWS on various datasets by using either exact or estimated loss values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyuan Yang, Zijie Zhao, Lingming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Bugs in operating system kernels can affect billions of devices and users all over the world. As a result, a large body of research has been focused on kernel fuzzing, i.e., automatically generating syscall (system call) sequences to detect potential kernel bugs or vulnerabilities. Kernel fuzzing aims to generate valid syscall sequences guided by syscall specifications that define both the syntax and semantics of syscalls. While there has been existing work trying to automate syscall specification generation, this remains largely manual work, and a large number of important syscalls are still uncovered.
  In this paper, we propose KernelGPT, the first approach to automatically synthesizing syscall specifications via Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced kernel fuzzing. Our key insight is that LLMs have seen massive kernel code, documentation, and use cases during pre-training, and thus can automatically distill the necessary information for making valid syscalls. More specifically, KernelGPT leverages an iterative approach to automatically infer the specifications, and further debug and repair them based on the validation feedback. Our results demonstrate that KernelGPT can generate more new and valid specifications and achieve higher coverage than state-of-the-art techniques. So far, by using newly generated specifications, KernelGPT has already detected 24 new unique bugs in Linux kernel, with 12 fixed and 11 assigned with CVE numbers. Moreover, a number of specifications generated by KernelGPT have already been merged into the kernel fuzzer Syzkaller, following the request from its development team.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Tian, Yikun Han, Xiusi Chen, Wei Wang, Nitesh V. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: Transferring the reasoning capability from stronger large language models (LLMs) to smaller ones has been quite appealing, as smaller LLMs are more flexible to deploy with less expense. Among the existing solutions, knowledge distillation stands out due to its outstanding efficiency and generalization. However, existing methods suffer from several drawbacks, including limited knowledge diversity and the lack of rich contextual information. To solve the problems and facilitate the learning of compact language models, we propose TinyLLM, a new knowledge distillation paradigm to learn a small student LLM from multiple large teacher LLMs. In particular, we encourage the student LLM to not only generate the correct answers but also understand the rationales behind these answers. Given that different LLMs possess diverse reasoning skills, we guide the student model to assimilate knowledge from various teacher LLMs. We further introduce an in-context example generator and a teacher-forcing Chain-of-Thought strategy to ensure that the rationales are accurate and grounded in contextually appropriate scenarios. Extensive experiments on six datasets across two reasoning tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. Results show that TinyLLM can outperform large teacher LLMs significantly, despite a considerably smaller model size. The source code is available at: https://github.com/YikunHan42/TinyLLM.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05396">TASER: Temporal Adaptive Sampling for Fast and Accurate Dynamic Graph Representation Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gangda Deng, Hongkuan Zhou, Hanqing Zeng, Yinglong Xia, Christopher Leung, Jianbo Li, Rajgopal Kannan, Viktor Prasanna</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various high-impact applications, including fraud detection and content recommendation. Despite the success of TGNNs, they are prone to the prevalent noise found in real-world dynamic graphs like time-deprecated links and skewed interaction distribution. The noise causes two critical issues that significantly compromise the accuracy of TGNNs: (1) models are supervised by inferior interactions, and (2) noisy input induces high variance in the aggregated messages. However, current TGNN denoising techniques do not consider the diverse and dynamic noise pattern of each node. In addition, they also suffer from the excessive mini-batch generation overheads caused by traversing more neighbors. We believe the remedy for fast and accurate TGNNs lies in temporal adaptive sampling. In this work, we propose TASER, the first adaptive sampling method for TGNNs optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. TASER adapts its mini-batch selection based on training dynamics and temporal neighbor selection based on the contextual, structural, and temporal properties of past interactions. To alleviate the bottleneck in mini-batch generation, TASER implements a pure GPU-based temporal neighbor finder and a dedicated GPU feature cache. We evaluate the performance of TASER using two state-of-the-art backbone TGNNs. On five popular datasets, TASER outperforms the corresponding baselines by an average of 2.3% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) while achieving an average of 5.1x speedup in training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Lin, Yiling Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Classic principal-agent problems such as Stackelberg games, contract design, and Bayesian persuasion, often assume that the agent is able to best respond to the principal's committed strategy. We study repeated generalized principal-agent problems under the assumption that the principal does not have commitment power and the agent uses algorithms to learn to respond to the principal. We reduce this problem to a one-shot generalized principal-agent problem where the agent approximately best responds. Using this reduction, we show that: (1) If the agent uses contextual no-regret learning algorithms with regret $\mathrm{Reg}(T)$, then the principal can guarantee utility at least $U^* - \Theta\big(\sqrt{\tfrac{\mathrm{Reg}(T)}{T}}\big)$, where $U^*$ is the principal's optimal utility in the classic model with a best-responding agent. (2) If the agent uses contextual no-swap-regret learning algorithms with swap-regret $\mathrm{SReg}(T)$, then the principal cannot obtain utility more than $U^* + O(\frac{\mathrm{SReg(T)}}{T})$. But (3) if the agent uses mean-based learning algorithms (which can be no-regret but not no-swap-regret), then the principal can sometimes do significantly better than $U^*$. These results not only refine previous results in Stackelberg games and contract design, but also lead to new results for Bayesian persuasion with a learning agent and all generalized principal-agent problems where the agent does not have private information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Li, Wenyi Tan, Chenxing Zhao, Shuangju Zhou, Xinkai Liang, Quan Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to neural rendering, specifically tailored for adversarial camouflage, within an extensive 3D rendering framework. Our method, named FPA, goes beyond traditional techniques by faithfully simulating lighting conditions and material variations, ensuring a nuanced and realistic representation of textures on a 3D target. To achieve this, we employ a generative approach that learns adversarial patterns from a diffusion model. This involves incorporating a specially designed adversarial loss and covert constraint loss to guarantee the adversarial and covert nature of the camouflage in the physical world. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the proposed camouflage in sticker mode, demonstrating its ability to cover the target without compromising adversarial information. Through empirical and physical experiments, FPA exhibits strong performance in terms of attack success rate and transferability. Additionally, the designed sticker-mode camouflage, coupled with a concealment constraint, adapts to the environment, yielding diverse styles of texture. Our findings highlight the versatility and efficacy of the FPA approach in adversarial camouflage applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandrajit Bajaj, Minh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite extensive research, time series classification and forecasting on noisy data remain highly challenging. The main difficulties lie in finding suitable mathematical concepts to describe time series and effectively separate noise from the true signals. Unlike traditional methods treating time series as static vectors or fixed sequences, we propose a novel framework that views each time series, regardless of length, as a realization of a continuous-time stochastic process. This mathematical approach captures dependencies across timestamps and detects hidden, time-varying signals within the noise. However, real-world data often involves multiple distinct dynamics, making it insufficient to model the entire process with a single stochastic model. To address this, we assign each dynamic a unique signature vector and introduce the concept of "most informative timestamps" to infer a sparse approximation of the individual dynamics from these vectors. The resulting model, called Motion Code, includes parameters that fully capture diverse underlying dynamics in an integrated manner, enabling simultaneous classification and forecasting of time series. Extensive experiments on noisy datasets, including real-world Parkinson's disease sensor tracking, demonstrate Motion Code's strong performance against established benchmarks for time series classification and forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Supreeth Narasimhaswamy, Uttaran Bhattacharya, Xiang Chen, Ishita Dasgupta, Saayan Mitra, Minh Hoai</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models can generate high-quality humans, but realism is lost when generating hands. Common artifacts include irregular hand poses, shapes, incorrect numbers of fingers, and physically implausible finger orientations. To generate images with realistic hands, we propose a novel diffusion-based architecture called HanDiffuser that achieves realism by injecting hand embeddings in the generative process. HanDiffuser consists of two components: a Text-to-Hand-Params diffusion model to generate SMPL-Body and MANO-Hand parameters from input text prompts, and a Text-Guided Hand-Params-to-Image diffusion model to synthesize images by conditioning on the prompts and hand parameters generated by the previous component. We incorporate multiple aspects of hand representation, including 3D shapes and joint-level finger positions, orientations and articulations, for robust learning and reliable performance during inference. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and perform user studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generating images with high-quality hands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel Torne, Anthony Simeonov, Zechu Li, April Chan, Tao Chen, Abhishek Gupta, Pulkit Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning methods need significant human supervision to learn policies robust to changes in object poses, physical disturbances, and visual distractors. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, can explore the environment autonomously to learn robust behaviors but may require impractical amounts of unsafe real-world data collection. To learn performant, robust policies without the burden of unsafe real-world data collection or extensive human supervision, we propose RialTo, a system for robustifying real-world imitation learning policies via reinforcement learning in "digital twin" simulation environments constructed on the fly from small amounts of real-world data. To enable this real-to-sim-to-real pipeline, RialTo proposes an easy-to-use interface for quickly scanning and constructing digital twins of real-world environments. We also introduce a novel "inverse distillation" procedure for bringing real-world demonstrations into simulated environments for efficient fine-tuning, with minimal human intervention and engineering required. We evaluate RialTo across a variety of robotic manipulation problems in the real world, such as robustly stacking dishes on a rack, placing books on a shelf, and six other tasks. RialTo increases (over 67%) in policy robustness without requiring extensive human data collection. Project website and videos at https://real-to-sim-to-real.github.io/RialTo/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Megha Srivastava, Simran Arora, Dan Boneh</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing compute demands of AI systems have led to the emergence of services that train models on behalf of clients lacking necessary resources. However, ensuring correctness of training and guarding against potential training-time attacks, such as data poisoning and backdoors, poses challenges. Existing works on verifiable training largely fall into two classes: proof-based systems, which are difficult to scale, and ``optimistic'' methods that consider a third-party auditor who can replicate the training process and contest the trainer. A key challenge with the latter is that nondeterminism between GPU types during training prevents exact replication of the training process, resulting in schemes that are non-robust. We propose a method that combines training in a higher precision than the target, rounding after intermediate computations, and sharing rounding decisions based on an adaptive thresholding procedure, to successfully control for nondeterminism. Across three different NVIDIA GPUs (A40, Titan XP, RTX 2080 Ti), we achieve exact training replication at FP32 precision for both full-training and fine-tuning of ResNet-50 (23M) and GPT-2 (117M) models. Our verifiable training scheme significantly decreases the storage and time costs compared to proof-based systems, and is publicly released at https://github.com/meghabyte/verifiable-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Ali Labbaf-Khaniki, Mohammad Manthouri, Hanieh Ajami</p>
<p>Abstract: Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is a crucial task for ensuring the safety and efficiency of industrial processes. We propose a novel FDD methodology for the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP), a widely used benchmark for chemical process control. The model employs two separate Transformer branches, enabling independent processing of input data and potential extraction of diverse information. A novel attention mechanism, Gated Dynamic Learnable Attention (GDLAttention), is introduced which integrates a gating mechanism and dynamic learning capabilities. The gating mechanism modulates the attention weights, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input. The dynamic learning approach adapts the attention strategy during training, potentially leading to improved performance. The attention mechanism uses a bilinear similarity function, providing greater flexibility in capturing complex relationships between query and key vectors. In order to assess the effectiveness of our approach, we tested it against 21 and 18 distinct fault scenarios in TEP, and compared its performance with several established FDD techniques. The outcomes indicate that the method outperforms others in terms of accuracy, false alarm rate, and misclassification rate. This underscores the robustness and efficacy of the approach for FDD in intricate industrial processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: The existing methods for evaluating the inference abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been predominantly results-centric, making it challenging to assess the inference process comprehensively. We introduce a novel approach using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark to evaluate the inference and contextual understanding abilities of LLMs in a process-centric manner, focusing on three key components from the Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH): Logical Coherence, Compositionality, and Productivity. Our carefully designed experiments reveal that while LLMs demonstrate some inference capabilities, they still significantly lag behind human-level reasoning in these three aspects. The main contribution of this paper lies in introducing the LoTH perspective, which provides a method for evaluating the reasoning process that conventional results-oriented approaches fail to capture, thereby offering new insights into the development of human-level reasoning in artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The diffusion model has long been plagued by scalability and quadratic complexity issues, especially within transformer-based structures. In this study, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of a State-Space Model called Mamba to extend its applicability to visual data generation. Firstly, we identify a critical oversight in most current Mamba-based vision methods, namely the lack of consideration for spatial continuity in the scan scheme of Mamba. Secondly, building upon this insight, we introduce a simple, plug-and-play, zero-parameter method named Zigzag Mamba, which outperforms Mamba-based baselines and demonstrates improved speed and memory utilization compared to transformer-based baselines. Lastly, we integrate Zigzag Mamba with the Stochastic Interpolant framework to investigate the scalability of the model on large-resolution visual datasets, such as FacesHQ $1024\times 1024$ and UCF101, MultiModal-CelebA-HQ, and MS COCO $256\times 256$ .

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chih-Chung Hsu, Chia-Ming Lee, Yi-Shiuan Chou</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Vision Transformer-based approaches for low-level vision tasks have achieved widespread success. Unlike CNN-based models, Transformers are more adept at capturing long-range dependencies, enabling the reconstruction of images utilizing non-local information. In the domain of super-resolution, Swin-transformer-based models have become mainstream due to their capability of global spatial information modeling and their shifting-window attention mechanism that facilitates the interchange of information between different windows. Many researchers have enhanced model performance by expanding the receptive fields or designing meticulous networks, yielding commendable results. However, we observed that it is a general phenomenon for the feature map intensity to be abruptly suppressed to small values towards the network's end. This implies an information bottleneck and a diminishment of spatial information, implicitly limiting the model's potential. To address this, we propose the Dense-residual-connected Transformer (DRCT), aimed at mitigating the loss of spatial information and stabilizing the information flow through dense-residual connections between layers, thereby unleashing the model's potential and saving the model away from information bottleneck. Experiment results indicate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and performs commendably at the NTIRE-2024 Image Super-Resolution (x4) Challenge.

<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), securing these models against malicious inputs while aligning them with human values has emerged as a critical challenge. In this paper, we investigate an important and unexplored question of whether techniques that successfully jailbreak Large Language Models (LLMs) can be equally effective in jailbreaking MLLMs. To explore this issue, we introduce JailBreakV-28K, a pioneering benchmark designed to assess the transferability of LLM jailbreak techniques to MLLMs, thereby evaluating the robustness of MLLMs against diverse jailbreak attacks. Utilizing a dataset of 2, 000 malicious queries that is also proposed in this paper, we generate 20, 000 text-based jailbreak prompts using advanced jailbreak attacks on LLMs, alongside 8, 000 image-based jailbreak inputs from recent MLLMs jailbreak attacks, our comprehensive dataset includes 28, 000 test cases across a spectrum of adversarial scenarios. Our evaluation of 10 open-source MLLMs reveals a notably high Attack Success Rate (ASR) for attacks transferred from LLMs, highlighting a critical vulnerability in MLLMs that stems from their text-processing capabilities. Our findings underscore the urgent need for future research to address alignment vulnerabilities in MLLMs from both textual and visual inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized software development, shifting from task-specific codes (Software 1.0) to neural network-based approaches (Software 2.0). However, applying this transition in engineering software presents challenges, including low surrogate model accuracy, the curse of dimensionality in inverse design, and rising complexity in physical simulations. We introduce an interpolating neural network (INN), grounded in interpolation theory and tensor decomposition, to realize Engineering Software 2.0 by advancing data training, partial differential equation solving, and parameter calibration. INN offers orders of magnitude fewer trainable/solvable parameters for comparable model accuracy than traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or physics-informed neural networks (PINN). Demonstrated in metal additive manufacturing, INN rapidly constructs an accurate surrogate model of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) heat transfer simulation, achieving sub-10-micrometer resolution for a 10 mm path in under 15 minutes on a single GPU. This makes a transformative step forward across all domains essential to engineering software.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ge Gao, Alexey Taymanov, Eduardo Salinas, Paul Mineiro, Dipendra Misra</p>
<p>Abstract: We study interactive learning of LLM-based language agents based on user edits made to the agent's output. In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness. The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent's alignment with the user's preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time. We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE that infers a description of the user's latent preference based on historic edit data. The inferred user preference descriptions are used to define prompts for generating responses in the future. This avoids fine-tuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks. Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference. However, user preference can be complex, subtle, and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER that leverages the LLM to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits. In the future, CIPHER retrieves inferred preferences from the k-closest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation. We introduce two interactive environments -- summarization and email writing, and use a GPT-4 simulated user for evaluation. On both tasks, CIPHER outperforms several baselines by achieving the lowest edit distance cost while only having a small overhead in LLM query cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haizhou Shi, Zihao Xu, Hengyi Wang, Weiyi Qin, Wenyuan Wang, Yibin Wang, Zifeng Wang, Sayna Ebrahimi, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) trained on static, pre-collected, general datasets has sparked numerous research directions and applications. One such direction addresses the non-trivial challenge of integrating pre-trained LLMs into dynamic data distributions, task structures, and user preferences. Pre-trained LLMs, when tailored for specific needs, often experience significant performance degradation in previous knowledge domains -- a phenomenon known as "catastrophic forgetting". While extensively studied in the continual learning (CL) community, it presents new manifestations in the realm of LLMs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress on LLMs within the context of CL. This survey is structured into four main sections: we first describe an overview of continually learning LLMs, consisting of two directions of continuity: vertical continuity (or vertical continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation from general to specific capabilities, and horizontal continuity (or horizontal continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation across time and domains (Section 3). We then summarize three stages of learning LLMs in the context of modern CL: Continual Pre-Training (CPT), Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP), and Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) (Section 4). Then we provide an overview of evaluation protocols for continual learning with LLMs, along with the current available data sources (Section 5). Finally, we discuss intriguing questions pertaining to continual learning for LLMs (Section 6). The full list of papers examined in this survey is available at https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/llm-continual-learning-survey.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Zhang, Weipeng Jiang, Chao Shen, Qi Li, Qian Wang, Chenhao Lin, Xiaohong Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, software systems powered by deep learning (DL) techniques have significantly facilitated people's lives in many aspects. As the backbone of these DL systems, various DL libraries undertake the underlying optimization and computation. However, like traditional software, DL libraries are not immune to bugs, which can pose serious threats to users' personal property and safety. Studying the characteristics of DL libraries, their associated bugs, and the corresponding testing methods is crucial for enhancing the security of DL systems and advancing the widespread application of DL technology. This paper provides an overview of the testing research related to various DL libraries, discusses the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, and provides guidance and reference for the application of the DL library. This paper first introduces the workflow of DL underlying libraries and the characteristics of three kinds of DL libraries involved, namely DL framework, DL compiler, and DL hardware library. It then provides definitions for DL underlying library bugs and testing. Additionally, this paper summarizes the existing testing methods and tools tailored to these DL libraries separately and analyzes their effectiveness and limitations. It also discusses the existing challenges of DL library testing and outlines potential directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugh Zhang, Jeff Da, Dean Lee, Vaughn Robinson, Catherine Wu, Will Song, Tiffany Zhao, Pranav Raja, Charlotte Zhuang, Dylan Slack, Qin Lyu, Sean Hendryx, Russell Kaplan, Michele Lunati, Summer Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. However, there is growing concern that some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of true reasoning ability. To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission Grade School Math 1000 (GSM1k). GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark, the gold standard for measuring elementary mathematical reasoning. We ensure that the two benchmarks are comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps in solution, answer magnitude, and more. When evaluating leading open- and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 8%, with several families of models showing evidence of systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes. Further analysis suggests a positive relationship (Spearman's r^2 = 0.36) between a model's probability of generating an example from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that some models may have partially memorized GSM8k. Nevertheless, many models, especially those on the frontier, show minimal signs of overfitting, and all models broadly demonstrate generalization to novel math problems guaranteed to not be in their training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Li, Tianze Xu, Xuesong Chen, Xinrui Yao, Shuchang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has witnessed rapid advancements, facilitating the creation of music, images, and other artistic forms across a wide range of industries. However, current models for image- and video-to-music synthesis struggle to capture the nuanced emotions and atmosphere conveyed by visual content. To fill this gap, we propose Mozart's Touch, a multi-modal music generation framework capable of generating music aligned with cross-modal inputs such as images, videos, and text. The framework consists of three key components: Multi-modal Captioning Module, Large Language Model (LLM) understanding \& Bridging Module, and Music Generation Module. Unlike traditional end-to-end methods, Mozart's Touch uses LLMs to accurately interpret visual elements without requiring the training or fine-tuning of music generation models, providing efficiency and transparency through clear, interpretable prompts. We also introduce the "LLM-Bridge" method to resolve the heterogeneous representation challenges between descriptive texts from different modalities. Through a series of objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that Mozart's Touch outperforms current state-of-the-art models. Our code and examples are available at https://github.com/TiffanyBlews/MozartsTouch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hirokazu Ishida, Naoki Hiraoka, Kei Okada, Masayuki Inaba</p>
<p>Abstract: Library-based methods are known to be very effective for fast motion planning by adapting an experience retrieved from a precomputed library. This article presents CoverLib, a principled approach for constructing and utilizing such a library. CoverLib iteratively adds an experience-classifier-pair to the library, where each classifier corresponds to an adaptable region of the experience within the problem space. This iterative process is an active procedure, as it selects the next experience based on its ability to effectively cover the uncovered region. During the query phase, these classifiers are utilized to select an experience that is expected to be adaptable for a given problem. Experimental results demonstrate that CoverLib effectively mitigates the trade-off between plannability and speed observed in global (e.g. sampling-based) and local (e.g. optimization-based) methods. As a result, it achieves both fast planning and high success rates over the problem domain. Moreover, due to its adaptation-algorithm-agnostic nature, CoverLib seamlessly integrates with various adaptation methods, including nonlinear programming-based and sampling-based algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Huang, Shatong Zhu, Junqiao Zhao, Hongtu Zhou, Chen Ye, Tiantian Feng, Changjun Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Value function factorization methods are commonly used in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, with QMIX receiving significant attention. Many QMIX-based methods introduce monotonicity constraints between the joint action value and individual action values to achieve decentralized execution. However, such constraints limit the representation capacity of value factorization, restricting the joint action values it can represent and hindering the learning of the optimal policy. To address this challenge, we propose the Potentially Optimal Joint Actions Weighted QMIX (POWQMIX) algorithm, which recognizes the potentially optimal joint actions and assigns h QMIX (POWQMIX) algorithm, which recognizes the potentially optimal joint actions and assigns higher weights to the corresponding losses of these joint actions during training. We theoretically prove that with such a weighted training approach the optimal policy is guaranteed to be recovered. Experiments in matrix games, difficulty-enhanced predator-prey, and StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge environments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14129">AlignGPT: Multi-modal Large Language Models with Adaptive Alignment Capability</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Zhao, Taotian Pang, Chunhui Li, Zhen Wu, Junjie Guo, Shangyu Xing, Xinyu Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely regarded as crucial in the exploration of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The core of MLLMs lies in their capability to achieve cross-modal alignment. To attain this goal, current MLLMs typically follow a two-phase training paradigm: the pre-training phase and the instruction-tuning phase. Despite their success, there are shortcomings in the modeling of alignment capabilities within these models. Firstly, during the pre-training phase, the model usually assumes that all image-text pairs are uniformly aligned, but in fact the degree of alignment between different image-text pairs is inconsistent. Secondly, the instructions currently used for finetuning incorporate a variety of tasks and different tasks usually require different levels of alignment capabilities, but previous MLLMs overlook these differentiated alignment needs. To tackle these issues, we propose a new multimodal large language model AlignGPT. In the pre-training stage, instead of treating all image-text pairs equally, we divide them into different groups according to the degrees of alignment of them. Then, the model is trained to learn the representations of different alignment levels. In the instruction-tuning phase, we adaptively combine these representations of alignment levels to meet the dynamic alignment needs of different tasks. Extensive experimental results show that our model achieves competitive performance on 12 benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoyan Luo, Yinghao Wu, Tianheng Cheng, Yong Liu, Yicheng Xiao, Hongfa Wang, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Yujiu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The newly proposed Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES) amplifies the formulation of classic RES by involving complex multiple/non-target scenarios. Recent approaches address GRES by directly extending the well-adopted RES frameworks with object-existence identification. However, these approaches tend to encode multi-granularity object information into a single representation, which makes it difficult to precisely represent comprehensive objects of different granularity. Moreover, the simple binary object-existence identification across all referent scenarios fails to specify their inherent differences, incurring ambiguity in object understanding. To tackle the above issues, we propose a \textbf{Co}unting-Aware \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}ecoding framework (CoHD) for GRES. By decoupling the intricate referring semantics into different granularity with a visual-linguistic hierarchy, and dynamic aggregating it with intra- and inter-selection, CoHD boosts multi-granularity comprehension with the reciprocal benefit of the hierarchical nature. Furthermore, we incorporate the counting ability by embodying multiple/single/non-target scenarios into count- and category-level supervision, facilitating comprehensive object perception. Experimental results on gRefCOCO, Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of CoHD which outperforms state-of-the-art GRES methods by a remarkable margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Fujii, Masashi Hatano, Hideo Saito, Hiroki Kajita</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical phase recognition has gained significant attention due to its potential to offer solutions to numerous demands of the modern operating room. However, most existing methods concentrate on minimally invasive surgery (MIS), leaving surgical phase recognition for open surgery understudied. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the scarcity of publicly available open surgery video datasets for surgical phase recognition. To address this issue, we introduce a new egocentric open surgery video dataset for phase recognition, named EgoSurgery-Phase. This dataset comprises 15 hours of real open surgery videos spanning 9 distinct surgical phases all captured using an egocentric camera attached to the surgeon's head. In addition to video, the EgoSurgery-Phase offers eye gaze. As far as we know, it is the first real open surgery video dataset for surgical phase recognition publicly available. Furthermore, inspired by the notable success of masked autoencoders (MAEs) in video understanding tasks (e.g., action recognition), we propose a gaze-guided masked autoencoder (GGMAE). Considering the regions where surgeons' gaze focuses are often critical for surgical phase recognition (e.g., surgical field), in our GGMAE, the gaze information acts as an empirical semantic richness prior to guiding the masking process, promoting better attention to semantically rich spatial regions. GGMAE significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art recognition method (6.4% in Jaccard) and the masked autoencoder-based method (3.1% in Jaccard) on EgoSurgery-Phase.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rustem Islamov, Yuan Gao, Sebastian U. Stich</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication efficiency has garnered significant attention as it is considered the main bottleneck for large-scale decentralized Machine Learning applications in distributed and federated settings. In this regime, clients are restricted to transmitting small amounts of quantized information to their neighbors over a communication graph. Numerous endeavors have been made to address this challenging problem by developing algorithms with compressed communication for decentralized non-convex optimization problems. Despite considerable efforts, the current results suffer from various issues such as non-scalability with the number of clients, requirements for large batches, or bounded gradient assumption. In this paper, we introduce MoTEF, a novel approach that integrates communication compression with Momentum Tracking and Error Feedback. Our analysis demonstrates that MoTEF achieves most of the desired properties, and significantly outperforms existing methods under arbitrary data heterogeneity. We provide numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings and confirm the practical superiority of MoTEF.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success for a variety of tasks such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. However, the use of GNNs (and machine learning more generally) to solve combinatorial optimization (CO) problems is much less explored. Here, we introduce GCON, a novel GNN architecture that leverages a complex filter bank and localized attention mechanisms to solve CO problems on graphs. We show how our method differentiates itself from prior GNN-based CO solvers and how it can be effectively applied to the maximum cut, minimum dominating set, and maximum clique problems in a unsupervised learning setting. GCON is competitive across all tasks and consistently outperforms other specialized GNN-based approaches, and is on par with the powerful Gurobi solver on the max-cut problem.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Fujii, Hideo Saito, Hiroki Kajita</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical tool detection is a fundamental task for understanding egocentric open surgery videos. However, detecting surgical tools presents significant challenges due to their highly imbalanced class distribution, similar shapes and similar textures, and heavy occlusion. The lack of a comprehensive large-scale dataset compounds these challenges. In this paper, we introduce EgoSurgery-Tool, an extension of the existing EgoSurgery-Phase dataset, which contains real open surgery videos captured using an egocentric camera attached to the surgeon's head, along with phase annotations. EgoSurgery-Tool has been densely annotated with surgical tools and comprises over 49K surgical tool bounding boxes across 15 categories, constituting a large-scale surgical tool detection dataset. EgoSurgery-Tool also provides annotations for hand detection with over 46K hand-bounding boxes, capturing hand-object interactions that are crucial for understanding activities in egocentric open surgery. EgoSurgery-Tool is superior to existing datasets due to its larger scale, greater variety of surgical tools, more annotations, and denser scenes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of EgoSurgery-Tool using nine popular object detectors to assess their effectiveness in both surgical tool and hand detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) combine unimodal encoders and large language models (LLMs) to perform multimodal tasks. Despite recent advancements towards the interpretability of these models, understanding internal representations of LMMs remains largely a mystery. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the interpretation of LMMs. We propose a dictionary learning based approach, applied to the representation of tokens. The elements of the learned dictionary correspond to our proposed concepts. We show that these concepts are well semantically grounded in both vision and text. Thus we refer to these as ``multi-modal concepts''. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the results of the learnt concepts. We show that the extracted multimodal concepts are useful to interpret representations of test samples. Finally, we evaluate the disentanglement between different concepts and the quality of grounding concepts visually and textually. Our implementation is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) augment graph structures with natural language descriptions, facilitating detailed depictions of data and their interconnections across various real-world settings. However, existing TAG datasets predominantly feature textual information only at the nodes, with edges typically represented by mere binary or categorical attributes. This lack of rich textual edge annotations significantly limits the exploration of contextual relationships between entities, hindering deeper insights into graph-structured data. To address this gap, we introduce Textual-Edge Graphs Datasets and Benchmark (TEG-DB), a comprehensive and diverse collection of benchmark textual-edge datasets featuring rich textual descriptions on nodes and edges. The TEG-DB datasets are large-scale and encompass a wide range of domains, from citation networks to social networks. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments on TEG-DB to assess the extent to which current techniques, including pre-trained language models, graph neural networks, and their combinations, can utilize textual node and edge information. Our goal is to elicit advancements in textual-edge graph research, specifically in developing methodologies that exploit rich textual node and edge descriptions to enhance graph analysis and provide deeper insights into complex real-world networks. The entire TEG-DB project is publicly accessible as an open-source repository on Github, accessible at https://github.com/Zhuofeng-Li/TEG-Benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian Liu, Huixin Zhang, Shubham Parashar, Shu Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot recognition (FSR) aims to train a classification model with only a few labeled examples of each concept concerned by a downstream task, where data annotation cost can be prohibitively high. We develop methods to solve FSR by leveraging a pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM). We particularly explore retrieval-augmented learning (RAL), which retrieves data from the VLM's pretraining set to learn better models for serving downstream tasks. RAL has been widely studied in zero-shot recognition but remains under-explored in FSR. Although applying RAL to FSR may seem straightforward, we observe interesting and novel challenges and opportunities. First, somewhat surprisingly, finetuning a VLM on a large amount of retrieved data underperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods. This is due to the imbalanced distribution of retrieved data and its domain gaps with the few-shot examples in the downstream task. Second, more surprisingly, we find that simply finetuning a VLM solely on few-shot examples significantly outperforms previous FSR methods, and finetuning on the mix of retrieved and few-shot data yields even better results. Third, to mitigate the imbalanced distribution and domain gap issues, we propose Stage-Wise retrieval-Augmented fineTuning (SWAT), which involves end-to-end finetuning on mixed data in the first stage and retraining the classifier on the few-shot data in the second stage. Extensive experiments on nine popular benchmarks demonstrate that SWAT significantly outperforms previous methods by $>$6% accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Intent inferral on a hand orthosis for stroke patients is challenging due to the difficulty of data collection. Additionally, EMG signals exhibit significant variations across different conditions, sessions, and subjects, making it hard for classifiers to generalize. Traditional approaches require a large labeled dataset from the new condition, session, or subject to train intent classifiers; however, this data collection process is burdensome and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose ChatEMG, an autoregressive generative model that can generate synthetic EMG signals conditioned on prompts (i.e., a given sequence of EMG signals). ChatEMG enables us to collect only a small dataset from the new condition, session, or subject and expand it with synthetic samples conditioned on prompts from this new context. ChatEMG leverages a vast repository of previous data via generative training while still remaining context-specific via prompting. Our experiments show that these synthetic samples are classifier-agnostic and can improve intent inferral accuracy for different types of classifiers. We demonstrate that our complete approach can be integrated into a single patient session, including the use of the classifier for functional orthosis-assisted tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an intent classifier trained partially on synthetic data has been deployed for functional control of an orthosis by a stroke survivor.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuefei Ning, Zifu Wang, Shiyao Li, Zinan Lin, Peiran Yao, Tianyu Fu, Matthew B. Blaschko, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Teaching to improve student models (e.g., knowledge distillation) is an extensively studied methodology in LLMs. However, for humans, teaching improves not only students but also teachers, by fostering more rigorous and clear reasoning as well as knowledge building. We ask: Can LLMs also learn by teaching (LbT) for better reasoning? If the answer is yes, we can potentially unlock the possibility of continuously advancing the models without solely relying on human-produced data or stronger models. In this paper, we provide a preliminary exploration on this question. We show that LbT ideas can be incorporated into existing LLM training/prompting pipelines and bring improvements. Specifically, we design three methods, each mimicking one of the three levels of LbT: observing students' feedback, learning from the feedback, and learning iteratively, with the goals of improving answer accuracy without training or improving models' inherent capability with fine-tuning. We reveal some findings: (1) Teaching materials that make it easier for students to learn have clearer and more accurate logic when using in-context learning as the student's "learning" method; (2) Weak-to-strong generalization: LbT might help improve strong models by teaching weak models; (3) Diversity in students might help: teaching multiple students could be better than teaching one student or the teacher itself. We hope that our exploration can inspire future research on LbT and more broadly adopting the advanced techniques in education to improve LLMs. The code and website are at https://github.com/imagination-research/lbt and https://sites.google.com/view/llm-learning-by-teaching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael A. Lepori, Alexa R. Tartaglini, Wai Keen Vong, Thomas Serre, Brenden M. Lake, Ellie Pavlick</p>
<p>Abstract: Though vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of settings, they exhibit surprising failures when performing tasks involving visual relations. This begs the question: how do ViTs attempt to perform tasks that require computing visual relations between objects? Prior efforts to interpret ViTs tend to focus on characterizing relevant low-level visual features. In contrast, we adopt methods from mechanistic interpretability to study the higher-level visual algorithms that ViTs use to perform abstract visual reasoning. We present a case study of a fundamental, yet surprisingly difficult, relational reasoning task: judging whether two visual entities are the same or different. We find that pretrained ViTs fine-tuned on this task often exhibit two qualitatively different stages of processing despite having no obvious inductive biases to do so: 1) a perceptual stage wherein local object features are extracted and stored in a disentangled representation, and 2) a relational stage wherein object representations are compared. In the second stage, we find evidence that ViTs can learn to represent somewhat abstract visual relations, a capability that has long been considered out of reach for artificial neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate that failures at either stage can prevent a model from learning a generalizable solution to our fairly simple tasks. By understanding ViTs in terms of discrete processing stages, one can more precisely diagnose and rectify shortcomings of existing and future models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> You Huang, Wenbin Lai, Jiayi Ji, Liujuan Cao, Shengchuan Zhang, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced interactive segmentation but is limited by the high computational cost on high-resolution images. This requires downsampling to meet GPU constraints, sacrificing the fine-grained details needed for high-precision interactive segmentation. To address SAM's limitations, we focus on visual length extrapolation and propose a lightweight model named HRSAM. The extrapolation enables HRSAM trained on low resolutions to generalize to high resolutions. We begin by finding the link between the extrapolation and attention scores, which leads us to base HRSAM on Swin attention. We then introduce the Flexible Local Attention (FLA) framework, using CUDA-optimized Efficient Memory Attention to accelerate HRSAM. Within FLA, we implement Flash Swin attention, achieving over a 35% speedup compared to traditional Swin attention, and propose a KV-only padding mechanism to enhance extrapolation. We also develop the Cycle-scan module that uses State Space models to efficiently expand HRSAM's receptive field. We further develop the HRSAM++ within FLA by adding an anchor map, providing multi-scale data augmentation for the extrapolation and a larger receptive field at slight computational cost. Experiments show that, under standard training, HRSAMs surpass the previous SOTA with only 38% of the latency. With SAM-distillation, the extrapolation enables HRSAMs to outperform the teacher model at lower latency. Further finetuning achieves performance significantly exceeding the previous SOTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ana-Cristina Rogoz, Maria Ilinca Nechita, Radu Tudor Ionescu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce PoPreRo, the first dataset for Popularity Prediction of Romanian posts collected from Reddit. The PoPreRo dataset includes a varied compilation of post samples from five distinct subreddits of Romania, totaling 28,107 data samples. Along with our novel dataset, we introduce a set of competitive models to be used as baselines for future research. Interestingly, the top-scoring model achieves an accuracy of 61.35% and a macro F1 score of 60.60% on the test set, indicating that the popularity prediction task on PoPreRo is very challenging. Further investigations based on few-shot prompting the Falcon-7B Large Language Model also point in the same direction. We thus believe that PoPreRo is a valuable resource that can be used to evaluate models on predicting the popularity of social media posts in Romanian. We release our dataset at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/PoPreRo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander David Goldie, Chris Lu, Matthew Thomas Jackson, Shimon Whiteson, Jakob Nicolaus Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) holds great potential for decision making in the real world, it suffers from a number of unique difficulties which often need specific consideration. In particular: it is highly non-stationary; suffers from high degrees of plasticity loss; and requires exploration to prevent premature convergence to local optima and maximize return. In this paper, we consider whether learned optimization can help overcome these problems. Our method, Learned Optimization for Plasticity, Exploration and Non-stationarity (OPEN), meta-learns an update rule whose input features and output structure are informed by previously proposed solutions to these difficulties. We show that our parameterization is flexible enough to enable meta-learning in diverse learning contexts, including the ability to use stochasticity for exploration. Our experiments demonstrate that when meta-trained on single and small sets of environments, OPEN outperforms or equals traditionally used optimizers. Furthermore, OPEN shows strong generalization characteristics across a range of environments and agent architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Wang, Chao Zhang, Qiyang Zhao, Hang Zou, Samson Lasaulce, Giuseppe Valenzise, Zhuo He, Merouane Debbah</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of wireless sensing technologies, using signals such as Wi-Fi, infrared, and RF to gather environmental data, has significantly advanced within Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Among these, Radio Frequency (RF) sensing stands out for its cost-effective and non-intrusive monitoring of human activities and environmental changes. However, traditional RF sensing methods face significant challenges, including noise, interference, incomplete data, and high deployment costs, which limit their effectiveness and scalability. This paper investigates the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) to overcome these limitations within the IoT ecosystem. We provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art GenAI techniques, focusing on their application to RF sensing problems. By generating high-quality synthetic data, enhancing signal quality, and integrating multi-modal data, GenAI offers robust solutions for RF environment reconstruction, localization, and imaging. Additionally, GenAI's ability to generalize enables IoT devices to adapt to new environments and unseen tasks, improving their efficiency and performance. The main contributions of this article include a detailed analysis of the challenges in RF sensing, the presentation of innovative GenAI-based solutions, and the proposal of a unified framework for diverse RF sensing tasks. Through case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating GenAI models, leading to advanced, scalable, and intelligent IoT systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotong Li, Fan Zhang, Haiwen Diao, Yueze Wang, Xinlong Wang, Ling-Yu Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly emphasize complex understanding of various visual elements, including multiple objects, text information, and spatial relations. Their development for comprehensive visual perception hinges on the availability of high-quality image-text datasets that offer diverse visual elements and throughout image descriptions. However, the scarcity of such hyper-detailed datasets currently hinders progress within the MLLM community. The bottleneck stems from the limited perceptual capabilities of current caption engines, which fall short in providing complete and accurate annotations. To facilitate the cutting-edge research of MLLMs on comprehensive vision perception, we thereby propose Perceptual Fusion, using a low-budget but highly effective caption engine for complete and accurate image descriptions. Specifically, Perceptual Fusion integrates diverse perception experts as image priors to provide explicit information on visual elements and adopts an efficient MLLM as a centric pivot to mimic advanced MLLMs' perception abilities. We carefully select 1M highly representative images from uncurated LAION dataset and generate dense descriptions using our engine, dubbed DenseFusion-1M. Extensive experiments validate that our engine outperforms its counterparts, where the resulting dataset significantly improves the perception and cognition abilities of existing MLLMs across diverse vision-language benchmarks, especially with high-resolution images as inputs. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/baaivision/DenseFusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengkun Jiao, Xinlan Wu, Bin Zhu, Jingjing Chen, Chong-Wah Ngo, Yugang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have significantly advanced a variety of vision-language tasks. The scalability and availability of high-quality training data play a pivotal role in the success of LMMs. In the realm of food, while comprehensive food datasets such as Recipe1M offer an abundance of ingredient and recipe information, they often fall short of providing ample data for nutritional analysis. The Recipe1M+ dataset, despite offering a subset for nutritional evaluation, is limited in the scale and accuracy of nutrition information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-Food, a unified food dataset that comprises over 100,000 images with various food labels, including categories, ingredients, recipes, and ingredient-level nutritional information. Uni-Food is designed to provide a more holistic approach to food data analysis, thereby enhancing the performance and capabilities of LMMs in this domain. To mitigate the conflicts arising from multi-task supervision during fine-tuning of LMMs, we introduce a novel Linear Rectification Mixture of Diverse Experts (RoDE) approach. RoDE utilizes a diverse array of experts to address tasks of varying complexity, thereby facilitating the coordination of trainable parameters, i.e., it allocates more parameters for more complex tasks and, conversely, fewer parameters for simpler tasks. RoDE implements linear rectification union to refine the router's functionality, thereby enhancing the efficiency of sparse task allocation. These design choices endow RoDE with features that ensure GPU memory efficiency and ease of optimization. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing the inherent challenges of food-related multitasking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Wang, Antonis Antoniades, Yanai Elazar, Alfonso Amayuelas, Alon Albalak, Kexun Zhang, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether these models genuinely generalize to unseen tasks or predominantly rely on memorizing vast amounts of pretraining data. To explore this issue, we introduce an extended concept of memorization, distributional memorization, which measures the correlation between the LLM output probabilities and the pretraining data frequency. To effectively capture task-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language model, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related $n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using the Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate four distinct tasks: machine translation, factual question answering, world knowledge understanding, and math reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with the strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while model performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual question answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine translation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more novel outputs. This study demonstrates that memorization plays a larger role in simpler, knowledge-intensive tasks, while generalization is the key for harder, reasoning-based tasks, providing a scalable method for analyzing large pretraining corpora in greater depth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihan Ren, Junpeng Zhang, Yang Xu, Yue Xin, Dongrui Liu, Quanshi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proves the two-phase dynamics of a deep neural network (DNN) learning interactions. Despite the long disappointing view of the faithfulness of post-hoc explanation of a DNN, a series of theorems have been proven in recent years to show that for a given input sample, a small set of interactions between input variables can be considered as primitive inference patterns that faithfully represent a DNN's detailed inference logic on that sample. Particularly, Zhang et al. have observed that various DNNs all learn interactions of different complexities in two distinct phases, and this two-phase dynamics well explains how a DNN changes from under-fitting to over-fitting. Therefore, in this study, we mathematically prove the two-phase dynamics of interactions, providing a theoretical mechanism for how the generalization power of a DNN changes during the training process. Experiments show that our theory well predicts the real dynamics of interactions on different DNNs trained for various tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Igor V. Tetko, Ruud van Deursen, Guillaume Godin</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization is very frequently employed in machine learning. However, an optimization of a large space of parameters could result in overfitting of models. In recent studies on solubility prediction the authors collected seven thermodynamic and kinetic solubility datasets from different data sources. They used state-of-the-art graph-based methods and compared models developed for each dataset using different data cleaning protocols and hyperparameter optimization. In our study we showed that hyperparameter optimization did not always result in better models, possibly due to overfitting when using the same statistical measures. Similar results could be calculated using pre-set hyperparameters, reducing the computational effort by around 10,000 times. We also extended the previous analysis by adding a representation learning method based on Natural Language Processing of smiles called Transformer CNN. We show that across all analyzed sets using exactly the same protocol, Transformer CNN provided better results than graph-based methods for 26 out of 28 pairwise comparisons by using only a tiny fraction of time as compared to other methods. Last but not least we stressed the importance of comparing calculation results using exactly the same statistical measures.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07435">Real-world validation of safe reinforcement learning, model predictive control and decision tree-based home energy management systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Ruddick, Glenn Ceusters, Gilles Van Kriekinge, Evgenii Genov, Cedric De Cauwer, Thierry Coosemans, Maarten Messagie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning based energy management approaches, specifically reinforcement learning with a safety layer (OptLayerPolicy) and a metaheuristic algorithm generating a decision tree control policy (TreeC), have shown promise. However, their effectiveness has only been demonstrated in computer simulations. This paper presents the real-world validation of these methods, comparing against model predictive control and simple rule-based control benchmark. The experiments were conducted on the electrical installation of 4 reproductions of residential houses, which all have their own battery, photovoltaic and dynamic load system emulating a non-controllable electrical load and a controllable electric vehicle charger. The results show that the simple rules, TreeC, and model predictive control-based methods achieved similar costs, with a difference of only 0.6%. The reinforcement learning based method, still in its training phase, obtained a cost 25.5\% higher to the other methods. Additional simulations show that the costs can be further reduced by using a more representative training dataset for TreeC and addressing errors in the model predictive control implementation caused by its reliance on accurate data from various sources. The OptLayerPolicy safety layer allows safe online training of a reinforcement learning agent in the real-world, given an accurate constraint function formulation. The proposed safety layer method remains error-prone, nonetheless, it is found beneficial for all investigated methods. The TreeC method, which does require building a realistic simulation for training, exhibits the safest operational performance, exceeding the grid limit by only 27.1 Wh compared to 593.9 Wh for reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangxiang Shen, Zheng Wan, Lingfeng Wen, Licheng Sun, Ou Yang Ming Jie, JiJUn Cheng, Xuan Tang, Xian Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The crystal structure can be simplified as a periodic point set repeating across the entire three-dimensional space along an underlying lattice. Traditionally, methods for representing crystals rely on descriptors like lattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups to characterize the structure. However, in reality, atoms in material always vibrate above absolute zero, causing continuous fluctuations in their positions. This dynamic behavior disrupts the underlying periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based on static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under even slight perturbations. To this end, chemists proposed the Pairwise Distance Distribution (PDD) method, which has been used to distinguish all periodic structures in the world's largest real materials collection, the Cambridge Structural Database. However, achieving the completeness of PDD requires defining a large number of neighboring atoms, resulting in high computational costs. Moreover, it does not account for atomic information, making it challenging to directly apply PDD to crystal material property prediction tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the atom-Weighted Pairwise Distance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution (UPDD) for the first time, incorporating them into the construction of multi-edge crystal graphs. Based on this, we further developed WPDDFormer and UPDDFormer, graph transformer architecture constructed using WPDD and UPDD crystal graphs. We demonstrate that this method maintains the continuity and completeness of crystal graphs even under slight perturbations in atomic positions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haisheng Su, Feixiang Song, Cong Ma, Wei Wu, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable embodied perception from an egocentric perspective is challenging yet essential for autonomous navigation technology of intelligent mobile agents. With the growing demand of social robotics, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of egocentric perceptual tasks related to navigation in both crowded and unstructured environments. Due to the complexity of environmental conditions and difficulty of surrounding obstacles owing to truncation and occlusion, the perception capability under this circumstance is still inferior. To further enhance the intelligence of mobile robots, in this paper, we setup an egocentric multi-sensor data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view from ego-perspective, capturing either near or farther areas. Meanwhile, a large-scale multimodal dataset is constructed, named RoboSense, to facilitate egocentric robot perception. Specifically, RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\times$ and $18\times$ as many annotations of surrounding obstacles within near ranges as the previous datasets collected for autonomous driving scenarios such as KITTI and nuScenes. Moreover, we define a novel matching criterion for near-field 3D perception and prediction metrics. Based on RoboSense, we formulate 6 popular tasks to facilitate the future research development, where the detailed analysis as well as benchmarks are also provided accordingly. Data desensitization measures have been conducted for privacy protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxuan Wang, Xiaocong Li, Lihao Zheng, Adrish Bhaumik, Prahlad Vadakkepat</p>
<p>Abstract: Controller tuning and optimization have been among the most fundamental problems in robotics and mechatronic systems. The traditional methodology is usually model-based, but its performance heavily relies on an accurate mathematical system model. In control applications with complex dynamics, obtaining a precise model is often challenging, leading us towards a data-driven approach. While various researchers have explored the optimization of a single controller, it remains a challenge to obtain the optimal controller parameters safely and efficiently when multiple controllers are involved. In this paper, we propose SafeCtrlBO to optimize multiple controllers simultaneously and safely. We simplify the exploration process in safe Bayesian optimization, reducing computational effort without sacrificing expansion capability. Additionally, we use additive kernels to enhance the efficiency of Gaussian process updates for unknown functions. Hardware experimental results on a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) demonstrate that compared to existing safe Bayesian optimization algorithms, SafeCtrlBO can obtain optimal parameters more efficiently while ensuring safety.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing keyword spotting (KWS) systems primarily rely on predefined keyword phrases. However, the ability to recognize customized keywords is crucial for tailoring interactions with intelligent devices.

This framework aims to effectively learn speaker-invariant and linguistic-informative embeddings for QbyE KWS tasks. Within this framework, we investigate three distinct network architectures for encoder modeling: LiCoNet, Conformer and ECAPA_TDNN. The experimental results on a substantial internal dataset of $629$ speakers have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed QbyE framework in maximizing the potential of simpler models such as LiCoNet. Particularly, LiCoNet, which is 13x more efficient, achieves comparable performance to the computationally intensive Conformer model (1.98% vs. 1.63\% FRR at 0.3 FAs/Hr).</p>

<p>Abstract: One-shot voice conversion(VC) aims to change the timbre of any source speech to match that of the target speaker with only one speech sample. Existing style transfer-based VC methods relied on speech representation disentanglement and suffered from accurately and independently encoding each speech component and recomposing back to converted speech effectively. To tackle this, we proposed Pureformer-VC, which utilizes Conformer blocks to build a disentangled encoder, and Zipformer blocks to build a style transfer decoder as the generator. In the decoder, we used effective styleformer blocks to integrate speaker characteristics effectively into the generated speech. The models used the generative VAE loss for encoding components and triplet loss for unsupervised discriminative training. We applied the styleformer method to Zipformer's shared weights for style transfer. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves comparable subjective scores and exhibits improvements in objective metrics compared to existing methods in a one-shot voice conversion scenario.</p>

<p>Abstract: Complex 3D scene understanding has gained increasing attention, with scene encoding strategies playing a crucial role in this success. However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Pohland, Claire Tomlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.</p>

One requirement is that decisions of ML systems in high-risk applications should be human-understandable. The field of "explainable artificial intelligence" (XAI) seemingly addresses this need. However, in its current form, XAI is unfit to provide quality control for ML; it itself needs scrutiny. Popular XAI methods cannot reliably answer important questions about ML models, their training data, or a given test input. We recapitulate results demonstrating that popular XAI methods systematically attribute importance to input features that are independent of the prediction target. This limits their utility for purposes such as model and data (in)validation, model improvement, and scientific discovery. We argue that the fundamental reason for this limitation is that current XAI methods do not address well-defined problems and are not evaluated against objective criteria of explanation correctness. Researchers should formally define the problems they intend to solve first and then design methods accordingly. This will lead to notions of explanation correctness that can be theoretically verified and objective metrics of explanation performance that can be assessed using ground-truth data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Li, Zihan Chen, Kai Fong Ernest Chong, Bikramjit Das, Tony Q. S. Quek, Howard H. Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging over-the-air computations for model aggregation is an effective approach to cope with the communication bottleneck in federated edge learning. By exploiting the superposition properties of multi-access channels, this approach facilitates an integrated design of communication and computation, thereby enhancing system privacy while reducing implementation costs. However, the inherent electromagnetic interference in radio channels often exhibits heavy-tailed distributions, giving rise to exceptionally strong noise in globally aggregated gradients that can significantly deteriorate the training performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel gradient clipping method, termed Median Anchored Clipping (MAC), to combat the detrimental effects of heavy-tailed noise. We also derive analytical expressions for the convergence rate of model training with analog over-the-air federated learning under MAC, which quantitatively demonstrates the effect of MAC on training performance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed MAC algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of heavy-tailed noise, hence substantially enhancing system robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Htet Kyaw, Se Hwan Jeon, Miana Smith, Neil Gershenfeld</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a system that transforms speech into physical objects by combining 3D generative Artificial Intelligence with robotic assembly. The system leverages natural language input to make design and manufacturing more accessible, enabling individuals without expertise in 3D modeling or robotic programming to create physical objects. We propose utilizing discrete robotic assembly of lattice-based voxel components to address the challenges of using generative AI outputs in physical production, such as design variability, fabrication speed, structural integrity, and material waste. The system interprets speech to generate 3D objects, discretizes them into voxel components, computes an optimized assembly sequence, and generates a robotic toolpath. The results are demonstrated through the assembly of various objects, ranging from chairs to shelves, which are prompted via speech and realized within 5 minutes using a 6-axis robotic arm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Song, Xudong Chen, Liupei Lu, Jie Li, Katherine A. Skinner</p>
<p>Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps provide environmental information for autonomous driving systems and are essential for safe planning. While existing methods with single-frame input achieve impressive performance for online vectorized HD map construction, they still struggle with complex scenarios and occlusions. We propose MemFusionMap, a novel temporal fusion model with enhanced temporal reasoning capabilities for online HD map construction. Specifically, we contribute a working memory fusion module that improves the model's memory capacity to reason across a history of frames. We also design a novel temporal overlap heatmap to explicitly inform the model about the temporal overlap information and vehicle trajectory in the Bird's Eye View space. By integrating these two designs, MemFusionMap significantly outperforms existing methods while also maintaining a versatile design for scalability. We conduct extensive evaluation on open-source benchmarks and demonstrate a maximum improvement of 5.4% in mAP over state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuo-Hsuan Hung, Kuan-Chen Wang, Kai-Chun Liu, Wei-Lun Chen, Xugang Lu, Yu Tsao, Chii-Wann Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important non-invasive method for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. However, ECG signals are susceptible to noise contamination, such as electrical interference or signal wandering, which reduces diagnostic accuracy. Various ECG denoising methods have been proposed, but most existing methods yield suboptimal performance under very noisy conditions or require several steps during inference, leading to latency during online processing. In this paper, we propose a novel ECG denoising model, namely Mamba-based ECG Enhancer (MECG-E), which leverages the Mamba architecture known for its fast inference and outstanding nonlinear mapping capabilities. Experimental results indicate that MECG-E surpasses several well-known existing models across multiple metrics under different noise conditions. Additionally, MECG-E requires less inference time than state-of-the-art diffusion-based ECG denoisers, demonstrating the model's functionality and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tan T. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: This review examines theoretical assumptions and computational models of event comprehension, tracing the evolution from discourse comprehension theories to contemporary event cognition frameworks. The review covers key discourse comprehension accounts, including Construction-Integration, Event Indexing, Causal Network, and Resonance models, highlighting their contributions to understanding cognitive processes in comprehension. I then discuss contemporary theoretical frameworks of event comprehension, including Event Segmentation Theory (Zacks et al., 2007), the Event Horizon Model (Radvansky & Zacks, 2014), and Hierarchical Generative Framework (Kuperberg, 2021), which emphasize prediction, causality, and multilevel representations in event understanding. Building on these theories, I evaluate five computational models of event comprehension: REPRISE (Butz et al., 2019), Structured Event Memory (SEM; Franklin et al., 2020), the Lu model (Lu et al., 2022), the Gumbsch model (Gumbsch et al., 2022), and the Elman and McRae model (2019). The analysis focuses on their approaches to hierarchical processing, prediction mechanisms, and representation learning. Key themes that emerge include the use of hierarchical structures as inductive biases, the importance of prediction in comprehension, and diverse strategies for learning event dynamics. The review identifies critical areas for future research, including the need for more sophisticated approaches to learning structured representations, integrating episodic memory mechanisms, and developing adaptive updating algorithms for working event models. By synthesizing insights from both theoretical frameworks and computational implementations, this review aims to advance our understanding of human event comprehension and guide future modeling efforts in cognitive science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Leroux, Paul-Philipp Manea, Chirag Sudarshan, Jan Finkbeiner, Sebastian Siegel, John Paul Strachan, Emre Neftci</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer networks, driven by self-attention, are central to Large Language Models. In generative Transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks.
  We present a custom self-attention in-memory computing architecture based on emerging charge-based memories called gain cells, which can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation and enable parallel analog dot-product computation required for self-attention. However, the analog gain cell circuits introduce non-idealities and constraints preventing the direct mapping of pre-trained models. To circumvent this problem, we design an initialization algorithm achieving text processing performance comparable to GPT-2 without training from scratch. Our architecture respectively reduces attention latency and energy consumption by up to two and five orders of magnitude compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power generative Transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the Melody Guided Music Generation (MG2) model, a novel approach using melody to guide the text-to-music generation that, despite a pretty simple method and extremely limited resources, achieves excellent performance. Specifically, we first align the text with audio waveforms and their associated melodies using the newly proposed Contrastive Language-Music Pretraining, enabling the learned text representation fused with implicit melody information. Subsequently, we condition the retrieval-augmented diffusion module on both text prompt and retrieved melody. This allows MG2to generate music that reflects the content of the given text description, meantime keeping the intrinsic harmony under the guidance of explicit melody information. We conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets: MusicCaps and MusicBench. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MG2 model surpasses current open-source text-to-music generation models, utilizing fewer than 1/3 of the parameters and less than 1/200 of the training data compared to state-of-the-art counterparts. Furthermore, we carried out comprehensive human evaluations to explore the potential applications of MG2 in real-world scenarios.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03736">CliMB: An AI-enabled Partner for Clinical Predictive Modeling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Evgeny Saveliev, Tim Schubert, Thomas Pouplin, Vasilis Kosmoliaptsis, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite its significant promise and continuous technical advances, real-world applications of artificial intelligence (AI) remain limited. We attribute this to the "domain expert-AI-conundrum": while domain experts, such as clinician scientists, should be able to build predictive models such as risk scores, they face substantial barriers in accessing state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools. While automated machine learning (AutoML) has been proposed as a partner in clinical predictive modeling, many additional requirements need to be fulfilled to make machine learning accessible for clinician scientists.
  To address this gap, we introduce CliMB, a no-code AI-enabled partner designed to empower clinician scientists to create predictive models using natural language. CliMB guides clinician scientists through the entire medical data science pipeline, thus empowering them to create predictive models from real-world data in just one conversation. CliMB also creates structured reports and interpretable visuals. In evaluations involving clinician scientists and systematic comparisons against a baseline GPT-4, CliMB consistently demonstrated superior performance in key areas such as planning, error prevention, code execution, and model performance. Moreover, in blinded assessments involving 45 clinicians from diverse specialties and career stages, more than 80% preferred CliMB over GPT-4. Overall, by providing a no-code interface with clear guidance and access to SOTA methods in the fields of data-centric AI, AutoML, and interpretable ML, CliMB empowers clinician scientists to build robust predictive models.
  The proof-of-concept version of CliMB is available as open-source software on GitHub: https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/climb.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aparna Elangovan, Jongwoo Ko, Lei Xu, Mahsa Elyasi, Ling Liu, Sravan Bodapati, Dan Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of automatic evaluation of generative models is typically measured by comparing it to human evaluation using correlation metrics. However, metrics like Krippendorff's $\alpha$ and Randolph's $\kappa$, originally designed to measure the reliability of human labeling, make assumptions about human behavior and the labeling process. In this paper, we show how *relying on a single aggregate correlation score* can obscure fundamental differences between human behavior and automatic evaluation methods, including LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the proportion of samples with variation or uncertainty in human labels (gathered during human evaluation) is relatively high, machine labels (generated by automatic evaluation methods) may superficially appear to have similar or better correlation with the human majority label compared to human-to-human (HH) correlation. This can create the illusion that automatic evaluation approximates the human majority label. However, as the proportion of samples with consistent human labels increases, the correlation between machine and human labels fall well below HH correlation. Based on these findings, we first propose stratifying results by human label uncertainty to provide a more robust analysis of automatic evaluation performance. Second, recognizing that uncertainty and variation are inherent in perception-based human evaluations, such as those involving attitudes or preferences, we introduce a new metric - *binned Jensen-Shannon Divergence for perception* for such scenarios to better measure the effectiveness of automatic evaluations. Third, we present visualization techniques -- *perception charts*, to compare the strengths and limitations of automatic evaluation and to contextualize correlation measures appropriately</p>

This study introduces the novel tasks of 2D, 2.5D and 3D unobserved object detection for predicting the location of nearby objects that are occluded or lie outside the image frame. We adapt several state-of-the-art pre-trained generative models to address this task, including 2D and 3D diffusion models and vision-language models, and show that they can be used to infer the presence of objects that are not directly observed. To benchmark this task, we propose a suite of metrics that capture different aspects of performance. Our empirical evaluation on indoor scenes from the RealEstate10k and NYU Depth v2 datasets demonstrate results that motivate the use of generative models for the unobserved object detection task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juhyun Oh, Eunsu Kim, Jiseon Kim, Wenda Xu, Inha Cha, William Yang Wang, Alice Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment, understanding the reasons behind LLM preferences remains crucial for bridging the gap between desired and actual behavior. LLMs often exhibit biases or tendencies that diverge from human preferences, such as favoring certain writing styles or producing overly verbose outputs. However, current methods for evaluating preference alignment often lack explainability, relying on coarse-grained comparisons. To address this, we introduce PROFILE (PRObing Factors of InfLuence for Explainability), a novel framework that uncovers and quantifies the influence of specific factors driving preferences. PROFILE's factor level analysis explains the 'why' behind human-model alignment and misalignment, offering insights into the direction of model improvement. We apply PROFILE to analyze human and LLM preferences across three tasks: summarization, helpful response generation, and document-based question-answering. Our factor level analysis reveals a substantial discrepancy between human and LLM preferences in generation tasks, whereas LLMs show strong alignment with human preferences in evaluation tasks. We demonstrate how leveraging factor level insights, including addressing misaligned factors or exploiting the generation-evaluation gap, can improve alignment with human preferences. This work underscores the importance of explainable preference analysis and highlights PROFILE's potential to provide valuable training signals, driving further improvements in human-model alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-han Li, Sandeep P. Chinchali, Ufuk Topcu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal encoders like CLIP excel in tasks such as zero-shot image classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, they require excessive training data. We propose canonical similarity analysis (CSA), which uses two unimodal encoders to replicate multimodal encoders using limited data. CSA maps unimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score to retain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference of unimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating the need for extensive GPU-based model training. Experiments show that CSA outperforms CLIP while requiring $300,000\times$ fewer multimodal data pairs and $6\times$ fewer unimodal data for ImageNet classification and misinformative news captions detection. CSA surpasses the state-of-the-art method to map unimodal features to multimodal features. We also demonstrate the ability of CSA with modalities beyond image and text, paving the way for future modality pairs with limited paired multimodal data but abundant unpaired unimodal data, such as lidar and text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soobin Um, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the generation of minority samples using pretrained text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models. Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziming Yu, Pan Zhou, Sike Wang, Jia Li, Hua Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven effective for a variety of downstream tasks. However, as LLMs grow in size, the memory demands for backpropagation become increasingly prohibitive. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods offer a memory-efficient alternative by using forward passes to estimate gradients, but the variance of gradient estimates typically scales linearly with the model's parameter dimension$\unicode{x2013}$a significant issue for LLMs. In this paper, we propose the random Subspace Zeroth-order (SubZero) optimization to address the challenges posed by LLMs' high dimensionality. We introduce a low-rank perturbation tailored for LLMs that significantly reduces memory consumption while improving training performance. Additionally, we prove that our gradient estimation closely approximates the backpropagation gradient, exhibits lower variance than traditional ZO methods, and ensures convergence when combined with SGD. Experimental results show that SubZero enhances fine-tuning performance and achieves faster convergence compared to standard ZO approaches like MeZO across various language modeling tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shi Fu, Yuzhu Chen, Yingjie Wang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the inner mechanisms of black-box foundation models (FMs) is essential yet challenging in artificial intelligence and its applications. Over the last decade, the long-running focus has been on their explainability, leading to the development of post-hoc explainable methods to rationalize the specific decisions already made by black-box FMs. However, these explainable methods have certain limitations in terms of faithfulness and resource requirement. Consequently, a new class of interpretable methods should be considered to unveil the underlying mechanisms of FMs in an accurate, comprehensive, heuristic, and resource-light way. This survey aims to review those interpretable methods that comply with the aforementioned principles and have been successfully applied to FMs. These methods are deeply rooted in machine learning theory, covering the analysis of generalization performance, expressive capability, and dynamic behavior. They provide a thorough interpretation of the entire workflow of FMs, ranging from the inference capability and training dynamics to their ethical implications. Ultimately, drawing upon these interpretations, this review identifies the next frontier research directions for FMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present MMDS, a system capable of recognizing medical images and patient facial details, and providing professional medical diagnoses. The system consists of two core components:The first component is the analysis of medical images and videos. We trained a specialized multimodal medical model capable of interpreting medical images and accurately analyzing patients' facial emotions and facial paralysis conditions. The model achieved an accuracy of 72.59% on the FER2013 facial emotion recognition dataset, with a 91.1% accuracy in recognizing the "happy" emotion. In facial paralysis recognition, the model reached an accuracy of 92%, which is 30% higher than that of GPT-4o. Based on this model, we developed a parser for analyzing facial movement videos of patients with facial paralysis, achieving precise grading of the paralysis severity. In tests on 30 videos of facial paralysis patients, the system demonstrated a grading accuracy of 83.3%.The second component is the generation of professional medical responses. We employed a large language model, integrated with a medical knowledge base, to generate professional diagnoses based on the analysis of medical images or videos. The core innovation lies in our development of a department-specific knowledge base routing management mechanism, in which the large language model categorizes data by medical departments and, during the retrieval process, determines the appropriate knowledge base to query. This significantly improves retrieval accuracy in the RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Imanol Echeverria, Maialen Murua, Roberto Santana</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems in real-time. Unlike traditional methods, deep learning can generate high-quality solutions efficiently, which is crucial for applications like routing and scheduling. However, existing approaches like deep reinforcement learning (RL) and behavioral cloning have notable limitations, with deep RL suffering from slow learning and behavioral cloning relying solely on expert actions, which can lead to generalization issues and neglect of the optimization objective. This paper introduces a novel offline RL method designed for combinatorial optimization problems with complex constraints, where the state is represented as a heterogeneous graph and the action space is variable. Our approach encodes actions in edge attributes and balances expected rewards with the imitation of expert solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on job-shop scheduling and flexible job-shop scheduling benchmarks, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Explaining the decisions of AI has become vital for fostering appropriate user trust in these systems. This paper investigates explanations for a structured prediction task called ``text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing'', which translates a natural language question into a structured query language (SQL) program. In this task setting, we designed three levels of model explanation, each exposing a different amount of the model's decision-making details (called ``algorithm transparency''), and investigated how different model explanations could potentially yield different impacts on the user experience. Our study with $\sim$100 participants shows that (1) the low-/high-transparency explanations often lead to less/more user reliance on the model decisions, whereas the medium-transparency explanations strike a good balance. We also show that (2) only the medium-transparency participant group was able to engage further in the interaction and exhibit increasing performance over time, and that (3) they showed the least changes in trust before and after the study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Chen, Xianghu Yue, Chen Zhang, Xiaoxue Gao, Robby T. Tan, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Building on the success of large language models (LLMs), recent advancements such as GPT-4o have enabled real-time speech interactions through LLM-based voice assistants, offering a significantly improved user experience compared to traditional text-based interactions. However, the absence of benchmarks designed to evaluate these speech interaction capabilities has hindered progress of LLM-based voice assistants development. Current evaluations focus primarily on automatic speech recognition (ASR) or general knowledge evaluation with clean speeches, neglecting the more intricate, real-world scenarios that involve diverse speaker characteristics, environmental and content factors. To address this, we introduce VoiceBench, the first benchmark designed to provide a multi-faceted evaluation of LLM-based voice assistants. VoiceBench also includes both real and synthetic spoken instructions that incorporate the above three key real-world variations. Extensive experiments reveal the limitations of current LLM-based voice assistant models and offer valuable insights for future research and development in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Yan, Changran Peng, Ercan Engin Kuruoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes Graph Signal Adaptive Message Passing (GSAMP), a novel message passing method that simultaneously conducts online prediction, missing data imputation, and noise removal on time-varying graph signals. Unlike conventional Graph Signal Processing methods that apply the same filter to the entire graph, the spatiotemporal updates of GSAMP employ a distinct approach that utilizes localized computations at each node. This update is based on an adaptive solution obtained from an optimization problem designed to minimize the discrepancy between observed and estimated values. GSAMP effectively processes real-world, time-varying graph signals under Gaussian and impulsive noise conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno Croso Cunha da Silva, Thomas Palmeira Ferraz, Roseli De Deus Lopes</p>
<p>Abstract: Disinformation on social media poses both societal and technical challenges, requiring robust detection systems. While previous studies have integrated textual information into propagation networks, they have yet to fully leverage the advancements in Transformer-based language models for high-quality contextual text representations. This work addresses this gap by incorporating Transformer-based textual features into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for fake news detection. We demonstrate that contextual text representations enhance GNN performance, achieving 33.8% relative improvement in Macro F1 over models without textual features and 9.3% over static text representations. We further investigate the impact of different feature sources and the effects of noisy data augmentation. We expect our methodology to open avenues for further research, and we made code publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Sun, Tong Wang, Cynthia Rudin</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparsity is a central aspect of interpretability in machine learning. Typically, sparsity is measured in terms of the size of a model globally, such as the number of variables it uses. However, this notion of sparsity is not particularly relevant for decision-making; someone subjected to a decision does not care about variables that do not contribute to the decision. In this work, we dramatically expand a notion of decision sparsity called the Sparse Explanation Value(SEV) so that its explanations are more meaningful. SEV considers movement along a hypercube towards a reference point. By allowing flexibility in that reference and by considering how distances along the hypercube translate to distances in feature space, we can derive sparser and more meaningful explanations for various types of function classes. We present cluster-based SEV and its variant tree-based SEV, introduce a method that improves credibility of explanations, and propose algorithms that optimize decision sparsity in machine learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Xiaogeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat to large language models (LLMs), enabling goal hijacking and data leakage. Prompt guard models, though effective in defense, suffer from over-defense -- falsely flagging benign inputs as malicious due to trigger word bias. To address this issue, we introduce NotInject, an evaluation dataset that systematically measures over-defense across various prompt guard models. NotInject contains 339 benign samples enriched with trigger words common in prompt injection attacks, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Our results show that state-of-the-art models suffer from over-defense issues, with accuracy dropping close to random guessing levels (60%). To mitigate this, we propose InjecGuard, a novel prompt guard model that incorporates a new training strategy, Mitigating Over-defense for Free (MOF), which significantly reduces the bias on trigger words. InjecGuard demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks including NotInject, surpassing the existing best model by 30.8%, offering a robust and open-source solution for detecting prompt injection attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Gao, Wendi Yang, Yujia Li, Lei Xing, S. Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-semantic context information is crucial for visual recognition, as the human visual perception system first uses global statistics to process scenes rapidly before identifying specific objects. However, while semantic information is increasingly incorporated into computer vision tasks such as image reconstruction, non-semantic information, such as global spatial structures, is often overlooked. To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction. Extensive experimental results show that MS-Glance outperforms existing image restoration losses across both natural and medical images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luc Jonveaux</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to urban sustainability assessment through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline the use of the ISO 37101 framework to automate and standardise the assessment of urban initiatives against the six "sustainability purposes" and twelve "issues" outlined in the standard. The methodology includes the development of a custom prompt based on the standard definitions and its application to two different datasets: 527 projects from the Paris Participatory Budget and 398 activities from the PROBONO Horizon 2020 project. The results show the effectiveness of LLMs in quickly and consistently categorising different urban initiatives according to sustainability criteria. The approach is particularly promising when it comes to breaking down silos in urban planning by providing a holistic view of the impact of projects. The paper discusses the advantages of this method over traditional human-led assessments, including significant time savings and improved consistency. However, it also points out the importance of human expertise in interpreting results and ethical considerations. This study hopefully can contribute to the growing body of work on AI applications in urban planning and provides a novel method for operationalising standardised sustainability frameworks in different urban contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fardin Jalil Piran, Zhiling Chen, Mohsen Imani, Farhad Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is essential for efficient data exchange in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, as it trains Machine Learning (ML) models locally and shares only model updates. However, FL is vulnerable to privacy threats like model inversion and membership inference attacks, which can expose sensitive training data. To address these privacy concerns, Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms are often applied. Yet, adding DP noise to black-box ML models degrades performance, especially in dynamic IoT systems where continuous, lifelong FL learning accumulates excessive noise over time. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Federated HyperDimensional computing with Privacy-preserving (FedHDPrivacy), an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework that combines the neuro-symbolic paradigm with DP. FedHDPrivacy carefully manages the balance between privacy and performance by theoretically tracking cumulative noise from previous rounds and adding only the necessary incremental noise to meet privacy requirements. In a real-world case study involving in-process monitoring of manufacturing machining operations, FedHDPrivacy demonstrates robust performance, outperforming standard FL frameworks-including Federated Averaging (FedAvg), Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD), Federated Proximal (FedProx), Federated Normalized Averaging (FedNova), and Federated Adam (FedAdam)-by up to 38%. FedHDPrivacy also shows potential for future enhancements, such as multimodal data fusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Jia, Zicheng Zhang, Jiaying Qian, Haoning Wu, Wei Sun, Chunyi Li, Xiaohong Liu, Weisi Lin, Guangtao Zhai, Xiongkuo Min</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent and proliferation of large multi-modal models (LMMs) have introduced new paradigms to computer vision, transforming various tasks into a unified visual question answering framework. Video Quality Assessment (VQA), a classic field in low-level visual perception, focused initially on quantitative video quality scoring. However, driven by advances in LMMs, it is now progressing toward more holistic visual quality understanding tasks. Recent studies in the image domain have demonstrated that Visual Question Answering (VQA) can markedly enhance low-level visual quality evaluation. Nevertheless, related work has not been explored in the video domain, leaving substantial room for improvement. To address this gap, we introduce the VQA2 Instruction Dataset - the first visual question answering instruction dataset that focuses on video quality assessment. This dataset consists of 3 subsets and covers various video types, containing 157,755 instruction question-answer pairs. Then, leveraging this foundation, we present the VQA2 series models. The VQA2 series models interleave visual and motion tokens to enhance the perception of spatial-temporal quality details in videos. We conduct extensive experiments on video quality scoring and understanding tasks, and results demonstrate that the VQA2series models achieve excellent performance in both tasks. Notably, our final model, the VQA2-Assistant, exceeds the renowned GPT-4o in visual quality understanding tasks while maintaining strong competitiveness in quality scoring tasks. Our work provides a foundation and feasible approach for integrating low-level video quality assessment and understanding with LMMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of the sixth generation of communication networks (6G) has been gaining momentum over the past years, with a target of being introduced by 2030. Several initiatives worldwide are developing innovative solutions and setting the direction for the key features of these networks. Some common emerging themes are the tight integration of AI, the convergence of multiple access technologies and sustainable operation, aiming to meet stringent performance and societal requirements. To that end, we are introducing REASON - Realising Enabling Architectures and Solutions for Open Networks. The REASON project aims to address technical challenges in future network deployments, such as E2E service orchestration, sustainability, security and trust management, and policy management, utilising AI-native principles, considering multiple access technologies and cloud-native solutions.
  This paper presents REASON's architecture and the identified requirements for future networks. The architecture is meticulously designed for modularity, interoperability, scalability, simplified troubleshooting, flexibility, and enhanced security, taking into consideration current and future standardisation efforts, and the ease of implementation and training. It is structured into four horizontal layers: Physical Infrastructure, Network Service, Knowledge, and End-User Application, complemented by two vertical layers: Management and Orchestration, and E2E Security. This layered approach ensures a robust, adaptable framework to support the diverse and evolving requirements of 6G networks, fostering innovation and facilitating seamless integration of advanced technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shauli Ravfogel, Anej Svete, V\'esteinn Sn{\ae}bjarnarson, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and manipulating the causal generation mechanisms in language models is essential for controlling their behavior. Previous work has primarily relied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or manipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to intervene on these models. To understand the impact of interventions precisely, it is useful to examine counterfactuals -- e.g., how a given sentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a specific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is conceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal hierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating true string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as Generalized Structural-equation. Models using the Gumbel-max trick. This allows us to model the joint distribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the same instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on hindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables and generate counterfactuals of observed strings. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach produces meaningful counterfactuals while at the same time showing that commonly used intervention techniques have considerable undesired side effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen-Ting Liu, Shang-Tse Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant threat to the privacy of Deep Neural Networks by recovering training data distribution from well-trained models. While existing defenses often rely on regularization techniques to reduce information leakage, they remain vulnerable to recent attacks. In this paper, we propose the Trapdoor-based Model Inversion Defense (Trap-MID) to mislead MI attacks. A trapdoor is integrated into the model to predict a specific label when the input is injected with the corresponding trigger. Consequently, this trapdoor information serves as the "shortcut" for MI attacks, leading them to extract trapdoor triggers rather than private data. We provide theoretical insights into the impacts of trapdoor's effectiveness and naturalness on deceiving MI attacks. In addition, empirical experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art defense performance of Trap-MID against various MI attacks without the requirements for extra data or large computational overhead.

<p>Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) has become a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), aimed at automatically extracting causalities from textual data. In this survey, we systematically address the foundational principles, technical frameworks, and challenges of ECI, offering a comprehensive taxonomy to categorize and clarify current research methodologies, as well as a quantitative assessment of existing models. We first establish a conceptual framework for ECI, outlining key definitions, problem formulations, and evaluation standards. Our taxonomy classifies ECI methods according to the two primary tasks of sentence-level (SECI) and document-level (DECI) event causality identification. For SECI, we examine feature pattern-based matching, deep semantic encoding, causal knowledge pre-training and prompt-based fine-tuning, and external knowledge enhancement methods. For DECI, we highlight approaches focused on event graph reasoning and prompt-based techniques to address the complexity of cross-sentence causal inference. Additionally, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and open challenges of each approach. We further conduct an extensive quantitative evaluation of various ECI methods on two benchmark datasets. Finally, we explore future research directions, highlighting promising pathways to overcome current limitations and broaden ECI applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled significant progress in multimodal understanding, expanding their capacity to analyze video content. However, existing evaluation benchmarks for MLLMs primarily focus on abstract video comprehension, lacking a detailed assessment of their ability to understand video compositions, the nuanced interpretation of how visual elements combine and interact within highly compiled video contexts. We introduce VidComposition, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the video composition understanding capabilities of MLLMs using carefully curated compiled videos and cinematic-level annotations. VidComposition includes 982 videos with 1706 multiple-choice questions, covering various compositional aspects such as camera movement, angle, shot size, narrative structure, character actions and emotions, etc. Our comprehensive evaluation of 33 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveals a significant performance gap between human and model capabilities. This highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex, compiled video compositions and offers insights into areas for further improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Xu, Yiguan Lin, Yinghao Li, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models demonstrate exceptional performance in simple code generation tasks but still face challenges in tackling complex problems. These challenges may stem from insufficient reasoning and problem decomposition capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a reasoning-augmented data generation process, SRA-MCTS, which guides the model to autonomously generate high-quality intermediate reasoning paths. This creates a positive feedback loop, enabling continuous improvement. Our method operates entirely through the model itself without requiring additional supervision. By synthesizing natural language reasoning paths and translating them into executable code, the approach ensures analytical accuracy and enhances the success rate in solving complex tasks. Experimental results show that, even without additional supervisory signals, our method achieves performance improvements across different model scales, demonstrating the significant potential of self-improvement in small models. Furthermore, the method remains robust when traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches exhibit performance degradation, with notable improvements observed in diversity metrics such as pass@10. We encourage further exploration of reasoning processes within training data to enhance the ability of language models to address complex problems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Liu, Kaiming Liu, Yiqi Zhu, Xuanyu Lei, Zonghan Yang, Zhenhe Zhang, Peng Li, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid development of artificial intelligence has drastically accelerated the development of scientific discovery. Trained with large-scale observation data, deep neural networks extract the underlying patterns in an end-to-end manner and assist human researchers with highly-precised predictions in unseen scenarios. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the empowered autonomous agents enable scientists to gain help through interaction in different stages of their research, including but not limited to literature review, research ideation, idea implementation, and academic writing. However, AI researchers instantiated by foundation model empowered agents with full-process autonomy are still in their infancy. In this paper, we study $\textbf{AI-Generated Science}$ (AIGS), where agents independently and autonomously complete the entire research process and discover scientific laws. By revisiting the definition of scientific research, we argue that $\textit{falsification}$ is the essence of both human research process and the design of an AIGS system. Through the lens of falsification, prior systems attempting towards AI-Generated Science either lack the part in their design, or rely heavily on existing verification engines that narrow the use in specialized domains. In this work, we propose Baby-AIGS as a baby-step demonstration of a full-process AIGS system, which is a multi-agent system with agents in roles representing key research process. By introducing FalsificationAgent, which identify and then verify possible scientific discoveries, we empower the system with explicit falsification. Experiments on three tasks preliminarily show that Baby-AIGS could produce meaningful scientific discoveries, though not on par with experienced human researchers. Finally, we discuss on the limitations of current Baby-AIGS, actionable insights, and related ethical issues in detail.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging task of multimodal mathematical reasoning by incorporating the ability of ``slow thinking" into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Contrary to existing methods that rely on direct or fast thinking, our key idea is to construct long chains of thought (CoT) consisting of atomic actions in a step-by-step manner, guiding MLLMs to perform complex reasoning. To this end, we design a novel AtomThink framework composed of three key modules: (i) a CoT annotation engine that automatically generates high-quality CoT annotations to address the lack of high-quality visual mathematical data; (ii) an atomic step fine-tuning strategy that jointly optimizes an MLLM and a policy reward model (PRM) for step-wise reasoning; and (iii) four different search strategies that can be applied with the PRM to complete reasoning. Additionally, we propose AtomMATH, a large-scale multimodal dataset of long CoTs, and an atomic capability evaluation metric for mathematical tasks. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed AtomThink significantly improves the performance of baseline MLLMs, achieving approximately 50\% relative accuracy gains on MathVista and 120\% on MathVerse. To support the advancement of multimodal slow-thinking models, we will make our code and dataset publicly available on https://github.com/Quinn777/AtomThink.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the success of text retrieval in many NLP tasks, code retrieval remains a largely underexplored area. Most text retrieval systems are tailored for natural language queries, often neglecting the specific challenges of retrieving code. This gap leaves existing models unable to effectively capture the diversity of programming languages and tasks across different domains, highlighting the need for more focused research in code retrieval. To address this, we introduce CodeXEmbed, a family of large-scale code embedding models ranging from 400M to 7B parameters. Our novel training pipeline unifies multiple programming languages and transforms various code-related tasks into a common retrieval framework, enhancing model generalizability and retrieval performance. Our 7B model sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in code retrieval, outperforming the previous leading model, Voyage-Code, by over 20% on CoIR benchmark. In addition to excelling in code retrieval, our models demonstrate competitive performance on the widely adopted BeIR text retrieval benchmark, offering versatility across domains. Experimental results demonstrate that improving retrieval performance significantly enhances end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) performance for code-related tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have made them crucial for visual question answering (VQA) in autonomous driving, enabling natural human-vehicle interactions. However, existing methods often struggle in dynamic driving environments, as they usually focus on static images or videos and rely on downsampling to manage computational costs. This results in the loss of critical details and the difficulty in effectively integrating spatial and temporal information, undermining fine-grained perception and temporal coherence essential for effective decision-making. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LaVida Drive, a novel and efficient VQA framework for autonomous driving. LaVida Drive seamlessly integrates temporal data while maintaining high-resolution inputs for detailed visual perception. It optimizes spatial processing by retaining high-resolution data for intricate details and using lower-resolution inputs for temporal analysis to focus on motion-related features, thereby boosting computational efficiency. The core of LaVida Drive consists of two modules: the \textit{Query-aware Token Selection} module and the \textit{Spatial-Temporal Token Recovery and Enhancement} module. The former dynamically selects the most relevant visual tokens based on semantic alignment with the input query, reducing the token count from high-resolution spatial input. The latter ensures smooth and coherent interactions between spatial and temporal information, preserving contextual continuity across frames. Extensive experiments on various autonomous driving question-answering benchmarks show that LaVida Drive significantly reduces visual tokens, enhances efficiency, and improves overall performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding plays a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents. While general VLMs, such as GPT-4V, demonstrate strong performance across various tasks, their proficiency in GUI grounding remains suboptimal. Recent studies have focused on fine-tuning these models specifically for one-shot GUI grounding, yielding significant improvements over baseline performance. We introduce a visual prompting framework that employs an iterative narrowing mechanism to improve the performance of both general and fine-tuned models in GUI grounding by up to 61%. For evaluation, we tested our method on a comprehensive benchmark comprising various UI platforms and provided the code to reproduce our results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitrios P. Panagoulias, Elissaios Sarmas, Vangelis Marinakis, Maria Virvou, George A. Tsihrintzis</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach to Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) by introducing the Extreme Value Dynamic Benchmarking Method (EVDBM). EVDBM integrates extreme value theory to detect extreme events and is coupled with the novel Dynamic Identification of Significant Correlation (DISC)-Thresholding algorithm, which enhances the analysis of key variables under extreme conditions. By integrating return values predicted through EVA into the benchmarking scores, we are able to transform these scores to reflect anticipated conditions more accurately. This provides a more precise picture of how each case is projected to unfold under extreme conditions. As a result, the adjusted scores offer a forward-looking perspective, highlighting potential vulnerabilities and resilience factors for each case in a way that static historical data alone cannot capture. By incorporating both historical and probabilistic elements, the EVDBM algorithm provides a comprehensive benchmarking framework that is adaptable to a range of scenarios and contexts. The methodology is applied to real PV data, revealing critical low - production scenarios and significant correlations between variables, which aid in risk management, infrastructure design, and long-term planning, while also allowing for the comparison of different production plants. The flexibility of EVDBM suggests its potential for broader applications in other sectors where decision-making sensitivity is crucial, offering valuable insights to improve outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Correia, Jan-Christoph Goos, Thomas B\"ack, Anna V. Kononova</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor-Alexandru P\u{a}durean, Paul Denny, Adish Singla</p>
<p>Abstract: Debugging is an essential skill when learning to program, yet its instruction and emphasis often vary widely across introductory courses. In the era of code-generating large language models (LLMs), the ability for students to reason about code and identify errors is increasingly important. However, students frequently resort to trial-and-error methods to resolve bugs without fully understanding the underlying issues. Developing the ability to identify and hypothesize the cause of bugs is crucial but can be time-consuming to teach effectively through traditional means. This paper introduces BugSpotter, an innovative tool that leverages an LLM to generate buggy code from a problem description and verify the synthesized bugs via a test suite. Students interact with BugSpotter by designing failing test cases, where the buggy code's output differs from the expected result as defined by the problem specification. This not only provides opportunities for students to enhance their debugging skills, but also to practice reading and understanding problem specifications. We deployed BugSpotter in a large classroom setting and compared the debugging exercises it generated to exercises hand-crafted by an instructor for the same problems. We found that the LLM-generated exercises produced by BugSpotter varied in difficulty and were well-matched to the problem specifications. Importantly, the LLM-generated exercises were comparable to those manually created by instructors with respect to student performance, suggesting that BugSpotter could be an effective and efficient aid for learning debugging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongjin Shin, Sangdon Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries inject malicious functionality during training that activates on trigger inputs at inference time. Extensive research has focused on developing stealthy backdoor attacks to evade detection and defense mechanisms. However, these approaches still have limitations that leave the door open for detection and mitigation due to their inherent design to cause malicious behavior in the presence of a trigger. To address this limitation, we introduce Deferred Activated Backdoor Functionality (DABF), a new paradigm in backdoor attacks. Unlike conventional attacks, DABF initially conceals its backdoor, producing benign outputs even when triggered. This stealthy behavior allows DABF to bypass multiple detection and defense methods, remaining undetected during initial inspections. The backdoor functionality is strategically activated only after the model undergoes subsequent updates, such as retraining on benign data. DABF attacks exploit the common practice in the life cycle of machine learning models to perform model updates and fine-tuning after initial deployment. To implement DABF attacks, we approach the problem by making the unlearning of the backdoor fragile, allowing it to be easily cancelled and subsequently reactivate the backdoor functionality. To achieve this, we propose a novel two-stage training scheme, called DeferBad. Our extensive experiments across various fine-tuning scenarios, backdoor attack types, datasets, and model architectures demonstrate the effectiveness and stealthiness of DeferBad.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheni Zeng, Yuxuan Chen, Shi Yu, Yukun Yan, Zhenghao Liu, Shuo Wang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can utilize techniques to quickly acquire knowledge from specific materials in advance, such as creating self-assessment questions, enabling us to achieving related tasks more efficiently. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) usually relies on retrieval-augmented generation to exploit knowledge materials in an instant manner, or requires external signals such as human preference data and stronger LLM annotations to conduct knowledge adaptation. To unleash the self-learning potential of LLMs, we propose KBAlign, an approach designed for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks involving knowledge bases. Our method utilizes iterative training with self-annotated data such as Q&A pairs and revision suggestions, enabling the model to grasp the knowledge content efficiently. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly boosting model performance in downstream tasks that require specific knowledge at a low cost. Notably, our approach achieves over 90% of the performance improvement that can be obtained by using GPT-4-turbo annotation, while relying entirely on self-supervision. We release our experimental data, models, and process analyses to the community for further exploration (https://github.com/thunlp/KBAlign).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Ding, Ziming Wang, Yi Ding, Hongjie Lin, SuYang Xi, Chia Chao Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Addressing the challenge of ensuring safety in ever-changing and unpredictable environments, particularly in the swiftly advancing realm of autonomous driving in today's 5G wireless communication world, we present Navigation Secure (NavSecure). This vision-based navigation framework merges the strengths of world models with crucial safety-focused decision-making capabilities, enabling autonomous vehicles to navigate real-world complexities securely. Our approach anticipates potential threats and formulates safer routes by harnessing the predictive capabilities of world models, thus significantly reducing the need for extensive real-world trial-and-error learning. Additionally, our method empowers vehicles to autonomously learn and develop through continuous practice, ensuring the system evolves and adapts to new challenges. Incorporating radio frequency technology, NavSecure leverages 5G networks to enhance real-time data exchange, improving communication and responsiveness. Validated through rigorous experiments under simulation-to-real driving conditions, NavSecure has shown exceptional performance in safety-critical scenarios, such as sudden obstacle avoidance. Results indicate that NavSecure excels in key safety metrics, including collision prevention and risk reduction, surpassing other end-to-end methodologies. This framework not only advances autonomous driving safety but also demonstrates how world models can enhance decision-making in critical applications. NavSecure sets a new standard for developing more robust and trustworthy autonomous driving systems, capable of handling the inherent dynamics and uncertainties of real-world environments.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15098">OminiControl: Minimal and Universal Control for Diffusion Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenxiong Tan, Songhua Liu, Xingyi Yang, Qiaochu Xue, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OminiControl, a highly versatile and parameter-efficient framework that integrates image conditions into pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models. At its core, OminiControl leverages a parameter reuse mechanism, enabling the DiT to encode image conditions using itself as a powerful backbone and process them with its flexible multi-modal attention processors. Unlike existing methods, which rely heavily on additional encoder modules with complex architectures, OminiControl (1) effectively and efficiently incorporates injected image conditions with only ~0.1% additional parameters, and (2) addresses a wide range of image conditioning tasks in a unified manner, including subject-driven generation and spatially-aligned conditions such as edges, depth, and more. Remarkably, these capabilities are achieved by training on images generated by the DiT itself, which is particularly beneficial for subject-driven generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that OminiControl outperforms existing UNet-based and DiT-adapted models in both subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditional generation. Additionally, we release our training dataset, Subjects200K, a diverse collection of over 200,000 identity-consistent images, along with an efficient data synthesis pipeline to advance research in subject-consistent generation.</p>
