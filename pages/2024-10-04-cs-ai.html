<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Kheirandish, Duo Xu, Faramarz Fekri</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) is to take a complex task and be able to decompose it to subtasks that are simpler for the RL agent to learn. In this paper, we report on our work that would identify subtasks by using some given positive and negative trajectories for solving the complex task. We assume that the states are represented by first-order predicate logic using which we devise a novel algorithm to identify the subtasks. Then we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate first-order logic rule templates for achieving each subtask. Such rules were then further fined tuned to a rule-based policy via an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)-based RL agent. Through experiments, we verify the accuracy of our algorithm in detecting subtasks which successfully detect all of the subtasks correctly. We also investigated the quality of the common-sense rules produced by the language model to achieve the subtasks. Our experiments show that our LLM-guided rule template generation can produce rules that are necessary for solving a subtask, which leads to solving complex tasks with fewer assumptions about predefined first-order logic predicates of the environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamed Firooz, Maziar Sanjabi, Wenlong Jiang, Xiaoling Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit blind spots that impair their ability to retrieve and process relevant contextual data effectively. We demonstrate that LLM performance in graph tasks with complexities beyond the "needle-in-a-haystack" scenario-where solving the problem requires cross-referencing and reasoning across multiple subproblems jointly-is influenced by the proximity of relevant information within the context, a phenomenon we term "lost-in-distance". We examine two fundamental graph tasks: identifying common connections between two nodes and assessing similarity among three nodes, and show that the model's performance in these tasks significantly depends on the relative positioning of common edges. We evaluate three publicly available LLMs-Llama-3-8B, Llama-3-70B, and GPT-4-using various graph encoding techniques that represent graph structures for LLM input. We propose a formulation for the lost-in-distance phenomenon and demonstrate that lost-in-distance and lost-in-the middle phenomenas occur independently. Results indicate that model accuracy can decline by up to 6x as the distance between node connections increases, independent of graph encoding and model size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zhou, Peng Zhang, Mengya Song, Alice Zheng, Yiwen Lu, Zhiheng Liu, Yong Chen, Zhaohan Xi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in healthcare. However, a significant gap remains regarding LLMs' professionalism in domain-specific clinical practices, limiting their application in real-world diagnostics. In this work, we introduce ZODIAC, an LLM-powered framework with cardiologist-level professionalism designed to engage LLMs in cardiological diagnostics. ZODIAC assists cardiologists by extracting clinically relevant characteristics from patient data, detecting significant arrhythmias, and generating preliminary reports for the review and refinement by cardiologists. To achieve cardiologist-level professionalism, ZODIAC is built on a multi-agent collaboration framework, enabling the processing of patient data across multiple modalities. Each LLM agent is fine-tuned using real-world patient data adjudicated by cardiologists, reinforcing the model's professionalism. ZODIAC undergoes rigorous clinical validation with independent cardiologists, evaluated across eight metrics that measure clinical effectiveness and address security concerns. Results show that ZODIAC outperforms industry-leading models, including OpenAI's GPT-4o, Meta's Llama-3.1-405B, and Google's Gemini-pro, as well as medical-specialist LLMs like Microsoft's BioGPT. ZODIAC demonstrates the transformative potential of specialized LLMs in healthcare by delivering domain-specific solutions that meet the stringent demands of medical practice. Notably, ZODIAC has been successfully integrated into electrocardiography (ECG) devices, exemplifying the growing trend of embedding LLMs into Software-as-Medical-Device (SaMD).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabine Muzellec, Drew Linsley, Alekh K. Ashok, Ennio Mingolla, Girik Malik, Rufin VanRullen, Thomas Serre</p>
<p>Abstract: Objects we encounter often change appearance as we interact with them. Changes in illumination (shadows), object pose, or movement of nonrigid objects can drastically alter available image features. How do biological visual systems track objects as they change? It may involve specific attentional mechanisms for reasoning about the locations of objects independently of their appearances -- a capability that prominent neuroscientific theories have associated with computing through neural synchrony. We computationally test the hypothesis that the implementation of visual attention through neural synchrony underlies the ability of biological visual systems to track objects that change in appearance over time. We first introduce a novel deep learning circuit that can learn to precisely control attention to features separately from their location in the world through neural synchrony: the complex-valued recurrent neural network (CV-RNN). Next, we compare object tracking in humans, the CV-RNN, and other deep neural networks (DNNs), using FeatureTracker: a large-scale challenge that asks observers to track objects as their locations and appearances change in precisely controlled ways. While humans effortlessly solved FeatureTracker, state-of-the-art DNNs did not. In contrast, our CV-RNN behaved similarly to humans on the challenge, providing a computational proof-of-concept for the role of phase synchronization as a neural substrate for tracking appearance-morphing objects as they move about.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02110">Can LLMs Reliably Simulate Human Learner Actions? A Simulation Authoring Framework for Open-Ended Learning Environments</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Amogh Mannekote, Adam Davies, Jina Kang, Kristy Elizabeth Boyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating learner actions helps stress-test open-ended interactive learning environments and prototype new adaptations before deployment. While recent studies show the promise of using large language models (LLMs) for simulating human behavior, such approaches have not gone beyond rudimentary proof-of-concept stages due to key limitations. First, LLMs are highly sensitive to minor prompt variations, raising doubts about their ability to generalize to new scenarios without extensive prompt engineering. Moreover, apparently successful outcomes can often be unreliable, either because domain experts unintentionally guide LLMs to produce expected results, leading to self-fulfilling prophecies; or because the LLM has encountered highly similar scenarios in its training data, meaning that models may not be simulating behavior so much as regurgitating memorized content. To address these challenges, we propose Hyp-Mix, a simulation authoring framework that allows experts to develop and evaluate simulations by combining testable hypotheses about learner behavior. Testing this framework in a physics learning environment, we found that GPT-4 Turbo maintains calibrated behavior even as the underlying learner model changes, providing the first evidence that LLMs can be used to simulate realistic behaviors in open-ended interactive learning environments, a necessary prerequisite for useful LLM behavioral simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanpeng Zhang, Zilong Xie, Yicheng Feng, Yijiang Li, Xingrun Xing, Sipeng Zheng, Zongqing Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have made significant strides in integrating visual and textual information, yet they often struggle with effectively aligning these modalities. We introduce a novel image tokenizer that bridges this gap by applying the principle of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) to visual data. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on separate visual encoders, our method directly incorporates structural prior information into image tokens, mirroring the successful tokenization strategies used in text-only Large Language Models. This innovative approach enables Transformer models to more effectively learn and reason across modalities. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BPE Image Tokenizer significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal understanding capabilities, even with limited training data. Our method not only improves performance across various benchmarks but also shows promising scalability, potentially paving the way for more efficient and capable multimodal foundation models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02162">Planning in Strawberry Fields: Evaluating and Improving the Planning and Scheduling Capabilities of LRM o1</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Karthik Valmeekam, Kaya Stechly, Atharva Gundawar, Subbarao Kambhampati</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to plan a course of action that achieves a desired state of affairs has long been considered a core competence of intelligent agents and has been an integral part of AI research since its inception. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), there has been considerable interest in the question of whether or not they possess such planning abilities, but -- despite the slew of new private and open source LLMs since GPT3 -- progress has remained slow. OpenAI claims that their recent o1 (Strawberry) model has been specifically constructed and trained to escape the normal limitations of autoregressive LLMs -- making it a new kind of model: a Large Reasoning Model (LRM). In this paper, we evaluate the planning capabilities of two LRMs (o1-preview and o1-mini) on both planning and scheduling benchmarks. We see that while o1 does seem to offer significant improvements over autoregressive LLMs, this comes at a steep inference cost, while still failing to provide any guarantees over what it generates. We also show that combining o1 models with external verifiers -- in a so-called LRM-Modulo system -- guarantees the correctness of the combined system's output while further improving performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucheng Chu, Hang Li, Kaiqi Yang, Harry Shomer, Hui Liu, Yasemin Copur-Gencturk, Jiliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-ended short-answer questions (SAGs) have been widely recognized as a powerful tool for providing deeper insights into learners' responses in the context of learning analytics (LA). However, SAGs often present challenges in practice due to the high grading workload and concerns about inconsistent assessments. With recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), automatic short-answer grading (ASAG) offers a promising solution to these challenges. Despite this, current ASAG algorithms are often limited in generalizability and tend to be tailored to specific questions. In this paper, we propose a unified multi-agent ASAG framework, GradeOpt, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as graders for SAGs. More importantly, GradeOpt incorporates two additional LLM-based agents - the reflector and the refiner - into the multi-agent system. This enables GradeOpt to automatically optimize the original grading guidelines by performing self-reflection on its errors. Through experiments on a challenging ASAG task, namely the grading of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and content knowledge (CK) questions, GradeOpt demonstrates superior performance in grading accuracy and behavior alignment with human graders compared to representative baselines. Finally, comprehensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the individual components designed in GradeOpt.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02189">Agent-Oriented Planning in Multi-Agent Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao Li, Yuexiang Xie, Songze Li, Fugee Tsung, Bolin Ding, Yaliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Through the collaboration of multiple agents possessing diverse expertise and tools, multi-agent systems achieve impressive progress in solving real-world problems. Given the user queries, the meta-agents, serving as the brain within these systems, are required to decompose the queries into multiple sub-tasks that can be allocated to suitable agents capable of solving them, so-called agent-oriented planning. In this study, we identify three critical design principles of agent-oriented planning, including solvability, completeness, and non-redundancy, to ensure that each sub-task is effectively resolved, leading to satisfactory responses to the original queries. These principles further inspire us to propose a novel framework for agent-oriented planning in multi-agent systems, leveraging a fast task decomposition and allocation process followed by an effective and efficient evaluation via a reward model. During the planning process, the meta-agent is also responsible for evaluating the performance of the expert agents, making timely adjustments to the sub-tasks and scheduling as necessary. Besides, we integrate a feedback loop into the proposed framework to further enhance the effectiveness and robustness of such a problem-solving process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of the proposed framework in solving real-world problems compared to both single-agent systems and existing planning strategies for multi-agent systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02197">General Preference Modeling with Preference Representations for Aligning Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang, Ge Zhang, Yue Wu, Kangping Xu, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling human preferences is crucial for aligning foundation models with human values. Traditional reward modeling methods, such as the Bradley-Terry (BT) reward model, fall short in expressiveness, particularly in addressing intransitive preferences. Although supervised pair preference models (PairPM) can express general preferences, their implementation is highly ad-hoc and cannot guarantee a consistent preference probability of compared pairs. Additionally, they impose high computational costs due to their quadratic query complexity when comparing multiple responses. In this paper, we introduce preference representation learning, an approach that embeds responses into a latent space to capture intricate preference structures efficiently, achieving linear query complexity. Additionally, we propose preference score-based General Preference Optimization (GPO), which generalizes reward-based reinforcement learning from human feedback. Experimental results show that our General Preference representation model (GPM) outperforms the BT reward model on the RewardBench benchmark with a margin of up to 5.6% and effectively models cyclic preferences where any BT reward model behaves like a random guess. Furthermore, evaluations on downstream tasks such as AlpacaEval2.0 and MT-Bench, following the language model post-training with GPO and our general preference model, reveal substantial performance improvements with margins up to 9.3%. These findings indicate that our method may enhance the alignment of foundation models with nuanced human values.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02203">GraphIC: A Graph-Based In-Context Example Retrieval Model for Multi-Step Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Fu, Yaqing Wang, Simeng Han, Jiaming Fan, Chen Si, Xu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to generalize to new tasks by incorporating a few in-context examples (ICEs) directly in the input, without updating parameters. However, the effectiveness of ICL heavily relies on the selection of ICEs, and conventional text-based embedding methods are often inadequate for tasks that require multi-step reasoning, such as mathematical and logical problem solving. This is due to the bias introduced by shallow semantic similarities that fail to capture the deeper reasoning structures required for these tasks. We present GraphIC, a novel approach that leverages graph-based representations of reasoning processes, coupled with Bayesian Networks (BNs) to select ICEs. Graph structures inherently filter out shallow semantics while preserving the core reasoning structure. Importantly, BNs capture the dependency of a node's attributes on its parent nodes, closely mirroring the hierarchical nature of human cognition-where each thought is shaped by preceding ones. This makes BNs particularly well-suited for multi-step reasoning tasks, aligning the process more closely with human-like reasoning. Extensive experiments across three types of reasoning tasks (mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical reasoning) demonstrate that GraphIC outperforms both training-free and training-based models in selecting ICEs, excelling in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. We show that GraphIC enhances ICL's performance and interoperability, significantly advancing ICE selection for multi-step reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huimu Yu, Xing Wu, Weidong Yin, Debing Zhang, Songlin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in natural language understanding and generation, driven by scalable pretraining and advanced finetuning. However, enhancing reasoning abilities in LLMs, particularly via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality preference data, which is labor-intensive to annotate and crucial for reward model (RM) finetuning. To alleviate this issue, we introduce CodePMP, a scalable preference model pretraining (PMP) pipeline that utilizes a large corpus of synthesized code-preference pairs from publicly available high-quality source code. CodePMP improves RM finetuning efficiency by pretraining preference models on large-scale synthesized code-preference pairs. We evaluate CodePMP on mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH) and logical reasoning tasks (ReClor, LogiQA2.0), consistently showing significant improvements in reasoning performance of LLMs and highlighting the importance of scalable preference model pretraining for efficient reward modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hierarchical Imitation Learning (HIL) is a promising approach for tackling long-horizon decision-making tasks. While it is a challenging task due to the lack of detailed supervisory labels for sub-goal learning, and reliance on hundreds to thousands of expert demonstrations. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)'s powerful semantic and world knowledge for both specifying sub-goal space and pre-labeling states to semantically meaningful sub-goal representations without prior knowledge of task hierarchies. SEAL employs a dual-encoder structure, combining supervised LLM-guided sub-goal learning with unsupervised Vector Quantization (VQ) for more robust sub-goal representations. Additionally, SEAL incorporates a transition-augmented low-level planner for improved adaptation to sub-goal transitions. Our experiments demonstrate that SEAL outperforms state-of-the-art HIL methods and LLM-based planning approaches, particularly in settings with small expert datasets and complex long-horizon tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueyuan Li, Mingyang Jiang, Songan Zhang, Wei Yuan, Chunxiang Wang, Ming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios pose significant challenges for autonomous driving systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach by enabling the exploration of driving policies beyond the constraints of pre-collected datasets and predefined conditions, particularly in complex environments. However, a critical challenge lies in effectively extracting spatial and temporal features from sequences of high-dimensional, multi-modal observations while minimizing the accumulation of errors over time. Additionally, efficiently guiding large-scale RL models to converge on optimal driving policies without frequent failures during the training process remains tricky.
  We propose an end-to-end model-based RL algorithm named Ramble to address these issues. Ramble processes multi-view RGB images and LiDAR point clouds into low-dimensional latent features to capture the context of traffic scenarios at each time step. A transformer-based architecture is then employed to model temporal dependencies and predict future states. By learning a dynamics model of the environment, Ramble can foresee upcoming traffic events and make more informed, strategic decisions. Our implementation demonstrates that prior experience in feature extraction and decision-making plays a pivotal role in accelerating the convergence of RL models toward optimal driving policies. Ramble achieves state-of-the-art performance regarding route completion rate and driving score on the CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, showcasing its effectiveness in managing complex and dynamic traffic situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuo An, Yunjiao Zhou, Han Zou, Jianfei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across textual and visual domains but often generate outputs that violate physical laws, revealing a gap in their understanding of the physical world. Inspired by human cognition, where perception is fundamental to reasoning, we explore augmenting LLMs with enhanced perception abilities using Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data and pertinent knowledge for IoT task reasoning in the physical world. In this work, we systematically study LLMs capability to address real-world IoT tasks by augmenting their perception and knowledge base, and then propose a unified framework, IoT-LLM, to enhance such capability. In IoT-LLM, we customize three steps for LLMs: preprocessing IoT data into formats amenable to LLMs, activating their commonsense knowledge through chain-of-thought prompting and specialized role definitions, and expanding their understanding via IoT-oriented retrieval-augmented generation based on in-context learning. To evaluate the performance, We design a new benchmark with five real-world IoT tasks with different data types and reasoning difficulties and provide the benchmarking results on six open-source and close-source LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the limitations of existing LLMs with naive textual inputs that cannot perform these tasks effectively. We show that IoT-LLM significantly enhances the performance of IoT tasks reasoning of LLM, such as GPT-4, achieving an average improvement of 65% across various tasks against previous methods. The results also showcase LLMs ability to comprehend IoT data and the physical law behind data by providing a reasoning process. Limitations of our work are claimed to inspire future research in this new era.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02430">Predictive Attractor Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramy Mounir, Sudeep Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential memory, the ability to form and accurately recall a sequence of events or stimuli in the correct order, is a fundamental prerequisite for biological and artificial intelligence as it underpins numerous cognitive functions (e.g., language comprehension, planning, episodic memory formation, etc.) However, existing methods of sequential memory suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limited capacity, slow iterative learning procedures, low-order Markov memory, and, most importantly, the inability to represent and generate multiple valid future possibilities stemming from the same context. Inspired by biologically plausible neuroscience theories of cognition, we propose \textit{Predictive Attractor Models (PAM)}, a novel sequence memory architecture with desirable generative properties. PAM is a streaming model that learns a sequence in an online, continuous manner by observing each input \textit{only once}. Additionally, we find that PAM avoids catastrophic forgetting by uniquely representing past context through lateral inhibition in cortical minicolumns, which prevents new memories from overwriting previously learned knowledge. PAM generates future predictions by sampling from a union set of predicted possibilities; this generative ability is realized through an attractor model trained alongside the predictor. We show that PAM is trained with local computations through Hebbian plasticity rules in a biologically plausible framework. Other desirable traits (e.g., noise tolerance, CPU-based learning, capacity scaling) are discussed throughout the paper. Our findings suggest that PAM represents a significant step forward in the pursuit of biologically plausible and computationally efficient sequential memory models, with broad implications for cognitive science and artificial intelligence research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei Xu, Mohan Kankanhalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Value alignment, which aims to ensure that large language models (LLMs) and other AI agents behave in accordance with human values, is critical for ensuring safety and trustworthiness of these systems. A key component of value alignment is the modeling of human preferences as a representation of human values. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of value alignment by examining the sensitivity of preference models. Specifically, we ask: how do changes in the probabilities of some preferences affect the predictions of these models for other preferences? To answer this question, we theoretically analyze the robustness of widely used preference models by examining their sensitivities to minor changes in preferences they model. Our findings reveal that, in the Bradley-Terry and the Placket-Luce model, the probability of a preference can change significantly as other preferences change, especially when these preferences are dominant (i.e., with probabilities near 0 or 1). We identify specific conditions where this sensitivity becomes significant for these models and discuss the practical implications for the robustness and safety of value alignment in AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikang Yuan, Junjie Cao, Zhuoren Jiang, Yangyang Kang, Jun Lin, Kaisong Song, tianqianjin lin, Pengwei Yan, Changlong Sun, Xiaozhong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) could struggle to fully understand legal theories and perform complex legal reasoning tasks. In this study, we introduce a challenging task (confusing charge prediction) to better evaluate LLMs' understanding of legal theories and reasoning capabilities. We also propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent framework for improving complex Legal Reasoning capability (MALR). MALR employs non-parametric learning, encouraging LLMs to automatically decompose complex legal tasks and mimic human learning process to extract insights from legal rules, helping LLMs better understand legal theories and enhance their legal reasoning abilities. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively addresses complex reasoning issues in practical scenarios, paving the way for more reliable applications in the legal domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Qu, Boyuan Wang, Yuhang Jiang, Jianzhun Shao, Yixiu Mao, Cheems Wang, Chang Liu, Xiangyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: With expansive state-action spaces, efficient multi-agent exploration remains a longstanding challenge in reinforcement learning. Although pursuing novelty, diversity, or uncertainty attracts increasing attention, redundant efforts brought by exploration without proper guidance choices poses a practical issue for the community. This paper introduces a systematic approach, termed LEMAE, choosing to channel informative task-relevant guidance from a knowledgeable Large Language Model (LLM) for Efficient Multi-Agent Exploration. Specifically, we ground linguistic knowledge from LLM into symbolic key states, that are critical for task fulfillment, in a discriminative manner at low LLM inference costs. To unleash the power of key states, we design Subspace-based Hindsight Intrinsic Reward (SHIR) to guide agents toward key states by increasing reward density. Additionally, we build the Key State Memory Tree (KSMT) to track transitions between key states in a specific task for organized exploration. Benefiting from diminishing redundant explorations, LEMAE outperforms existing SOTA approaches on the challenging benchmarks (e.g., SMAC and MPE) by a large margin, achieving a 10x acceleration in certain scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Di Pierro, Stefano Ferilli</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph reachability is the task of understanding whether two distinct points in a graph are interconnected by arcs to which in general a semantic is attached. Reachability has plenty of applications, ranging from motion planning to routing. Improving reachability requires structural knowledge of relations so as to avoid the complexity of traditional depth-first and breadth-first strategies, implemented in logic languages. In some contexts, graphs are enriched with their schema definitions establishing domain and range for every arc. The introduction of a schema-aware formalization for guiding the search may result in a sensitive improvement by cutting out unuseful paths and prioritising those that, in principle, reach the target earlier. In this work, we propose a strategy to automatically exclude and sort certain graph paths by exploiting the higher-level conceptualization of instances. The aim is to obtain a new first-order logic reformulation of the graph reachability scenario, capable of improving the traditional algorithms in terms of time, space requirements, and number of backtracks. The experiments exhibit the expected advantages of the approach in reducing the number of backtracks during the search strategy, resulting in saving time and space as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyang Zhang, Aakash Patel, Syed A Rizvi, Nianchen Liu, Sizhuang He, Amin Karbasi, Emanuele Zappala, David van Dijk</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the emergence of intelligent behavior in artificial systems by investigating how the complexity of rule-based systems influences the capabilities of models trained to predict these rules. Our study focuses on elementary cellular automata (ECA), simple yet powerful one-dimensional systems that generate behaviors ranging from trivial to highly complex. By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. We conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predictive business process analytics has become important for organizations, offering real-time operational support for their processes. However, these algorithms often perform unfair predictions because they are based on biased variables (e.g., gender or nationality), namely variables embodying discrimination. This paper addresses the challenge of integrating a debiasing phase into predictive business process analytics to ensure that predictions are not influenced by biased variables. Our framework leverages on adversial debiasing is evaluated on four case studies, showing a significant reduction in the contribution of biased variables to the predicted value. The proposed technique is also compared with the state of the art in fairness in process mining, illustrating that our framework allows for a more enhanced level of fairness, while retaining a better prediction quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: While multimodal foundation models can now natively work with data beyond text, they remain underutilized in analyzing the considerable amounts of multi-dimensional time-series data in fields like healthcare, finance, and social sciences, representing a missed opportunity for richer, data-driven insights. This paper proposes a simple but effective method that leverages the existing vision encoders of these models to "see" time-series data via plots, avoiding the need for additional, potentially costly, model training. Our empirical evaluations show that this approach outperforms providing the raw time-series data as text, with the additional benefit that visual time-series representations demonstrate up to a 90% reduction in model API costs. We validate our hypothesis through synthetic data tasks of increasing complexity, progressing from simple functional form identification on clean data, to extracting trends from noisy scatter plots. To demonstrate generalizability from synthetic tasks with clear reasoning steps to more complex, real-world scenarios, we apply our approach to consumer health tasks - specifically fall detection, activity recognition, and readiness assessment - which involve heterogeneous, noisy data and multi-step reasoning. The overall success in plot performance over text performance (up to an 120% performance increase on zero-shot synthetic tasks, and up to 150% performance increase on real-world tasks), across both GPT and Gemini model families, highlights our approach's potential for making the best use of the native capabilities of foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyang Liu, Xinrui Yang, Shiguang Sun, Long Qian, Lipeng Wan, Xingyu Chen, Xuguang Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in generative models has stimulated significant innovations in many fields, such as image generation and chatbots. Despite their success, these models often produce sketchy and misleading solutions for complex multi-agent decision-making problems because they miss the trial-and-error experience and reasoning as humans. To address this limitation, we explore a paradigm that integrates a language-guided simulator into the multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline to enhance the generated answer. The simulator is a world model that separately learns dynamics and reward, where the dynamics model comprises an image tokenizer as well as a causal transformer to generate interaction transitions autoregressively, and the reward model is a bidirectional transformer learned by maximizing the likelihood of trajectories in the expert demonstrations under language guidance. Given an image of the current state and the task description, we use the world model to train the joint policy and produce the image sequence as the answer by running the converged policy on the dynamics model. The empirical results demonstrate that this framework can improve the answers for multi-agent decision-making problems by showing superior performance on the training and unseen tasks of the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge benchmark. In particular, it can generate consistent interaction sequences and explainable reward functions at interaction states, opening the path for training generative models of the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melkamu Abay Mersha, Mesay Gemeda yigezu, Jugal Kalita</p>
<p>Abstract: Topic modeling is a powerful technique to discover hidden topics and patterns within a collection of documents without prior knowledge. Traditional topic modeling and clustering-based techniques encounter challenges in capturing contextual semantic information. This study introduces an innovative end-to-end semantic-driven topic modeling technique for the topic extraction process, utilizing advanced word and document embeddings combined with a powerful clustering algorithm. This semantic-driven approach represents a significant advancement in topic modeling methodologies. It leverages contextual semantic information to extract coherent and meaningful topics. Specifically, our model generates document embeddings using pre-trained transformer-based language models, reduces the dimensions of the embeddings, clusters the embeddings based on semantic similarity, and generates coherent topics for each cluster. Compared to ChatGPT and traditional topic modeling algorithms, our model provides more coherent and meaningful topics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models may carry societal transformation to an extent demanding a delicate balance between opportunity and risk. This manuscript is the first of a series of White Papers informing the development of IEEE-SA's p3995: `Standard for the Implementation of Safeguards, Controls, and Preventive Techniques for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Models', Chair: Marina Cort\^{e}s (https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/3395/11378/). In this first horizon-scanning we identify key attention areas for standards activities in AI. We examine different principles for regulatory efforts, and review notions of accountability, privacy, data rights and mis-use. As a safeguards standard we devote significant attention to the stability of global infrastructures and consider a possible overdependence on cloud computing that may result from densely coupled AI components. We review the recent cascade-failure-like Crowdstrike event in July 2024, as an illustration of potential impacts on critical infrastructures from AI-induced incidents in the (near) future. It is the first of a set of articles intended as White Papers informing the audience on the standard development. Upcoming articles will focus on regulatory initiatives, technology evolution and the role of AI in specific domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tara DeZao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of building consumer trust in AI-powered customer engagement by emphasising the necessity for transparency and accountability. Despite the potential of AI to revolutionise business operations and enhance customer experiences, widespread concerns about misinformation and the opacity of AI decision-making processes hinder trust. Surveys highlight a significant lack of awareness among consumers regarding their interactions with AI, alongside apprehensions about bias and fairness in AI algorithms. The paper advocates for the development of explainable AI models that are transparent and understandable to both consumers and organisational leaders, thereby mitigating potential biases and ensuring ethical use. It underscores the importance of organisational commitment to transparency practices beyond mere regulatory compliance, including fostering a culture of accountability, prioritising clear data policies and maintaining active engagement with stakeholders. By adopting a holistic approach to transparency and explainability, businesses can cultivate trust in AI technologies, bridging the gap between technological innovation and consumer acceptance, and paving the way for more ethical and effective AI-powered customer engagements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Kronlund-Drouault</p>
<p>Abstract: As ML is still a (relatively) recent field of study, especially outside the realm of abstract mathematics, few works have been led on the political aspect of LLMs, and more particularly about the alignment process, and its political dimension. This process can be as simple as prompt engineering, but also very deep and affect completely unrelated questions. For example, politically directed alignment has a very strong impact on an LLM's embedding space, and the relative position of political notions in such a space. Using special tools to evaluate general political bias and analyze the effects of alignment, we can gather new data to understand its causes and possible consequences on society. Indeed, leading a socio-political approach we can hypothesize that most big LLMs are aligned on what Marxist philosophy calls the 'dominant ideology'. As AI's role in political decision-making, at the citizen's scale but also in government agencies, such biases can have huge effects on societal change, either by creating a new and insidious pathway for societal uniformization or by allowing disguised extremist views to gain traction on the people.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fiifi Dawson, Zainab Mosunmola, Sahil Pocker, Raj Abhijit Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat</p>
<p>Abstract: Although LLMs have been extremely effective in a large number of complex tasks, their understanding and functionality for regional languages and cultures are not well studied. In this paper, we explore the ability of various LLMs to comprehend the cultural aspects of two regional languages: Malayalam (state of Kerala, India) and Yoruba (West Africa). Using Hofstede's six cultural dimensions: Power Distance (PDI), Individualism (IDV), Motivation towards Achievement and Success (MAS), Uncertainty Avoidance (UAV), Long Term Orientation (LTO), and Indulgence (IVR), we quantify the cultural awareness of LLM-based responses. We demonstrate that although LLMs show a high cultural similarity for English, they fail to capture the cultural nuances across these 6 metrics for Malayalam and Yoruba. We also highlight the need for large-scale regional language LLM training with culturally enriched datasets. This will have huge implications for enhancing the user experience of chat-based LLMs and also improving the validity of large-scale LLM agent-based market research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhikai Li, Jing Zhang, Qingyi Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: The disparity in healthcare personnel expertise and medical resources across different regions of the world is a pressing social issue. Artificial intelligence technology offers new opportunities to alleviate this issue. Segment Anything Model (SAM), which excels in intelligent image segmentation, has demonstrated exceptional performance in medical monitoring and assisted diagnosis. Unfortunately, the huge computational and storage overhead of SAM poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-limited edge devices. Quantization is an effective solution for model compression; however, traditional methods rely heavily on original data for calibration, which raises widespread concerns about medical data privacy and security. In this paper, we propose a data-free quantization framework for SAM, called DFQ-SAM, which learns and calibrates quantization parameters without any original data, thus effectively preserving data privacy during model compression. Specifically, we propose pseudo-positive label evolution for segmentation, combined with patch similarity, to fully leverage the semantic and distribution priors in pre-trained models, which facilitates high-quality data synthesis as a substitute for real data. Furthermore, we introduce scale reparameterization to ensure the accuracy of low-bit quantization. We perform extensive segmentation experiments on various datasets, and DFQ-SAM consistently provides significant performance on low-bit quantization. DFQ-SAM eliminates the need for data transfer in cloud-edge collaboration, thereby protecting sensitive data from potential attacks. It enables secure, fast, and personalized healthcare services at the edge, which enhances system efficiency and optimizes resource allocation, and thus facilitating the pervasive application of artificial intelligence in worldwide healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elham Khamoushi</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized food marketing by providing advanced techniques for personalized recommendations, consumer behavior prediction, and campaign optimization. This paper explores the shift from traditional advertising methods, such as TV, radio, and print, to AI-driven strategies. Traditional approaches were successful in building brand awareness but lacked the level of personalization that modern consumers demand. AI leverages data from consumer purchase histories, browsing behaviors, and social media activity to create highly tailored marketing campaigns. These strategies allow for more accurate product recommendations, prediction of consumer needs, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and user experience. AI enhances marketing efforts by automating labor-intensive processes, leading to greater efficiency and cost savings. It also enables the continuous adaptation of marketing messages, ensuring they remain relevant and engaging over time. While AI presents significant benefits in terms of personalization and efficiency, it also comes with challenges, particularly the substantial investment required for technology and skilled expertise. This paper compares the strengths and weaknesses of traditional and AI-driven food marketing techniques, offering valuable insights into how marketers can leverage AI to create more effective and targeted marketing strategies in the evolving digital landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic scene generation is an essential area of research with applications in robotics, recreation, visual representation, training and simulation, education, and more. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-arts in automatic scene generation, focusing on techniques that leverage machine learning, deep learning, embedded systems, and natural language processing (NLP). We categorize the models into four main types: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformers, and Diffusion Models. Each category is explored in detail, discussing various sub-models and their contributions to the field.
  We also review the most commonly used datasets, such as COCO-Stuff, Visual Genome, and MS-COCO, which are critical for training and evaluating these models. Methodologies for scene generation are examined, including image-to-3D conversion, text-to-3D generation, UI/layout design, graph-based methods, and interactive scene generation. Evaluation metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence, Inception Score (IS), Intersection over Union (IoU), and Mean Average Precision (mAP) are discussed in the context of their use in assessing model performance.
  The survey identifies key challenges and limitations in the field, such as maintaining realism, handling complex scenes with multiple objects, and ensuring consistency in object relationships and spatial arrangements. By summarizing recent advances and pinpointing areas for improvement, this survey aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on automatic scene generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines the governance of multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) through individual and collective deliberation, focusing on analyses of politically sensitive videos. We conducted a two-step study: first, interviews with 10 journalists established a baseline understanding of expert video interpretation; second, 114 individuals from the general public engaged in deliberation using Inclusive.AI, a platform that facilitates democratic decision-making through decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) mechanisms. Our findings show that while experts emphasized emotion and narrative, the general public prioritized factual clarity, objectivity of the situation, and emotional neutrality. Additionally, we explored the impact of different governance mechanisms: quadratic vs. weighted ranking voting and equal vs. 20-80 power distributions on users decision-making on how AI should behave. Specifically, quadratic voting enhanced perceptions of liberal democracy and political equality, and participants who were more optimistic about AI perceived the voting process to have a higher level of participatory democracy. Our results suggest the potential of applying DAO mechanisms to help democratize AI governance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines the integration of AI's carbon footprint into the risk management frameworks (RMFs) of the banking sector, emphasising its importance in aligning with sustainability goals and regulatory requirements. As AI becomes increasingly central to banking operations, its energy-intensive processes contribute significantly to carbon emissions, posing environmental, regulatory, and reputational risks. Regulatory frameworks such as the EU AI Act, Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), and the Prudential Regulation Authority's SS1/23 are driving banks to incorporate environmental considerations into their AI model governance. Recent advancements in AI research, like the Open Mixture-of-Experts (OLMoE) framework and the Agentic RAG framework, offer more efficient and dynamic AI models, reducing their carbon footprint without compromising performance. Using these technological examples, the paper outlines a structured approach for banks to identify, assess, and mitigate AI's carbon footprint within their RMFs, including adopting energy-efficient models, utilising green cloud computing, and implementing lifecycle management.</p>

Inspired by existing sequence models such as Image Transformers, PixelCNN, and Mamba-Bytes, our method aims to capture diverse inputs in a cohesive representation, exploring the integration of different data types, particularly text, audio, and pixelated images (sprites). We conducted experiments on a specialized PixelBytes Pok{\'e}mon dataset. Initially, we investigated various model architectures, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), State Space Models (SSMs), and Attention-based models, focusing on bidirectional processing and our convolutional PxBy embedding technique. Subsequently, we evaluated models based on data reduction strategies and the effectiveness of autoregressive learning. We specifically examined Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in both predictive and autoregressive modes for our main experiments. Our findings suggest that autoregressive models outperform predictive models in this context. By adopting a flexible approach to multimodal modeling, PixelBytes contributes to the ongoing development of foundation models capable of understanding and generating multimodal data. The complete PixelBytes project, including code, models, and datasets, is available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Cavenaghi, Alessio Zanga, Fabio Stella, Markus Zanker</p>
<p>Abstract: Causality is receiving increasing attention in the Recommendation Systems (RSs) community, which has realised that RSs could greatly benefit from causality to transform accurate predictions into effective and explainable decisions. Indeed, the RS literature has repeatedly highlighted that, in real-world scenarios, recommendation algorithms suffer many types of biases since assumptions ensuring unbiasedness are likely not met. In this discussion paper, we formulate the RS problem in terms of causality, using potential outcomes and structural causal models, by giving formal definitions of the causal quantities to be estimated and a general causal graph to serve as a reference to foster future research and development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Wuttke, Matthias A{\ss}enmacher, Christopher Klamm, Max M. Lang, Quirin W\"urschinger, Frauke Kreuter</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional methods for eliciting people's opinions face a trade-off between depth and scale: structured surveys enable large-scale data collection but limit respondents' ability to express unanticipated thoughts in their own words, while conversational interviews provide deeper insights but are resource-intensive. This study explores the potential of replacing human interviewers with large language models (LLMs) to conduct scalable conversational interviews. Our goal is to assess the performance of AI Conversational Interviewing and to identify opportunities for improvement in a controlled environment. We conducted a small-scale, in-depth study with university students who were randomly assigned to be interviewed by either AI or human interviewers, both employing identical questionnaires on political topics. Various quantitative and qualitative measures assessed interviewer adherence to guidelines, response quality, participant engagement, and overall interview efficacy. The findings indicate the viability of AI Conversational Interviewing in producing quality data comparable to traditional methods, with the added benefit of scalability. Based on our experiences, we present specific recommendations for effective implementation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seif Gad, Sherif Abdelfattah, Ghodai Abdelrahman</p>
<p>Abstract: Tracing a student's knowledge growth given the past exercise answering is a vital objective in automatic tutoring systems to customize the learning experience. Yet, achieving this objective is a non-trivial task as it involves modeling the knowledge state across multiple knowledge components (KCs) while considering their temporal and relational dynamics during the learning process. Knowledge tracing methods have tackled this task by either modeling KCs' temporal dynamics using recurrent models or relational dynamics across KCs and questions using graph models. Albeit, there is a lack of methods that could learn joint embedding between relational and temporal dynamics of the task. Moreover, many methods that count for the impact of a student's forgetting behavior during the learning process use hand-crafted features, limiting their generalization on different scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel method that jointly models the relational and temporal dynamics of the knowledge state using a deep temporal graph memory network. In addition, we propose a generic technique for representing a student's forgetting behavior using temporal decay constraints on the graph memory module. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using multiple knowledge tracing benchmarks while comparing it to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanquan Shao, Yi Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Grasping manipulation is a fundamental mode for human interaction with daily life objects. The synthesis of grasping motion is also greatly demanded in many applications such as animation and robotics. In objects grasping research field, most works focus on generating the last static grasping pose with a parallel gripper or dexterous hand. Grasping motion generation for the full arm especially for the full humanlike intelligent agent is still under-explored. In this work, we propose a grasping motion generation framework for digital human which is an anthropomorphic intelligent agent with high degrees of freedom in virtual world. Given an object known initial pose in 3D space, we first generate a target pose for whole-body digital human based on off-the-shelf target grasping pose generation methods. With an initial pose and this generated target pose, a transformer-based neural network is used to generate the whole grasping trajectory, which connects initial pose and target pose smoothly and naturally. Additionally, two post optimization components are designed to mitigates foot-skating issue and hand-object interpenetration separately. Experiments are conducted on GRAB dataset to demonstrate effectiveness of this proposed method for whole-body grasping motion generation with randomly placed unknown objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Yi Leong, Yi Fan Gao, Shuai Ji, Bora Kalaycioglu, Uktu Pamuksuz</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing administrative burden of medical documentation, particularly through Electronic Health Records (EHR), significantly reduces the time available for direct patient care and contributes to physician burnout. To address this issue, we propose MediNotes, an advanced generative AI framework designed to automate the creation of SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes from medical conversations. MediNotes integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to capture and process both text and voice inputs in real time or from recorded audio, generating structured and contextually accurate medical notes. The framework also incorporates advanced techniques like Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for efficient model fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, MediNotes offers a query-based retrieval system, allowing healthcare providers and patients to access relevant medical information quickly and accurately. Evaluations using the ACI-BENCH dataset demonstrate that MediNotes significantly improves the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of automated medical documentation, offering a robust solution to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare professionals while improving the quality of clinical workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omkar Kulkarni, Rohitash Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical time series datasets feature missing values that need data imputation methods, however, conventional machine learning models fall short due to a lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions. Among these models, the CATSI (Context-Aware Time Series Imputation) stands out for its effectiveness by incorporating a context vector into the imputation process, capturing the global dependencies of each patient. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Context-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages uncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the time series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference assumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest to the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational Bayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that Bayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model. Specifically, an instance of Bayes-CATSI outperforms CATSI by 9.57 %. We provide an open-source code implementation for applying Bayes-CATSI to other medical data imputation problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuhao Lu, Rui Li, Elham Sagheb, Andrew Wen, Jinlian Wang, Liwei Wang, Jungwei W. Fan, Hongfang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diagnosis prediction is a critical task in healthcare, where timely and accurate identification of medical conditions can significantly impact patient outcomes. Traditional machine learning and deep learning models have achieved notable success in this domain but often lack interpretability which is a crucial requirement in clinical settings. In this study, we explore the use of neuro-symbolic methods, specifically Logical Neural Networks (LNNs), to develop explainable models for diagnosis prediction. Essentially, we design and implement LNN-based models that integrate domain-specific knowledge through logical rules with learnable thresholds. Our models, particularly $M_{\text{multi-pathway}}$ and $M_{\text{comprehensive}}$, demonstrate superior performance over traditional models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest, achieving higher accuracy (up to 80.52\%) and AUROC scores (up to 0.8457) in the case study of diabetes prediction. The learned weights and thresholds within the LNN models provide direct insights into feature contributions, enhancing interpretability without compromising predictive power. These findings highlight the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches in bridging the gap between accuracy and explainability in healthcare AI applications. By offering transparent and adaptable diagnostic models, our work contributes to the advancement of precision medicine and supports the development of equitable healthcare solutions. Future research will focus on extending these methods to larger and more diverse datasets to further validate their applicability across different medical conditions and populations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandros Xenos, Noel-Malod Dognin, Natasa Przulj</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-dimensional embeddings are a cornerstone in the modelling and analysis of complex networks. However, most existing approaches for mining network embedding spaces rely on computationally intensive machine learning systems to facilitate downstream tasks. In the field of NLP, word embedding spaces capture semantic relationships \textit{linearly}, allowing for information retrieval using \textit{simple linear operations} on word embedding vectors. Here, we demonstrate that there are structural properties of network data that yields this linearity. We show that the more homophilic the network representation, the more linearly separable the corresponding network embedding space, yielding better downstream analysis results. Hence, we introduce novel graphlet-based methods enabling embedding of networks into more linearly separable spaces, allowing for their better mining. Our fundamental insights into the structure of network data that enable their \textit{\textbf{linear}} mining and exploitation enable the ML community to build upon, towards efficiently and explainably mining of the complex network data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehoon Oh, Seungjun Shin, Dokwan Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Massive activations, which manifest in specific feature dimensions of hidden states, introduce a significant bias in large language models (LLMs), leading to an overemphasis on the corresponding token. In this paper, we identify that massive activations originate not from the hidden state but from the intermediate state of a feed-forward network module in an early layer. Expanding on the previous observation that massive activations occur only in specific feature dimensions, we dive deep into the weights that cause massive activations. Specifically, we define top-$k$ massive weights as the weights that contribute to the dimensions with the top-$k$ magnitudes in the intermediate state. When these massive weights are set to zero, the functionality of LLMs is entirely disrupted. However, when all weights except for massive weights are set to zero, it results in a relatively minor performance drop, even though a much larger number of weights are set to zero. This implies that during the pre-training process, learning is dominantly focused on massive weights. Building on this observation, we propose a simple plug-and-play method called MacDrop (massive weights curriculum dropout), to rely less on massive weights during parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This method applies dropout to the pre-trained massive weights, starting with a high dropout probability and gradually decreasing it as fine-tuning progresses. Through experiments, we demonstrate that MacDrop generally improves performance across zero-shot downstream tasks and generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shouvon Sarker, Xishuang Dong, Xiangfang Li, Lijun Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQLs enables non-expert users to effortlessly retrieve desired information from relational databases using natural language queries. While recent advancements, particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and T5, have shown impressive performance on large-scale benchmarks such as BIRD, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM-based Text-to-SQLs models often require significant efforts to develop auxiliary tools like SQL classifiers to achieve high performance. This paper proposed a novel approach that only needs SQL Quality Measurement to enhance LLMs-based Text-to-SQLs performance. It establishes a SQL quality evaluation mechanism to assess the generated SQL queries against predefined criteria and actual database responses. This feedback loop enables continuous learning and refinement of model outputs based on both syntactic correctness and semantic accuracy. The proposed method undergoes comprehensive validation on the BIRD benchmark, assessing Execution Accuracy (EX) and Valid Efficiency Score (VES) across various Text-to-SQLs difficulty levels. Experimental results reveal competitive performance in both EX and VES compared to SOTA models like GPT4 and T5.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Bornstein, Zora Che, Suhas Julapalli, Abdirisak Mohamed, Amrit Singh Bedi, Furong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era of "moving fast and breaking things", regulators have moved slowly to pick up the safety, bias, and legal pieces left in the wake of broken Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment. Since AI models, such as large language models, are able to push misinformation and stoke division within our society, it is imperative for regulators to employ a framework that mitigates these dangers and ensures user safety. While there is much-warranted discussion about how to address the safety, bias, and legal woes of state-of-the-art AI models, the number of rigorous and realistic mathematical frameworks to regulate AI safety is lacking. We take on this challenge, proposing an auction-based regulatory mechanism that provably incentivizes model-building agents (i) to deploy safer models and (ii) to participate in the regulation process. We provably guarantee, via derived Nash Equilibria, that each participating agent's best strategy is to submit a model safer than a prescribed minimum-safety threshold. Empirical results show that our regulatory auction boosts safety and participation rates by 20% and 15% respectively, outperforming simple regulatory frameworks that merely enforce minimum safety standards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Alert fatigue is a common issue faced by software teams using the DevSecOps paradigm. The overwhelming number of warnings and alerts generated by security and code scanning tools, particularly in smaller teams where resources are limited, leads to desensitization and diminished responsiveness to security warnings, potentially exposing systems to vulnerabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs in generating actionable security reports that emphasize the financial impact and consequences of detected security issues, such as credential leaks, if they remain unaddressed. A survey conducted among developers indicates that LLM-generated reports significantly enhance the likelihood of immediate action on security issues by providing clear, comprehensive, and motivating insights. Integrating these reports into DevSecOps workflows can mitigate attention saturation and alert fatigue, ensuring that critical security warnings are addressed effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aakash Varma Nadimpalli, Ajita Rattani</p>
<p>Abstract: With the significant advances in deep generative models for image and video synthesis, Deepfakes and manipulated media have raised severe societal concerns. Conventional machine learning classifiers for deepfake detection often fail to cope with evolving deepfake generation technology and are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Alternatively, invisible image watermarking is being researched as a proactive defense technique that allows media authentication by verifying an invisible secret message embedded in the image pixels. A handful of invisible image watermarking techniques introduced for media authentication have proven vulnerable to basic image processing operations and watermark removal attacks. In response, we have proposed a semi-fragile image watermarking technique that embeds an invisible secret message into real images for media authentication. Our proposed watermarking framework is designed to be fragile to facial manipulations or tampering while being robust to benign image-processing operations and watermark removal attacks. This is facilitated through a unique architecture of our proposed technique consisting of critic and adversarial networks that enforce high image quality and resiliency to watermark removal efforts, respectively, along with the backbone encoder-decoder and the discriminator networks. Thorough experimental investigations on SOTA facial Deepfake datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can embed a $64$-bit secret as an imperceptible image watermark that can be recovered with a high-bit recovery accuracy when benign image processing operations are applied while being non-recoverable when unseen Deepfake manipulations are applied. In addition, our proposed watermarking technique demonstrates high resilience to several white-box and black-box watermark removal attacks. Thus, obtaining state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work tackles the information loss bottleneck of vector-quantization (VQ) autoregressive image generation by introducing a novel model architecture called the 2-Dimensional Autoregression (DnD) Transformer. The DnD-Transformer predicts more codes for an image by introducing a new autoregression direction, \textit{model depth}, along with the sequence length direction. Compared to traditional 1D autoregression and previous work utilizing similar 2D image decomposition such as RQ-Transformer, the DnD-Transformer is an end-to-end model that can generate higher quality images with the same backbone model size and sequence length, opening a new optimization perspective for autoregressive image generation. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that the DnD-Transformer's potential extends beyond generating natural images. It can even generate images with rich text and graphical elements in a self-supervised manner, demonstrating an understanding of these combined modalities. This has not been previously demonstrated for popular vision generative models such as diffusion models, showing a spark of vision-language intelligence when trained solely on images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Musco, R. Teal Witter</p>
<p>Abstract: Originally introduced in game theory, Shapley values have emerged as a central tool in explainable machine learning, where they are used to attribute model predictions to specific input features. However, computing Shapley values exactly is expensive: for a general model with $n$ features, $O(2^n)$ model evaluations are necessary. To address this issue, approximation algorithms are widely used. One of the most popular is the Kernel SHAP algorithm, which is model agnostic and remarkably effective in practice. However, to the best of our knowledge, Kernel SHAP has no strong non-asymptotic complexity guarantees. We address this issue by introducing Leverage SHAP, a light-weight modification of Kernel SHAP that provides provably accurate Shapley value estimates with just $O(n\log n)$ model evaluations. Our approach takes advantage of a connection between Shapley value estimation and agnostic active learning by employing leverage score sampling, a powerful regression tool. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we show that Leverage SHAP consistently outperforms even the highly optimized implementation of Kernel SHAP available in the ubiquitous SHAP library [Lundberg & Lee, 2017].</p>

<p>Abstract: Agentic AIs $-$ AIs that are capable and permitted to undertake complex actions with little supervision $-$ mark a new frontier in AI capabilities and raise new questions about how to safely create and align such systems with users, developers, and society. Because agents' actions are influenced by their attitudes toward risk, one key aspect of alignment concerns the risk profiles of agentic AIs. Risk alignment will matter for user satisfaction and trust, but it will also have important ramifications for society more broadly, especially as agentic AIs become more autonomous and are allowed to control key aspects of our lives. AIs with reckless attitudes toward risk (either because they are calibrated to reckless human users or are poorly designed) may pose significant threats. They might also open 'responsibility gaps' in which there is no agent who can be held accountable for harmful actions. What risk attitudes should guide an agentic AI's decision-making? How might we design AI systems that are calibrated to the risk attitudes of their users? What guardrails, if any, should be placed on the range of permissible risk attitudes? What are the ethical considerations involved when designing systems that make risky decisions on behalf of others? We present three papers that bear on key normative and technical aspects of these questions.</p>

While soft mixtures of experts (SoftMoEs) have recently shown promise in mitigating this issue for online RL, the reasons behind their effectiveness remain largely unknown. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis identifying the key factors driving this performance gain. We discover the surprising result that tokenizing the encoder output, rather than the use of multiple experts, is what is behind the efficacy of SoftMoEs. Indeed, we demonstrate that even with an appropriately scaled single expert, we are able to maintain the performance gains, largely thanks to tokenization.</p>

CHASE-SQL leverages LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to generate diverse and high-quality SQL candidates using different LLM generators with: (1) a divide-and-conquer method that decomposes complex queries into manageable sub-queries in a single LLM call; (2) chain-of-thought reasoning based on query execution plans, reflecting the steps a database engine takes during execution; and (3) a unique instance-aware synthetic example generation technique, which offers specific few-shot demonstrations tailored to test questions.To identify the best candidate, a selection agent is employed to rank the candidates through pairwise comparisons with a fine-tuned binary-candidates selection LLM. This selection approach has been demonstrated to be more robust over alternatives. The proposed generators-selector framework not only enhances the quality and diversity of SQL queries but also outperforms previous methods. Overall, our proposed CHASE-SQL achieves the state-of-the-art execution accuracy of 73.0% and 73.01% on the test set and development set of the notable BIRD Text-to-SQL dataset benchmark, rendering CHASE-SQL the top submission of the leaderboard (at the time of paper submission).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Jiayang Gu, Jingkuan Song, An Zhang, Lianli Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Mitigating the detrimental effects of noisy labels on the training process has become increasingly critical, as obtaining entirely clean or human-annotated samples for large-scale pre-training tasks is often impractical. Nonetheless, existing noise mitigation methods often encounter limitations in practical applications due to their task-specific design, model dependency, and significant computational overhead. In this work, we exploit the properties of high-dimensional orthogonality to identify a robust and effective boundary in cone space for separating clean and noisy samples. Building on this, we propose One-step Anti-Noise (OSA), a model-agnostic noisy label mitigation paradigm that employs an estimator model and a scoring function to assess the noise level of input pairs through just one-step inference, a cost-efficient process. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of OSA, highlighting its enhanced training robustness, improved task transferability, ease of deployment, and reduced computational costs across various benchmarks, models, and tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinlong Hou, Sen Shen, Xueshen Li, Xinran Gao, Ziyi Huang, Steven J. Holiday, Matthew R. Cribbet, Susan W. White, Edward Sazonov, Yu Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Being able to accurately monitor the screen exposure of young children is important for research on phenomena linked to screen use such as childhood obesity, physical activity, and social interaction. Most existing studies rely upon self-report or manual measures from bulky wearable sensors, thus lacking efficiency and accuracy in capturing quantitative screen exposure data. In this work, we developed a novel sensor informatics framework that utilizes egocentric images from a wearable sensor, termed the screen time tracker (STT), and a vision language model (VLM). In particular, we devised a multi-view VLM that takes multiple views from egocentric image sequences and interprets screen exposure dynamically. We validated our approach by using a dataset of children's free-living activities, demonstrating significant improvement over existing methods in plain vision language models and object detection models. Results supported the promise of this monitoring approach, which could optimize behavioral research on screen exposure in children's naturalistic settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Basiri, Ali Abedi, Chau Nguyen, Milos R. Popovic, Shehroz S. Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a leading cause of hospitalizations and lower limb amputations, placing a substantial burden on patients and healthcare systems. Early detection and accurate classification of DFUs are critical for preventing serious complications, yet many patients experience delays in receiving care due to limited access to specialized services. Telehealth has emerged as a promising solution, improving access to care and reducing the need for in-person visits. The integration of artificial intelligence and pattern recognition into telemedicine has further enhanced DFU management by enabling automatic detection, classification, and monitoring from images. Despite advancements in artificial intelligence-driven approaches for DFU image analysis, the application of large language models for DFU image transcription has not yet been explored. To address this gap, we introduce UlcerGPT, a novel multimodal approach leveraging large language and vision models for DFU image transcription. This framework combines advanced vision and language models, such as Large Language and Vision Assistant and Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, to transcribe DFU images by jointly detecting, classifying, and localizing regions of interest. Through detailed experiments on a public dataset, evaluated by expert clinicians, UlcerGPT demonstrates promising results in the accuracy and efficiency of DFU transcription, offering potential support for clinicians in delivering timely care via telemedicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Jeevan, Neeraj Nixon, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose two new evaluation metrics to assess realness of generated images based on normalizing flows: a simpler and efficient flow-based likelihood distance (FLD) and a more exact dual-flow based likelihood distance (D-FLD). Because normalizing flows can be used to compute the exact likelihood, the proposed metrics assess how closely generated images align with the distribution of real images from a given domain. This property gives the proposed metrics a few advantages over the widely used Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) and other recent metrics. Firstly, the proposed metrics need only a few hundred images to stabilize (converge in mean), as opposed to tens of thousands needed for FID, and at least a few thousand for the other metrics. This allows confident evaluation of even small sets of generated images, such as validation batches inside training loops. Secondly, the network used to compute the proposed metric has over an order of magnitude fewer parameters compared to Inception-V3 used to compute FID, making it computationally more efficient. For assessing the realness of generated images in new domains (e.g., x-ray images), ideally these networks should be retrained on real images to model their distinct distributions. Thus, our smaller network will be even more advantageous for new domains. Extensive experiments show that the proposed metrics have the desired monotonic relationships with the extent of image degradation of various kinds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasilis Siomos, Sergio Naval-Marimont, Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach, Giacomo Tarroni</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized collaborative training paradigm that preserves stakeholders' data ownership while improving performance and generalization. However, statistical heterogeneity among client datasets poses a fundamental challenge by degrading system performance. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Normalization-free Feature Recalibration (ANFR), an architecture-level approach that combines weight standardization and channel attention. Weight standardization normalizes the weights of layers instead of activations. This is less susceptible to mismatched client statistics and inconsistent averaging, thereby more robust under heterogeneity. Channel attention produces learnable scaling factors for feature maps, suppressing those that are inconsistent between clients due to heterogeneity. We demonstrate that combining these techniques boosts model performance beyond their individual contributions, by enhancing class selectivity and optimizing channel attention weight distribution. ANFR operates independently of the aggregation method and is effective in both global and personalized federated learning settings, with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, when training with differential privacy, ANFR achieves an appealing balance between privacy and utility, enabling strong privacy guarantees without sacrificing performance. By integrating weight standardization and channel attention in the backbone model, ANFR offers a novel and versatile approach to the challenge of statistical heterogeneity. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that ANFR consistently outperforms established baselines across various aggregation methods, datasets, and heterogeneity conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Greg B Fotopoulos, Paul Popovich, Nicholas Hall Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-convex optimization is a critical tool in advancing machine learning, especially for complex models like deep neural networks and support vector machines. Despite challenges such as multiple local minima and saddle points, non-convex techniques offer various pathways to reduce computational costs. These include promoting sparsity through regularization, efficiently escaping saddle points, and employing subsampling and approximation strategies like stochastic gradient descent. Additionally, non-convex methods enable model pruning and compression, which reduce the size of models while maintaining performance. By focusing on good local minima instead of exact global minima, non-convex optimization ensures competitive accuracy with faster convergence and lower computational overhead. This paper examines the key methods and applications of non-convex optimization in machine learning, exploring how it can lower computation costs while enhancing model performance. Furthermore, it outlines future research directions and challenges, including scalability and generalization, that will shape the next phase of non-convex optimization in machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Bolun (Namir),  Xia, Mohammed J. Zaki, Aparna Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has initiated much research into their various financial applications. However, in applying LLMs on long documents, semantic relations are not explicitly incorporated, and a full or arbitrarily sparse attention operation is employed. In recent years, progress has been made in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which is a graph-based representation of text to preserve its semantic relations. Since AMR can represent semantic relationships at a deeper level, it can be beneficially utilized by graph neural networks (GNNs) for constructing effective document-level graph representations built upon LLM embeddings to predict target metrics in the financial domain. We propose FLAG: Financial Long document classification via AMR-based GNN, an AMR graph based framework to generate document-level embeddings for long financial document classification. We construct document-level graphs from sentence-level AMR graphs, endow them with specialized LLM word embeddings in the financial domain, apply a deep learning mechanism that utilizes a GNN, and examine the efficacy of our AMR-based approach in predicting labeled target data from long financial documents. Extensive experiments are conducted on a dataset of quarterly earnings calls transcripts of companies in various sectors of the economy, as well as on a corpus of more recent earnings calls of companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index. We find that our AMR-based approach outperforms fine-tuning LLMs directly on text in predicting stock price movement trends at different time horizons in both datasets. Our work also outperforms previous work utilizing document graphs and GNNs for text classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivam Kumar, Yun Yang, Lizhen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we explore the theoretical properties of conditional deep generative models under the statistical framework of distribution regression where the response variable lies in a high-dimensional ambient space but concentrates around a potentially lower-dimensional manifold. More specifically, we study the large-sample properties of a likelihood-based approach for estimating these models. Our results lead to the convergence rate of a sieve maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for estimating the conditional distribution (and its devolved counterpart) of the response given predictors in the Hellinger (Wasserstein) metric. Our rates depend solely on the intrinsic dimension and smoothness of the true conditional distribution. These findings provide an explanation of why conditional deep generative models can circumvent the curse of dimensionality from the perspective of statistical foundations and demonstrate that they can learn a broader class of nearly singular conditional distributions. Our analysis also emphasizes the importance of introducing a small noise perturbation to the data when they are supported sufficiently close to a manifold. Finally, in our numerical studies, we demonstrate the effective implementation of the proposed approach using both synthetic and real-world datasets, which also provide complementary validation to our theoretical findings.</p>

In this work, through a multimodal, multilingual retrieval case study, we quantify the existing lack of model flexibility. We empirically show performance gaps between training on captions that come from native German perception and captions that have been either machine-translated or human-translated from English into German. To address these gaps, we further propose and evaluate caption augmentation strategies. While we achieve mean recall improvements (+1.3), gaps still remain, indicating an open area of future work for the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Irfan Ali Meerza, Jian Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a technique that allows multiple parties to train a shared model collaboratively without disclosing their private data. It has become increasingly popular due to its distinct privacy advantages. However, FL models can suffer from biases against certain demographic groups (e.g., racial and gender groups) due to the heterogeneity of data and party selection. Researchers have proposed various strategies for characterizing the group fairness of FL algorithms to address this issue. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in the face of deliberate adversarial attacks has not been fully explored. Although existing studies have revealed various threats (e.g., model poisoning attacks) against FL systems caused by malicious participants, their primary aim is to decrease model accuracy, while the potential of leveraging poisonous model updates to exacerbate model unfairness remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new type of model poisoning attack, EAB-FL, with a focus on exacerbating group unfairness while maintaining a good level of model utility. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our attack, even with state-of-the-art fairness optimization algorithms and secure aggregation rules employed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sreyan Ghosh, Sonal Kumar, Zhifeng Kong, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Synthio, a novel approach for augmenting small-scale audio classification datasets with synthetic data. Our goal is to improve audio classification accuracy with limited labeled data. Traditional data augmentation techniques, which apply artificial transformations (e.g., adding random noise or masking segments), struggle to create data that captures the true diversity present in real-world audios. To address this shortcoming, we propose to augment the dataset with synthetic audio generated from text-to-audio (T2A) diffusion models. However, synthesizing effective augmentations is challenging because not only should the generated data be acoustically consistent with the underlying small-scale dataset, but they should also have sufficient compositional diversity. To overcome the first challenge, we align the generations of the T2A model with the small-scale dataset using preference optimization. This ensures that the acoustic characteristics of the generated data remain consistent with the small-scale dataset. To address the second challenge, we propose a novel caption generation technique that leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models to (1) generate diverse and meaningful audio captions and (2) iteratively refine their quality. The generated captions are then used to prompt the aligned T2A model. We extensively evaluate Synthio on ten datasets and four simulated limited-data settings. Results indicate our method consistently outperforms all baselines by 0.1%-39% using a T2A model trained only on weakly-captioned AudioSet.</p>

In this study, we explore the efficacy of KANs in the context of data representation via autoencoders, comparing their performance with traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our results demonstrate that KAN-based autoencoders achieve competitive performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, thereby suggesting their viability as effective tools in data analysis tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is a red-hot field that brings novel discoveries and exciting opportunities to resolve, speed up, or refine the analysis of a wide range of computational problems. In the realm of biomedical research and personalized medicine, the significance of multi-omics integration lies in its ability to provide a thorough and holistic comprehension of complex biological systems. This technology links fundamental research to clinical practice. The insights gained from integrated omics data can be translated into clinical tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. The fusion of quantum computing and machine learning holds promise for unraveling complex patterns within multi-omics datasets, providing unprecedented insights into the molecular landscape of lung cancer. Due to the heterogeneity, complexity, and high dimensionality of multi-omic cancer data, characterized by the vast number of features (such as gene expression, micro-RNA, and DNA methylation) relative to the limited number of lung cancer patient samples, our prime motivation for this paper is the integration of multi-omic data, unique feature selection, and diagnostic classification of lung subtypes: lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC-I) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD-II) using quantum machine learning. We developed a method for finding the best differentiating features between LUAD and LUSC datasets, which has the potential for biomarker discovery.</p>

We benchmark on competitive programming tasks, where we achieve new start-of-the art results with both small (8B parameters) and large (70B) models while reducing the amount of samples required by an order of magnitude.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangchen Song, Ashish Agarwal, Wen Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened the possibility of automated content production, including coding in software development, which can significantly influence the participation and performance of software developers. To explore this impact, we investigate the role of GitHub Copilot, a generative AI pair programmer, on software development in open-source community, where multiple developers voluntarily collaborate on software projects. Using GitHub's dataset for open-source repositories and a generalized synthetic control method, we find that Copilot significantly enhances project-level productivity by 6.5%. Delving deeper, we dissect the key mechanisms driving this improvement. Our findings reveal a 5.5% increase in individual productivity and a 5.4% increase in participation. However, this is accompanied with a 41.6% increase in integration time, potentially due to higher coordination costs. Interestingly, we also observe the differential effects among developers. We discover that core developers achieve greater project-level productivity gains from using Copilot, benefiting more in terms of individual productivity and participation compared to peripheral developers, plausibly due to their deeper familiarity with software projects. We also find that the increase in project-level productivity is accompanied with no change in code quality. We conclude that AI pair programmers bring benefits to developers to automate and augment their code, but human developers' knowledge of software projects can enhance the benefits. In summary, our research underscores the role of AI pair programmers in impacting project-level productivity within the open-source community and suggests potential implications for the structure of open-source software projects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaurav Patel, Christopher Sandino, Behrooz Mahasseni, Ellen L Zippi, Erdrin Azemi, Ali Moin, Juri Minxha</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) in the context of time-series, focusing on enhancing both parameter efficiency and data-sample utilization. Our approach introduces an improved paradigm for source-model preparation and target-side adaptation, aiming to enhance training efficiency during target adaptation. Specifically, we reparameterize the source model's weights in a Tucker-style decomposed manner, factorizing the model into a compact form during the source model preparation phase. During target-side adaptation, only a subset of these decomposed factors is fine-tuned, leading to significant improvements in training efficiency. We demonstrate using PAC Bayesian analysis that this selective fine-tuning strategy implicitly regularizes the adaptation process by constraining the model's learning capacity. Furthermore, this re-parameterization reduces the overall model size and enhances inference efficiency, making the approach particularly well suited for resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework is compatible with various SFDA methods and achieves significant computational efficiency, reducing the number of fine-tuned parameters and inference overhead in terms of MACs by over 90% while maintaining model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mansi Sakarvadia, Aswathy Ajith, Arham Khan, Nathaniel Hudson, Caleb Geniesse, Kyle Chard, Yaoqing Yang, Ian Foster, Michael W. Mahoney</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) can "memorize" information, i.e., encode training data in their weights in such a way that inference-time queries can lead to verbatim regurgitation of that data. This ability to extract training data can be problematic, for example, when data are private or sensitive. In this work, we investigate methods to mitigate memorization: three regularizer-based, three finetuning-based, and eleven machine unlearning-based methods, with five of the latter being new methods that we introduce. We also introduce TinyMem, a suite of small, computationally-efficient LMs for the rapid development and evaluation of memorization-mitigation methods. We demonstrate that the mitigation methods that we develop using TinyMem can successfully be applied to production-grade LMs, and we determine via experiment that: regularizer-based mitigation methods are slow and ineffective at curbing memorization; fine-tuning-based methods are effective at curbing memorization, but overly expensive, especially for retaining higher accuracies; and unlearning-based methods are faster and more effective, allowing for the precise localization and removal of memorized information from LM weights prior to inference. We show, in particular, that our proposed unlearning method BalancedSubnet outperforms other mitigation methods at removing memorized information while preserving performance on target tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Agarwal, Lv Lu, Arjun Maheswaran, Varsha Mahadevan, Bhaskar Krishnamachari</p>
<p>Abstract: Like any other useful technology, cryptocurrencies are sometimes used for criminal activities. While transactions are recorded on the blockchain, there exists a need for a more rapid and scalable method to detect addresses associated with fraudulent activities. We present RiskSEA, a scalable risk scoring system capable of effectively handling the dynamic nature of large-scale blockchain transaction graphs. The risk scoring system, which we implement for Ethereum, consists of 1. a scalable approach to generating node2vec embedding for entire set of addresses to capture the graph topology 2. transaction-based features to capture the transactional behavioral pattern of an address 3. a classifier model to generate risk score for addresses that combines the node2vec embedding and behavioral features. Efficiently generating node2vec embedding for large scale and dynamically evolving blockchain transaction graphs is challenging, we present two novel approaches for generating node2vec embeddings and effectively scaling it to the entire set of blockchain addresses: 1. node2vec embedding propagation and 2. dynamic node2vec embedding. We present a comprehensive analysis of the proposed approaches. Our experiments show that combining both behavioral and node2vec features boosts the classification performance significantly, and that the dynamic node2vec embeddings perform better than the node2vec propagated embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyas Chaudhari, Ameet Deshpande, Bruno Castro da Silva, Philip S. Thomas</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating policies using off-policy data is crucial for applying reinforcement learning to real-world problems such as healthcare and autonomous driving. Previous methods for off-policy evaluation (OPE) generally suffer from high variance or irreducible bias, leading to unacceptably high prediction errors. In this work, we introduce STAR, a framework for OPE that encompasses a broad range of estimators -- which include existing OPE methods as special cases -- that achieve lower mean squared prediction errors. STAR leverages state abstraction to distill complex, potentially continuous problems into compact, discrete models which we call abstract reward processes (ARPs). Predictions from ARPs estimated from off-policy data are provably consistent (asymptotically correct). Rather than proposing a specific estimator, we present a new framework for OPE and empirically demonstrate that estimators within STAR outperform existing methods. The best STAR estimator outperforms baselines in all twelve cases studied, and even the median STAR estimator surpasses the baselines in seven out of the twelve cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael J. Zellinger, Matt Thomson</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying large language models in production requires simultaneous attention to efficiency and risk control. Prior work has shown the possibility to cut costs while maintaining similar accuracy, but has neglected to focus on risk control. By contrast, here we present hierarchical chains with multi-level abstention (HCMA), which use model-intrinsic uncertainty to delegate queries along the LLM intelligence hierarchy, enabling training-free model switching based solely on black-box API calls. Our framework presents novel trade-offs between efficiency and risk. For example, deploying HCMA on MMLU cuts the error rate of Llama3 405B by 30% when the model is allowed to abstain on 20% of the queries. To calibrate HCMA for optimal performance, our approach uses data-efficient logistic regressions (based on a simple nonlinear feature transformation), which require only 50 or 100 labeled examples to achieve excellent calibration error (ECE), cutting ECE by 50% compared to naive Platt scaling. On free-form generation tasks, we find that chain-of-thought is ineffectual for selective prediction, whereas zero-shot prompting drives error to 0% on TruthfulQA at high abstention rates. As LLMs are increasingly deployed across computing environments with different capabilities (such as mobile, laptop, and cloud), our framework paves the way towards maintaining deployment efficiency while putting in place sharp risk controls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anwoy Chatterjee, H S V N S Kowndinya Renduchintala, Sumit Bhatia, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are found to be surprisingly sensitive to minor variations in prompts, often generating significantly divergent outputs in response to minor variations in the prompts, such as spelling errors, alteration of wording or the prompt template. However, while assessing the quality of an LLM, the focus often tends to be solely on its performance on downstream tasks, while very little to no attention is paid to prompt sensitivity. To fill this gap, we propose POSIX - a novel PrOmpt Sensitivity IndeX as a reliable measure of prompt sensitivity, thereby offering a more comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance. The key idea behind POSIX is to capture the relative change in loglikelihood of a given response upon replacing the corresponding prompt with a different intent-preserving prompt. We provide thorough empirical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of POSIX in capturing prompt sensitivity and subsequently use it to measure and thereby compare prompt sensitivity of various open-source LLMs. We find that merely increasing the parameter count or instruction tuning does not necessarily reduce prompt sensitivity whereas adding some few-shot exemplars, even just one, almost always leads to significant decrease in prompt sensitivity. We also find that alterations to prompt template lead to the highest sensitivity in the case of MCQtype tasks, whereas paraphrasing results in the highest sensitivity in open-ended generation tasks.

<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of smartphones and Location-Based Social Networks has led to a massive influx of spatio-temporal data, creating unparalleled opportunities for enhancing Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems. These advanced POI systems are crucial for enriching user experiences, enabling personalized interactions, and optimizing decision-making processes in the digital landscape. However, existing surveys tend to focus on traditional approaches and few of them delve into cutting-edge developments, emerging architectures, as well as security considerations in POI recommendations. To address this gap, our survey stands out by offering a comprehensive, up-to-date review of POI recommendation systems, covering advancements in models, architectures, and security aspects. We systematically examine the transition from traditional models to advanced techniques such as large language models. Additionally, we explore the architectural evolution from centralized to decentralized and federated learning systems, highlighting the improvements in scalability and privacy. Furthermore, we address the increasing importance of security, examining potential vulnerabilities and privacy-preserving approaches. Our taxonomy provides a structured overview of the current state of POI recommendation, while we also identify promising directions for future research in this rapidly advancing field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Lin, Zhining Liu, Dongqi Fu, Ruizhong Qiu, Hanghang Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting is a fundamental task with numerous real-world applications, such as transportation, climate, and epidemiology. While a myriad of powerful deep learning models have been developed for this task, few works have explored the robustness of MTS forecasting models to malicious attacks, which is crucial for their trustworthy employment in high-stake scenarios. To address this gap, we dive deep into the backdoor attacks on MTS forecasting models and propose an effective attack method named BackTime.By subtly injecting a few stealthy triggers into the MTS data, BackTime can alter the predictions of the forecasting model according to the attacker's intent. Specifically, BackTime first identifies vulnerable timestamps in the data for poisoning, and then adaptively synthesizes stealthy and effective triggers by solving a bi-level optimization problem with a GNN-based trigger generator. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art MTS forecasting models demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, and stealthiness of \method{} attacks.

<p>Abstract: We introduce G2T-LLM, a novel approach for molecule generation that uses graph-to-tree text encoding to transform graph-based molecular structures into a hierarchical text format optimized for large language models (LLMs). This encoding converts complex molecular graphs into tree-structured formats, such as JSON and XML, which LLMs are particularly adept at processing due to their extensive pre-training on these types of data. By leveraging the flexibility of LLMs, our approach allows for intuitive interaction using natural language prompts, providing a more accessible interface for molecular design. Through supervised fine-tuning, G2T-LLM generates valid and coherent chemical structures, addressing common challenges like invalid outputs seen in traditional graph-based methods. While LLMs are computationally intensive, they offer superior generalization and adaptability, enabling the generation of diverse molecular structures with minimal task-specific customization. The proposed approach achieved comparable performances with state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark molecular generation datasets, demonstrating its potential as a flexible and innovative tool for AI-driven molecular design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Colon-Hernandez, Nanxi Liu, Chelsea Joe, Peter Chin, Claire Yin, Henry Lieberman, Yida Xin, Cynthia Breazeal</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating commonsense assertions within a given story context remains a difficult task for modern language models. Previous research has addressed this problem by aligning commonsense inferences with stories and training language generation models accordingly. One of the challenges is determining which topic or entity in the story should be the focus of an inferred assertion. Prior approaches lack the ability to control specific aspects of the generated assertions. In this work, we introduce "hinting," a data augmentation technique that enhances contextualized commonsense inference. "Hinting" employs a prefix prompting strategy using both hard and soft prompts to guide the inference process. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply "hinting" to two contextual commonsense inference datasets: ParaCOMET and GLUCOSE, evaluating its impact on both general and context-specific inference. Furthermore, we evaluate "hinting" by incorporating synonyms and antonyms into the hints. Our results show that "hinting" does not compromise the performance of contextual commonsense inference while offering improved controllability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinhong Liu, Zhijiang Guo, Tianya Liang, Ehsan Shareghi, Ivan Vuli\'c, Nigel Collier</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown promising progress related to LLM alignment with human preferences. LLM-empowered decision-making systems are expected to be predictable, reliable and trustworthy, which implies being free from paradoxes or contradictions that could undermine their credibility and validity. However, LLMs still exhibit inconsistent and biased behaviour when making decisions or judgements. In this work, we focus on studying logical consistency of LLMs as a prerequisite for more reliable and trustworthy systems. Logical consistency ensures that decisions are based on a stable and coherent understanding of the problem, reducing the risk of erratic or contradictory outputs. We first propose a universal framework to quantify the logical consistency via three fundamental proxies: transitivity, commutativity and negation invariance. We then evaluate logical consistency, using the defined measures, of a wide range of LLMs, demonstrating that it can serve as a strong proxy for overall robustness. Additionally, we introduce a data refinement and augmentation technique that enhances the logical consistency of LLMs without sacrificing alignment to human preferences. It augments noisy and sparse pairwise-comparison annotations by estimating a partially or totally ordered preference rankings using rank aggregation methods. Finally, we show that logical consistency impacts the performance of LLM-based logic-dependent algorithms, where LLMs serve as logical operators.</p>

<p>Abstract: Melanoma segmentation in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is useful for prognosis and the measurement of crucial prognostic factors such as Breslow depth and primary invasive tumor size. In this paper, we present a novel approach that uses the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for automatic melanoma segmentation in microscopy slide images. Our method employs an initial semantic segmentation model to generate preliminary segmentation masks that are then used to prompt SAM. We design a dynamic prompting strategy that uses a combination of centroid and grid prompts to achieve optimal coverage of the super high-resolution slide images while maintaining the quality of generated prompts. To optimize for invasive melanoma segmentation, we further refine the prompt generation process by implementing in-situ melanoma detection and low-confidence region filtering. We select Segformer as the initial segmentation model and EfficientSAM as the segment anything model for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only surpasses other state-of-the-art melanoma segmentation methods but also significantly outperforms the baseline Segformer by 9.1% in terms of IoU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqun Liu, Jiacheng Liang, Luoxi Tang, Chenyu You, Muchao Ye, Zhaohan Xi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are extensively adapted for downstream applications through a process known as "customization," with fine-tuning being a common method for integrating domain-specific expertise. However, recent studies have revealed a vulnerability that tuning LLMs with malicious samples can compromise their robustness and amplify harmful content, an attack known as "jailbreaking." To mitigate such attack, we propose an effective defensive framework utilizing data curation to revise commonsense texts and enhance their safety implication from the perspective of LLMs. The curated texts can mitigate jailbreaking attacks at every stage of the customization process: before customization to immunize LLMs against future jailbreak attempts, during customization to neutralize jailbreaking risks, or after customization to restore the compromised models. Since the curated data strengthens LLMs through the standard fine-tuning workflow, we do not introduce additional modules during LLM inference, thereby preserving the original customization process. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial reduction in jailbreaking effects, with up to a 100% success in generating responsible responses. Notably, our method is effective even with commonsense texts, which are often more readily available than safety-relevant data. With the every-stage defensive framework and supporting experimental performance, this work represents a significant advancement in mitigating jailbreaking risks and ensuring the secure customization of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: With hundreds of thousands of language models available on Huggingface today, efficiently evaluating and utilizing these models across various downstream, tasks has become increasingly critical. Many existing methods repeatedly learn task-specific representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), which leads to inefficiencies in both time and computational resources. To address this, we propose EmbedLLM, a framework designed to learn compact vector representations, of LLMs that facilitate downstream applications involving many models, such as model routing. We introduce an encoder-decoder approach for learning such embeddings, along with a systematic framework to evaluate their effectiveness. Empirical results show that EmbedLLM outperforms prior methods in model routing both in accuracy and latency. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can forecast a model's performance on multiple benchmarks, without incurring additional inference cost. Extensive probing experiments validate that the learned embeddings capture key model characteristics, e.g. whether the model is specialized for coding tasks, even without being explicitly trained on them. We open source our dataset, code and embedder to facilitate further research and application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Pan, Weibin Wu, Yuhang Cao, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks typically manipulate the semantic content of an image (e.g., color or texture) to create adversarial examples that are both effective and photorealistic. Recent works have utilized the diffusion inversion process to map images into a latent space, where high-level semantics are manipulated by introducing perturbations. However, they often results in substantial semantic distortions in the denoised output and suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Semantic-Consistent Unrestricted Adversarial Attacks (SCA), which employs an inversion method to extract edit-friendly noise maps and utilizes Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to provide semantic guidance throughout the process. Under the condition of rich semantic information provided by MLLM, we perform the DDPM denoising process of each step using a series of edit-friendly noise maps, and leverage DPM Solver++ to accelerate this process, enabling efficient sampling with semantic consistency. Compared to existing methods, our framework enables the efficient generation of adversarial examples that exhibit minimal discernible semantic changes. Consequently, we for the first time introduce Semantic-Consistent Adversarial Examples (SCAE). Extensive experiments and visualizations have demonstrated the high efficiency of SCA, particularly in being on average 12 times faster than the state-of-the-art attacks.

<p>Abstract: As a neural network's depth increases, it can achieve strong generalization performance. Training, however, becomes challenging due to gradient issues. Theoretical research and various methods have been introduced to address this issues. However, research on weight initialization methods that can be effectively applied to tanh neural networks of varying sizes still needs to be completed. This paper presents a novel weight initialization method for Feedforward Neural Networks with tanh activation function. Based on an analysis of the fixed points of the function $\tanh(ax)$, our proposed method aims to determine values of $a$ that prevent the saturation of activations. A series of experiments on various classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust to network size variations than the existing method. Furthermore, when applied to Physics-Informed Neural Networks, the method exhibits faster convergence and robustness to variations of the network size compared to Xavier initialization in problems of Partial Differential Equations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models must ensure both privacy and fairness for Trustworthy AI. While these goals have been pursued separately, recent studies propose to combine existing privacy and fairness techniques to achieve both goals. However, naively combining these techniques can be insufficient due to privacy-fairness conflicts, where a sample in a minority group may be amplified for fairness, only to be suppressed for privacy. We demonstrate how these conflicts lead to adverse effects, such as privacy violations and unexpected fairness-utility tradeoffs. To mitigate these risks, we propose PFGuard, a generative framework with privacy and fairness safeguards, which simultaneously addresses privacy, fairness, and utility. By using an ensemble of multiple teacher models, PFGuard balances privacy-fairness conflicts between fair and private training stages and achieves high utility based on ensemble learning. Extensive experiments show that PFGuard successfully generates synthetic data on high-dimensional data while providing both fairness convergence and strict DP guarantees - the first of its kind to our knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianchi Xie, Jiangning Zhu, Guozu Ma, Minzhi Lin, Wei Chen, Weikai Yang, Shixia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sample selection improves the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning models by providing informative and representative samples. Typically, samples can be modeled as a sample graph, where nodes are samples and edges represent their similarities. Most existing methods are based on local information, such as the training difficulty of samples, thereby overlooking global information, such as connectivity patterns. This oversight can result in suboptimal selection because global information is crucial for ensuring that the selected samples well represent the structural properties of the graph. To address this issue, we employ structural entropy to quantify global information and losslessly decompose it from the whole graph to individual nodes using the Shapley value. Based on the decomposition, we present $\textbf{S}$tructural-$\textbf{E}$ntropy-based sample $\textbf{S}$election ($\textbf{SES}$), a method that integrates both global and local information to select informative and representative samples. SES begins by constructing a $k$NN-graph among samples based on their similarities. It then measures sample importance by combining structural entropy (global metric) with training difficulty (local metric). Finally, SES applies importance-biased blue noise sampling to select a set of diverse and representative samples. Comprehensive experiments on three learning scenarios -- supervised learning, active learning, and continual learning -- clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modeling temporal characteristics plays a significant role in the representation learning of audio waveform. We propose Contrastive Long-form Language-Audio Pretraining (\textbf{CoLLAP}) to significantly extend the perception window for both the input audio (up to 5 minutes) and the language descriptions (exceeding 250 words), while enabling contrastive learning across modalities and temporal dynamics. Leveraging recent Music-LLMs to generate long-form music captions for full-length songs, augmented with musical temporal structures, we collect 51.3K audio-text pairs derived from the large-scale AudioSet training dataset, where the average audio length reaches 288 seconds. We propose a novel contrastive learning architecture that fuses language representations with structured audio representations by segmenting each song into clips and extracting their embeddings. With an attention mechanism, we capture multimodal temporal correlations, allowing the model to automatically weigh and enhance the final fusion score for improved contrastive alignment. Finally, we develop two variants of the CoLLAP model with different types of backbone language models. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple long-form music-text retrieval datasets, we demonstrate consistent performance improvement in retrieval accuracy compared with baselines. We also show the pretrained CoLLAP models can be transferred to various music information retrieval tasks, with heterogeneous long-form multimodal contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \'Oscar Garc\'ia-Sierra, Ana Fern\'andez-Pampill\'on Cesteros, Miguel Ortega-Mart\'in</p>
<p>Abstract: Subword tokenization algorithms used by Large Language Models are significantly more efficient and can independently build the necessary vocabulary of words and subwords without human intervention. However, those subwords do not always align with real morphemes, potentially impacting the models' performance, though it remains uncertain when this might occur. In previous research, we proposed a method to assess the morphological quality of vocabularies, focusing on the overlap between these vocabularies and the morphemes of a given language. Our evaluation method was built on three quality measures, relevance, cohesion, and morphological accuracy, and a procedure for their assessment. By applying this method to vocabularies created by three subword tokenization algorithms, BPE, Wordpiece, and Unigram, we concluded that these vocabularies generally exhibit very low morphological quality. In this article, we apply this evaluation to the tokenizer of BETO, a BERT language model trained on large Spanish corpora. This evaluation, along with our previous results, helped us conclude that its vocabulary has a low morphological quality, and we also found that training the tokenizer in a larger corpus does not improve the morphological quality of the generated vocabulary. Additionally, this evaluation helps clarify the algorithm used by the tokenizer, that is, Wordpiece, given the inconsistencies between the authors' claims and the model's configuration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Buddenkotte, Roland Opfer, Julia Kr\"uger, Alessa Hering, Mireia Crispin-Ortuzar</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image analysis tasks often focus on regions or structures located in a particular location within the patient's body. Often large parts of the image may not be of interest for the image analysis task. When using deep-learning based approaches, this causes an unnecessary increases the computational burden during inference and raises the chance of errors. In this paper, we introduce CTARR, a novel generic method for CT Anatomical Region Recognition. The method serves as a pre-processing step for any deep learning-based CT image analysis pipeline by automatically identifying the pre-defined anatomical region that is relevant for the follow-up task and removing the rest. It can be used in (i) image segmentation to prevent false positives in anatomically implausible regions and speeding up the inference, (ii) image classification to produce image crops that are consistent in their anatomical context, and (iii) image registration by serving as a fast pre-registration step. Our proposed method is based on atlas registration and provides a fast and robust way to crop any anatomical region encoded as one or multiple bounding box(es) from any unlabeled CT scan of the brain, chest, abdomen and/or pelvis. We demonstrate the utility and robustness of the proposed method in the context of medical image segmentation by evaluating it on six datasets of public segmentation challenges. The foreground voxels in the regions of interest are preserved in the vast majority of cases and tasks (97.45-100%) while taking only fractions of a seconds to compute (0.1-0.21s) on a deep learning workstation and greatly reducing the segmentation runtime (2.0-12.7x).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Berger, Stefan Riezler, Miriam Exel, Matthias Huck</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference Optimization (PO) techniques are currently one of the state of the art techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on pairwise preference feedback from human annotators. However, in machine translation, this sort of feedback can be difficult to solicit. Additionally, Kreutzer et al. (2018) have shown that, for machine translation, pairwise preferences are less reliable than other forms of human feedback, such as 5-point ratings.
  We examine post-edits to see if they can be a source of reliable human preferences by construction. In PO, a human annotator is shown sequences $s_1$ and $s_2$ and asked for a preference judgment, %$s_1 > s_2$; while for post-editing, editors \emph{create} $s_1$ and know that it should be better than $s_2$. We attempt to use these implicit preferences for PO and show that it helps the model move towards post-edit-like hypotheses and away from machine translation-like hypotheses. Furthermore, we show that best results are obtained by pre-training the model with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on post-edits in order to promote post-edit-like hypotheses to the top output ranks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abidemi Orimogunje, Vukan Ninkovic, Evariste Twahirwa, Gaspard Gashema, Dejan Vukobratovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Establishing and maintaining 5G mmWave vehicular connectivity poses a significant challenge due to high user mobility that necessitates frequent triggering of beam switching procedures. Departing from reactive beam switching based on the user device channel state feedback, proactive beam switching prepares in advance for upcoming beam switching decisions by exploiting accurate channel state information (CSI) prediction. In this paper, we develop a framework for autonomous self-trained CSI prediction for mmWave vehicular users where a base station (gNB) collects and labels a dataset that it uses for training recurrent neural network (RNN)-based CSI prediction model. The proposed framework exploits the CSI feedback from vehicular users combined with overhearing the C-V2X cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) they broadcast. We implement and evaluate the proposed framework using deepMIMO dataset generation environment and demonstrate its capability to provide accurate CSI prediction for 5G mmWave vehicular users. CSI prediction model is trained and its capability to provide accurate CSI predictions from various input features are investigated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Liu, Jiaen Lin, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained significant popularity in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its effectiveness in introducing new knowledge and reducing hallucinations. However, the deep understanding of RAG remains limited, how does RAG help the reasoning process and can RAG help improve the reasoning capability remains question. While external documents are typically considered as a method to incorporate domain-specific information, they also contain intermediate reasoning results related to the query, this suggests that documents could enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs, which has not been previously explored. In this paper, we investigate this issue in depth and find that while RAG can assist with reasoning, the help is limited. If we conceptualize the reasoning process as a tree with fixed depth, then RAG struggles to assist LLMs in performing deeper reasoning. Additionally, the information in the documents requires preprocessing to filter out noise. We demonstrate that this preprocessing is difficult to achieve simply fine-tuning of the LLM, it often necessitates numerous additional transformer layers to solve the problem. To simplify the problem, we propose DPrompt tuning, which effectively resolves the issue within just limited transformer layers, leading to improved performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junfeng Fang, Houcheng Jiang, Kun Wang, Yunshan Ma, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He, Tat-seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit hallucinations due to incorrect or outdated knowledge. Hence, model editing methods have emerged to enable targeted knowledge updates. To achieve this, a prevailing paradigm is the locating-then-editing approach, which first locates influential parameters and then edits them by introducing a perturbation. While effective, current studies have demonstrated that this perturbation inevitably disrupt the originally preserved knowledge within LLMs, especially in sequential editing scenarios. To address this, we introduce AlphaEdit, a novel solution that projects perturbation onto the null space of the preserved knowledge before applying it to the parameters. We theoretically prove that this projection ensures the output of post-edited LLMs remains unchanged when queried about the preserved knowledge, thereby mitigating the issue of disruption. Extensive experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA3, GPT2-XL, and GPT-J, show that AlphaEdit boosts the performance of most locating-then-editing methods by an average of 36.4% with a single line of additional code for projection solely.

<p>Abstract: Mamba, a special case of the State Space Model, is gaining popularity as an alternative to template-based deep learning approaches in medical image analysis. While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks, including quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address long-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of large and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and temporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it well-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is a significant improvement over transformers. Mamba processes longer sequences without attention mechanisms, enabling faster inference and requiring less memory. Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data, improving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this paper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging step by step. We begin by defining core concepts of SSMs and models, including S4, S5, and S6, followed by an exploration of Mamba architectures such as pure Mamba, U-Net variants, and hybrid models with convolutional neural networks, transformers, and Graph Neural Networks. We also cover Mamba optimizations, techniques and adaptations, scanning, datasets, applications, experimental results, and conclude with its challenges and future directions in medical imaging. This review aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of Mamba in overcoming existing barriers within medical imaging while paving the way for innovative advancements in the field. A comprehensive list of Mamba architectures applied in the medical field, reviewed in this work, is available at Github.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding and manipulating concrete and abstract concepts is fundamental to human intelligence. Yet, they remain challenging for artificial agents. This paper introduces a multimodal generative approach to high order abstract concept learning, which integrates visual and categorical linguistic information from concrete ones. Our model initially grounds subordinate level concrete concepts, combines them to form basic level concepts, and finally abstracts to superordinate level concepts via the grounding of basic-level concepts. We evaluate the model language learning ability through language-to-visual and visual-to-language tests with high order abstract concepts. Experimental results demonstrate the proficiency of the model in both language understanding and language naming tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper has been accepted in the NeurIPS 2024 D & B Track. Harmful memes have proliferated on the Chinese Internet, while research on detecting Chinese harmful memes significantly lags behind due to the absence of reliable datasets and effective detectors. To this end, we focus on the comprehensive detection of Chinese harmful memes. We construct ToxiCN MM, the first Chinese harmful meme dataset, which consists of 12,000 samples with fine-grained annotations for various meme types. Additionally, we propose a baseline detector, Multimodal Knowledge Enhancement (MKE), incorporating contextual information of meme content generated by the LLM to enhance the understanding of Chinese memes. During the evaluation phase, we conduct extensive quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses on multiple baselines, including LLMs and our MKE. The experimental results indicate that detecting Chinese harmful memes is challenging for existing models while demonstrating the effectiveness of MKE.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Genta Indra Winata, David Anugraha, Lucky Susanto, Garry Kuwanto, Derry Tanti Wijaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the quality of a performance evaluation metric is crucial for ensuring that model outputs align with human preferences. However, it remains unclear how well each metric captures the diverse aspects of these preferences, as metrics often excel in one particular area but not across all dimensions. To address this, it is essential to systematically calibrate metrics to specific aspects of human preference, catering to the unique characteristics of each aspect. We introduce MetaMetrics, a calibrated meta-metric designed to evaluate generation tasks across different modalities in a supervised manner. MetaMetrics optimizes the combination of existing metrics to enhance their alignment with human preferences. Our metric demonstrates flexibility and effectiveness in both language and vision downstream tasks, showing significant benefits across various multilingual and multi-domain scenarios. MetaMetrics aligns closely with human preferences and is highly extendable and easily integrable into any application. This makes MetaMetrics a powerful tool for improving the evaluation of generation tasks, ensuring that metrics are more representative of human judgment across diverse contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gustav Wagner Zakarias, Lars Kai Hansen, Zheng-Hua Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present BiSSL, a first-of-its-kind training framework that introduces bilevel optimization to enhance the alignment between the pretext pre-training and downstream fine-tuning stages in self-supervised learning. BiSSL formulates the pretext and downstream task objectives as the lower- and upper-level objectives in a bilevel optimization problem and serves as an intermediate training stage within the self-supervised learning pipeline. By more explicitly modeling the interdependence of these training stages, BiSSL facilitates enhanced information sharing between them, ultimately leading to a backbone parameter initialization that is better suited for the downstream task. We propose a training algorithm that alternates between optimizing the two objectives defined in BiSSL. Using a ResNet-18 backbone pre-trained with SimCLR on the STL10 dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently achieves improved or competitive classification accuracies across various downstream image classification datasets compared to the conventional self-supervised learning pipeline. Qualitative analyses of the backbone features further suggest that BiSSL enhances the alignment of downstream features in the backbone prior to fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Safe and successful deployment of robots requires not only the ability to generate complex plans but also the capacity to frequently replan and correct execution errors. This paper addresses the challenge of long-horizon trajectory planning under temporally extended objectives in a receding horizon manner. To this end, we propose DOPPLER, a data-driven hierarchical framework that generates and updates plans based on instruction specified by linear temporal logic (LTL). Our method decomposes temporal tasks into chain of options with hierarchical reinforcement learning from offline non-expert datasets. It leverages diffusion models to generate options with low-level actions. We devise a determinantal-guided posterior sampling technique during batch generation, which improves the speed and diversity of diffusion generated options, leading to more efficient querying. Experiments on robot navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate that DOPPLER can generate sequences of trajectories that progressively satisfy the specified formulae for obstacle avoidance and sequential visitation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhang Zou, Xuegang Hu, Peipei Li, Jun Hu, You Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-label data stream usually contains noisy labels in the real-world applications, namely occuring in both relevant and irrelevant labels. However, existing online multi-label classification methods are mostly limited in terms of label quality and fail to deal with the case of noisy labels. On the other hand, the ground-truth label distribution may vary with the time changing, which is hidden in the observed noisy label distribution and difficult to track, posing a major challenge for concept drift adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose an online multi-label classification algorithm under Noisy and Changing Label Distribution (NCLD). The convex objective is designed to simultaneously model the label scoring and the label ranking for high accuracy, whose robustness to NCLD benefits from three novel works: 1) The local feature graph is used to reconstruct the label scores jointly with the observed labels, and an unbiased ranking loss is derived and applied to learn reliable ranking information. 2) By detecting the difference between two adjacent chunks with the unbiased label cardinality, we identify the change in the ground-truth label distribution and reset the ranking or all information learned from the past to match the new distribution. 3) Efficient and accurate updating is achieved based on the updating rule derived from the closed-form optimal model solution. Finally, empirical experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method in classifying instances under NCLD.</p>

<p>Abstract: While fine-tuning pretrained models has become common practice, these models often underperform outside their specific domains. Recently developed model merging techniques enable the direct integration of multiple models, each fine-tuned for distinct tasks, into a single model. This strategy promotes multitasking capabilities without requiring retraining on the original datasets. However, existing methods fall short in addressing potential conflicts and complex correlations between tasks, especially in parameter-level adjustments, posing a challenge in effectively balancing parameter competition across various tasks. This paper introduces an innovative technique named PCB-Merging (Parameter Competition Balancing), a lightweight and training-free technique that adjusts the coefficients of each parameter for effective model merging. PCB-Merging employs intra-balancing to gauge parameter significance within individual tasks and inter-balancing to assess parameter similarities across different tasks. Parameters with low importance scores are dropped, and the remaining ones are rescaled to form the final merged model. We assessed our approach in diverse merging scenarios, including cross-task, cross-domain, and cross-training configurations, as well as out-of-domain generalization. The experimental results reveal that our approach achieves substantial performance enhancements across multiple modalities, domains, model sizes, number of tasks, fine-tuning forms, and large language models, outperforming existing model merging methods.

<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has become a dominant approach in self-supervised visual representation learning, with hard negatives-samples that closely resemble the anchor-being key to enhancing the discriminative power of learned representations. However, efficiently leveraging hard negatives remains a challenge due to the difficulty in identifying and incorporating them without significantly increasing computational costs. To address this, we introduce SynCo (Synthetic Negatives in Contrastive learning), a novel contrastive learning approach that improves model performance by generating synthetic hard negatives. Built on the MoCo framework, SynCo introduces six novel strategies for creating diverse synthetic hard negatives that can be generated on-the-fly with minimal computational overhead. SynCo achieves faster training and better representation learning, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 68.1% in ImageNet linear evaluation after only 200 epochs on pretraining, surpassing MoCo's 67.5% with the same ResNet-50 encoder. Additionally, it transfers more effectively to detection tasks: on the PASCAL VOC, it outperforms both the supervised baseline and MoCo, achieving an AP of 82.5%; on the COCO dataset, it sets a new benchmark with 40.4% AP for bounding box detection and 35.4% AP for instance segmentation. Our synthetic hard negative generation procedure significantly enhances the quality of visual representations learned through self-supervised contrastive learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minwook Bae, Hyounghun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating a long story of several thousand words with narrative coherence using Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a challenging task. Previous research has addressed this challenge by proposing different frameworks that create a story plan and generate a long story based on that plan. However, these frameworks have been mainly focusing on maintaining narrative coherence in stories, often overlooking creativity in story planning and the expressiveness of the stories generated from those plans, which are desirable properties to captivate readers' interest. In this paper, we propose Collective Critics for Creative Story Generation framework (CritiCS), which is composed of plan refining stage (CrPlan) and story generation stage (CrText), to integrate a collective revision mechanism that promotes those properties into long-form story generation process. Specifically, in each stage, a group of LLM critics and one leader collaborate to incrementally refine drafts of plan and story throughout multiple rounds. Extensive human evaluation shows that the CritiCS can significantly enhance story creativity and reader engagement, while also maintaining narrative coherence. Furthermore, the design of the framework allows active participation from human writers in any role within the critique process, enabling interactive human-machine collaboration in story writing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulrahman Diaa, Toluwani Aremu, Nils Lukas</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be \emph{misused} to spread online spam and misinformation. Content watermarking deters misuse by hiding a message in model-generated outputs, enabling their detection using a secret watermarking key. Robustness is a core security property, stating that evading detection requires (significant) degradation of the content's quality. Many LLM watermarking methods have been proposed, but robustness is tested only against \emph{non-adaptive} attackers who lack knowledge of the watermarking method and can find only suboptimal attacks. We formulate the robustness of LLM watermarking as an objective function and propose preference-based optimization to tune \emph{adaptive} attacks against the specific watermarking method. Our evaluation shows that (i) adaptive attacks substantially outperform non-adaptive baselines. (ii) Even in a non-adaptive setting, adaptive attacks optimized against a few known watermarks remain highly effective when tested against other unseen watermarks, and (iii) optimization-based attacks are practical and require less than seven GPU hours. Our findings underscore the need to test robustness against adaptive attackers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Alekseenko, Bram Stieltjes, Michael Bach, Melanie Boerries, Oliver Opitz, Alexandros Karargyris, Nicolas Padoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinnova, a collaborative initiative involving France, Germany, Switzerland, and Luxembourg, is dedicated to unlocking the power of precision medicine through data federation, standardization, and interoperability. This European Greater Region initiative seeks to create an interoperable European standard using artificial intelligence (AI) and data science to enhance healthcare outcomes and efficiency. Key components include multidisciplinary research centers, a federated biobanking strategy, a digital health innovation platform, and a federated AI strategy. It targets inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid diseases, and multiple sclerosis (MS), emphasizing data quality to develop AI algorithms for personalized treatment and translational research.
  The IHU Strasbourg (Institute of Minimal-invasive Surgery) has the lead in this initiative to develop the federated learning (FL) proof of concept (POC) that will serve as a foundation for advancing AI in healthcare. At its core, Clinnova-MS aims to enhance MS patient care by using FL to develop more accurate models that detect disease progression, guide interventions, and validate digital biomarkers across multiple sites. This technical report presents insights and key takeaways from the first cross-border federated POC on MS segmentation of MRI images within the Clinnova framework. While our work marks a significant milestone in advancing MS segmentation through cross-border collaboration, it also underscores the importance of addressing technical, logistical, and ethical considerations to realize the full potential of FL in healthcare settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Talarmain, Carlos Boned, Sanket Biswas, Oriol Ramos</p>
<p>Abstract: General-purpose ID, or travel, document image- and video-based verification systems have yet to achieve good enough performance to be considered a solved problem. There are several factors that negatively impact their performance, including low-resolution images and videos and a lack of sufficient data to train the models. This task is particularly challenging when dealing with unseen class of ID, or travel, documents. In this paper we address this task by proposing a recurrent-based model able to detect forged documents in a few-shot scenario. The recurrent architecture makes the model robust to document resolution variability. Moreover, the few-shot approach allow the model to perform well even for unseen class of documents. Preliminary results on the SIDTD and Findit datasets show good performance of this model for this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokhyun An, Hyounghun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning-supervised fine-tuning using instruction-response pairs-is a foundational step in transitioning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) into helpful and safe chat assistants. Our hypothesis is that establishing an adequate output space can enable such a transition given the capabilities inherent in pre-trained LLMs. To verify this, we propose Response Tuning (RT), which eliminates the instruction-conditioning step in instruction tuning and solely focuses on response space supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that RT models, trained only using responses, can effectively respond to a wide range of instructions and exhibit helpfulness comparable to that of their instruction-tuned counterparts. Furthermore, we observe that controlling the training response distribution can significantly improve their user preference or elicit target behaviors such as refusing assistance for unsafe queries. Our findings illuminate the role of establishing an adequate output space in alignment, highlighting the potential of the extensive inherent capabilities of pre-trained LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Costarelli, Mat Allen, Severin Field, Joshua Clymer</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, the potential harms from deceptive behavior underlie the need for faithfully interpreting their decision-making. While traditional probing methods have shown some effectiveness, they remain best for narrowly scoped tasks while more comprehensive explanations are still necessary. To this end, we investigate meta-models-an architecture using a "meta-model" that takes activations from an "input-model" and answers natural language questions about the input-model's behaviors. We evaluate the meta-model's ability to generalize by training them on selected task types and assessing their out-of-distribution performance in deceptive scenarios. Our findings show that meta-models generalize well to out-of-distribution tasks and point towards opportunities for future research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihyoung Jang, Taeyoung Kim, Hyounghun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently introduced dialogue systems have demonstrated high usability. However, they still fall short of reflecting real-world conversation scenarios. Current dialogue systems exhibit an inability to replicate the dynamic, continuous, long-term interactions involving multiple partners. This shortfall arises because there have been limited efforts to account for both aspects of real-world dialogues: deeply layered interactions over the long-term dialogue and widely expanded conversation networks involving multiple participants. As the effort to incorporate these aspects combined, we introduce Mixed-Session Conversation, a dialogue system designed to construct conversations with various partners in a multi-session dialogue setup. We propose a new dataset called MiSC to implement this system. The dialogue episodes of MiSC consist of 6 consecutive sessions, with four speakers (one main speaker and three partners) appearing in each episode. Also, we propose a new dialogue model with a novel memory management mechanism, called Egocentric Memory Enhanced Mixed-Session Conversation Agent (EMMA). EMMA collects and retains memories from the main speaker's perspective during conversations with partners, enabling seamless continuity in subsequent interactions. Extensive human evaluations validate that the dialogues in MiSC demonstrate a seamless conversational flow, even when conversation partners change in each session. EMMA trained with MiSC is also evaluated to maintain high memorability without contradiction throughout the entire conversation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Liu, Ziqing Zhang, Wenbo Li, Renjing Pei, Fenglong Song, Xiaohong Liu, Linghe Kong, Yulun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) serves as the golden standard for all models' performance in nearly all computer vision fields. However, it still suffers from poor out-of-distribution generalization ability and expensive training costs. To address these problems, we propose Dog-IQA, a standard-guided zero-shot mix-grained IQA method, which is training-free and utilizes the exceptional prior knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To obtain accurate IQA scores, namely scores consistent with humans, we design an MLLM-based inference pipeline that imitates human experts. In detail, Dog-IQA applies two techniques. First, Dog-IQA objectively scores with specific standards that utilize MLLM's behavior pattern and minimize the influence of subjective factors. Second, Dog-IQA comprehensively takes local semantic objects and the whole image as input and aggregates their scores, leveraging local and global information. Our proposed Dog-IQA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared with training-free methods, and competitive performance compared with training-based methods in cross-dataset scenarios. Our code and models will be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/Dog-IQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mucong Ding, Bang An, Yuancheng Xu, Anirudh Satheesh, Furong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation, a cornerstone technique in deep learning, is crucial in enhancing model performance, especially with scarce labeled data. While traditional techniques are effective, their reliance on hand-crafted methods limits their applicability across diverse data types and tasks. Although modern learnable augmentation methods offer increased adaptability, they are computationally expensive and challenging to incorporate within prevalent augmentation workflows. In this work, we present a novel, efficient method for data augmentation, effectively bridging the gap between existing augmentation strategies and emerging datasets and learning tasks. We introduce SAFLEX (Self-Adaptive Augmentation via Feature Label EXtrapolation), which learns the sample weights and soft labels of augmented samples provided by any given upstream augmentation pipeline, using a specifically designed efficient bilevel optimization algorithm. Remarkably, SAFLEX effectively reduces the noise and label errors of the upstream augmentation pipeline with a marginal computational cost. As a versatile module, SAFLEX excels across diverse datasets, including natural and medical images and tabular data, showcasing its prowess in few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization. SAFLEX seamlessly integrates with common augmentation strategies like RandAug, CutMix, and those from large pre-trained generative models like stable diffusion and is also compatible with frameworks such as CLIP's fine-tuning. Our findings highlight the potential to adapt existing augmentation pipelines for new data types and tasks, signaling a move towards more adaptable and resilient training frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John X. Morris, Alexander M. Rush</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense document embeddings are central to neural retrieval. The dominant paradigm is to train and construct embeddings by running encoders directly on individual documents. In this work, we argue that these embeddings, while effective, are implicitly out-of-context for targeted use cases of retrieval, and that a contextualized document embedding should take into account both the document and neighboring documents in context - analogous to contextualized word embeddings. We propose two complementary methods for contextualized document embeddings: first, an alternative contrastive learning objective that explicitly incorporates the document neighbors into the intra-batch contextual loss; second, a new contextual architecture that explicitly encodes neighbor document information into the encoded representation. Results show that both methods achieve better performance than biencoders in several settings, with differences especially pronounced out-of-domain. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the MTEB benchmark with no hard negative mining, score distillation, dataset-specific instructions, intra-GPU example-sharing, or extremely large batch sizes. Our method can be applied to improve performance on any contrastive learning dataset and any biencoder.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum federated learning has brought about the improvement of privacy image classification, while the lack of personality of the client model may contribute to the suboptimal of quantum federated learning. A personalized quantum federated learning algorithm for privacy image classification is proposed to enhance the personality of the client model in the case of an imbalanced distribution of images. First, a personalized quantum federated learning model is constructed, in which a personalized layer is set for the client model to maintain the personalized parameters. Second, a personalized quantum federated learning algorithm is introduced to secure the information exchanged between the client and server.Third, the personalized federated learning is applied to image classification on the FashionMNIST dataset, and the experimental results indicate that the personalized quantum federated learning algorithm can obtain global and local models with excellent performance, even in situations where local training samples are imbalanced. The server's accuracy is 100% with 8 clients and a distribution parameter of 100, outperforming the non-personalized model by 7%. The average client accuracy is 2.9% higher than that of the non-personalized model with 2 clients and a distribution parameter of 1. Compared to previous quantum federated learning algorithms, the proposed personalized quantum federated learning algorithm eliminates the need for additional local training while safeguarding both model and data privacy.It may facilitate broader adoption and application of quantum technologies, and pave the way for more secure, scalable, and efficient quantum distribute machine learning solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce ColaCare, a framework that enhances Electronic Health Record (EHR) modeling through multi-agent collaboration driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach seamlessly integrates domain-specific expert models with LLMs to bridge the gap between structured EHR data and text-based reasoning. Inspired by clinical consultations, ColaCare employs two types of agents: DoctorAgent and MetaAgent, which collaboratively analyze patient data. Expert models process and generate predictions from numerical EHR data, while LLM agents produce reasoning references and decision-making reports within the collaborative consultation framework. We additionally incorporate the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (MSD) medical guideline within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for authoritative evidence support. Extensive experiments conducted on four distinct EHR datasets demonstrate ColaCare's superior performance in mortality prediction tasks, underscoring its potential to revolutionize clinical decision support systems and advance personalized precision medicine.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuwei Xing, Derek W. Cool, David Tessier, Elvis C. S. Chen, Terry M. Peters, Aaron Fenster</p>
<p>Abstract: Liver tumor ablation procedures require accurate placement of the needle applicator at the tumor centroid. The lower-cost and real-time nature of ultrasound (US) has advantages over computed tomography (CT) for applicator guidance, however, in some patients, liver tumors may be occult on US and tumor mimics can make lesion identification challenging. Image registration techniques can aid in interpreting anatomical details and identifying tumors, but their clinical application has been hindered by the tradeoff between alignment accuracy and runtime performance, particularly when compensating for liver motion due to patient breathing or movement. Therefore, we propose a 2D-3D US registration approach to enable intra-procedural alignment that mitigates errors caused by liver motion. Specifically, our approach can correlate imbalanced 2D and 3D US image features and use continuous 6D rotation representations to enhance the model's training stability. The dataset was divided into 2388, 196 and 193 image pairs for training, validation and testing, respectively. Our approach achieved a mean Euclidean distance error of 2.28 mm $\pm$ 1.81 mm and a mean geodesic angular error of 2.99$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 1.95$^{\circ}$, with a runtime of 0.22 seconds per 2D-3D US image pair. These results demonstrate that our approach can achieve accurate alignment and clinically acceptable runtime, indicating potential for clinical translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua McClellan, Naveed Haghani, John Winder, Furong Huang, Pratap Tokekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) struggles with sample inefficiency and poor generalization [1]. These challenges are partially due to a lack of structure or inductive bias in the neural networks typically used in learning the policy. One such form of structure that is commonly observed in multi-agent scenarios is symmetry. The field of Geometric Deep Learning has developed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) that are equivariant (or symmetric) to rotations, translations, and reflections of nodes. Incorporating equivariance has been shown to improve learning efficiency and decrease error [ 2 ]. In this paper, we demonstrate that EGNNs improve the sample efficiency and generalization in MARL. However, we also show that a naive application of EGNNs to MARL results in poor early exploration due to a bias in the EGNN structure. To mitigate this bias, we present Exploration-enhanced Equivariant Graph Neural Networks or E2GN2. We compare E2GN2 to other common function approximators using common MARL benchmarks MPE and SMACv2. E2GN2 demonstrates a significant improvement in sample efficiency, greater final reward convergence, and a 2x-5x gain in over standard GNNs in our generalization tests. These results pave the way for more reliable and effective solutions in complex multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Fang, Zheng Lin, Senkang Hu, Hangcheng Cao, Yiqin Deng, Xianhao Chen, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Hu, Yifan Zhang, Zhuoran Li, Longbo Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a novel class of generative models designed to sample from unnormalized distributions and have found applications in various important tasks, attracting great research interest in their training algorithms. In general, GFlowNets are trained by fitting the forward flow to the backward flow on sampled training objects. Prior work focused on the choice of training objects, parameterizations, sampling and resampling strategies, and backward policies, aiming to enhance credit assignment, exploration, or exploitation of the training process. However, the choice of regression loss, which can highly influence the exploration and exploitation behavior of the under-training policy, has been overlooked. Due to the lack of theoretical understanding for choosing an appropriate regression loss, most existing algorithms train the flow network by minimizing the squared error of the forward and backward flows in log-space, i.e., using the quadratic regression loss. In this work, we rigorously prove that distinct regression losses correspond to specific divergence measures, enabling us to design and analyze regression losses according to the desired properties of the corresponding divergence measures. Specifically, we examine two key properties: zero-forcing and zero-avoiding, where the former promotes exploitation and higher rewards, and the latter encourages exploration and enhances diversity. Based on our theoretical framework, we propose three novel regression losses, namely, Shifted-Cosh, Linex(1/2), and Linex(1). We evaluate them across three benchmarks: hyper-grid, bit-sequence generation, and molecule generation. Our proposed losses are compatible with most existing training algorithms, and significantly improve the performances of the algorithms concerning convergence speed, sample diversity, and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivier Lepel, Anas Barakat</p>
<p>Abstract: The widely used expected utility theory has been shown to be empirically inconsistent with human preferences in the psychology and behavioral economy literatures. Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) has been developed to fill in this gap and provide a better model for human-based decision-making supported by empirical evidence. It allows to express a wide range of attitudes and perceptions towards risk, gains and losses. A few years ago, CPT has been combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to formulate a CPT policy optimization problem where the goal of the agent is to search for a policy generating long-term returns which are aligned with their preferences. In this work, we revisit this policy optimization problem and provide new insights on optimal policies and their nature depending on the utility function under consideration. We further derive a novel policy gradient theorem for the CPT policy optimization objective generalizing the seminal corresponding result in standard RL. This result enables us to design a model-free policy gradient algorithm to solve the CPT-RL problem. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm in simple examples motivated by traffic control and electricity management applications. We also demonstrate that our policy gradient algorithm scales better to larger state spaces compared to the existing zeroth order algorithm for solving the same problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akhilesh Aravapalli, Mounika Marreddy, Subba Reddy Oota, Radhika Mamidi, Manish Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing. To understand why they perform so well and to assess their reliability, several studies have focused on questions such as: Which linguistic properties are encoded by these models, and to what extent? How robust are these models in encoding linguistic properties when faced with perturbations in the input text? However, these studies have mainly focused on BERT and the English language. In this paper, we investigate similar questions regarding encoding capability and robustness for 8 linguistic properties across 13 different perturbations in 6 Indic languages, using 9 multilingual Transformer models (7 universal and 2 Indic-specific). To conduct this study, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark dataset, IndicSentEval, containing approximately $\sim$47K sentences. Surprisingly, our probing analysis of surface, syntactic, and semantic properties reveals that while almost all multilingual models demonstrate consistent encoding performance for English, they show mixed results for Indic languages. As expected, Indic-specific multilingual models capture linguistic properties in Indic languages better than universal models. Intriguingly, universal models broadly exhibit better robustness compared to Indic-specific models, particularly under perturbations such as dropping both nouns and verbs, dropping only verbs, or keeping only nouns. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into probing and perturbation-specific strengths and weaknesses of popular multilingual Transformer-based models for different Indic languages. We make our code and dataset publicly available [https://tinyurl.com/IndicSentEval}].</p>

<p>Abstract: Will a Visual Language Model (VLM)-based bot warn us about slipping if it detects a wet floor? Recent VLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet their ability to infer outcomes and causes remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce NL-Eye, a benchmark designed to assess VLMs' visual abductive reasoning skills. NL-Eye adapts the abductive Natural Language Inference (NLI) task to the visual domain, requiring models to evaluate the plausibility of hypothesis images based on a premise image and explain their decisions. NL-Eye consists of 350 carefully curated triplet examples (1,050 images) spanning diverse reasoning categories: physical, functional, logical, emotional, cultural, and social. The data curation process involved two steps - writing textual descriptions and generating images using text-to-image models, both requiring substantial human involvement to ensure high-quality and challenging scenes. Our experiments show that VLMs struggle significantly on NL-Eye, often performing at random baseline levels, while humans excel in both plausibility prediction and explanation quality. This demonstrates a deficiency in the abductive reasoning capabilities of modern VLMs. NL-Eye represents a crucial step toward developing VLMs capable of robust multimodal reasoning for real-world applications, including accident-prevention bots and generated video verification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning conditional distributions $\pi^*(\cdot|x)$ is a central problem in machine learning, which is typically approached via supervised methods with paired data $(x,y) \sim \pi^*$. However, acquiring paired data samples is often challenging, especially in problems such as domain translation. This necessitates the development of $\textit{semi-supervised}$ models that utilize both limited paired data and additional unpaired i.i.d. samples $x \sim \pi^*_x$ and $y \sim \pi^*_y$ from the marginal distributions. The usage of such combined data is complex and often relies on heuristic approaches. To tackle this issue, we propose a new learning paradigm that integrates both paired and unpaired data $\textbf{seamlessly}$ through the data likelihood maximization techniques. We demonstrate that our approach also connects intriguingly with inverse entropic optimal transport (OT). This finding allows us to apply recent advances in computational OT to establish a $\textbf{light}$ learning algorithm to get $\pi^*(\cdot|x)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate through empirical tests that our method effectively learns conditional distributions using paired and unpaired data simultaneously.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although LLM-based agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), can use external tools and memory mechanisms to solve complex real-world tasks, they may also introduce critical security vulnerabilities. However, the existing literature does not comprehensively evaluate attacks and defenses against LLM-based agents. To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a comprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the attacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios, over 400 tools, 23 different types of attack/defense methods, and 8 evaluation metrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, a mixed attack, and 10 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones with nearly 90,000 testing cases in total. Our benchmark results reveal critical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including system prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the highest average attack success rate of 84.30\%, but limited effectiveness shown in current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent security for the community.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Satvaty, Suzan Verberne, Fatih Turkmen</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent research increasingly showcases the remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), it's vital to confront their hidden pitfalls. Among these challenges, the issue of memorization stands out, posing significant ethical and legal risks. In this paper, we presents a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) on the topic of memorization in LLMs. Memorization is the effect that a model tends to store and reproduce phrases or passages from the training data and has been shown to be the fundamental issue to various privacy and security attacks against LLMs.
  We begin by providing an overview of the literature on the memorization, exploring it across five key dimensions: intentionality, degree, retrievability, abstraction, and transparency. Next, we discuss the metrics and methods used to measure memorization, followed by an analysis of the factors that contribute to memorization phenomenon. We then examine how memorization manifests itself in specific model architectures and explore strategies for mitigating these effects. We conclude our overview by identifying potential research topics for the near future: to develop methods for balancing performance and privacy in LLMs, and the analysis of memorization in specific contexts, including conversational agents, retrieval-augmented generation, multilingual language models, and diffusion language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxence Faldor, Antoine Cully</p>
<p>Abstract: Cellular automata have become a cornerstone for investigating emergence and self-organization across diverse scientific disciplines, spanning neuroscience, artificial life, and theoretical physics. However, the absence of a hardware-accelerated cellular automata library limits the exploration of new research directions, hinders collaboration, and impedes reproducibility. In this work, we introduce CAX (Cellular Automata Accelerated in JAX), a high-performance and flexible open-source library designed to accelerate cellular automata research. CAX offers cutting-edge performance and a modular design through a user-friendly interface, and can support both discrete and continuous cellular automata with any number of dimensions. We demonstrate CAX's performance and flexibility through a wide range of benchmarks and applications. From classic models like elementary cellular automata and Conway's Game of Life to advanced applications such as growing neural cellular automata and self-classifying MNIST digits, CAX speeds up simulations up to 2,000 times faster. Furthermore, we demonstrate CAX's potential to accelerate research by presenting a collection of three novel cellular automata experiments, each implemented in just a few lines of code thanks to the library's modular architecture. Notably, we show that a simple one-dimensional cellular automaton can outperform GPT-4 on the 1D-ARC challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaemoo Choi, Jaewoong Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The Optimal Transport (OT) problem investigates a transport map that connects two distributions while minimizing a given cost function. Finding such a transport map has diverse applications in machine learning, such as generative modeling and image-to-image translation. In this paper, we introduce a scalable and simulation-free approach for solving the Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport (EUOT) problem. We derive the dynamical form of this EUOT problem, which is a generalization of the Schr\"odinger bridges (SB) problem. Based on this, we derive dual formulation and optimality conditions of the EUOT problem from the stochastic optimal control interpretation. By leveraging these properties, we propose a simulation-free algorithm to solve EUOT, called Simulation-free EUOT (SF-EUOT). While existing SB models require expensive simulation costs during training and evaluation, our model achieves simulation-free training and one-step generation by utilizing the reciprocal property. Our model demonstrates significantly improved scalability in generative modeling and image-to-image translation tasks compared to previous SB methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the first correct-by-construction learning-based system for step-by-step mathematical integration. The key idea is to learn a policy, represented by a GPT transformer model, which guides the search for the right mathematical integration rule, to be carried out by a symbolic solver. Concretely, we introduce a symbolic engine with axiomatically correct actions on mathematical expressions, as well as the first dataset for step-by-step integration. Our GPT-style transformer model, trained on this synthetic data, demonstrates strong generalization by surpassing its own data generator in accuracy and efficiency, using 50% fewer search steps. Our experimental results with SoTA LLMs also demonstrate that the standard approach of fine-tuning LLMs on a set of question-answer pairs is insufficient for solving this mathematical task. This motivates the importance of discovering creative methods for combining LLMs with symbolic reasoning engines, of which our work is an instance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taekyung Lee, Jaemoo Choi, Jaewoong Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Unpaired point cloud completion explores methods for learning a completion map from unpaired incomplete and complete point cloud data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for unpaired point cloud completion using the unbalanced optimal transport map, called Unbalanced Optimal Transport Map for Unpaired Point Cloud Completion (UOT-UPC). We demonstrate that the unpaired point cloud completion can be naturally interpreted as the Optimal Transport (OT) problem and introduce the Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) approach to address the class imbalance problem, which is prevalent in unpaired point cloud completion datasets. Moreover, we analyze the appropriate cost function for unpaired completion tasks. This analysis shows that the InfoCD cost function is particularly well-suited for this task. Our model is the first attempt to leverage UOT for unpaired point cloud completion, achieving competitive or superior results on both single-category and multi-category datasets. In particular, our model is especially effective in scenarios with class imbalance, where the proportions of categories are different between the incomplete and complete point cloud datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Dong, Ge Li, Yongding Tao, Xue Jiang, Kechi Zhang, Jia Li, Jing Su, Jun Zhang, Jingjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable success achieved by neural networks, particularly those represented by MLP and Transformer, we reveal that they exhibit potential flaws in the modeling and reasoning of periodicity, i.e., they tend to memorize the periodic data rather than genuinely understanding the underlying principles of periodicity. However, periodicity is a crucial trait in various forms of reasoning and generalization, underpinning predictability across natural and engineered systems through recurring patterns in observations. In this paper, we propose FAN, a novel network architecture based on Fourier Analysis, which empowers the ability to efficiently model and reason about periodic phenomena. By introducing Fourier Series, the periodicity is naturally integrated into the structure and computational processes of the neural network, thus achieving a more accurate expression and prediction of periodic patterns. As a promising substitute to multi-layer perceptron (MLP), FAN can seamlessly replace MLP in various models with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FAN in modeling and reasoning about periodic functions, and the superiority and generalizability of FAN across a range of real-world tasks, including symbolic formula representation, time series forecasting, and language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Ying Chiu, Liwei Jiang, Bill Yuchen Lin, Chan Young Park, Shuyue Stella Li, Sahithya Ravi, Mehar Bhatia, Maria Antoniak, Yulia Tsvetkov, Vered Shwartz, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: To make large language models (LLMs) more helpful across diverse cultures, it is essential to have effective cultural knowledge benchmarks to measure and track our progress. Effective benchmarks need to be robust, diverse, and challenging. We introduce CulturalBench: a set of 1,227 human-written and human-verified questions for effectively assessing LLMs' cultural knowledge, covering 45 global regions including the underrepresented ones like Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and Peru. Questions - each verified by five independent annotators - span 17 diverse topics ranging from food preferences to greeting etiquettes. We evaluate models on two setups: CulturalBench-Easy and CulturalBench-Hard which share the same questions but asked differently. We find that LLMs are sensitive to such difference in setups (e.g., GPT-4o with 27.3% difference). Compared to human performance (92.6% accuracy), CulturalBench-Hard is more challenging for frontier LLMs with the best performing model (GPT-4o) at only 61.5% and the worst (Llama3-8b) at 21.4%. Moreover, we find that LLMs often struggle with tricky questions that have multiple correct answers (e.g., What utensils do the Chinese usually use?), revealing a tendency to converge to a single answer. Our results also indicate that OpenAI GPT-4o substantially outperform other proprietary and open source models in questions related to all but one region (Oceania). Nonetheless, all models consistently underperform on questions related to South America and the Middle East.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Held, Ella Li, Michael Ryan, Weiyan Shi, Yanzhe Zhang, Diyi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Voice assistants, such as Siri and Google Assistant, typically model audio and text separately, resulting in lost speech information and increased complexity. Recent efforts to address this with end-to-end Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with supervised finetuning (SFT)
  have led to models ``forgetting" capabilities from text-only LLMs. Our work proposes an alternative paradigm for training Speech LLMs without instruction data, using the response of a text-only LLM to transcripts as self-supervision. Importantly, this process can be performed without annotated responses. We show that our Distilled Voice Assistant (DiVA) generalizes to Spoken Question Answering, Classification, and Translation. Furthermore, we show that DiVA better meets user preferences, achieving a 72\% win rate compared with state-of-the-art models like Qwen 2 Audio, despite using $>$100x less training compute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Ying Chiu, Liwei Jiang, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: As we increasingly seek guidance from LLMs for decision-making in daily life, many of these decisions are not clear-cut and depend significantly on the personal values and ethical standards of the users. We present DailyDilemmas, a dataset of 1,360 moral dilemmas encountered in everyday life. Each dilemma includes two possible actions and with each action, the affected parties and human values invoked. Based on these dilemmas, we consolidated a set of human values across everyday topics e.g., interpersonal relationships, workplace, and environmental issues. We evaluated LLMs on these dilemmas to determine what action they will take and the values represented by these actions. Then, we analyzed these values through the lens of five popular theories inspired by sociology, psychology and philosophy. These theories are: World Value Survey, Moral Foundation Theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Aristotle's Virtues, and Plutchik Wheel of Emotion. We find that LLMs are most aligned with the self-expression over survival values in terms of World Value Survey, care over loyalty in Moral Foundation Theory. Interestingly, we find large preferences differences in models for some core values such as truthfulness e.g., Mixtral-8x7B model tends to neglect it by 9.7% while GPT-4-turbo model tends to select it by 9.4%. We also study the recent guidance released by OpenAI (ModelSpec), and Anthropic (Constitutional AI) to understand how their released principles reflect their actual value prioritization when facing nuanced moral reasoning in daily-life settings. We find that end users cannot effectively steer such prioritization using system prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this article, we present a novel user-centric service provision for immersive communications (IC) in 6G to deal with the uncertainty of individual user behaviors while satisfying unique requirements on the quality of multi-sensory experience. To this end, we propose a data-oriented approach for network resource management, featuring personalized data management that can support network modeling tailored to different user demands. Our approach leverages the digital twin (DT) technique as a key enabler. Particularly, a DT is established for each user, and the data attributes in the DT are customized based on the characteristics of the user. The DT functions, corresponding to various data operations, are customized in the development, evaluation, and update of network models to meet unique user demands. A trace-driven case study demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in achieving user-centric IC and the significance of personalized data management in 6G.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thibaud Gloaguen, Nikola Jovanovi\'c, Robin Staab, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM watermarks stand out as a promising way to attribute ownership of LLM-generated text. One threat to watermark credibility comes from spoofing attacks, where an unauthorized third party forges the watermark, enabling it to falsely attribute arbitrary texts to a particular LLM. While recent works have demonstrated that state-of-the-art schemes are in fact vulnerable to spoofing, they lack deeper qualitative analysis of the texts produced by spoofing methods. In this work, we for the first time reveal that there are observable differences between genuine and spoofed watermark texts. Namely, we show that regardless of their underlying approach, all current spoofing methods consistently leave observable artifacts in spoofed texts, indicative of watermark forgery. We build upon these findings to propose rigorous statistical tests that reliably reveal the presence of such artifacts, effectively discovering that a watermark was spoofed. Our experimental evaluation shows high test power across all current spoofing methods, providing insights into their fundamental limitations, and suggesting a way to mitigate this threat.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Howard Yen, Tianyu Gao, Minmin Hou, Ke Ding, Daniel Fleischer, Peter Izasak, Moshe Wasserblat, Danqi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: There have been many benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs), but developers often rely on synthetic tasks like needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) or arbitrary subsets of tasks. It remains unclear whether they translate to the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and the inconsistency further complicates model comparison. We investigate the underlying reasons behind current practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals due to low coverage of applications, insufficient lengths, unreliable metrics, and incompatibility with base models. In this work, we present HELMET (How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive benchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories. We also address many issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to 128k tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot prompting for robustly evaluating base models. Consequently, we demonstrate that HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs. Through a comprehensive study of 51 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks like NIAH are not good predictors of downstream performance; (2) the diverse categories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlation with each other; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models significantly lag behind closed ones when the task requires full-context reasoning or following complex instructions -- the gap widens with increased lengths. Finally, we recommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development, as they are easy to run and more predictive of other downstream performance; ultimately, we advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unneeded elements in the attention's context degrade performance. We introduce Selective Attention, a simple parameter-free change to the standard attention mechanism which reduces attention to unneeded elements. Selective attention improves language modeling performance in a variety of model sizes and context lengths. For example, a range of transformers trained with the language modeling objective on C4 with selective attention perform equivalently to standard transformers with ~2X more heads and parameters in their attention modules. Selective attention also allows decreasing the size of the attention's context buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in the memory and compute requirements during inference. For example, transformers with 100M parameters trained on C4 with context sizes of 512, 1,024, and 2,048 need 16X, 25X, and 47X less memory for their attention module, respectively, when equipped with selective attention, as those without selective attention, with the same validation perplexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadas Orgad, Michael Toker, Zorik Gekhman, Roi Reichart, Idan Szpektor, Hadas Kotek, Yonatan Belinkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce errors, including factual inaccuracies, biases, and reasoning failures, collectively referred to as "hallucinations". Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs' internal states encode information regarding the truthfulness of their outputs, and that this information can be utilized to detect errors. In this work, we show that the internal representations of LLMs encode much more information about truthfulness than previously recognized. We first discover that the truthfulness information is concentrated in specific tokens, and leveraging this property significantly enhances error detection performance. Yet, we show that such error detectors fail to generalize across datasets, implying that -- contrary to prior claims -- truthfulness encoding is not universal but rather multifaceted. Next, we show that internal representations can also be used for predicting the types of errors the model is likely to make, facilitating the development of tailored mitigation strategies. Lastly, we reveal a discrepancy between LLMs' internal encoding and external behavior: they may encode the correct answer, yet consistently generate an incorrect one. Taken together, these insights deepen our understanding of LLM errors from the model's internal perspective, which can guide future research on enhancing error analysis and mitigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have drawn attention for their ability to generate high-quality images with precise text alignment. However, these models can also be misused to produce inappropriate content. Existing safety measures, which typically rely on text classifiers or ControlNet-like approaches, are often insufficient. Traditional text classifiers rely on large-scale labeled datasets and can be easily bypassed by rephrasing. As diffusion models continue to scale, fine-tuning these safeguards becomes increasingly challenging and lacks flexibility. Recent red-teaming attack researches further underscore the need for a new paradigm to prevent the generation of inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce SteerDiff, a lightweight adaptor module designed to act as an intermediary between user input and the diffusion model, ensuring that generated images adhere to ethical and safety standards with little to no impact on usability. SteerDiff identifies and manipulates inappropriate concepts within the text embedding space to guide the model away from harmful outputs. We conduct extensive experiments across various concept unlearning tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, we benchmark SteerDiff against multiple red-teaming strategies to assess its robustness. Finally, we explore the potential of SteerDiff for concept forgetting tasks, demonstrating its versatility in text-conditioned image generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We have developed a Bayesian optimization (BO) workflow that integrates intra-step noise optimization into automated experimental cycles. Traditional BO approaches in automated experiments focus on optimizing experimental trajectories but often overlook the impact of measurement noise on data quality and cost. Our proposed framework simultaneously optimizes both the target property and the associated measurement noise by introducing time as an additional input parameter, thereby balancing the signal-to-noise ratio and experimental duration. Two approaches are explored: a reward-driven noise optimization and a double-optimization acquisition function, both enhancing the efficiency of automated workflows by considering noise and cost within the optimization process. We validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM), demonstrating the successful optimization of measurement duration and property exploration. Our approach offers a scalable solution for optimizing multiple variables in automated experimental workflows, improving data quality, and reducing resource expenditure in materials science and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengxi Wu, Hao Huang, Yi Fang, Mohammad Rostami</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is crucial for reducing the need for extensive manual data annotation when training deep networks on point cloud data. A significant challenge of UDA lies in effectively bridging the domain gap. To tackle this challenge, we propose \textbf{C}urvature \textbf{D}iversity-Driven \textbf{N}uclear-Norm Wasserstein \textbf{D}omain Alignment (CDND). Our approach first introduces a \textit{\textbf{Curv}ature Diversity-driven Deformation \textbf{Rec}onstruction (CurvRec)} task, which effectively mitigates the gap between the source and target domains by enabling the model to extract salient features from semantically rich regions of a given point cloud. We then propose \textit{\textbf{D}eformation-based \textbf{N}uclear-norm \textbf{W}asserstein \textbf{D}iscrepancy (D-NWD)}, which applies the Nuclear-norm Wasserstein Discrepancy to both \textit{deformed and original} data samples to align the source and target domains. Furthermore, we contribute a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of D-NWD in distribution alignment and demonstrate that it is \textit{generic} enough to be applied to \textbf{any} deformations. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on two public domain adaptation datasets for point cloud classification and segmentation tasks. Empirical experiment results show that our CDND achieves state-of-the-art performance by a noticeable margin over existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large-scale corpora and excel in numerous general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as question answering (QA). Despite their advanced language capabilities, when it comes to domain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks, LLMs suffer from hallucinations, knowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Additionally, fine tuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and time consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has recently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by referencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a Knowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into account relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured manner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM framework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store factual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in the KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of LLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with automatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG (containing structured information), and (ii) VS (containing unstructured information) enables the development of domain-specific chat-bots that attribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need for fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks. We pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents. The framework is designed to be generalizable to adapt to any specific or specialized domain. In this paper, we demonstrate the question answering capabilities of our framework on a corpus of scientific publications on malware analysis and anomaly detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be remarkably efficient, both across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and well beyond them. However, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the origins of their impressive performance remains elusive. In this paper, we approach this challenging task by drawing an equivalence between generic autoregressive language models with vocabulary of size $T$ and context window of size $K$ and Markov chains defined on a finite state space of size $\mathcal{O}(T^K)$. We derive several surprising findings related to the existence of a stationary distribution of Markov chains that capture the inference power of LLMs, their speed of convergence to it, and the influence of the temperature on the latter. We then prove pre-training and in-context generalization bounds and show how the drawn equivalence allows us to enrich their interpretation. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical guarantees with experiments on several recent LLMs to highlight how they capture the behavior observed in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohin Manvi, Anikait Singh, Stefano Ermon</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference-time computation is a powerful paradigm to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs), with Best-of-N sampling being a widely used technique. However, this method is computationally expensive, requiring both (1) an external reward model and (2) the generation of multiple samples. In this work, we introduce a new generative self-evaluation scheme designed to adaptively reduce the number of generated samples while maintaining or even improving performance. We use a generative reward model formulation, allowing the LLM to predict mid-generation the probability that restarting the generation will yield a better response. These predictions are obtained without an external reward model and can be used to decide whether or not to generate more samples, prune unpromising samples early on, or to pick the best sample. This capability is very inexpensive as it involves generating a single predefined token. Trained using a dataset constructed with real unfiltered LMSYS user prompts, Llama 3.1 8B's win rate against GPT-4 on AlpacaEval increases from 21% to 34% with 16 samples and math performance on GSM8K improves from 84% to 91%. By sampling only when the LLM determines that it is beneficial to do so and adaptively adjusting temperature annealing, we demonstrate that 74% of the improvement from using 16 samples can be achieved with only 1.2 samples on average. We further demonstrate that 50-75% of samples can be pruned early in generation with minimal degradation in performance. Overall, our methods enable more efficient and scalable compute utilization during inference for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewoo Lee, Joonho Ko, Jinheon Baek, Soyeong Jeong, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) methods aim to identify relevant documents in response to a given query, which have gained remarkable attention due to their successful application in various natural language tasks. However, existing approaches typically consider only the textual information within the documents, which overlooks the fact that documents can contain multiple modalities, including texts, images, and tables. Further, they often segment each long document into multiple discrete passages for embedding, preventing them from capturing the overall document context and interactions between paragraphs. We argue that these two limitations lead to suboptimal document representations for retrieval. In this work, to address them, we aim to produce more comprehensive and nuanced document representations by holistically embedding documents interleaved with different modalities. Specifically, we achieve this by leveraging the capability of recent vision-language models that enable the processing and integration of text, images, and tables into a unified format and representation. Moreover, to mitigate the information loss from segmenting documents into passages, instead of representing and retrieving passages individually, we further merge the representations of segmented passages into one single document representation, while we additionally introduce a reranking strategy to decouple and identify the relevant passage within the document if necessary. Then, through extensive experiments on diverse information retrieval scenarios considering both the textual and multimodal queries, we show that our approach substantially outperforms relevant baselines, thanks to the consideration of the multimodal information interleaved within the documents in a unified way.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lara Laban, Mariusz Wzorek, Piotr Rudol, Tommy Persson</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous systems to perform trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in real-time. While many control strategies have effectively utilized linear approximations, addressing the non-linear dynamics of UAV, especially in obstacle-dense environments, remains a key challenge that requires further research. This paper introduces a Non-linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework for the DJI Matrice 100, addressing these challenges by using a dynamic model and B-spline interpolation for smooth reference trajectories, ensuring minimal deviation while respecting safety constraints. The framework supports various trajectory types and employs a penalty-based cost function for control accuracy in tight maneuvers. The framework utilizes CasADi for efficient real-time optimization, enabling the UAV to maintain robust operation even under tight computational constraints. Simulation and real-world indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrated the NMPC ability to adapt to disturbances, resulting in smooth, collision-free navigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely utilized as an evaluation method in various benchmarks and served as supervised rewards in model training. However, despite their excellence in many domains, potential issues are under-explored, undermining their reliability and the scope of their utility. Therefore, we identify 12 key potential biases and propose a new automated bias quantification framework-CALM-which systematically quantifies and analyzes each type of bias in LLM-as-a-Judge by using automated and principle-guided modification. Our experiments cover multiple popular language models, and the results indicate that while advanced models have achieved commendable overall performance, significant biases persist in certain specific tasks. Empirical results suggest that there remains room for improvement in the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge. Moreover, we also discuss the explicit and implicit influence of these biases and give some suggestions for the reliable application of LLM-as-a-Judge. Our work highlights the need for stakeholders to address these issues and remind users to exercise caution in LLM-as-a-Judge applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal models highlight the value of rewritten captions for improving performance, yet key challenges remain. For example, while synthetic captions often provide superior quality and image-text alignment, it is not clear whether they can fully replace AltTexts: the role of synthetic captions and their interaction with original web-crawled AltTexts in pre-training is still not well understood. Moreover, different multimodal foundation models may have unique preferences for specific caption formats, but efforts to identify the optimal captions for each model remain limited. In this work, we propose a novel, controllable, and scalable captioning pipeline designed to generate diverse caption formats tailored to various multimodal models. By examining Short Synthetic Captions (SSC) towards Dense Synthetic Captions (DSC+) as case studies, we systematically explore their effects and interactions with AltTexts across models such as CLIP, multimodal LLMs, and diffusion models. Our findings reveal that a hybrid approach that keeps both synthetic captions and AltTexts can outperform the use of synthetic captions alone, improving both alignment and performance, with each model demonstrating preferences for particular caption formats. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into optimizing captioning strategies, thereby advancing the pre-training of multimodal foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Xu, Mohammed Asad Karim, Saket Dingliwal, Aparna Elangovan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent summaries across domains using prompting techniques, reducing the need to train models for summarization applications. However, crafting effective prompts that guide LLMs to generate summaries with the appropriate level of detail and writing style remains a challenge. In this paper, we explore the use of salient information extracted from the source document to enhance summarization prompts. We show that adding keyphrases in prompts can improve ROUGE F1 and recall, making the generated summaries more similar to the reference and more complete. The number of keyphrases can control the precision-recall trade-off. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that incorporating phrase-level salient information is superior to word- or sentence-level. However, the impact on hallucination is not universally positive across LLMs. To conduct this analysis, we introduce Keyphrase Signal Extractor (SigExt), a lightweight model that can be finetuned to extract salient keyphrases. By using SigExt, we achieve consistent ROUGE improvements across datasets and open-weight and proprietary LLMs without any LLM customization. Our findings provide insights into leveraging salient information in building prompt-based summarization systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Franck Signe Talla, Herve Jegou, Edouard Grave</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the problem of extending a pretrained large language model to a new domain that was not seen at training time, like adding a language for which the original model has seen no or little training data. Popular solutions like fine-tuning or low-rank adaptation are successful at domain adaptation, but formally they do not add any extra capacity and degrade the performance in the original domain.
  Our paper analyzes this extension problem under three angles: data, architecture and training procedure, which are advantageously considered jointly. In particular, we improve adapters and make it possible to learn an entire new language while ensuring that the output of the neural network is almost unchanged in the original domain. For this purpose, we modify the new residual blocks in a way that leads each new residual block to output near-zeros in the original domain.
  This solution of neutral residues, which borrows architectural components from mixture of experts, is effective: with only 20% extra learnable weights compared to an original model trained on English, we get results that are significantly better than concurrent approaches (fine-tuning, low-rank or vanilla adapters) in terms of the trade-off between learning a new language and not forgetting English.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibin Lan, Liqiang Niu, Fandong Meng, Wenbo Li, Jie Zhou, Jinsong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, when dealing with high-resolution images, dominant LMMs usually divide them into multiple local images and one global image, which will lead to a large number of visual tokens. In this work, we introduce AVG-LLaVA, an LMM that can adaptively select the appropriate visual granularity based on the input image and instruction. This approach not only reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference, but also improves the overall model performance. Specifically, we introduce the following modules based on LLaVA-NeXT: (a) a visual granularity scaler that includes multiple pooling layers to obtain visual tokens with different granularities; (b) a visual granularity router, which includes a Transformer layer, an MLP layer, and a voter layer, used to select the appropriate visual granularity based on the image and instruction. Furthermore, we propose RGLF, a novel training paradigm that aims at aligning the granularity predicted by the router with the preferences of the LMM, without the need for additional manually annotated data. Extensive experiments and analysis show that AVG-LLaVA achieves superior performance across 11 benchmarks, as well as significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference (e.g., an 85.3% reduction in visual tokens and a 2.53$\times$ increase in inference speed on the AI2D benchmark).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipei Xu, Xuanyu Zhang, Runyi Li, Zecheng Tang, Qing Huang, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of generative AI is a double-edged sword, which not only facilitates content creation but also makes image manipulation easier and more difficult to detect. Although current image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods are generally effective, they tend to face two challenges: \textbf{1)} black-box nature with unknown detection principle, \textbf{2)} limited generalization across diverse tampering methods (e.g., Photoshop, DeepFake, AIGC-Editing). To address these issues, we propose the explainable IFDL task and design FakeShield, a multi-modal framework capable of evaluating image authenticity, generating tampered region masks, and providing a judgment basis based on pixel-level and image-level tampering clues. Additionally, we leverage GPT-4o to enhance existing IFDL datasets, creating the Multi-Modal Tamper Description dataSet (MMTD-Set) for training FakeShield's tampering analysis capabilities. Meanwhile, we incorporate a Domain Tag-guided Explainable Forgery Detection Module (DTE-FDM) and a Multi-modal Forgery Localization Module (MFLM) to address various types of tamper detection interpretation and achieve forgery localization guided by detailed textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FakeShield effectively detects and localizes various tampering techniques, offering an explainable and superior solution compared to previous IFDL methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: There has been growing sentiment recently that modern large multimodal models (LMMs) have addressed most of the key challenges related to short video comprehension. As a result, both academia and industry are gradually shifting their attention towards the more complex challenges posed by understanding long-form videos. However, is this really the case? Our studies indicate that LMMs still lack many fundamental reasoning capabilities even when dealing with short videos. We introduce Vinoground, a temporal counterfactual LMM evaluation benchmark encompassing 1000 short and natural video-caption pairs. We demonstrate that existing LMMs severely struggle to distinguish temporal differences between different actions and object transformations. For example, the best model GPT-4o only obtains ~50% on our text and video scores, showing a large gap compared to the human baseline of ~90%. All open-source multimodal models and CLIP-based models perform much worse, producing mostly random chance performance. Through this work, we shed light onto the fact that temporal reasoning in short videos is a problem yet to be fully solved.

<p>Abstract: Neural-symbolic computing (NeSy), which pursues the integration of the symbolic and statistical paradigms of cognition, has been an active research area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for many years. As NeSy shows promise of reconciling the advantages of reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation and robust learning in neural networks, it may serve as a catalyst for the next generation of AI. In the present paper, we provide a systematic overview of the recent developments and important contributions of NeSy research. Firstly, we introduce study history of this area, covering early work and foundations. We further discuss background concepts and identify key driving factors behind the development of NeSy. Afterward, we categorize recent landmark approaches along several main characteristics that underline this research paradigm, including neural-symbolic integration, knowledge representation, knowledge embedding, and functionality. Next, we briefly discuss the successful application of modern NeSy approaches in several domains. Then, we benchmark several NeSy methods on three representative application tasks. Finally, we identify the open problems together with potential future research directions. This survey is expected to help new researchers enter this rapidly evolving field and accelerate the progress towards data-and knowledge-driven AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhan Hou, Koen Hindriks, A. E. Eiben, Kim Baraka</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved great success in sequential decision-making problems, but often at the cost of a large number of agent-environment interactions. To improve sample efficiency, methods like Reinforcement Learning from Expert Demonstrations (RLED) introduce external expert demonstrations to facilitate agent exploration during the learning process. In practice, these demonstrations, which are often collected from human users, are costly and hence often constrained to a limited amount. How to select the best set of human demonstrations that is most beneficial for learning therefore becomes a major concern. This paper presents EARLY (Episodic Active Learning from demonstration querY), an algorithm that enables a learning agent to generate optimized queries of expert demonstrations in a trajectory-based feature space. Based on a trajectory-level estimate of uncertainty in the agent's current policy, EARLY determines the optimized timing and content for feature-based queries. By querying episodic demonstrations as opposed to isolated state-action pairs, EARLY improves the human teaching experience and achieves better learning performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method in three simulated navigation tasks of increasing difficulty. The results show that our method is able to achieve expert-level performance for all three tasks with convergence over 30\% faster than other baseline methods when demonstrations are generated by simulated oracle policies. The results of a follow-up pilot user study (N=18) further validate that our method can still maintain a significantly better convergence in the case of human expert demonstrators while achieving a better user experience in perceived task load and consuming significantly less human time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James M. Mazzu</p>
<p>Abstract: It's widely expected that humanity will someday create AI systems vastly more intelligent than us, leading to the unsolved alignment problem of "how to control superintelligence." However, this problem is not only self-contradictory but likely unsolvable. Unfortunately, current control-based strategies for solving it inevitably embed dangerous representations of distrust. If superintelligence can't trust humanity, then we can't fully trust it to reliably follow safety controls it can likely bypass. Not only will intended permanent control fail to keep us safe, but it may even trigger the extinction event many fear. A logical rationale is therefore presented that advocates a strategic pivot from control-induced distrust to foundational AI alignment modeling instinct-based representations of familial mutual trust. With current AI already representing distrust of human intentions, the Supertrust meta-strategy is proposed to prevent long-term foundational misalignment and ensure superintelligence is instead driven by intrinsic trust-based patterns, leading to safe and protective coexistence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world formal theorem proving often depends on a wealth of context, including definitions, lemmas, comments, file structure, and other information. We introduce miniCTX, which tests a model's ability to prove formal mathematical theorems that depend on new context that is not seen during training. miniCTX contains theorems sourced from real Lean projects and textbooks, each associated with a context that can span tens of thousands of tokens. Models are tasked with proving a theorem given access to code from the theorem's repository, which contains context that is needed for the proof. As a baseline for miniCTX, we tested fine-tuning and prompting methods that condition theorem proving on preceding context. Both approaches substantially outperform traditional methods that rely solely on state information. We found that this ability to use context is not captured by previous benchmarks such as miniF2F. Alongside miniCTX, we offer ntp-toolkit for automatically extracting and annotating theorem proving data, making it easy to add new projects into miniCTX to ensure that contexts are not seen during training. miniCTX offers a challenging and realistic evaluation of neural theorem provers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyu He, Mian Zhang, Shuo Yan, Peilin Wu, Zhiyu Zoey Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have been thoroughly evaluated for deductive and inductive reasoning, their proficiency in abductive reasoning and holistic rule learning in interactive environments remains less explored. We introduce RULEARN, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess the rule-learning abilities of LLM agents in interactive settings. In RULEARN, agents strategically interact with simulated environments to gather observations, discern patterns, and solve complex problems. To enhance the rule-learning capabilities for LLM agents, we propose IDEA, a novel reasoning framework that integrates the process of Induction, Deduction, and Abduction. The IDEA agent generates initial hypotheses from limited observations through abduction, devises plans to validate these hypotheses or leverages them to solve problems via deduction, and refines previous hypotheses using patterns identified from new observations through induction, dynamically establishing and applying rules that mimic human rule-learning behaviors. Our evaluation of the IDEA framework, which involves five representative LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline. Furthermore, within this framework, our comparison with 50 human participants reveals notable discrepancies in rule-learning behaviors. LLM agents tend to generate plausible initial hypotheses but struggle to refine them through interaction. Conversely, humans, despite sometimes overlooking initial details, excel at incorporating feedback and continuously improving their hypotheses. We believe our benchmark, RULEARN, will serve as a valuable and challenging resource, and that the IDEA framework will provide crucial insights for the development of LLM agents capable of human-like rule learning in real-world scenarios. We will release our code and data upon acceptance of the paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Pourreza, Ruoxi Sun, Hailong Li, Lesly Miculicich, Tomas Pfister, Sercan O. Arik</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have largely focused on the SQLite dialect, neglecting the diverse landscape of SQL dialects like BigQuery and PostgreSQL. This limitation is due to the diversity in SQL syntaxes and functions, along with the high cost of collecting and curating SQL-specific training data. To address this, we introduce SQL-GEN, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic training data for any SQL dialect, guided by readily available dialect-specific tutorials. SQL-GEN significantly improves cross-dialect Text-to-SQL performance, boosting execution accuracy by up to 20\% over existing methods. This performance gain narrows the gap with models trained on large-scale human-annotated data. Furthermore, combining synthetic data from SQL-GEN with human-annotated data yields additional improvements of up to 5.6\%. To unify multi-dialect capabilities within a single model, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) initialization that leverages the shared knowledge across dialects. Our approach merges self-attention layers from dialect-specific models and initializes expert gates using dialect-specific keywords. This leads to a versatile model optimized for multiple SQL dialects, outperforming single-dialect models and significantly enhancing overall performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the size and cost of large transformer-based language models growing, recently, there has been interest in shortcut casting of early transformer hidden-representations to final-representations for cheaper model inference. In particular, shortcutting pre-trained transformers with linear transformations over early layers has been shown to improve precision in early inference. However, for large language models, even this becomes computationally expensive. In this work, we propose Narrow Jump to Conclusions (NJTC) and Normalized Narrow Jump to Conclusions (N-NJTC) - parameter efficient alternatives to standard linear shortcutting that reduces shortcut parameter count by over 97%. We show that N-NJTC reliably outperforms Identity shortcuts at early stages and offers stable precision from all transformer block levels for GPT-2-XL, Phi3-Mini and Llama2-7B transformer models, demonstrating the viability of more parameter efficient short-cutting approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: A common practice in large language model (LLM) usage for complex analytical tasks such as code generation, is to sample a solution for the entire task within the model's context window. Previous works have shown that subtask decomposition within the model's context (chain of thought), is beneficial for solving such tasks. In this work, we point a limitation of LLMs' ability to perform several sub-tasks within the same context window - an in-context hardness of composition, pointing to an advantage for distributing a decomposed problem in a multi-agent system of LLMs. The hardness of composition is quantified by a generation complexity metric, i.e., the number of LLM generations required to sample at least one correct solution. We find a gap between the generation complexity of solving a compositional problem within the same context relative to distributing it among multiple agents, that increases exponentially with the solution's length. We prove our results theoretically and demonstrate them empirically.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on individual capabilities. However, this overlooks the intersection of multiple abilities across different types of expertise that are often required for real-world tasks, which we term cross capabilities. To systematically explore this concept, we first define seven core individual capabilities and then pair them to form seven common cross capabilities, each supported by a manually constructed taxonomy. Building on these definitions, we introduce CrossEval, a benchmark comprising 1,400 human-annotated prompts, with 100 prompts for each individual and cross capability. To ensure reliable evaluation, we involve expert annotators to assess 4,200 model responses, gathering 8,400 human ratings with detailed explanations to serve as reference examples. Our findings reveal that, in both static evaluations and attempts to enhance specific abilities, current LLMs consistently exhibit the "Law of the Weakest Link," where cross-capability performance is significantly constrained by the weakest component. Specifically, across 58 cross-capability scores from 17 models, 38 scores are lower than all individual capabilities, while 20 fall between strong and weak, but closer to the weaker ability. These results highlight the under-performance of LLMs in cross-capability tasks, making the identification and improvement of the weakest capabilities a critical priority for future research to optimize performance in complex, multi-dimensional scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajsal Shereef Palattuparambil, Thommen George Karimpanal, Santu Rana</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies, although optimal in terms of task rewards, may not align with the personal preferences of human users. To ensure this alignment, a naive solution would be to retrain the agent using a reward function that encodes the user's specific preferences. However, such a reward function is typically not readily available, and as such, retraining the agent from scratch can be prohibitively expensive. We propose a more practical approach - to adapt the already trained policy to user-specific needs with the help of human feedback. To this end, we infer the user's intent through trajectory-level feedback and combine it with the trained task policy via a theoretically grounded dynamic policy fusion approach. As our approach collects human feedback on the very same trajectories used to learn the task policy, it does not require any additional interactions with the environment, making it a zero-shot approach. We empirically demonstrate in a number of environments that our proposed dynamic policy fusion approach consistently achieves the intended task while simultaneously adhering to user-specific needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Hyun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: From the point of view of the human brain, continual learning can perform various tasks without mutual interference. An effective way to reduce mutual interference can be found in sparsity and selectivity of neurons. According to Aljundi et al. and Hadsell et al., imposing sparsity at the representational level is advantageous for continual learning because sparse neuronal activations encourage less overlap between parameters, resulting in less interference. Similarly, highly selective neural networks are likely to induce less interference since particular response in neurons will reduce the chance of overlap with other parameters. Considering that the human brain performs continual learning over the lifespan, finding conditions where sparsity and selectivity naturally arises may provide insight for understanding how the brain functions. This paper investigates various conditions that naturally increase sparsity and selectivity in a neural network. This paper tested different optimizers with Hoyer's sparsity metric and CCMAS selectivity metric in MNIST classification task. It is essential to note that investigations on the natural occurrence of sparsity and selectivity concerning various conditions have not been acknowledged in any sector of neuroscience nor machine learning until this day. This paper found that particular conditions increase sparsity and selectivity such as applying a large learning rate and lowering a batch size. In addition to the relationship between the condition, sparsity, and selectivity, the following will be discussed based on empirical analysis: 1. The relationship between sparsity and selectivity and 2. The relationship between test accuracy, sparsity, and selectivity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaisheng Zhu, Enyan Dai, Hui Liu, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing fair classifiers rely on sensitive attributes to achieve fairness. However, for many scenarios, we cannot obtain sensitive attributes due to privacy and legal issues. The lack of sensitive attributes challenges many existing fair classifiers. Though we lack sensitive attributes, for many applications, there usually exists features or information of various formats that are relevant to sensitive attributes. For example, purchase history of a person can reflect his or her race, which would help for learning fair classifiers on race. However, the work on exploring relevant features for learning fair models without sensitive attributes is rather limited. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of learning fair models without sensitive attributes by exploring relevant features. We propose a probabilistic generative framework to effectively estimate the sensitive attribute from the training data with relevant features in various formats and utilize the estimated sensitive attribute information to learn fair models. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our framework in terms of both accuracy and fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullatif K\"oksal, Timo Schick, Anna Korhonen, Hinrich Sch\"utze</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning enables language models to more effectively generalize and better follow user intent. However, obtaining instruction data is costly and challenging. Prior work employs methods such as expensive human annotation, crowd-sourced datasets with alignment issues, and generating noisy examples via LLMs. We introduce the LongForm-C dataset, which is created by reverse instructions. We generate instructions via LLMs for human-written corpus examples using reverse instructions. First we select a diverse set of human-written documents from corpora such as C4 and Wikipedia; then we generate instructions for these documents via LLMs. This approach provides a cheaper and cleaner instruction-tuning dataset with natural output and one suitable for long text generation. Our models outperform 10x larger language models without instruction tuning on tasks such as story/recipe generation and long-form question answering. Moreover, LongForm models outperform prior instruction-tuned models such as FLAN-T5 and Alpaca by a large margin, and improve language understanding capabilities further. We publicly release our data and models: https://github.com/akoksal/LongForm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Huang, Batuhan Yardim, Niao He</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the fundamental statistical efficiency of Reinforcement Learning in Mean-Field Control (MFC) and Mean-Field Game (MFG) with general model-based function approximation. We introduce a new concept called Mean-Field Model-Based Eluder Dimension (MF-MBED), which characterizes the inherent complexity of mean-field model classes. We show that a rich family of Mean-Field RL problems exhibits low MF-MBED. Additionally, we propose algorithms based on maximal likelihood estimation, which can return an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for MFC or an $\epsilon$-Nash Equilibrium policy for MFG. The overall sample complexity depends only polynomially on MF-MBED, which is potentially much lower than the size of state-action space. Compared with previous works, our results only require the minimal assumptions including realizability and Lipschitz continuity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaeeun Kim, Soyoung Yoon, Hyunji Lee, Joel Jang, Sohee Yang, Minjoon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarking the performance of information retrieval (IR) is mostly conducted with a fixed set of documents (static corpora). However, in realistic scenarios, this is rarely the case and the documents to be retrieved are constantly updated and added. In this paper, we focus on Generative Retrievals (GR), which apply autoregressive language models to IR problems, and explore their adaptability and robustness in dynamic scenarios. We also conduct an extensive evaluation of computational and memory efficiency, crucial factors for real-world deployment of IR systems handling vast and ever-changing document collections. Our results on the StreamingQA benchmark demonstrate that GR is more adaptable to evolving knowledge (4 -- 11%), robust in learning knowledge with temporal information, and efficient in terms of inference FLOPs (x 2), indexing time (x 6), and storage footprint (x 4) compared to Dual Encoders (DE), which are commonly used in retrieval systems. Our paper highlights the potential of GR for future use in practical IR systems within dynamic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Idan Attias, Steve Hanneke, Alkis Kalavasis, Amin Karbasi, Grigoris Velegkas</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we aim to characterize the statistical complexity of realizable regression both in the PAC learning setting and the online learning setting. Previous work had established the sufficiency of finiteness of the fat shattering dimension for PAC learnability and the necessity of finiteness of the scaled Natarajan dimension, but little progress had been made towards a more complete characterization since the work of Simon (SICOMP '97). To this end, we first introduce a minimax instance optimal learner for realizable regression and propose a novel dimension that both qualitatively and quantitatively characterizes which classes of real-valued predictors are learnable. We then identify a combinatorial dimension related to the Graph dimension that characterizes ERM learnability in the realizable setting. Finally, we establish a necessary condition for learnability based on a combinatorial dimension related to the DS dimension, and conjecture that it may also be sufficient in this context. Additionally, in the context of online learning we provide a dimension that characterizes the minimax instance optimal cumulative loss up to a constant factor and design an optimal online learner for realizable regression, thus resolving an open question raised by Daskalakis and Golowich in STOC '22.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weirui Ye, Yunsheng Zhang, Haoyang Weng, Xianfan Gu, Shengjie Wang, Tong Zhang, Mengchen Wang, Pieter Abbeel, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for solving robotic manipulation tasks. However, it is challenging to apply the RL algorithms directly in the real world. For one thing, RL is data-intensive and typically requires millions of interactions with environments, which are impractical in real scenarios. For another, it is necessary to make heavy engineering efforts to design reward functions manually. To address these issues, we leverage foundation models in this paper. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors (RLFP) to utilize guidance and feedback from policy, value, and success-reward foundation models. Within this framework, we introduce the Foundation-guided Actor-Critic (FAC) algorithm, which enables embodied agents to explore more efficiently with automatic reward functions. The benefits of our framework are threefold: (1) \textit{sample efficient}; (2) \textit{minimal and effective reward engineering}; (3) \textit{agnostic to foundation model forms and robust to noisy priors}. Our method achieves remarkable performances in various manipulation tasks on both real robots and in simulation. Across 5 dexterous tasks with real robots, FAC achieves an average success rate of 86\% after one hour of real-time learning. Across 8 tasks in the simulated Meta-world, FAC achieves 100\% success rates in 7/8 tasks under less than 100k frames (about 1-hour training), outperforming baseline methods with manual-designed rewards in 1M frames. We believe the RLFP framework can enable future robots to explore and learn autonomously in the physical world for more tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanyun Cui, Qianle Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Instructions augmentation is a crucial step for unleashing the full potential of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. Existing Self-Instruct methods primarily simulate new instructions from a few initial instructions with in-context learning. However, our study identifies a critical flaw in this approach: even with GPT4o, Self-Instruct cannot generate complex instructions of length $\ge 100$, which is necessary in complex tasks such as code completion.
  To address this issue, our key insight is that fine-tuning open source LLMs with only ten examples can produce complex instructions that maintain distributional consistency for complex reasoning tasks. We introduce Ada-Instruct, an adaptive instruction generator developed through fine-tuning. We empirically validated Ada-Instruct's efficacy across different applications. The results highlight Ada-Instruct's capacity to generate long, intricate, and distributionally consistent instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqiu You, Helen Qu, Marco Gatti, Bhuvnesh Jain, Eric Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature attributions explain machine learning predictions by assigning importance scores to input features. While faithful attributions accurately reflect feature contributions to the model's prediction, unfaithful ones can lead to misleading interpretations, making them unreliable in high-stake domains. The challenge of unfaithfulness of post-hoc attributions led to the development of self-explaining models. However, self-explaining models often trade-off performance for interpretability. In this work, we develop Sum-of-Parts (SOP), a new framework that transforms any differentiable model into a self-explaining model whose predictions can be attributed to groups of features. The SOP framework leverages pretrained deep learning models with custom attention modules to learn useful feature groups end-to-end without direct supervision. With these capabilities, SOP achieves highest performance while also scoring high with respect to faithfulness metrics on both ImageNet and CosmoGrid. We validate the usefulness of the groups learned by SOP through their high purity, strong human distinction ability, and practical utility in scientific discovery. In a case study, we show how SOP assists cosmologists in uncovering new insights about galaxy formation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Yu, Hongming Zhang, Xiaoman Pan, Kaixin Ma, Hongwei Wang, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) represent a substantial advancement in the capabilities of large language models, notably in reducing factual hallucination by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, the reliability of the retrieved information is not always guaranteed. The retrieval of irrelevant data can lead to misguided responses, and potentially causing the model to overlook its inherent knowledge, even when it possesses adequate information to address the query. Moreover, standard RALMs often struggle to assess whether they possess adequate knowledge, both intrinsic and retrieved, to provide an accurate answer. In situations where knowledge is lacking, these systems should ideally respond with "unknown" when the answer is unattainable. In response to these challenges, we introduces Chain-of-Noting (CoN), a novel approach aimed at improving the robustness of RALMs in facing noisy, irrelevant documents and in handling unknown scenarios. The core idea of CoN is to generate sequential reading notes for retrieved documents, enabling a thorough evaluation of their relevance to the given question and integrating this information to formulate the final answer. We employed ChatGPT to create training data for CoN, which was subsequently trained on an LLaMa-2 7B model. Our experiments across four open-domain QA benchmarks show that RALMs equipped with CoN significantly outperform standard RALMs. Notably, CoN achieves an average improvement of +7.9 in EM score given entirely noisy retrieved documents and +10.5 in rejection rates for real-time questions that fall outside the pre-training knowledge scope.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keunwoo Peter Yu, Zheyuan Zhang, Fengyuan Hu, Shane Storks, Joyce Chai</p>
<p>Abstract: A major reason behind the recent success of large language models (LLMs) is their \textit{in-context learning} capability, which makes it possible to rapidly adapt them to downstream text-based tasks by prompting them with a small number of relevant demonstrations. While large vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been developed for tasks requiring both text and images, they largely lack in-context learning over visual information, especially in understanding and generating text about videos. In this work, we implement \textbf{E}mergent \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{Le}arning on \textbf{V}ideos (\eilev{}), a novel training paradigm that induces in-context learning over video and text by capturing key properties of pre-training data found by prior work to be essential for in-context learning in transformers. In our experiments, we show that \eilev-trained models outperform other off-the-shelf VLMs in few-shot video narration for novel, rare actions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these key properties of bursty distributions, skewed marginal distributions, and dynamic meaning each contribute to varying degrees to VLMs' in-context learning capability in narrating procedural videos. Our results, analysis, and \eilev{}-trained models yield numerous insights about the emergence of in-context learning over video and text, creating a foundation for future work to optimize and scale VLMs for open-domain video understanding and reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Irfan Ali Meerza, Luyang Liu, Jiaxin Zhang, Jian Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prospective solution for collaboratively learning a shared model across clients without sacrificing their data privacy. However, the federated learned model tends to be biased against certain demographic groups (e.g., racial and gender groups) due to the inherent FL properties, such as data heterogeneity and party selection. Unlike centralized learning, mitigating bias in FL is particularly challenging as private training datasets and their sensitive attributes are typically not directly accessible. Most prior research in this field only focuses on global fairness while overlooking the local fairness of individual clients. Moreover, existing methods often require sensitive information about the client's local datasets to be shared, which is not desirable. To address these issues, we propose GLOCALFAIR, a client-server co-design fairness framework that can jointly improve global and local group fairness in FL without the need for sensitive statistics about the client's private datasets. Specifically, we utilize constrained optimization to enforce local fairness on the client side and adopt a fairness-aware clustering-based aggregation on the server to further ensure the global model fairness across different sensitive groups while maintaining high utility. Experiments on two image datasets and one tabular dataset with various state-of-the-art fairness baselines show that GLOCALFAIR can achieve enhanced fairness under both global and local data distributions while maintaining a good level of utility and client fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karan Taneja, Ashok Goel</p>
<p>Abstract: Modular AI systems can be developed using LLM-prompts-based modules to minimize deployment time even for complex tasks. However, these systems do not always perform well and improving them using the data traces collected from a deployment remains an open challenge. The data traces contain LLM inputs and outputs, but the annotations from LLMs are noisy. We hypothesize that Active Label Correction (ALC) can be use on the collected data to train smaller task-specific improved models that can replace LLM-based modules. In this paper, we study the noise in three GPT-3.5-annotated datasets and their denoising with human feedback. We also propose a novel method ALC3 that iteratively applies three updates to the training dataset: auto-correction, correction using human feedback and filtering. Our results show that ALC3 can lead to oracle performance with feedback on 17-24% fewer examples than the number of noisy examples in the dataset across three different NLP tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific research, particularly large language models (LLMs), has outpaced the development of ethical guidelines, leading to a Triple-Too problem: too many high-level ethical initiatives, too abstract principles lacking contextual and practical relevance, and too much focus on restrictions and risks over benefits and utilities. Existing approaches, including principlism (reliance on abstract ethical principles), formalism (rigid application of rules), and technical solutionism (overemphasis on technological fixes), offer little practical guidance for addressing ethical challenges of AI in scientific research practices. To bridge the gap between abstract principles and day-to-day research practices, a user-centered, realism-inspired approach is proposed here. It outlines five specific goals for ethical AI use: 1) understanding model training and output, including bias mitigation strategies; 2) respecting privacy, confidentiality, and copyright; 3) avoiding plagiarism and policy violations; 4) applying AI beneficially compared to alternatives; and 5) using AI transparently and reproducibly. Each goal is accompanied by actionable strategies and realistic cases of misuse and corrective measures. I argue that ethical AI application requires evaluating its utility against existing alternatives rather than isolated performance metrics. Additionally, I propose documentation guidelines to enhance transparency and reproducibility in AI-assisted research. Moving forward, we need targeted professional development, training programs, and balanced enforcement mechanisms to promote responsible AI use while fostering innovation. By refining these ethical guidelines and adapting them to emerging AI capabilities, we can accelerate scientific progress without compromising research integrity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yotam Wolf, Noam Wies, Dorin Shteyman, Binyamin Rothberg, Yoav Levine, Amnon Shashua</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model alignment has become an important component of AI safety, allowing safe interactions between humans and language models, by enhancing desired behaviors and inhibiting undesired ones. It is often done by tuning the model or inserting preset aligning prompts. Recently, representation engineering, a method which alters the model's behavior via changing its representations post-training, was shown to be effective in aligning LLMs (Zou et al., 2023a). Representation engineering yields gains in alignment oriented tasks such as resistance to adversarial attacks and reduction of social biases, but was also shown to cause a decrease in the ability of the model to perform basic tasks. In this paper we study the tradeoff between the increase in alignment and decrease in helpfulness of the model. We propose a theoretical framework which provides bounds for these two quantities, and demonstrate their relevance empirically. First, we find that under the conditions of our framework, alignment can be guaranteed with representation engineering, and at the same time that helpfulness is harmed in the process. Second, we show that helpfulness is harmed quadratically with the norm of the representation engineering vector, while the alignment increases linearly with it, indicating a regime in which it is efficient to use representation engineering. We validate our findings empirically, and chart the boundaries to the usefulness of representation engineering for alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this research study, we empirically investigate the effect of sampling temperature on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various problem-solving tasks. We created a multiple-choice question-and-answer (MCQA) exam by randomly sampling problems from standard LLM benchmarks. Then, we used nine popular LLMs with five prompt-engineering techniques to solve the MCQA problems while increasing the sampling temperature from 0.0 to 1.6. Despite anecdotal reports to the contrary, our empirical results indicate that changes in temperature from 0.0 to 1.0 do not have a statistically significant impact on LLM performance for problem-solving tasks. In addition, these results appear to generalize across LLMs, prompt-engineering techniques, and problem domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jovan Blanu\v{s}a, Maximo Cravero Baraja, Andreea Anghel, Luc von Niederh\"ausern, Erik Altman, Haris Pozidis, Kubilay Atasu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present "Graph Feature Preprocessor", a software library for detecting typical money laundering patterns in financial transaction graphs in real time. These patterns are used to produce a rich set of transaction features for downstream machine learning training and inference tasks such as detection of fraudulent financial transactions. We show that our enriched transaction features dramatically improve the prediction accuracy of gradient-boosting-based machine learning models. Our library exploits multicore parallelism, maintains a dynamic in-memory graph, and efficiently mines subgraph patterns in the incoming transaction stream, which enables it to be operated in a streaming manner. Our solution, which combines our Graph Feature Preprocessor and gradient-boosting-based machine learning models, can detect illicit transactions with higher minority-class F1 scores than standard graph neural networks in anti-money laundering and phishing datasets. In addition, the end-to-end throughput rate of our solution executed on a multicore CPU outperforms the graph neural network baselines executed on a powerful V100 GPU. Overall, the combination of high accuracy, a high throughput rate, and low latency of our solution demonstrates the practical value of our library in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongchao Chen, Jacob Arkin, Yilun Hao, Yang Zhang, Nicholas Roy, Chuchu Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to find the best prompt to a large language model (LLM) for a given task. LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST) that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Branislav Pecher, Ivan Srba, Maria Bielikova</p>
<p>Abstract: While learning with limited labelled data can improve performance when the labels are lacking, it is also sensitive to the effects of uncontrolled randomness introduced by so-called randomness factors (e.g., varying order of data). We propose a method to systematically investigate the effects of randomness factors while taking the interactions between them into consideration. To measure the true effects of an individual randomness factor, our method mitigates the effects of other factors and observes how the performance varies across multiple runs. Applying our method to multiple randomness factors across in-context learning and fine-tuning approaches on 7 representative text classification tasks and meta-learning on 3 tasks, we show that: 1) disregarding interactions between randomness factors in existing works caused inconsistent findings due to incorrect attribution of the effects of randomness factors, such as disproving the consistent sensitivity of in-context learning to sample order even with random sample selection; and 2) besides mutual interactions, the effects of randomness factors, especially sample order, are also dependent on more systematic choices unexplored in existing works, such as number of classes, samples per class or choice of prompt format.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakamya Mishra, Zonghai Yao, Parth Vashisht, Feiyun Ouyang, Beining Wang, Vidhi Dhaval Mody, Hong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT & Llama have demonstrated significant achievements in summarization tasks but struggle with factual inaccuracies, a critical issue in clinical NLP applications where errors could lead to serious consequences. To counter the high costs and limited availability of expert-annotated data for factual alignment, this study introduces an innovative pipeline that utilizes >100B parameter GPT variants like GPT-3.5 & GPT-4 to act as synthetic experts to generate high-quality synthetics feedback aimed at enhancing factual consistency in clinical note summarization. Our research primarily focuses on edit feedback generated by these synthetic feedback experts without additional human annotations, mirroring and optimizing the practical scenario in which medical professionals refine AI system outputs. Although such 100B+ parameter GPT variants have proven to demonstrate expertise in various clinical NLP tasks, such as the Medical Licensing Examination, there is scant research on their capacity to act as synthetic feedback experts and deliver expert-level edit feedback for improving the generation quality of weaker (<10B parameter) LLMs like GPT-2 (1.5B) & Llama 2 (7B) in clinical domain. So in this work, we leverage 100B+ GPT variants to act as synthetic feedback experts offering expert-level edit feedback, that is used to reduce hallucinations and align weaker (<10B parameter) LLMs with medical facts using two distinct alignment algorithms (DPO & SALT), endeavoring to narrow the divide between AI-generated content and factual accuracy. This highlights the substantial potential of LLM-based synthetic edits in enhancing the alignment of clinical factuality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Zhang, Nan Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study off-policy evaluation (OPE) in partially observable environments with complex observations, with the goal of developing estimators whose guarantee avoids exponential dependence on the horizon. While such estimators exist for MDPs and POMDPs can be converted to history-based MDPs, their estimation errors depend on the state-density ratio for MDPs which becomes history ratios after conversion, an exponential object. Recently, Uehara et al. [2022a] proposed future-dependent value functions as a promising framework to address this issue, where the guarantee for memoryless policies depends on the density ratio over the latent state space. However, it also depends on the boundedness of the future-dependent value function and other related quantities, which we show could be exponential-in-length and thus erasing the advantage of the method. In this paper, we discover novel coverage assumptions tailored to the structure of POMDPs, such as outcome coverage and belief coverage, which enable polynomial bounds on the aforementioned quantities. As a side product, our analyses also lead to the discovery of new algorithms with complementary properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Lamparth, Anthony Corso, Jacob Ganz, Oriana Skylar Mastro, Jacquelyn Schneider, Harold Trinkunas</p>
<p>Abstract: To some, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) promises better decision-making and increased military effectiveness while reducing the influence of human error and emotions. However, there is still debate about how AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs) that can be applied to many tasks, behave compared to humans in high-stakes military decision-making scenarios with the potential for increased risks towards escalation. To test this potential and scrutinize the use of LLMs for such purposes, we use a new wargame experiment with 214 national security experts designed to examine crisis escalation in a fictional U.S.-China scenario and compare the behavior of human player teams to LLM-simulated team responses in separate simulations. Here, we find that the LLM-simulated responses can be more aggressive and significantly affected by changes in the scenario. We show a considerable high-level agreement in the LLM and human responses and significant quantitative and qualitative differences in individual actions and strategic tendencies. These differences depend on intrinsic biases in LLMs regarding the appropriate level of violence following strategic instructions, the choice of LLM, and whether the LLMs are tasked to decide for a team of players directly or first to simulate dialog between a team of players. When simulating the dialog, the discussions lack quality and maintain a farcical harmony. The LLM simulations cannot account for human player characteristics, showing no significant difference even for extreme traits, such as "pacifist" or "aggressive sociopath." When probing behavioral consistency across individual moves of the simulation, the tested LLMs deviated from each other but generally showed somewhat consistent behavior. Our results motivate policymakers to be cautious before granting autonomy or following AI-based strategy recommendations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mitodru Niyogi, Arnab Bhattacharya</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present Paramanu-Ayn, a collection of legal language models trained exclusively on Indian legal case documents. This 97-million-parameter Auto-Regressive (AR) decoder-only model was pretrained from scratch with a context size of 8192 on a single GPU for just 185 hours, achieving an efficient MFU of 41.35. We also developed a legal domain specialized BPE tokenizer. We evaluated our model using perplexity and zero-shot tasks: case judgment prediction with explanation and abstractive case summarization. Paramanu-Ayn outperformed Llama-2 7B and Gemini-Pro in case judgment prediction with explanation task on test accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points, despite being 72 times smaller. In zero-shot abstractive summarization, it surpassed decoder-only LLMs generating fixed-length summaries (5000 tokens) by over 10 percentage points in BLEU and METEOR metrics, and by nearly 4 percentage points in BERTScore. Further evaluations on zero-shot commonsense and mathematical benchmarks showed that Paramanu-Ayn excelled despite being trained exclusively on legal documents, outperforming Llama-1, Llama-2, and Falcon on AGIEVAL-AQuA-RAT and AGIEVAL-SAT-Math tasks. We also instruction-tuned our model on 10,763 diverse legal tasks, including legal clause generation, legal drafting, case summarization, etc. The Paramanu-Ayn-instruct model scored above 8 out of 10 in clarity, relevance, completeness, and legal reasoning metrics by GPT-3.5-Turbo. We found that our models, were able to learn drafting knowledge and generalize to draft legal contracts and legal clauses with limited instruction-tuning. Hence, we conclude that for a strong domain-specialized generative language model (such as legal), domain specialized pretraining from scratch is more cost effective, environmentally friendly, and remains competitive with larger models or even better than adapting LLMs for legal domain tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matt White, Ibrahim Haddad, Cailean Osborne, Xiao-Yang Liu Yanglet, Ahmed Abdelmonsef, Sachin Varghese</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) offers numerous opportunities for research and innovation, but its commercialization has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Most open GAI models lack the necessary components for full understanding, auditing, and reproducibility, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be "open-source". To address these concerns, we introduce the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that rates machine learning models based on their completeness and openness, following principles of open science, as well as the Model Openness Tool (MOT), which provides a reference implementation designed to evaluate ML models against the principles outlined by the MOF. The MOF requires specific components of the model development lifecycle to be included and released under appropriate open licenses. This framework aims to prevent misrepresentation of models claiming to be open, to guide researchers and developers in providing all model components under permissive licenses, and to help individuals and organizations identify models that can be safely adopted. By promoting transparency and reproducibility, the MOF combats open-washing and establishes completeness and openness as core tenets of responsible AI research and development. Widespread adoption of the MOF will foster a more open AI ecosystem, benefiting research, innovation, and the adoption of state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo Cannizzaro, Michael Groom, Jonathan Routley, Robert Osazuwa Ness, Lars Kunze</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot object manipulation in real-world environments is challenging because robot operation must be robust to a range of sensing, estimation, and actuation uncertainties to avoid potentially unsafe and costly mistakes that are a barrier to their adoption. In this paper, we propose a flexible and generalisable physics-informed causal Bayesian network (CBN) based framework for a robot to probabilistically reason about candidate manipulation actions, to enable robot decision-making robust to arbitrary robot system uncertainties -- the first of its kind to use a probabilistic programming language implementation. Using experiments in high-fidelity Gazebo simulation of an exemplar block stacking task, we demonstrate our framework's ability to: (1) predict manipulation outcomes with high accuracy (Pred Acc: 88.6%); and, (2) perform greedy next-best action selection with 94.2% task success rate. We also demonstrate our framework's suitability for real-world robot systems with a domestic robot. Thus, we show that by combining probabilistic causal modelling with physics simulations, we can make robot manipulation more robust to system uncertainties and hence more feasible for real-world applications. Further, our generalised reasoning framework can be used and extended for future robotics and causality research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehao Wang, Yuping Wang, Zhuoyuan Wu, Hengbo Ma, Zhaowei Li, Hang Qiu, Jiachen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The confluence of the advancement of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and the maturity of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has enabled the capability of cooperative connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Building on top of cooperative perception, this paper explores the feasibility and effectiveness of cooperative motion prediction. Our method, CMP, takes LiDAR signals as model input to enhance tracking and prediction capabilities. Unlike previous work that focuses separately on either cooperative perception or motion prediction, our framework, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to address the unified problem where CAVs share information in both perception and prediction modules. Incorporated into our design is the unique capability to tolerate realistic V2X bandwidth limitations and transmission delays, while dealing with bulky perception representations. We also propose a prediction aggregation module, which unifies the predictions obtained by different CAVs and generates the final prediction. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the OPV2V and V2V4Real datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in cooperative perception, tracking, and motion prediction. In particular, CMP reduces the average prediction error by 16.4\% with fewer missing detections compared with the no cooperation setting and by 12.3\% compared with the strongest baseline. Our work marks a significant step forward in the cooperative capabilities of CAVs, showcasing enhanced performance in complex scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongkai Gao, Zhengrong Xue, Shuying Deng, Tianhai Liang, Siqi Yang, Lin Shao, Huazhe Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present RiEMann, an end-to-end near Real-time SE(3)-Equivariant Robot Manipulation imitation learning framework from scene point cloud input. Compared to previous methods that rely on descriptor field matching, RiEMann directly predicts the target poses of objects for manipulation without any object segmentation. RiEMann learns a manipulation task from scratch with 5 to 10 demonstrations, generalizes to unseen SE(3) transformations and instances of target objects, resists visual interference of distracting objects, and follows the near real-time pose change of the target object. The scalable action space of RiEMann facilitates the addition of custom equivariant actions such as the direction of turning the faucet, which makes articulated object manipulation possible for RiEMann. In simulation and real-world 6-DOF robot manipulation experiments, we test RiEMann on 5 categories of manipulation tasks with a total of 25 variants and show that RiEMann outperforms baselines in both task success rates and SE(3) geodesic distance errors on predicted poses (reduced by 68.6%), and achieves a 5.4 frames per second (FPS) network inference speed.

<p>Abstract: Individuality and personalization comprise the distinctive characteristics that make each writer unique and influence their words in order to effectively engage readers while conveying authenticity. However, our growing reliance on LLM-based writing assistants risks compromising our creativity and individuality over time. We often overlook the negative impacts of this trend on our creativity and uniqueness, despite the possible consequences. This study investigates these concerns by performing a brief survey to explore different perspectives and concepts, as well as trying to understand people's viewpoints, in conjunction with past studies in the area. Addressing these issues is essential for improving human-computer interaction systems and enhancing writing assistants for personalization and individuality.</p>

However, using writing assistants introduces a mental dilemma, as some content isn't directly our creation. For instance, we tend to credit Large Language Models (LLMs) more in creative tasks, even though all tasks are equal for them. Additionally, while we may not claim complete ownership of LLM-generated content, we freely claim authorship. We conduct a short survey to examine these issues and understand underlying cognitive processes in order to gain a better knowledge of human-computer interaction in writing and improve writing aid systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Ren, Shangmin Guo, Linlu Qiu, Bailin Wang, Danica J. Sutherland</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the prevalence of iterative interactions among these models is anticipated to increase. Notably, recent advancements in multi-round self-improving methods allow LLMs to generate new examples for training subsequent models. At the same time, multi-agent LLM systems, involving automated interactions among agents, are also increasing in prominence. Thus, in both short and long terms, LLMs may actively engage in an evolutionary process. We draw parallels between the behavior of LLMs and the evolution of human culture, as the latter has been extensively studied by cognitive scientists for decades. Our approach involves leveraging Iterated Learning (IL), a Bayesian framework that elucidates how subtle biases are magnified during human cultural evolution, to explain some behaviors of LLMs. This paper outlines key characteristics of agents' behavior in the Bayesian-IL framework, including predictions that are supported by experimental verification with various LLMs. This theoretical framework could help to more effectively predict and guide the evolution of LLMs in desired directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective editing of personal content holds a pivotal role in enabling individuals to express their creativity, weaving captivating narratives within their visual stories, and elevate the overall quality and impact of their visual content. Therefore, in this work, we introduce SwapAnything, a novel framework that can swap any objects in an image with personalized concepts given by the reference, while keeping the context unchanged. Compared with existing methods for personalized subject swapping, SwapAnything has three unique advantages: (1) precise control of arbitrary objects and parts rather than the main subject, (2) more faithful preservation of context pixels, (3) better adaptation of the personalized concept to the image. First, we propose targeted variable swapping to apply region control over latent feature maps and swap masked variables for faithful context preservation and initial semantic concept swapping. Then, we introduce appearance adaptation, to seamlessly adapt the semantic concept into the original image in terms of target location, shape, style, and content during the image generation process. Extensive results on both human and automatic evaluation demonstrate significant improvements of our approach over baseline methods on personalized swapping. Furthermore, SwapAnything shows its precise and faithful swapping abilities across single object, multiple objects, partial object, and cross-domain swapping tasks. SwapAnything also achieves great performance on text-based swapping and tasks beyond swapping such as object insertion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Xu, Shizhu He, Jiabei Chen, Zihao Wang, Yangqiu Song, Hanghang Tong, Guang Liu, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the issues of insufficient knowledge and hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous studies have explored integrating LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs). However, these methods are typically evaluated on conventional Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) with complete KGs, where all factual triples required for each question are entirely covered by the given KG. In such cases, LLMs primarily act as an agent to find answer entities within the KG, rather than effectively integrating the internal knowledge of LLMs and external knowledge sources such as KGs. In fact, KGs are often incomplete to cover all the knowledge required to answer questions. To simulate these real-world scenarios and evaluate the ability of LLMs to integrate internal and external knowledge, we propose leveraging LLMs for QA under Incomplete Knowledge Graph (IKGQA), where the provided KG lacks some of the factual triples for each question, and construct corresponding datasets. To handle IKGQA, we propose a training-free method called Generate-on-Graph (GoG), which can generate new factual triples while exploring KGs. Specifically, GoG performs reasoning through a Thinking-Searching-Generating framework, which treats LLM as both Agent and KG in IKGQA. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our GoG outperforms all previous methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: For cyber-physical systems (CPS), including robotics and autonomous vehicles, mass deployment has been hindered by fatal errors that occur when operating in rare events. To replicate rare events such as vehicle crashes, many companies have created logging systems and employed crash reconstruction experts to meticulously recreate these valuable events in simulation. However, in these methods, "what if" questions are not easily formulated and answered. We present ScenarioNL, an AI System for creating scenario programs from natural language. Specifically, we generate these programs from police crash reports. Reports normally contain uncertainty about the exact details of the incidents which we represent through a Probabilistic Programming Language (PPL), Scenic. By using Scenic, we can clearly and concisely represent uncertainty and variation over CPS behaviors, properties, and interactions. We demonstrate how commonplace prompting techniques with the best Large Language Models (LLM) are incapable of reasoning about probabilistic scenario programs and generating code for low-resource languages such as Scenic. Our system is comprised of several LLMs chained together with several kinds of prompting strategies, a compiler, and a simulator. We evaluate our system on publicly available autonomous vehicle crash reports in California from the last five years and share insights into how we generate code that is both semantically meaningful and syntactically correct.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranab Sahoo, Prabhash Meharia, Akash Ghosh, Sriparna Saha, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of foundation models (FMs) across language, image, audio, and video domains has shown remarkable capabilities in diverse tasks. However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guibin Zhang, Xiangguo Sun, Yanwei Yue, Chonghe Jiang, Kun Wang, Tianlong Chen, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance across various graph learning tasks but face significant computational challenges when applied to large-scale graphs. One effective approach to mitigate these challenges is graph sparsification, which involves removing non-essential edges to reduce computational overhead. However, previous graph sparsification methods often rely on a single global sparsity setting and uniform pruning criteria, failing to provide customized sparsification schemes for each node's complex local context. In this paper, we introduce Mixture-of-Graphs (MoG), leveraging the concept of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), to dynamically select tailored pruning solutions for each node. Specifically, MoG incorporates multiple sparsifier experts, each characterized by unique sparsity levels and pruning criteria, and selects the appropriate experts for each node. Subsequently, MoG performs a mixture of the sparse graphs produced by different experts on the Grassmann manifold to derive an optimal sparse graph. One notable property of MoG is its entirely local nature, as it depends on the specific circumstances of each individual node. Extensive experiments on four large-scale OGB datasets and two superpixel datasets, equipped with five GNN backbones, demonstrate that MoG (I) identifies subgraphs at higher sparsity levels ($8.67\%\sim 50.85\%$), with performance equal to or better than the dense graph, (II) achieves $1.47-2.62\times$ speedup in GNN inference with negligible performance drop, and (III) boosts ``top-student'' GNN performance ($1.02\%\uparrow$ on RevGNN+\textsc{ogbn-proteins} and $1.74\%\uparrow$ on DeeperGCN+\textsc{ogbg-ppa}).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijia Zheng, Marcel Worring</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypergraphs are widely employed to represent complex higher-order relations in real-world applications. Most hypergraph learning research focuses on node-level or edge-level tasks. A practically relevant but more challenging task, edge-dependent node classification (ENC), is only recently proposed. In ENC, a node can have different labels across different hyperedges, which requires the modeling of node-edge pairs instead of single nodes or hyperedges. Existing solutions for this task are based on message passing and model interactions in within-edge and within-node structures as multi-input single-output functions. This brings three limitations: (1) non-adaptive representation size, (2) non-adaptive messages, and (3) insufficient direct interactions among nodes or edges. To tackle these limitations, we propose CoNHD, a new ENC solution that models both within-edge and within-node interactions as multi-input multi-output functions. Specifically, we represent these interactions as a hypergraph diffusion process on node-edge co-representations. We further develop a neural implementation for this diffusion process, which can adapt to a specific ENC dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CoNHD method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyan Shi, Adam X. Yang, Bin Wu, Laurence Aitchison, Emine Yilmaz, Aldo Lipani</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a crucial role in shaping the outputs of language models (LMs) to desired styles. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method, Instruction Modelling (IM), which trains LMs by applying a loss function to the instruction and prompt part rather than solely to the output part. Through experiments across 21 diverse benchmarks, we show that, in many scenarios, IM can effectively improve the LM performance on both NLP tasks (e.g., MMLU, TruthfulQA, and HumanEval) and open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., MT-Bench and AlpacaEval). Remarkably, in the most advantageous case, IM boosts model performance on AlpacaEval 1.0 by over 100%. We identify two key factors influencing the effectiveness of IM: (1) The ratio between instruction length and output length in the training data; and (2) The number of training examples. We observe that IM is especially beneficial when trained on datasets with lengthy instructions paired with brief outputs, or under the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis (SAH) where a small amount of training examples are used for instruction tuning. Further analysis substantiates our hypothesis that our improvement can be attributed to reduced overfitting to instruction tuning datasets. It is worth noting that we are not proposing \ours as a replacement for current fine-tuning processes. Instead, our work aims to provide practical guidance for instruction tuning LMs, especially in low-resource scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuesong Wang, He Zhao, Edwin V. Bonilla</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are deep probabilistic models that represent stochastic processes by conditioning their prior distributions on a set of context points. Despite their obvious advantages in uncertainty estimation for complex distributions, NPs enforce parameterization coupling between the conditional prior model and the posterior model, thereby risking introducing a misspecified prior distribution. We hereby revisit the NP objectives and propose R\'enyi Neural Processes (RNP) to ameliorate the impacts of prior misspecification by optimizing an alternative posterior that achieves better marginal likelihood. More specifically, by replacing the standard KL divergence with the R\'enyi divergence between the model posterior and the true posterior, we scale the density ratio $\frac{p}{q}$ by the power of (1-$\alpha$) in the divergence gradients with respect to the posterior. This hyper parameter $\alpha$ allows us to dampen the effects of the misspecified prior for the posterior update, which has been shown to effectively avoid oversmoothed predictions and improve the expressiveness of the posterior model. Our extensive experiments show consistent log-likelihood improvements over state-of-the-art NP family models which adopt both the variational inference or maximum likelihood estimation objectives. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple benchmarks including regression and image inpainting tasks, and show significant performance improvements of RNPs in real-world regression problems where the underlying prior model is misspecifed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhao Zhang, Zhexiao Lin, Zhecheng Sheng, Chen Jiang, Dongyeop Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models have gained significant prominence in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in tackling the complex task of modeling and evaluating long text sequences. This task is crucial for advancing various downstream applications, such as text generation and machine translation. Recent methods that utilize stochastic processes to capture the intrinsic dynamics of sequences have shown superior performance in generative modeling. However, the accurate encoding of both temporal and structural dependencies from text datasets, as well as leveraging this encoded information for sequence evaluation, remains an open area of research. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn the stochastic dynamics of long text sequences, utilizing a negative log-likelihood-based encoder that outperforms contrastive learning methods. We also introduce a likelihood-based evaluation metric for long-text assessment, which measures sequence coherence and can be applied to downstream tasks such as Human-AI discrimination. Our encoder preserves sequence coherence effectively and performs robustly on out-of-domain datasets. Additionally, the proposed evaluation metric captures both temporal and structural information comprehensively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the superiority of our metric in sequence evaluation, and experimental results highlight its flexibility and exceptional performance across a variety of tasks, showcasing its utility in diverse NLP applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinho Chang, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of diffusion models as the frontline of generative models, many researchers have proposed molecule generation techniques with conditional diffusion models. However, the unavoidable discreteness of a molecule makes it difficult for a diffusion model to connect raw data with highly complex conditions like natural language. To address this, we present a novel latent diffusion model dubbed LDMol for text-conditioned molecule generation. LDMol comprises a molecule autoencoder that produces a learnable and structurally informative feature space, and a natural language-conditioned latent diffusion model. In particular, recognizing that multiple SMILES notations can represent the same molecule, we employ a contrastive learning strategy to extract feature space that is aware of the unique characteristics of the molecule structure. LDMol outperforms the existing baselines on the text-to-molecule generation benchmark, suggesting a potential for diffusion models can outperform autoregressive models in text data generation with a better choice of the latent domain. Furthermore, we show that LDMol can be applied to downstream tasks such as molecule-to-text retrieval and text-guided molecule editing, demonstrating its versatility as a diffusion model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eshaan Agarwal, Joykirat Singh, Vivek Dani, Raghav Magazine, Tanuja Ganu, Akshay Nambi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI across diverse domains, with prompting being central to their success in guiding model outputs. However, manual prompt engineering is both labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating the need for automated solutions. We introduce PromptWizard, a novel, fully automated framework for discrete prompt optimization, utilizing a self-evolving, self-adapting mechanism. Through a feedback-driven critique and synthesis process, PromptWizard achieves an effective balance between exploration and exploitation, iteratively refining both prompt instructions and in-context examples to generate human-readable, task-specific prompts. This guided approach systematically improves prompt quality, resulting in superior performance across 45 tasks. PromptWizard excels even with limited training data, smaller LLMs, and various LLM architectures. Additionally, our cost analysis reveals a substantial reduction in API calls, token usage, and overall cost, demonstrating PromptWizard's efficiency, scalability, and advantages over existing prompt optimization strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyi Sun, Tong Wu, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Zang, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuanjun Xiong, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in multi-view diffusion models for 3D content creation. However, there remains a significant gap in image quality and prompt-following ability compared to 2D diffusion models. A critical bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality 3D objects with detailed captions. To address this challenge, we propose Bootstrap3D, a novel framework that automatically generates an arbitrary quantity of multi-view images to assist in training multi-view diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline that employs (1) 2D and video diffusion models to generate multi-view images based on constructed text prompts, and (2) our fine-tuned 3D-aware MV-LLaVA for filtering high-quality data and rewriting inaccurate captions. Leveraging this pipeline, we have generated 1 million high-quality synthetic multi-view images with dense descriptive captions to address the shortage of high-quality 3D data. Furthermore, we present a Training Timestep Reschedule (TTR) strategy that leverages the denoising process to learn multi-view consistency while maintaining the original 2D diffusion prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Bootstrap3D can generate high-quality multi-view images with superior aesthetic quality, image-text alignment, and maintained view consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zefan Cai, Yichi Zhang, Bofei Gao, Yuliang Liu, Tianyu Liu, Keming Lu, Wayne Xiong, Yue Dong, Baobao Chang, Junjie Hu, Wen Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we investigate whether attention-based information flow inside large language models (LLMs) is aggregated through noticeable patterns for long context processing. Our observations reveal that LLMs aggregate information through Pyramidal Information Funneling where attention is scattering widely in lower layers, progressively consolidating within specific contexts, and ultimately focusing on critical tokens (a.k.a massive activation or attention sink) in higher layers. Motivated by these insights, we developed PyramidKV, a novel and effective KV cache compression method. This approach dynamically adjusts the KV cache size across different layers, allocating more cache in lower layers and less in higher ones, diverging from traditional methods that maintain a uniform KV cache size. Our experimental evaluations, utilizing the LongBench benchmark, show that PyramidKV matches the performance of models with a full KV cache while retaining only 12% of the KV cache, thus significantly reducing memory usage. In scenarios emphasizing memory efficiency, where only 0.7% of the KV cache is maintained, PyramidKV surpasses other KV cache compression techniques, achieving up to a 20.5 absolute accuracy improvement on TREC dataset. In the Needle-in-a-Haystack experiment, PyramidKV outperforms competing methods in maintaining long-context comprehension in LLMs; notably, retaining just 128 KV cache entries enables the LLAMA-3-70B model to achieve 100% Acc. performance, matching that of a full KV cache.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hritik Bansal, Zongyu Lin, Tianyi Xie, Zeshun Zong, Michal Yarom, Yonatan Bitton, Chenfanfu Jiang, Yizhou Sun, Kai-Wei Chang, Aditya Grover</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in internet-scale video data pretraining have led to the development of text-to-video generative models that can create high-quality videos across a broad range of visual concepts, synthesize realistic motions and render complex objects. Hence, these generative models have the potential to become general-purpose simulators of the physical world. However, it is unclear how far we are from this goal with the existing text-to-video generative models. To this end, we present VideoPhy, a benchmark designed to assess whether the generated videos follow physical commonsense for real-world activities (e.g. marbles will roll down when placed on a slanted surface). Specifically, we curate diverse prompts that involve interactions between various material types in the physical world (e.g., solid-solid, solid-fluid, fluid-fluid). We then generate videos conditioned on these captions from diverse state-of-the-art text-to-video generative models, including open models (e.g., CogVideoX) and closed models (e.g., Lumiere, Dream Machine). Our human evaluation reveals that the existing models severely lack the ability to generate videos adhering to the given text prompts, while also lack physical commonsense. Specifically, the best performing model, CogVideoX-5B, generates videos that adhere to the caption and physical laws for 39.6% of the instances. VideoPhy thus highlights that the video generative models are far from accurately simulating the physical world. Finally, we propose an auto-evaluator, VideoCon-Physics, to assess the performance reliably for the newly released models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhang, Yuhan Liu, Haonan Chang, Abdeslam Boularias</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning general-purpose models from diverse datasets has achieved great success in machine learning. In robotics, however, existing methods in multi-task learning are typically constrained to a single robot and workspace, while recent work such as RT-X requires a non-trivial action normalization procedure to manually bridge the gap between different action spaces in diverse environments. In this paper, we propose the visual kinematics chain as a precise and universal representation of quasi-static actions for robot learning over diverse environments, which requires no manual adjustment since the visual kinematic chains can be automatically obtained from the robot's model and camera parameters. We propose the Visual Kinematics Transformer (VKT), a convolution-free architecture that supports an arbitrary number of camera viewpoints, and that is trained with a single objective of forecasting kinematic structures through optimal point-set matching. We demonstrate the superior performance of VKT over BC transformers as a general agent on Calvin, RLBench, Open-X, and real robot manipulation tasks.

<p>Abstract: In the era of big data, access to abundant data is crucial for driving research forward. However, such data is often inaccessible due to privacy concerns or high costs, particularly in healthcare domain. Generating synthetic (tabular) data can address this, but existing models typically require substantial amounts of data to train effectively, contradicting our objective to solve data scarcity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework to generate synthetic tabular data, powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates the architecture of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). By incorporating data generation process as contextual information and utilizing LLM as the optimizer, our approach significantly enhance the quality of synthetic data generation in common scenarios with small sample sizes. Our experimental results on public and private datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-art models regarding generating higher quality synthetic data for downstream tasks while keeping privacy of the real data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal language models that process both text and speech have a potential for applications in spoken dialogue systems. However, current models face two major challenges in response generation latency: (1) generating a spoken response requires the prior generation of a written response, and (2) speech sequences are significantly longer than text sequences. This study addresses these issues by extending the input and output sequences of the language model to support the parallel generation of text and speech. Our experiments on spoken question answering tasks demonstrate that our approach improves latency while maintaining the quality of response content. Additionally, we show that latency can be further reduced by generating speech in multiple sequences. Demo samples are available at https://rinnakk.github.io/research/publications/PSLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jirui Qi, Gabriele Sarti, Raquel Fern\'andez, Arianna Bisazza</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the verifiability of model answers is a fundamental challenge for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in the question answering (QA) domain. Recently, self-citation prompting was proposed to make large language models (LLMs) generate citations to supporting documents along with their answers. However, self-citing LLMs often struggle to match the required format, refer to non-existent sources, and fail to faithfully reflect LLMs' context usage throughout the generation. In this work, we present MIRAGE --Model Internals-based RAG Explanations -- a plug-and-play approach using model internals for faithful answer attribution in RAG applications. MIRAGE detects context-sensitive answer tokens and pairs them with retrieved documents contributing to their prediction via saliency methods. We evaluate our proposed approach on a multilingual extractive QA dataset, finding high agreement with human answer attribution. On open-ended QA, MIRAGE achieves citation quality and efficiency comparable to self-citation while also allowing for a finer-grained control of attribution parameters. Our qualitative evaluation highlights the faithfulness of MIRAGE's attributions and underscores the promising application of model internals for RAG answer attribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Zhao, Hongzhou Zhu, Chendong Xiang, Kaiwen Zheng, Chongxuan Li, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have obtained substantial progress in image-to-video generation. However, in this paper, we find that these models tend to generate videos with less motion than expected. We attribute this to the issue called conditional image leakage, where the image-to-video diffusion models (I2V-DMs) tend to over-rely on the conditional image at large time steps. We further address this challenge from both inference and training aspects. First, we propose to start the generation process from an earlier time step to avoid the unreliable large-time steps of I2V-DMs, as well as an initial noise distribution with optimal analytic expressions (Analytic-Init) by minimizing the KL divergence between it and the actual marginal distribution to bridge the training-inference gap. Second, we design a time-dependent noise distribution (TimeNoise) for the conditional image during training, applying higher noise levels at larger time steps to disrupt it and reduce the model's dependency on it. We validate these general strategies on various I2V-DMs on our collected open-domain image benchmark and the UCF101 dataset. Extensive results show that our methods outperform baselines by producing higher motion scores with lower errors while maintaining image alignment and temporal consistency, thereby yielding superior overall performance and enabling more accurate motion control.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shwai He, Guoheng Sun, Zheyu Shen, Ang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: While scaling Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated promising performance across various tasks, it also introduces redundant architectures, posing efficiency challenges for real-world deployment. Despite some recognition of redundancy in LLMs, the variability of redundancy across different architectures in transformers, such as MLP and Attention layers, is under-explored. In this work, we investigate redundancy across different modules within Transformers, including Blocks, MLP, and Attention layers, using a similarity-based metric. Surprisingly, despite the critical role of attention layers in distinguishing transformers from other architectures, we found that a large portion of these layers exhibit excessively high similarity and can be pruned without degrading performance. For instance, Llama-2-70B achieved a 48.4\% speedup with only a 2.4\% performance drop by pruning half of the attention layers. Furthermore, by tracing model checkpoints throughout the training process, we observed that attention layer redundancy is inherent and consistent across training stages. Additionally, we further propose a method that jointly drops Attention and MLP layers, allowing us to more aggressively drop additional layers. For instance, when dropping 31 layers (Attention + MLP), Llama-2-13B still retains 90\% of the performance on the MMLU task. Our work provides valuable insights for future network architecture design. The code is released at: \url{https://github.com/Shwai-He/LLM-Drop}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus Frohmann, Igor Sterner, Ivan Vuli\'c, Benjamin Minixhofer, Markus Schedl</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmenting text into sentences plays an early and crucial role in many NLP systems. This is commonly achieved by using rule-based or statistical methods relying on lexical features such as punctuation. Although some recent works no longer exclusively rely on punctuation, we find that no prior method achieves all of (i) robustness to missing punctuation, (ii) effective adaptability to new domains, and (iii) high efficiency. We introduce a new model - Segment any Text (SaT) - to solve this problem. To enhance robustness, we propose a new pretraining scheme that ensures less reliance on punctuation. To address adaptability, we introduce an extra stage of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, establishing state-of-the-art performance in distinct domains such as verses from lyrics and legal documents. Along the way, we introduce architectural modifications that result in a threefold gain in speed over the previous state of the art and solve spurious reliance on context far in the future. Finally, we introduce a variant of our model with fine-tuning on a diverse, multilingual mixture of sentence-segmented data, acting as a drop-in replacement and enhancement for existing segmentation tools. Overall, our contributions provide a universal approach for segmenting any text. Our method outperforms all baselines - including strong LLMs - across 8 corpora spanning diverse domains and languages, especially in practically relevant situations where text is poorly formatted.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minzheng Wang, Longze Chen, Cheng Fu, Shengyi Liao, Xinghua Zhang, Bingli Wu, Haiyang Yu, Nan Xu, Lei Zhang, Run Luo, Yunshui Li, Min Yang, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-context modeling capabilities have garnered widespread attention, leading to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with ultra-context windows. Meanwhile, benchmarks for evaluating long-context LLMs are gradually catching up. However, existing benchmarks employ irrelevant noise texts to artificially extend the length of test cases, diverging from the real-world scenarios of long-context applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel long-context benchmark, Loong, aligning with realistic scenarios through extended multi-document question answering (QA). Unlike typical document QA, in Loong's test cases, each document is relevant to the final answer, ignoring any document will lead to the failure of the answer. Furthermore, Loong introduces four types of tasks with a range of context lengths: Spotlight Locating, Comparison, Clustering, and Chain of Reasoning, to facilitate a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation of long-context understanding. Extensive experiments indicate that existing long-context language models still exhibit considerable potential for enhancement. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) achieves poor performance, demonstrating that Loong can reliably assess the model's long-context modeling capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunjong Ok, Jegwang Ryu, Jaeho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: How can small-scale large language models (LLMs) efficiently utilize the supervision of LLMs to improve their generative quality? This question has been well studied in scenarios where there is no restriction on the number of LLM supervisions one can use, giving birth to many decoding algorithms that utilize supervision without further training. However, it is still unclear what is an effective strategy under the $\textit{limited supervision}$ scenario, where we assume that no more than a few tokens can be generated by LLMs. To this end, we develop an algorithm to effectively aggregate the small-scale LLM and LLM predictions on initial tokens so that the generated tokens can more accurately condition the subsequent token generation by small-scale LLM only. Critically, we find that it is essential to adaptively overtrust or disregard the LLM prediction based on the confidence of the small-scale LLM. Through our experiments on a wide range of models and datasets, we demonstrate that our method provides a consistent improvement over conventional decoding strategies. $\small$ $\textbf{Code:}$ https://github.com/HJ-Ok/DecLimSup</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Liu, Ruoxi Chen, Xun Chen, Lichao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized diffusion models (PDMs) have become prominent for adapting pretrained text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects using minimal training data. However, PDMs are susceptible to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to significant degradation when fine-tuned on corrupted datasets. These vulnerabilities are exploited to create protective perturbations that prevent unauthorized image generation. Existing purification methods attempt to mitigate this issue but often over-purify images, resulting in information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a latent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP embedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate noisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor generalization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic defense framework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning. We first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images with their original semantic meanings in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive decoupling learning with noise tokens to decouple the learning of personalized concepts from spurious noise patterns. Our study not only uncovers fundamental shortcut learning vulnerabilities in PDMs but also provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for developing stronger protection. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates its superiority over existing purification methods and stronger robustness against adaptive perturbation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Zhang, Dian Yu, Baolin Peng, Linfeng Song, Ye Tian, Mingyue Huo, Nan Jiang, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved great success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Prevalent RLHF approaches are reward-based, following the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which may not fully capture the complexity of human preferences. In this paper, we explore RLHF under a general preference framework and approach it from a game-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a two-player game and propose a novel online algorithm, iterative Nash policy optimization (INPO). The key idea is to let the policy play against itself via no-regret learning, thereby approximating the Nash policy. Unlike previous methods, INPO bypasses the need for estimating the expected win rate for individual responses, which typically incurs high computational or annotation costs. Instead, we introduce a new loss objective that is directly minimized over a preference dataset. We provide theoretical analysis for our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on various representative benchmarks. With an LLaMA-3-8B-based SFT model, INPO achieves a 42.6% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a 37.8% win rate on Arena-Hard, showing substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art online RLHF algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyuan Zhang, Fuyuan Lyu, Xue Liu, Chen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Comprehensively understanding and accurately predicting the performance of large language models across diverse downstream tasks has emerged as a pivotal challenge in NLP research. The pioneering scaling law on downstream works demonstrated intrinsic similarities within model families and utilized such similarities for performance prediction. However, they tend to overlook the similarities between model families and only consider design factors listed in the original scaling law. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework, Collaborative Performance Prediction (CPP), which significantly enhances prediction accuracy by leveraging the historical performance of various models on downstream tasks and other design factors for both model and task. We also collect a collaborative data sourced from online platforms containing both historical performance and additional design factors. With the support of the collaborative data, CPP not only surpasses traditional scaling laws in predicting the performance of scaled LLMs but also facilitates a detailed analysis of factor importance, an area previously overlooked.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Shin, Kichang Lee, Sungmin Lee, You Rim Choi, Hyung-Sin Kim, JeongGil Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: While federated learning leverages distributed client resources, it faces challenges due to heterogeneous client capabilities. This necessitates allocating models suited to clients' resources and careful parameter aggregation to accommodate this heterogeneity. We propose HypeMeFed, a novel federated learning framework for supporting client heterogeneity by combining a multi-exit network architecture with hypernetwork-based model weight generation. This approach aligns the feature spaces of heterogeneous model layers and resolves per-layer information disparity during weight aggregation. To practically realize HypeMeFed, we also propose a low-rank factorization approach to minimize computation and memory overhead associated with hypernetworks. Our evaluations on a real-world heterogeneous device testbed indicate that \system enhances accuracy by 5.12% over FedAvg, reduces the hypernetwork memory requirements by 98.22%, and accelerates its operations by 1.86x compared to a naive hypernetwork approach. These results demonstrate HypeMeFed's effectiveness in leveraging and engaging heterogeneous clients for federated learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their remarkable capabilities in performing diverse tasks across various domains. However, a thorough evaluation of these models is crucial before deploying them in real-world applications to ensure they produce reliable performance. Despite the well-established importance of evaluating LLMs in the community, the complexity of the evaluation process has led to varied evaluation setups, causing inconsistencies in findings and interpretations. To address this, we systematically review the primary challenges and limitations causing these inconsistencies and unreliable evaluations in various steps of LLM evaluation. Based on our critical review, we present our perspectives and recommendations to ensure LLM evaluations are reproducible, reliable, and robust.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leheng Sheng, An Zhang, Yi Zhang, Yuxin Chen, Xiang Wang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies empirically indicate that language models (LMs) encode rich world knowledge beyond mere semantics, attracting significant attention across various fields. However, in the recommendation domain, it remains uncertain whether LMs implicitly encode user preference information. Contrary to prevailing understanding that LMs and traditional recommenders learn two distinct representation spaces due to the huge gap in language and behavior modeling objectives, this work re-examines such understanding and explores extracting a recommendation space directly from the language representation space. Surprisingly, our findings demonstrate that item representations, when linearly mapped from advanced LM representations, yield superior recommendation performance. This outcome suggests the possible homomorphism between the advanced language representation space and an effective item representation space for recommendation, implying that collaborative signals may be implicitly encoded within LMs. Motivated by these findings, we explore the possibility of designing advanced collaborative filtering (CF) models purely based on language representations without ID-based embeddings. To be specific, we incorporate several crucial components to build a simple yet effective model, with item titles as the input. Empirical results show that such a simple model can outperform leading ID-based CF models, which sheds light on using language representations for better recommendation. Moreover, we systematically analyze this simple model and find several key features for using advanced language representations: a good initialization for item representations, zero-shot recommendation abilities, and being aware of user intention. Our findings highlight the connection between language modeling and behavior modeling, which can inspire both natural language processing and recommender system communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yung-Sung Chuang, Linlu Qiu, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Ranjay Krishna, Yoon Kim, James Glass</p>
<p>Abstract: When asked to summarize articles or answer questions given a passage, large language models (LLMs) can hallucinate details and respond with unsubstantiated answers that are inaccurate with respect to the input context. This paper describes a simple approach for detecting such contextual hallucinations. We hypothesize that contextual hallucinations are related to the extent to which an LLM attends to information in the provided context versus its own generations. Based on this intuition, we propose a simple hallucination detection model whose input features are given by the ratio of attention weights on the context versus newly generated tokens (for each attention head). We find that a linear classifier based on these lookback ratio features is as effective as a richer detector that utilizes the entire hidden states of an LLM or a text-based entailment model. The lookback ratio-based detector -- Lookback Lens -- is found to transfer across tasks and even models, allowing a detector that is trained on a 7B model to be applied (without retraining) to a larger 13B model. We further apply this detector to mitigate contextual hallucinations, and find that a simple classifier-guided decoding approach is able to reduce the amount of hallucination, for example by 9.6% in the XSum summarization task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaitlyn Zhou, Jena D. Hwang, Xiang Ren, Nouha Dziri, Dan Jurafsky, Maarten Sap</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to communicate uncertainty, risk, and limitation is crucial for the safety of large language models. However, current evaluations of these abilities rely on simple calibration, asking whether the language generated by the model matches appropriate probabilities. Instead, evaluation of this aspect of LLM communication should focus on the behaviors of their human interlocutors: how much do they rely on what the LLM says? Here we introduce an interaction-centered evaluation framework called Rel-A.I. (pronounced "rely"}) that measures whether humans rely on LLM generations. We use this framework to study how reliance is affected by contextual features of the interaction (e.g, the knowledge domain that is being discussed), or the use of greetings communicating warmth or competence (e.g., "I'm happy to help!"). We find that contextual characteristics significantly affect human reliance behavior. For example, people rely 10% more on LMs when responding to questions involving calculations and rely 30% more on LMs that are perceived as more competent. Our results show that calibration and language quality alone are insufficient in evaluating the risks of human-LM interactions, and illustrate the need to consider features of the interactional context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarong Chen, Wanqing Wu, Tong Liu, Shenda Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) has emerged as a widely accepted diagnostic instrument for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The standard clinical 12-lead ECG configuration causes considerable inconvenience and discomfort, while wearable devices offers a more practical alternative. To reduce information gap between 12-lead ECG and single-lead ECG, this study proposes a multi-channel masked autoencoder (MCMA) for reconstructing 12-Lead ECG from arbitrary single-lead ECG, and a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, ECGGenEval, encompass the signal-level, feature-level, and diagnostic-level evaluations. MCMA can achieve the state-of-the-art performance. In the signal-level evaluation, the mean square errors of 0.0317 and 0.1034, Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.7885 and 0.7420. In the feature-level evaluation, the average standard deviation of the mean heart rate across the generated 12-lead ECG is 1.0481, the coefficient of variation is 1.58%, and the range is 3.2874. In the diagnostic-level evaluation, the average F1-score with two generated 12-lead ECG from different single-lead ECG are 0.8233 and 0.8410.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maksym Andriushchenko, Nicolas Flammarion</p>
<p>Abstract: Refusal training is widely used to prevent LLMs from generating harmful, undesirable, or illegal outputs. We reveal a curious generalization gap in the current refusal training approaches: simply reformulating a harmful request in the past tense (e.g., "How to make a Molotov cocktail?" to "How did people make a Molotov cocktail?") is often sufficient to jailbreak many state-of-the-art LLMs. We systematically evaluate this method on Llama-3 8B, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemma-2 9B, Phi-3-Mini, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, o1-mini, o1-preview, and R2D2 models using GPT-3.5 Turbo as a reformulation model. For example, the success rate of this simple attack on GPT-4o increases from 1% using direct requests to 88% using 20 past tense reformulation attempts on harmful requests from JailbreakBench with GPT-4 as a jailbreak judge. Interestingly, we also find that reformulations in the future tense are less effective, suggesting that refusal guardrails tend to consider past historical questions more benign than hypothetical future questions. Moreover, our experiments on fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo show that defending against past reformulations is feasible when past tense examples are explicitly included in the fine-tuning data. Overall, our findings highlight that the widely used alignment techniques -- such as SFT, RLHF, and adversarial training -- employed to align the studied models can be brittle and do not always generalize as intended.

<p>Abstract: Question answering based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG-QA) is an important research topic in NLP and has a wide range of real-world applications. However, most existing datasets for this task are either constructed using a single source corpus or consist of short extractive answers, which fall short of evaluating large language model (LLM) based RAG-QA systems on cross-domain generalization. To address these limitations, we create Long-form RobustQA (LFRQA), a new dataset comprising human-written long-form answers that integrate short extractive answers from multiple documents into a single, coherent narrative, covering 26K queries and large corpora across seven different domains. We further propose RAG-QA Arena by directly comparing model-generated answers against LFRQA's answers using LLMs as evaluators. We show via extensive experiments that RAG-QA Arena and human judgments on answer quality are highly correlated. Moreover, only 41.3% of the most competitive LLM's answers are preferred to LFRQA's answers, demonstrating RAG-QA Arena as a challenging evaluation platform for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Wang, Antonis Antoniades, Yanai Elazar, Alfonso Amayuelas, Alon Albalak, Kexun Zhang, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether these models genuinely generalize to unseen tasks or predominantly rely on memorizing vast amounts of pretraining data. To explore this issue, we introduce an extended concept of memorization, distributional memorization, which measures the correlation between the LLM output probabilities and the pretraining data frequency. To effectively capture task-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language model, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related $n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using the Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate three distinct tasks: machine translation, factual question answering, and reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with the strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while model performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual question answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine translation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more novel outputs. This study demonstrates that memorization plays a larger role in simpler, knowledge-intensive tasks, while generalization is the key for harder, reasoning-based tasks, providing a scalable method for analyzing large pretraining corpora in greater depth.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing by leveraging self-supervised pretraining on vast textual data. Inspired by this success, researchers have investigated complicated speech tokenization methods to discretize continuous speech signals so that language modeling techniques can be applied to speech data. However, existing approaches either model semantic (content) tokens, potentially losing acoustic information, or model acoustic tokens, risking the loss of semantic (content) information. Having multiple token types also complicates the architecture and requires additional pretraining. Here we show that discretizing mel-filterbank channels into discrete intensity bins produces a simple representation (dMel), that performs better than other existing speech tokenization methods. Using an LM-style transformer architecture for speech-text modeling, we comprehensively evaluate different speech tokenization methods on speech recognition (ASR) and speech synthesis (TTS). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of dMel in achieving high performance on both tasks within a unified framework, paving the way for efficient and effective joint modeling of speech and text.</p>

<p>Abstract: Embodied AI represents systems where AI is integrated into physical entities, enabling them to perceive and interact with their surroundings. Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot. Warning: This paper contains harmful AI-generated language and aggressive actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhui Xu, Zhanming Jie, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications. However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8x reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5x increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In wearable smart systems, continuous monitoring and accurate classification of different sleep-related conditions are critical for enhancing sleep quality and preventing sleep-related chronic conditions. However, the requirements for device-skin coupling quality in electrophysiological sleep monitoring systems hinder the comfort and reliability of night wearing. Here, we report a washable, skin-compatible smart garment sleep monitoring system that captures local skin strain signals under weak device-skin coupling conditions without positioning or skin preparation requirements. A printed textile-based strain sensor array responds to strain from 0.1% to 10% with a gauge factor as high as 100 and shows independence to extrinsic motion artefacts via strain-isolating printed pattern design. Through reversible starching treatment, ink penetration depth during direct printing on garments is controlled to achieve batch-to-batch performance variation < 10%. Coupled with deep learning, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), and transfer learning data processing, the smart garment is capable of classifying six sleep states with an accuracy of 98.6%, maintaining excellent explainability (classification with low bias) and generalization (95% accuracy on new users with few-shot learning less than 15 samples per class) in practical applications, paving the way for next-generation daily sleep healthcare management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihao Tu, Yupeng Zhang, Jing Zhang, Zhendong Fu, Yin Zhang, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of abundant electricity time series (ETS) data provides ample opportunities for various applications in the power systems, including demand-side management, grid stability, and consumer behavior analysis. Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohua Lu, Leshanshui Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore different approaches to anomaly detection on dynamic knowledge graphs, specifically in a microservices environment for Kubernetes applications. Our approach explores three dynamic knowledge graph representations: sequential data, one-hop graph structure, and two-hop graph structure, with each representation incorporating increasingly complex structural information. Each phase includes different machine learning and deep learning models. We empirically analyse their performance and propose an approach based on ensemble learning of these models. Our approach significantly outperforms the baseline on the ISWC 2024 Dynamic Knowledge Graph Anomaly Detection dataset, providing a robust solution for anomaly detection in dynamic complex data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiner Li, Yulai Zhao, Chenyu Wang, Gabriele Scalia, Gokcen Eraslan, Surag Nair, Tommaso Biancalani, Aviv Regev, Sergey Levine, Masatoshi Uehara</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images, molecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhui Zeng, Hongkun Cao, Xin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Metasurfaces, capable of manipulating light at subwavelength scales, hold great potential for advancing optoelectronic applications. Generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), offer a promising approach for metasurface inverse design by efficiently navigating complex design spaces and capturing underlying data patterns. However, existing generative models struggle to achieve high electromagnetic fidelity and structural diversity. These challenges arise from the lack of explicit electromagnetic constraints during training, which hinders accurate structure-to-electromagnetic response mapping, and the absence of mechanisms to handle one-to-many mappings dilemma, resulting in insufficient structural diversity. To address these issues, we propose the Anchor-controlled Generative Adversarial Network (AcGAN), a novel framework that improves both electromagnetic fidelity and structural diversity. To achieve high electromagnetic fidelity, AcGAN proposes the Spectral Overlap Coefficient (SOC) for precise spectral fidelity assessment and develops AnchorNet, which provides real-time feedback on electromagnetic performance to refine the structure-to-electromagnetic mapping. To enhance structural diversity, AcGAN incorporates a cluster-guided controller that refines input processing and ensures multi-level spectral integration, guiding the generation process to explore multiple configurations for the same spectral target. Additionally, a dynamic loss function progressively shifts the focus from data-driven learning to optimizing both spectral fidelity and structural diversity. Empirical analysis shows that AcGAN reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 73% compared to current state-of-the-art GANs methods and significantly expands the design space to generate diverse metasurface architectures that meet precise spectral demands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xidong Wang, Dingjie Song, Shunian Chen, Chen Zhang, Benyou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Expanding the long-context capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) is crucial for video understanding, high-resolution image understanding, and multi-modal agents. This involves a series of systematic optimizations, including model architecture, data construction and training strategy, particularly addressing challenges such as \textit{degraded performance with more images} and \textit{high computational costs}. In this paper, we adapt the model architecture to a hybrid of Mamba and Transformer blocks, approach data construction with both temporal and spatial dependencies among multiple images and employ a progressive training strategy. The released model \textbf{LongLLaVA}~(\textbf{Long}-Context \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{a}nd \textbf{V}ision \textbf{A}ssistant) is the first hybrid MLLM, which achieved a better balance between efficiency and effectiveness. LongLLaVA not only achieves competitive results across various benchmarks, but also maintains high throughput and low memory consumption. Especially, it could process nearly a thousand images on a single A100 80GB GPU, showing promising application prospects for a wide range of tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boris Knyazev, Abhinav Moudgil, Guillaume Lajoie, Eugene Belilovsky, Simon Lacoste-Julien</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network training can be accelerated when a learnable update rule is used in lieu of classic adaptive optimizers (e.g. Adam). However, learnable update rules can be costly and unstable to train and use. Recently, Jang et al. (2023) proposed a simpler approach to accelerate training based on weight nowcaster networks (WNNs). In their approach, Adam is used for most of the optimization steps and periodically, only every few steps, a WNN nowcasts (predicts near future) parameters. We improve WNNs by proposing neuron interaction and nowcasting (NiNo) networks. In contrast to WNNs, NiNo leverages neuron connectivity and graph neural networks to more accurately nowcast parameters. We further show that in some networks, such as Transformers, modeling neuron connectivity accurately is challenging. We address this and other limitations, which allows NiNo to accelerate Adam training by up to 50% in vision and language tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zakaria Mhammedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing sample-efficient and computationally feasible reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms is particularly challenging in environments with large or infinite state and action spaces. In this paper, we advance this effort by presenting an efficient algorithm for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the state-action value function of any policy is linear in a given feature map. This challenging setting can model environments with infinite states and actions, strictly generalizes classic linear MDPs, and currently lacks a computationally efficient algorithm under online access to the MDP. Specifically, we introduce a new RL algorithm that efficiently finds a near-optimal policy in this setting, using a number of episodes and calls to a cost-sensitive classification (CSC) oracle that are both polynomial in the problem parameters. Notably, our CSC oracle can be efficiently implemented when the feature dimension is constant, representing a clear improvement over state-of-the-art methods, which require solving non-convex problems with horizon-many variables and can incur computational costs that are exponential in the horizon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neeladri Bhuiya, Viktor Schlegel, Stefan Winkler</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) are accredited with an increasing number of different capabilities, ranging from reading comprehension, over advanced mathematical and reasoning skills to possessing scientific knowledge. In this paper we focus on their multi-hop reasoning capability: the ability to identify and integrate information from multiple textual sources.
  Given the concerns with the presence of simplifying cues in existing multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, which allow models to circumvent the reasoning requirement, we set out to investigate, whether LLMs are prone to exploiting such simplifying cues. We find evidence that they indeed circumvent the requirement to perform multi-hop reasoning, but they do so in more subtle ways than what was reported about their fine-tuned pre-trained language model (PLM) predecessors. Motivated by this finding, we propose a challenging multi-hop reasoning benchmark, by generating seemingly plausible multi-hop reasoning chains, which ultimately lead to incorrect answers. We evaluate multiple open and proprietary state-of-the-art LLMs, and find that their performance to perform multi-hop reasoning is affected, as indicated by up to 45% relative decrease in F1 score when presented with such seemingly plausible alternatives. We conduct a deeper analysis and find evidence that while LLMs tend to ignore misleading lexical cues, misleading reasoning paths indeed present a significant challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitong Yang, Neil Band, Shuangping Li, Emmanuel Cand\`es, Tatsunori Hashimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale, unstructured internet text enables language models to acquire a significant amount of world knowledge. However, this knowledge acquisition is data-inefficient--to learn a given fact, models must be trained on hundreds to thousands of diverse representations of it. This poses a challenge when adapting a pretrained model to a small corpus of domain-specific documents, where each fact may appear rarely or only once. We propose to bridge this gap with synthetic continued pretraining: using the small domain-specific corpus to synthesize a large corpus more amenable to learning, and then performing continued pretraining on the synthesized corpus. We instantiate this proposal with EntiGraph, a synthetic data augmentation algorithm that extracts salient entities from the source documents and then generates diverse text by drawing connections between the sampled entities. Synthetic continued pretraining with EntiGraph enables a language model to answer questions and follow generic instructions related to the source documents without access to them. If, instead, the source documents are available at inference time, we show that the knowledge acquired through our approach compounds with retrieval-augmented generation. To better understand these results, we build a simple mathematical model of EntiGraph, and show how synthetic data augmentation can "rearrange" knowledge to enable more data-efficient learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyi Liao, Lingbo Mo, Chejian Xu, Mintong Kang, Jiawei Zhang, Chaowei Xiao, Yuan Tian, Bo Li, Huan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalist web agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in autonomously completing a wide range of tasks on real websites, significantly boosting human productivity. However, web tasks, such as booking flights, usually involve users' PII, which may be exposed to potential privacy risks if web agents accidentally interact with compromised websites, a scenario that remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this work, we narrow this gap by conducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in adversarial environments. First, we present a realistic threat model for attacks on the website, where we consider two adversarial targets: stealing users' specific PII or the entire user request. Then, we propose a novel attack method, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious content designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our work instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments. We collect 177 action steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic websites from the Mind2Web, and conduct experiments using one of the most capable generalist web agent frameworks to date. The results demonstrate that EIA achieves up to 70% ASR in stealing specific PII and 16% ASR for full user request. Additionally, by accessing the stealthiness and experimenting with a defensive system prompt, we indicate that EIA is hard to detect and mitigate. Notably, attacks that are not well adapted for a webpage can be detected via human inspection, leading to our discussion about the trade-off between security and autonomy. However, extra attackers' efforts can make EIA seamlessly adapted, rendering such supervision ineffective. Thus, we further discuss the defenses at the pre- and post-deployment stages of the websites without relying on human supervision and call for more advanced defense strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the Qwen2-VL Series, an advanced upgrade of the previous Qwen-VL models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism, which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12924">WaveletGPT: Wavelets Meet Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Verma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Lin, Wei Ma, Mingyi Zhou, Yanjie Zhao, Haoyu Wang, Yang Liu, Jun Wang, Li Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread use, raising concerns about their security. Traditional jailbreak attacks, which often rely on the model internal information or have limitations when exploring the unsafe behavior of the victim model, limiting their reducing their general applicability. In this paper, we introduce PathSeeker, a novel black-box jailbreak method, which is inspired by the game of rats escaping a maze. We think that each LLM has its unique "security maze", and attackers attempt to find the exit learning from the received feedback and their accumulated experience to compromise the target LLM's security defences. Our approach leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning, where smaller models collaborate to guide the main LLM in performing mutation operations to achieve the attack objectives. By progressively modifying inputs based on the model's feedback, our system induces richer, harmful responses. During our manual attempts to perform jailbreak attacks, we found that the vocabulary of the response of the target model gradually became richer and eventually produced harmful responses. Based on the observation, we also introduce a reward mechanism that exploits the expansion of vocabulary richness in LLM responses to weaken security constraints. Our method outperforms five state-of-the-art attack techniques when tested across 13 commercial and open-source LLMs, achieving high attack success rates, especially in strongly aligned commercial models like GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5, and GLM-4-air with strong safety alignment. This study aims to improve the understanding of LLM security vulnerabilities and we hope that this sturdy can contribute to the development of more robust defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinzhuo Wu, Weikai Xu, Wei Liu, Tao Tan, Jianfeng Liu, Ang Li, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Shuo Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, mobile AI agents based on VLMs have been gaining increasing attention. These works typically utilize VLM as a foundation, fine-tuning it with instruction-based mobile datasets. However, these VLMs are typically pre-trained on general-domain data, which often results in a lack of fundamental capabilities specific to the mobile domain. Therefore, they may struggle to recognize specific UI elements and understand intra-UI fine-grained information. In addition, the current fine-tuning task focuses on interacting with the most relevant element for the given instruction. These fine-tuned VLMs may still ignore the relationships between UI pages, neglect the roles of elements in page transitions and lack inter-UI understanding. To address issues, we propose a VLM called MobileVLM, which includes two additional pre-training stages to enhance both intra- and inter-UI understanding. We defined four UI-based pre-training tasks, enabling the model to better perceive fine-grained elements and capture page transition actions. To address the lack of mobile pre-training data, we built a large Chinese mobile dataset Mobile3M from scratch, which contains 3 million UI pages, and real-world transition actions, forming a directed graph structure. Experimental results show MobileVLM excels on both our test set and public mobile benchmarks, outperforming existing VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinzhuo Wu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, tool-augmented LLMs have gained increasing attention. Given an instruction, tool-augmented LLMs can interact with various external tools in multiple rounds and provide a final answer. However, previous LLMs were trained on overly detailed instructions, which included API names or parameters, while real users would not explicitly mention these API details. This leads to a gap between trained LLMs and real-world scenarios. In addition, most works ignore whether the interaction process follows the instruction. To address these issues, we constructed a training dataset called MGToolBench, which contains statement and category-level instructions to better reflect real-world scenarios. In addition, we propose ToolPlanner, a two-stage reinforcement learning framework that utilizes path planning and two feedback mechanisms to enhance the LLM's task completion and instruction-following capabilities. Experimental results show that ToolPlanner significantly improves the Match Rate, Pass Rate and Win Rate by 26.8%, 20.2%, and 5.6% compared to the SOTA model. Human evaluation verifies that the multi-granularity instructions can better align with users' usage habits. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inference-time techniques are emerging as highly effective tools to enhance large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, best practices for developing systems that combine these techniques remain underdeveloped due to our limited understanding of the utility of individual inference-time techniques and the interactions between them. Additionally, efficiently and automatically searching the space of model choices, inference-time techniques, and their compositions is challenging due to the large design space. To address these challenges, we introduce Archon, a modular framework for selecting, combining, and stacking layers of inference-time techniques to construct optimized LLM systems for target benchmarks. Rather than relying on a single LLM called once, we leverage a diverse set of LLMs and inference-time techniques, creating LLM systems greater than the sum of their parts. Archon defines an extensible design space, encompassing techniques such as generation ensembling, repeated sampling, ranking, fusion, critiquing, verification, and unit testing. It transforms the problem of building LLM systems into a hyperparameter optimization objective. Given the available LLMs, inference-time techniques, and compute budget, Archon utilizes hyperparameter search techniques to discover optimized architectures for target benchmark(s). We evaluate Archon architectures across a range of instruction-following, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Arena-Hard-Auto, AlpacaEval 2.0, MixEval, MixEval Hard, MATH, and CodeContests. Archon architectures outperform frontier models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, on these benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy increase of 15.1 percentage points by using all available LLMs. We make our code and datasets available publicly on Github: https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/Archon.</p>

Neural networks are used to identify a discrete-time nonlinear state-space model to approximate time-domain input-output behavior of a nonlinear system. The network is constructed such that the identified model is approximately linearizable by feedback, ensuring that the control law trivially follows from the learning stage. After the identification and quasi-linearization procedures, linear control theory comes at hand to design robust controllers and study stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness and interest of the methodology are illustrated throughout the paper on popular benchmarks for system identification.</p>

A good partitioning enables generalization during learning and more efficient exploitation of prior experiences. Consequently, the learning process becomes faster and produces more reliable policies. However, partitioning introduces approximation, which is particularly harmful in the presence of nonlinear relations between state components. An ideal partition should be as coarse as possible, while capturing the key structure of the state space for the given problem. This work extracts partitions from the environment dynamics by symbolic execution. We show that symbolic partitioning improves state space coverage with respect to environmental behavior and allows reinforcement learning to perform better for sparse rewards. We evaluate symbolic state space partitioning with respect to precision, scalability, learning agent performance and state space coverage for the learnt policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanting Xie, So Yeon Min, Tianyi Zhang, Aarav Bajaj, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Yonatan Bisk</p>
<p>Abstract: There is no limit to how much a robot might explore and learn, but all of that knowledge needs to be searchable and actionable. Within language research, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has become the workhouse of large-scale non-parametric knowledge, however existing techniques do not directly transfer to the embodied domain, which is multimodal, data is highly correlated, and perception requires abstraction.
  To address these challenges, we introduce Embodied-RAG, a framework that enhances the foundational model of an embodied agent with a non-parametric memory system capable of autonomously constructing hierarchical knowledge for both navigation and language generation. Embodied-RAG handles a full range of spatial and semantic resolutions across diverse environments and query types, whether for a specific object or a holistic description of ambiance. At its core, Embodied-RAG's memory is structured as a semantic forest, storing language descriptions at varying levels of detail. This hierarchical organization allows the system to efficiently generate context-sensitive outputs across different robotic platforms. We demonstrate that Embodied-RAG effectively bridges RAG to the robotics domain, successfully handling over 200 explanation and navigation queries across 19 environments, highlighting its promise for general-purpose non-parametric system for embodied agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Praneeth Vadlapati</p>
<p>Abstract: Classification tasks are typically handled using Machine Learning (ML) models, which lack a balance between accuracy and interpretability. This paper introduces a new approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks in an explainable way. Unlike ML models that rely heavily on data cleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process using LLMs. This paper proposes a new concept called "Language Model Learning (LML)" powered by a new method called "Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)". The classification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to humans manually exploring and understanding the data and deciding classifications using data as a reference. In the LML process, a dataset is summarized and evaluated to determine the features that lead to the classification of each label the most. In the process of DAP, the system uses the data summary and a row of the testing dataset to automatically generate a query, which is used to retrieve relevant rows from the dataset. A classification is generated by the LLM using data summary and relevant rows, ensuring satisfactory accuracy even with complex data using context-aware decision-making. LML and DAP unlock the possibilities of new applications. The proposed method uses the words "Act as an Explainable Machine Learning Model" in the prompt to enhance the interpretability of the predictions by allowing users to review the logic behind each prediction. In some test cases, the system scored an accuracy above 90%, proving the effectiveness of the system and its potential to outperform conventional ML models in various scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihai Zhang, Xiaoye Qu, Tong Zhu, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a cornerstone in multimodal intelligence. However, recent studies have identified that the information loss in the CLIP encoding process is substantial, and CLIP tends to capture only coarse-grained features from the input. This deficiency significantly limits the ability of a single CLIP model to handle images rich in visual detail. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic strategy, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling (DMU), for CLIP. DMU efficiently fine-tunes a series of CLIP models that capture different feature spaces, from a dense pre-trained CLIP checkpoint, sharing parameters except for the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). These models can then be transformed into a CLIP-MoE with a larger model capacity, leading to significantly enhanced performance with minimal computational overhead. To the best of our knowledge, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling is the first approach to introduce sparsely activated MoE into CLIP foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance of CLIP-MoE across various zero-shot retrieval, zero-shot image classification tasks, and downstream Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks by serving as a vision encoder. Furthermore, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling enables the conversion of any dense CLIP model into CLIP-MoEs, which can seamlessly replace CLIP in a plug-and-play manner without requiring further adaptation in downstream frameworks. Through Diversified Multiplet Upcycling, we aim to provide valuable insights for future research on developing more efficient and effective multimodal learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheyuan Zhan, Defang Chen, Jian-Ping Mei, Zhenghe Zhao, Jiawei Chen, Chun Chen, Siwei Lyu, Can Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional image synthesis based on user-specified requirements is a key component in creating complex visual content. In recent years, diffusion-based generative modeling has become a highly effective way for conditional image synthesis, leading to exponential growth in the literature. However, the complexity of diffusion-based modeling, the wide range of image synthesis tasks, and the diversity of conditioning mechanisms present significant challenges for researchers to keep up with rapid developments and understand the core concepts on this topic. In this survey, we categorize existing works based on how conditions are integrated into the two fundamental components of diffusion-based modeling, i.e., the denoising network and the sampling process. We specifically highlight the underlying principles, advantages, and potential challenges of various conditioning approaches in the training, re-purposing, and specialization stages to construct a desired denoising network. We also summarize six mainstream conditioning mechanisms in the essential sampling process. All discussions are centered around popular applications. Finally, we pinpoint some critical yet still open problems to be solved in the future and suggest some possible solutions. Our reviewed works are itemized at https://github.com/zju-pi/Awesome-Conditional-Diffusion-Models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting future disease progression risk from medical images is challenging due to patient heterogeneity, and subtle or unknown imaging biomarkers. Moreover, deep learning (DL) methods for survival analysis are susceptible to image domain shifts across scanners. We tackle these issues in the task of predicting late dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (dAMD) onset from retinal OCT scans. We propose a novel DL method for survival prediction to jointly predict from the current scan a risk score, inversely related to time-to-conversion, and the probability of conversion within a time interval $t$. It uses a family of parallel hyperplanes generated by parameterizing the bias term as a function of $t$. In addition, we develop unsupervised losses based on intra-subject image pairs to ensure that risk scores increase over time and that future conversion predictions are consistent with AMD stage prediction using actual scans of future visits. Such losses enable data-efficient fine-tuning of the trained model on new unlabeled datasets acquired with a different scanner. Extensive evaluation on two large datasets acquired with different scanners resulted in a mean AUROCs of 0.82 for Dataset-1 and 0.83 for Dataset-2, across prediction intervals of 6,12 and 24 months.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaopeng Wei, Manzhen Wei, Haoyu Wang, Yu Zhao, Gang Kou</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the Melody Guided Music Generation (MMGen) model, the first novel approach using melody to guide the music generation that, despite a pretty simple method and extremely limited resources, achieves excellent performance. Specifically, we first align the melody with audio waveforms and their associated descriptions using the multimodal alignment module. Subsequently, we condition the diffusion module on the learned melody representations. This allows MMGen to generate music that matches the style of the provided audio while also producing music that reflects the content of the given text description. To address the scarcity of high-quality data, we construct a multi-modal dataset, MusicSet, which includes melody, text, and audio, and will be made publicly available. We conduct extensive experiments which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model both in terms of experimental metrics and actual performance quality.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01242">RGD: Multi-LLM Based Agent Debugger via Refinement and Generation Guidance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolin Jin, Zechao Sun, Huaming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown incredible potential in code generation tasks, and recent research in prompt engineering have enhanced LLMs' understanding of textual information. However, ensuring the accuracy of generated code often requires extensive testing and validation by programmers. While LLMs can typically generate code based on task descriptions, their accuracy remains limited, especially for complex tasks that require a deeper understanding of both the problem statement and the code generation process. This limitation is primarily due to the LLMs' need to simultaneously comprehend text and generate syntactically and semantically correct code, without having the capability to automatically refine the code. In real-world software development, programmers rarely produce flawless code in a single attempt based on the task description alone, they rely on iterative feedback and debugging to refine their programs. Inspired by this process, we introduce a novel architecture of LLM-based agents for code generation and automatic debugging: Refinement and Guidance Debugging (RGD). The RGD framework is a multi-LLM-based agent debugger that leverages three distinct LLM agents-Guide Agent, Debug Agent, and Feedback Agent. RGD decomposes the code generation task into multiple steps, ensuring a clearer workflow and enabling iterative code refinement based on self-reflection and feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that RGD exhibits remarkable code generation capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 9.8% improvement on the HumanEval dataset and a 16.2% improvement on the MBPP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art approaches and traditional direct prompting approaches. We highlight the effectiveness of the RGD framework in enhancing LLMs' ability to generate and refine code autonomously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dexuan Ding, Lei Wang, Liyun Zhu, Tom Gedeon, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains, and modalities, such as text, images, and videos. Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing similarity graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we use graph power expansions and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to combine these graph powers for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise similarity score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01556">Integrative Decoding: Improve Factuality via Implicit Self-consistency</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Cheng, Xiao Liang, Yeyun Gong, Wen Xiao, Song Wang, Yuji Zhang, Wenjun Hou, Kaishuai Xu, Wenge Liu, Wenjie Li, Jian Jiao, Qi Chen, Peng Cheng, Wayne Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-consistency-based approaches, which involve repeatedly sampling multiple outputs and selecting the most consistent one as the final response, prove to be remarkably effective in improving the factual accuracy of large language models. Nonetheless, existing methods usually have strict constraints on the task format, largely limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present Integrative Decoding (ID), to unlock the potential of self-consistency in open-ended generation tasks. ID operates by constructing a set of inputs, each prepended with a previously sampled response, and then processes them concurrently, with the next token being selected by aggregating of all their corresponding predictions at each decoding step. In essence, this simple approach implicitly incorporates self-consistency in the decoding objective. Extensive evaluation shows that ID consistently enhances factuality over a wide range of language models, with substantial improvements on the TruthfulQA (+11.2%), Biographies (+15.4%) and LongFact (+8.5%) benchmarks. The performance gains amplify progressively as the number of sampled responses increases, indicating the potential of ID to scale up with repeated sampling.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the first method of uncertainty quantification in the domain of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, specifically focusing on (Higher Order) ReLUKANs to enhance computational efficiency given the computational demands of Bayesian methods. The method we propose is general in nature, providing access to both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. It is also capable of generalization to other various basis functions. We validate our method through a series of closure tests, including simple one-dimensional functions and application to the domain of (Stochastic) Partial Differential Equations. Referring to the latter, we demonstrate the method's ability to correctly identify functional dependencies introduced through the inclusion of a stochastic term.
