<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Andreoni, Andrei Buliga, Alessandro Daniele, Chiara Ghidini, Marco Montali, Massimiliano Ronzani</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains. However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored. The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a finite-state automaton corresponding to the temporal specification. Instead, we aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jong-Hwan Jang, Junho Song, Yong-Yeon Jo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual \textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more effective clinical decision-making.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Hu, Xiaoyang Wang, Qing Liu, Xiwei Xu, Qian Fu, Wenjie Zhang, Liming Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models. Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16054">Generative Foundation Model for Structured and Unstructured Electronic Health Records</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sonish Sivarajkumar, Hang Zhang, Yuelyu Ji, Maneesh Bilalpur, Xizhi Wu, Chenyu Li, Min Gu Kwak, Shyam Visweswaran, Yanshan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics, vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining, where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction (NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and 30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation, GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to additional modalities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring liveability and comfort is one of the fundamental objectives of urban planning. Numerous studies have employed computational methods to assess and quantify factors related to urban comfort such as greenery coverage, thermal comfort, and walkability. However, a clear definition of urban comfort and its comprehensive evaluation framework remain elusive. Our research explores the theoretical interpretations and methodologies for assessing urban comfort within digital planning, emphasising three key dimensions: multidimensional analysis, data support, and AI assistance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16059">Integrating Time Series into LLMs via Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion for Enhanced Forecasting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuomin Chen, Dan Li, Jiahui Zhou, Shunyu Wu, Haozheng Ye, Jian Lou, See-Kiong Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas, rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16072">InMind: Evaluating LLMs in Capturing and Applying Individual Human Reasoning Styles</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zizhen Li, Chuanhao Li, Yibin Wang, Qi Chen, Diping Song, Yukang Feng, Jianwen Sun, Jiaxin Ai, Fanrui Zhang, Mingzhu Sun, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized, adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned human-AI interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heewoong Noh, Namkyeong Lee, Gyoung S. Na, Kibum Kim, Chanyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saransh Kumar Gupta, Rizwan Gulzar Mir, Lipika Dey, Partha Pratim Das, Anirban Sen, Ramesh Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network (FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers, policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world saturated with dietary assertions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Wu, Yuang Yao, Tengfei Ma, Chenran Zhang, Na Su, Tao Zhou, Geng Chen, Wen Fan, Yi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain, most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns. Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks, outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Hu, Parfait Atchade-Adelomou, Carlo Adornetto, Adrian Mora-Carrero, Luis Alonso-Pastor, Ariel Noyman, Yubo Liu, Kent Larson</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets. Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent, context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems. Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities, personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to limited data availability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Abrantes, Robert Tjarko Lange, Yujin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However, existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features: (1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandru Tugui</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom), designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal, the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation. The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics, computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards maturity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Driven by rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), agents are empowered to combine intrinsic knowledge with dynamic tool use, greatly enhancing their capacity to address real-world tasks. In line with such an evolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0), towards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based agent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically, we abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and provide unified interfaces and extensible modules, enabling developers to easily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore, we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable evaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of long-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In addition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution and facilitates rapid deployment in production environments. With these enhancements, AgentScope provides a practical foundation for building scalable, adaptive, and effective agentic applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Han Hsieh, Elvis Hsieh, Dantong Niu, Trevor Darrell, Roei Herzig, David M. Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that (i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii) engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond, where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing only on causally relevant features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Yang, Chenlong Deng, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) has become increasingly important in the legal field. In this paper, we identify that existing large language models (LLMs) have significant problems of insufficient reasoning due to a lack of legal knowledge. Therefore, we introduce GLARE, an agentic legal reasoning framework that dynamically acquires key legal knowledge by invoking different modules, thereby improving the breadth and depth of reasoning. Experiments conducted on the real-world dataset verify the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, the reasoning chain generated during the analysis process can increase interpretability and provide the possibility for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniello Panariello, Emanuele Frascaroli, Pietro Buzzega, Lorenzo Bonicelli, Angelo Porrello, Simone Calderara</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total of 14 datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Zhang, Zhijian Zhou, Weidi Xu, Yanting Miao, Chao Qu, Yuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing. Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the competitive analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: In early childhood education, accurately detecting behavioral and collaborative engagement is essential for fostering meaningful learning experiences. This paper presents an AI-driven approach that leverages Vision Transformers (ViTs) to automatically classify children's engagement using visual cues such as gaze direction, interaction, and peer collaboration. Utilizing the Child-Play gaze dataset, our method is trained on annotated video segments to classify behavioral and collaborative engagement states (e.g., engaged, not engaged, collaborative, not collaborative). We evaluated three state-of-the-art transformer models: Vision Transformer (ViT), Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), and Swin Transformer. Among these, the Swin Transformer achieved the highest classification performance with an accuracy of 97.58%, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling local and global attention. Our results highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures for scalable, automated engagement analysis in real-world educational settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Wang, Yongqi Fan, yansha zhu, ZongYu Wang, Xuezhi Cao, Xinyan He, Haiyun Jiang, Tong Ruan, Jingping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts (CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs. Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process, which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization (DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolei Diao, Zhihan Zhou, Lida Shi, Ting Wang, Ruihua Qi, Hao Xu, Daqian Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However, existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in ancient Chinese NLP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Islamic inheritance domain holds significant importance for Muslims to ensure fair distribution of shares between heirs. Manual calculation of shares under numerous scenarios is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to assist with complex legal reasoning tasks. This study evaluates the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs to interpret and apply Islamic inheritance laws. We utilized the dataset proposed in the ArabicNLP QIAS 2025 challenge, which includes inheritance case scenarios given in Arabic and derived from Islamic legal sources. Various base and fine-tuned models, are assessed on their ability to accurately identify heirs, compute shares, and justify their reasoning in alignment with Islamic legal principles. Our analysis reveals that the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms all other models that we utilized across every difficulty level. It achieves up to 92.7% accuracy and secures the third place overall in Task 1 of the Qias 2025 challenge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications. Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios. Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025 shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15798">Persuasiveness and Bias in LLM: Investigating the Impact of Persuasiveness and Reinforcement of Bias in Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Saumya Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally, promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models. Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing, and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyedali Mohammadi, Manas Paldhe, Amit Chhabra</p>
<p>Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2 USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies, interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data, demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature, Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot, MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities, their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation, illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human knowledge.

<p>Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness, necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research coverage, as well as factual consistency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruv Atreja</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web (with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility: each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality) and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or even FullKV in some specific situations</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Rehman Linder</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL divergence, even when the original and extended models use different tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training, evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of embedding space during vocabulary expansion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Murphy, Twm Stone</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in AI are widely understood to have implications for cybersecurity. Articles have emphasized the effect of AI on the cyber offense-defense balance, and commentators can be found arguing either that cyber will privilege attackers or defenders. For defenders, arguments are often made that AI will enable solutions like formal verification of all software--and for some well-equipped companies, this may be true. This conversation, however, does not match the reality for most companies. "Trailing-edge organizations," as we term them, rely heavily on legacy software, poorly staff security roles, and struggle to implement best practices like rapid deployment of security patches. These decisions may be the result of corporate inertia, but may also be the result of a seemingly-rational calculation that attackers may not bother targeting a firm due to lack of economic incentives, and as a result, underinvestment in defense will not be punished.
  This approach to security may have been sufficient prior to the development of AI systems, but it is unlikely to remain viable in the near future. We argue that continuing improvements in AI's capabilities poses additional risks on two fronts: First, increased usage of AI will alter the economics of the marginal cyberattack and expose these trailing-edge organizations to more attackers, more frequently. Second, AI's advances will enable attackers to develop exploits and launch attacks earlier than they can today--meaning that it is insufficient for these companies to attain parity with today's leading defenders, but must instead aim for faster remediation timelines and more resilient software. The situation today portends a dramatically increased number of attacks in the near future. Moving forward, we offer a range of solutions for both organizations and governments to improve the defensive posture of firms which lag behind their peers today.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songyuan Sui, Hongyi Liu, Serena Liu, Li Li, Soo-Hyun Choi, Rui Chen, Xia Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in table understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nouar AlDahoul, Yasir Zaki</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression. While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech. Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash 2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Yin, Haolin Wang, Peng Bao, Ju Xu, Yongliang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tinghui Zhang, Yifan Wang, Daisy Zhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal, face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio, compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Pan, Jingxuan Fan, Zidi Xiong, Ely Hahami, Jorin Overwiening, Ziqian Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark, understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging $\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26 commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization (DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect and control model abnormalities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT, the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bibo Wu, Fang Fang, Ming Zeng, Xianbin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging pinching antennas in wireless network enabled federated learning (FL) can effectively mitigate the common "straggler" issue in FL by dynamically establishing strong line-of-sight (LoS) links on demand. This letter proposes a hybrid conventional and pinching antenna network (HCPAN) to significantly improve communication efficiency in the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled FL system. Within this framework, a fuzzy logic-based client classification scheme is first proposed to effectively balance clients' data contributions and communication conditions. Given this classification, we formulate a total time minimization problem to jointly optimize pinching antenna placement and resource allocation. Due to the complexity of variable coupling and non-convexity, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is developed to effectively address this problem. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed scheme in enhancing FL performance via the optimized deployment of pinching antenna.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pouria Mortezaagha, Arya Rahgozar</p>
<p>Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN). Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach), we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM) judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores, and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of 81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines (43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and end-to-end traceability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifei Xie, Ziyang Ma, Zihang Liu, Kaiyu Pang, Hongyu Li, Jialin Zhang, Yue Liao, Deheng Ye, Chunyan Miao, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the "Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However, this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning, leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srikant Panda, Hitesh Laxmichand Patel, Shahad Al-Khalifa, Amit Agarwal, Hend Al-Khalifa, Sharefah Al-Ghamdi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality, infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models: inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srikant Panda, Vishnu Hari, Kalpana Panda, Amit Agarwal, Hitesh Laxmichand Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters. Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianren Zhang, Shreyas Prasad, Di Wang, Qiuhai Zeng, Suhang Wang, Wenbo Yan, Mat Hans</p>
<p>Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced. However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems. First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench. To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements (e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question, text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations. Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94% accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1 Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic readiness in Brazil.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing (NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive, dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving the way for more efficient model deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: As AI systems increasingly influence critical decisions, they face threats that exploit reasoning mechanisms rather than technical infrastructure. We present a framework for cognitive cybersecurity, a systematic protection of AI reasoning processes from adversarial manipulation. Our contributions are threefold. First, we establish cognitive cybersecurity as a discipline complementing traditional cybersecurity and AI safety, addressing vulnerabilities where legitimate inputs corrupt reasoning while evading conventional controls. Second, we introduce the CIA+TA, extending traditional Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability triad with Trust (epistemic validation) and Autonomy (human agency preservation), requirements unique to systems generating knowledge claims and mediating decisions. Third, we present a quantitative risk assessment methodology with empirically-derived coefficients, enabling organizations to measure cognitive security risks. We map our framework to OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS, facilitating operational integration. Validation through previously published studies (151 human participants; 12,180 AI trials) reveals strong architecture dependence: identical defenses produce effects ranging from 96% reduction to 135% amplification of vulnerabilities. This necessitates pre-deployment Cognitive Penetration Testing as a governance requirement for trustworthy AI deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7% across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maarten Buyl, Yousra Fettach, Guillaume Bied, Tijl De Bie</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with each other, most notably in multi-agent setups, we may expect (and hope) that `trust' relationships develop between them, mirroring trust relationships between human colleagues, friends, or partners. Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be capable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in trust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build trust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how this relates to explicit measures of trust.
  We study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e. susceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with explicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established in psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically, by starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the LLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust are either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures. These findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their opinion may be deceiving. Instead, context-specific and implicit measures may be more informative in understanding how LLMs trust each other.</p>

From the perspective of the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC) hypothesis -- a framework for understanding these faculties and the emergence of language at the group level -- we introduce a hypothetical idea: that language, with its embedded distributional semantics, serves as a collectively formed external representation. CPC generalises the concepts of individual memory and attention to the collective level. This offers a new perspective on how shared linguistic structures, which may embrace collective world models learned through next-word prediction, emerge from and shape group-level cognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Boone, Fatemeh Afghah</p>
<p>Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are being increasingly utilized for critical applications. CPS combines sensing and computing elements, often having multi-layer designs with networking, computational, and physical interfaces, which provide them with enhanced capabilities for a variety of application scenarios. However, the combination of physical and computational elements also makes CPS more vulnerable to attacks compared to network-only systems, and the resulting impacts of CPS attacks can be substantial. Intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS) are an effective mechanism by which CPS can be secured, but the majority of current solutions often train and validate on network traffic-only datasets, ignoring the distinct attacks that may occur on other system layers. In order to address this, we develop an adaptable CPS anomaly detection model that can detect attacks within CPS without the need for previously labeled data. To achieve this, we utilize domain adaptation techniques that allow us to transfer known attack knowledge from a network traffic-only environment to a CPS environment. We validate our approach using a state-of-the-art CPS intrusion dataset that combines network, operating system (OS), and Robot Operating System (ROS) data. Through this dataset, we are able to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model across network traffic-only and CPS environments with distinct attack types and its ability to outperform other anomaly detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqiao Zhu, Ji Liu, Rongjuncheng Zhang, Haipang Wu, Yulun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First, vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second, existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Liu, Yuwei Liu, Yuan Meng, Jieheng Zhang, Yuwei Zhou, Ye Li, Jiacheng Jiang, Kangye Ji, Shijia Ge, Zhi Wang, Wenwu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-centric hierarchical embodied models have demonstrated strong potential for long-horizon robotic control. However, existing methods lack spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem, we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table. Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7% average success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Hruday Kavuri, Gargi Shroff, Rahul Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n) compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang Wang, Tianwei Yan, Zonghao Yang, Minghao Hu, Jun Zhang, Zhunchen Luo, Xiaoying Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs) and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM, significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision. DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of all modules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Terry Jingchen Zhang, Wenyuan Jiang, Rongchuan Liu, Yisong Wang, Junran Yang, Ning Wang, Nicole Ni, Yinya Huang, Mrinmaya Sachan</p>
<p>Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems, which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning. Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4) and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated reasoning research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojuan Tang, Fanxu Meng, Pingzhi Tang, Yuxuan Wang, Di Yin, Xing Sun, Muhan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache, eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaan Berke Ugurlar, Joaqu\'in de Navascu\'es, Michael Taynnan Barros</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the dynamic organization and homeostasis of living tissues requires high-resolution, time-resolved imaging coupled with methods capable of extracting interpretable, predictive insights from complex datasets. Here, we present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO (Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy, VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment, ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics, enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models, which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3) designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models, such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B total and 2.2B activated parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayukh Bagchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Information Ecosystem Reengineering (IER) -- the technological reconditioning of information sources, services, and systems within a complex information ecosystem -- is a foundational challenge in the digital transformation of public sector services and smart governance platforms. From a semantic knowledge management perspective, IER becomes especially entangled due to the potentially infinite number of possibilities in its conceptualization, namely, as a result of manifoldness in the multi-level mix of perception, language and conceptual interlinkage implicit in all agents involved in such an effort. This paper proposes a novel approach -- Representation Disentanglement -- to disentangle these multiple layers of knowledge representation complexity hindering effective reengineering decision making. The approach is based on the theoretically grounded and implementationally robust ontology-driven conceptual modeling paradigm which has been widely adopted in systems analysis and (re)engineering. We argue that such a framework is essential to achieve explainability, traceability and semantic transparency in public sector knowledge representation and to support auditable decision workflows in governance ecosystems increasingly driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data-centric architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) serving systems face challenges from highly variable requests with diverse lengths, priorities, and stage-specific service-level objectives (SLOs). Meeting these requires real-time scheduling, rapid and cost-effective scaling, and support for both collocated and disaggregated Prefill/Decode (P/D) architectures.
  We present \textbf{HyperFlexis}, a unified LLM serving system that integrates algorithmic and system-level innovations to jointly optimize scheduling and scaling under multiple SLOs. It features a multi-SLO-aware scheduler that leverages budget estimation and request prioritization to ensure proactive SLO compliance for both new and ongoing requests. The system supports prefill- and decode-stage multi-SLO scheduling for P/D-disaggregated architectures and KV cache transfers. It also enables cost-effective scaling decisions, prefill-decode instance linking during scaling, and rapid P/D role transitions. To accelerate scaling and reduce cold-start latency, a device-to-device (D2D) weight transfer mechanism is proposed that lowers weight loading overhead by up to \textbf{19.39$\times$}. These optimizations allow the system to achieve up to \textbf{4.44$\times$} higher SLO attainment, \textbf{65.82\%} lower request latency, and cost parity with state-of-the-art baselines. The code will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grzegorz Dudek, Witold Orzeszko, Piotr Fiszeder</p>
<p>Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are characterized by extreme volatility, making accurate forecasts essential for effective risk management and informed trading strategies. Traditional deterministic (point) forecasting methods are inadequate for capturing the full spectrum of potential volatility outcomes, underscoring the importance of probabilistic approaches. To address this limitation, this paper introduces probabilistic forecasting methods that leverage point forecasts from a wide range of base models, including statistical (HAR, GARCH, ARFIMA) and machine learning (e.g. LASSO, SVR, MLP, Random Forest, LSTM) algorithms, to estimate conditional quantiles of cryptocurrency realized variance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature to propose and systematically evaluate probabilistic forecasts of variance in cryptocurrency markets based on predictions derived from multiple base models. Our empirical results for Bitcoin demonstrate that the Quantile Estimation through Residual Simulation (QRS) method, particularly when applied to linear base models operating on log-transformed realized volatility data, consistently outperforms more sophisticated alternatives. Additionally, we highlight the robustness of the probabilistic stacking framework, providing comprehensive insights into uncertainty and risk inherent in cryptocurrency volatility forecasting. This research fills a significant gap in the literature, contributing practical probabilistic forecasting methodologies tailored specifically to cryptocurrency markets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in social science simulations. While their performance on reasoning and optimization tasks has been extensively evaluated, less attention has been paid to their ability to simulate human decision-making's variability and adaptability. We propose a process-oriented evaluation framework with progressive interventions (Intrinsicality, Instruction, and Imitation) to examine how LLM agents adapt under different levels of external guidance and human-derived noise. We validate the framework on two classic economics tasks, irrationality in the second-price auction and decision bias in the newsvendor problem, showing behavioral gaps between LLMs and humans.
  We find that LLMs, by default, converge on stable and conservative strategies that diverge from observed human behaviors. Risk-framed instructions impact LLM behavior predictably but do not replicate human-like diversity. Incorporating human data through in-context learning narrows the gap but fails to reach human subjects' strategic variability. These results highlight a persistent alignment gap in behavioral fidelity and suggest that future LLM evaluations should consider more process-level realism. We present a process-oriented approach for assessing LLMs in dynamic decision-making tasks, offering guidance for their application in synthetic data for social science research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Onur Alp Kirci, M. Emre Gursoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the integrity of text classification models used in natural language processing. While several dirty-label attacks that achieve high attack success rates (ASR) have been proposed, clean-label attacks are inherently more difficult. In this paper, we propose three sample selection strategies to improve attack effectiveness in clean-label scenarios: Minimum, Above50, and Below50. Our strategies identify those samples which the model predicts incorrectly or with low confidence, and by injecting backdoor triggers into such samples, we aim to induce a stronger association between the trigger patterns and the attacker-desired target label. We apply our methods to clean-label variants of four canonical backdoor attacks (InsertSent, WordInj, StyleBkd, SynBkd) and evaluate them on three datasets (IMDB, SST2, HateSpeech) and four model types (LSTM, BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa). Results show that the proposed strategies, particularly the Minimum strategy, significantly improve the ASR over random sample selection with little or no degradation in the model's clean accuracy. Furthermore, clean-label attacks enhanced by our strategies outperform BITE, a state of the art clean-label attack method, in many configurations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, enabling high-quality code generation from natural language descriptions. However, LLMs alone face significant limitations in real-world hardware design workflows, including the inability to execute code, lack of debugging capabilities, and absence of long-term memory. To address these challenges, we present ASIC-Agent, an autonomous system designed specifically for digital ASIC design tasks. ASIC-Agent enhances base LLMs with a multi-agent architecture incorporating specialized sub-agents for RTL generation, verification, OpenLane hardening, and Caravel chip integration, all operating within a comprehensive sandbox environment with access to essential hardware design tools. The system leverages a vector database containing documentation, API references, error knowledge, and curated insights from the open-source silicon community. To evaluate ASIC-Agent's performance, we introduce ASIC-Agent-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess agentic systems in hardware design tasks. We evaluate ASIC-Agent with various base LLMs, providing quantitative comparisons and qualitative insights into agent behavior across different design scenarios. Our results demonstrate that ASIC-Agent, when powered by Claude 4 Sonnet, successfully automates a broad range of ASIC design tasks spanning varying levels of complexity, showing the potential of significantly accelerating the ASIC design workflow.</p>

We analyze key properties of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.</p>

In fact, CNN can help with the monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images, making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks. For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation methods, may be more appropriate.

<p>Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers. To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset. This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saba Naqvi, Mohammad Baqar</p>
<p>Abstract: Software testing remains critical for ensuring reliability, yet traditional approaches are slow, costly, and prone to gaps in coverage. This paper presents an AI-driven framework that automates test case generation and validation using natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), and predictive models, embedded within a policy-driven trust and fairness model. The approach translates natural language requirements into executable tests, continuously optimizes them through learning, and validates outcomes with real-time analysis while mitigating bias. Case studies demonstrate measurable gains in defect detection, reduced testing effort, and faster release cycles, showing that AI-enhanced testing improves both efficiency and reliability. By addressing integration and scalability challenges, the framework illustrates how AI can shift testing from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, adaptive system that strengthens software quality in increasingly complex environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyue Song, Hansol Ku, Jayneel Vora, Nelson Lee, Ahmad Kamari, Prasant Mohapatra, Parth Pathak</p>
<p>Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse, noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Poorvi Joshi (National University of Singapore), Mohan Gurusamy (National University of Singapore)</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to time series classification using a Markov Transition Field (MTF)-aided Transformer model, specifically designed for Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). The proposed model integrates the temporal dependency modeling strengths of MTFs with the sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities of Transformer architectures. We evaluate the model's performance using the InSDN dataset, demonstrating that our model outperforms baseline classification models, particularly in data-constrained environments commonly encountered in SDN applications. We also highlight the relationship between the MTF and Transformer components, which leads to better performance, even with limited data. Furthermore, our approach achieves competitive training and inference times, making it an efficient solution for real-world SDN applications. These findings establish the potential of MTF-aided Transformers to address the challenges of time series classification in SDNs, offering a promising path for reliable and scalable analysis in scenarios with sparse data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renxuan Tan, Rongpeng Li, Xiaoxue Yu, Xianfu Chen, Xing Xu, Zhifeng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL, a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic (PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2% improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively, over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Cao, Xiaohui Zhong, Lei Chen, Zhiwei Wua, Hao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of tropical atmospheric variability on intraseasonal timescales, and reliable MJO predictions are essential for protecting lives and mitigating impacts on societal assets. However, numerical models still fall short of achieving the theoretical predictability limit for the MJO due to inherent constraints. In an effort to extend the skillful prediction window for the MJO, machine learning (ML) techniques have gained increasing attention. This study examines the MJO prediction performance of the FuXi subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) ML model during boreal winter, comparing it with the European Centre for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts S2S model. Results indicate that for the initial strong MJO phase 3, the FuXi-S2S model demonstrates reduced biases in intraseasonal outgoing longwave radiation anomalies averaged over the tropical western Pacific (WP) region during days 15-20, with the convective center located over this area. Analysis of multiscale interactions related to moisture transport suggests that improvements could be attributed to the FuXi-S2S model's more accurate prediction of the area-averaged meridional gradient of low-frequency background moisture over the tropical WP. These findings not only explain the enhanced predictive capability of the FuXi-S2S model but also highlight the potential of ML approaches in advancing the MJO forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rapha\"el Merx, Hanna Suominen, Trevor Cohn, Ekaterina Vylomova</p>
<p>Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978 documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages, of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahinthan Chandramohan, Jovan Jancic, Yuntong Zhang, Padmanabhan Krishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper describes our approach to automated program repair. We combine various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks. However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic defects that we see in industry.
  We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryogo Niwa, Shigeo Yoshida, Yuki Koyama, Yoshitaka Ushiku</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next. However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the optimization process, negatively impacting the designer's experience. We propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing cooperative method with lower cognitive load.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Zhou, Daniele Solombrino, Donato Crisostomi, Maria Sofia Bucarelli, Giuseppe Alessio D'Inverno, Fabrizio Silvestri, Emanuele Rodol\`a</p>
<p>Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one. Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory, demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in model merging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing}, SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive generative adversarial network (MSPG-SEN) for GAN models. This paper has four contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces the training cost of GAN networks. Our experimental results show that, MSPG-SEN has achieved state-of-the-art generation results on the following five datasets,INKK The dataset is 89.7\%,AWUN The dataset is 78.3\%,IONJ The dataset is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We propose an adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL), which effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow dynamic residual network(). After ablation experiments, it can effectively improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability, with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention mechanism (DEMA). After experiments, the attention can be extended to a variety of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local information, improve feature separation capability and feature expression capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK With strong cross-task capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao-Cheng Liao, Yi Mei, Mengjie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal control policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanming Shen, Hao Chen, Yulei Tang, Shaolin Zhu, Wentao Ye, Xiaomeng Hu, Haobo Wang, Gang Chen, Junbo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks, including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs, and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitao Lin, Zhen Yang, Jiawei Xue, Ziji Zhang, Luzhu Wang, Yikun Gu, Yao Xu, Xin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative Recommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the application of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation). However, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by spatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper, we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences, thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations. Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e., ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of millions of POIs and users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zoe Kotti, Konstantina Dritsa, Diomidis Spinellis, Panos Louridas</p>
<p>Abstract: Code completion entails the task of providing missing tokens given a surrounding context. It can boost developer productivity while providing a powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave, code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages, models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657 GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset. Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers, and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language, model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Wang, Haoyu Qiao, Lujun Li, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters, resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without significant performance loss.</p>

<p>Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency, environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in micromobilities. This survey paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal, and feature-based characteristics. In addition, we provide a detailed overview of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages, challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety, focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help future researchers better understand this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akira Oyama, Shoichi Hasegawa, Akira Taniguchi, Yoshinobu Hagiwara, Tadahiro Taniguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Daily life support robots must interpret ambiguous verbal instructions involving demonstratives such as ``Bring me that cup,'' even when objects or users are out of the robot's view. Existing approaches to exophora resolution primarily rely on visual data and thus fail in real-world scenarios where the object or user is not visible. We propose Multimodal Interactive Exophora resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal data. SSL is utilized to orient the robot toward users who are initially outside its visual field, enabling accurate identification of user gestures and pointing directions. When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts with the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments in a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times better when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the user was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and interactive questioning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhang, Zhenyu Liao, Jingfeng Wu, Difan Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models (DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers, ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pi-Wei Chen, Jerry Chun-Wei Lin, Wei-Han Chen, Jia Ji, Zih-Ching Chen, Feng-Hao Yeh, Chao-Chun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding. In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Ma, Guo-Sen Xie, Fang Zhao, Zechao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs, characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module. Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised (pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Li, Zezhi Shao, Chengqing Yu, Tangwen Qian, Zhao Zhang, Yifan Du, Shaoming He, Fei Wang, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Lubos, Alexander Felfernig, Gerhard Leitner, Julian Schwazer</p>
<p>Abstract: Usability describes a set of essential quality attributes of user interfaces (UI) that influence human-computer interaction. Common evaluation methods, such as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual, and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility, we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited expert resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxiong Zhang, Xin Zhou, Zhiwei Zeng, Yongjie Wang, Dusit Niyato, Zhiqi Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: MultiModal Recommendation (MMR) systems have emerged as a promising solution for improving recommendation quality by leveraging rich item-side modality information, prompting a surge of diverse methods. Despite these advances, existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw modality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior graph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and modality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second, they use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a fixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of modality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA. First, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by incorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from representations generated by a pretrained MMR model. This enables the graph to capture both collaborative patterns and modality aware similarities with enhanced robustness against modality noise. Moreover, it introduces a novel bi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism to improve modality-behavior representation alignment, which dynamically assigns alignment strength across entities according to their alignment degree, while gradually increasing the overall alignment intensity throughout training. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that EGRA significantly outperforms recent methods, confirming its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jamal Hwaidi, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that enables direct communication between the human body and an external device. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition. Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and classification of MI-EEG.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cross-organizational collaboration in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) faces many challenges in achieving semantic alignment across independently developed system models. SysML v2 introduces enhanced structural modularity and formal semantics, offering a stronger foundation for interoperable modeling. Meanwhile, GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new capabilities for assisting model understanding and integration. This paper proposes a structured, prompt-driven approach for LLM-assisted semantic alignment of SysML v2 models. The core contribution lies in the iterative development of an alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction, semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an example of a measurement system. Benefits and limitations are discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aparna Singh, Geetanjali Rathee, Chaker Abdelaziz Kerrache, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: The very high growth of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has generated an urgent requirement for secure, effective, and context-aware data sharing mechanisms, especially over heterogeneous and geographically dispersed settings. This work suggests a new architecture that combines a relay chain-driven encryption system with a modified Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme to tackle the double impediment of dynamic access and low-latency communication. The model proposes a context-aware smart contract on a worldwide relay chain that checks against data properties, including event type, time, and geographical region, to specify the suitable level of encryption policy. From such relay-directed judgment, On-Board Units (OBUs) encrypt data end-to-end by utilising CP-ABE and store ciphertext inside localised regional blockchains, preventing dependence on symmetric encryption or off-chain storage. High-sensitivity events are secured with firm, multi-attribute access rules, whereas common updates use light policies to help reduce processing burdens. The crypto system also adds traceability and low-latency revocation, with global enforcement managed through the relay chain. This distributed, scalable model provides a proper balance between responsiveness in real time and security and is extremely apt for next-gen vehicular networks that function across multi-jurisdictional domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mika Leo Hube, Filip Lemic, Ethungshan Shitiri, Gerard Calvo Bartra, Sergi Abadal, Xavier Costa P\'erez</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations. Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets, enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models, including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels, and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust and scalable nanoscale localization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Ji, Jun Zhang, Heming Xia, Jinpeng Chen, Lidan Shou, Gang Chen, Huan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD) framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning. Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens, enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this, it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner. Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$ decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for Qwen2.5-VL-32B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanpeng Chu, Wei Wu, Guanyu Fen, Yutao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision, powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications. These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification, autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts, noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Chen, Zhiyong Ma, Wenbiao Du, Qingyuan Chuai</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles. Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work, we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover, to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results, demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands, enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum. Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions, and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge. Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use. MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale), revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex, real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alina Fastowski, Bardh Prenkaj, Gjergji Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics, often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahya Badran, Christine Preisach</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems, typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing (KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete, error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes within a simulated student environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman, Devraj Raghuvanshi, Umang Jain, Shubhi Bansal, Nagendra Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal representations, especially when these representations are obtained through explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities. To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities, reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA) to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Maisonnave, Karim Haroun, Tom Pegeot</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongyeop Hyun, Bumsoo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Selen Gecgel Cetin, Tolga Ovatman, Gunes Karabulut Kurt</p>
<p>Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods, and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively address complex threat scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darpan Aswal, C\'eline Hudelot</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications; however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces \textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers. Code will be released upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueyao Zhang, Junan Zhang, Yuancheng Wang, Chaoren Wang, Yuanzhe Chen, Dongya Jia, Zhuo Chen, Zhizheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Controllable human voice generation, particularly for expressive domains like singing, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Vevo2, a unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To tackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable flexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a music-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from speech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5 Hz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style for both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2 consists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to enable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a flow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control. Particularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and implicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice. Moreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody, we design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both intelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show that the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and singing voice generation. Additionally, Vevo2's effectiveness across a wide range of synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both speech and singing further demonstrates its strong generalization ability and versatility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Li, Kleanthis Malialis, Stelios G. Vrachimis, Marios M. Polycarpou</p>
<p>Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages, modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Uppaal Coshy, a tool for automatic synthesis of a safety strategy -- or shield -- for Markov decision processes over continuous state spaces and complex hybrid dynamics. The general methodology is to partition the state space and then solve a two-player safety game, which entails a number of algorithmically hard problems such as reachability for hybrid systems. The general philosophy of Uppaal Coshy is to approximate hard-to-obtain solutions using simulations. Our implementation is fully automatic and supports the expressive formalism of Uppaal models, which encompass stochastic hybrid automata. The precision of our partition-based approach benefits from using finer grids, which however are not efficient to store. We include an algorithm called Caap to efficiently compute a compact representation of a shield in the form of a decision tree, which yields significant reductions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yan, Sheng Sun, Zhe Wang, Yijun Lin, Zenghao Duan, zhifei zheng, Min Liu, Zhiyi yin, Jianping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous efforts have revealed their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Although these studies have driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\&A to investigate the misuse threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan, meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ana-Cristina Rogoz, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Alexandra-Valentina Anghel, Ionut-Lucian Antone-Iordache, Simona Coniac, Andreea Iuliana Ionescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce MedQARo, the first large-scale medical QA benchmark in Romanian, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. MedQARo is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment with four LLMs from distinct families of models on MedQARo. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that pretrained models fail to generalize on MedQARo. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for reliable clinical QA in Romanian.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruian Tie, Xiaohui Zhong, Zhengyu Shi, Hao Li, Jun Liu, Wu Libo</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate change is exacerbating extreme weather events globally, including high temperatures, extreme precipitation, strong winds, and tropical cyclones, posing severe threats to human health, infrastructure, food security, and socio-economic systems. Although existing global climate models (GCMs) provide essential tools for climate prediction, they face limitations such as insufficient resolution and high computational costs when simulating extreme events. To address these issues, this study proposes a spatiotemporal downscaling model based on generative machine learning-the Domain Aligned Climate Downscaling model (DACD), designed to enhance the simulation capabilities for extreme weather events. The proposed model employs domain adaptation tricks and a Flow Matching training framework to transform global low-resolution climate data into high-resolution local-scale climate information while achieving precise simulation of multivariable and temporal scales. The results show that during the historical period (2005-2014), our model outperformed existing methods in simulating high temperatures, extreme precipitation, strong wind, and tropical cyclone tracks, significantly reducing errors and improving the ability to capture extreme events. Under different future scenarios (2015-2100), the model reveals a significant increasing trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, particularly under the high-emission scenario (SSP585). Compared to traditional methods, our model more accurately simulates the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of extreme events, providing an essential tool for understanding the impacts of climate change. This study offers a new technological pathway for high-resolution climate analysis and extreme event prediction, providing scientific support for addressing future climate change and formulating adaptation strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Zhang, Cunjian Chen, Qiang Gao, Yi Wang, Bin Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However, these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI) modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters. Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect detection.

<p>Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories, including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and assessment of LLMs in Turkish.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2) Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge. Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM) decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design. Code is available at https://github.com/Ameame1/OPERA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support. However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias, compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067 vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256 anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI support in pediatric care.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen object categories.</p>

<p>Abstract: Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However, existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics. Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Udvas Das, Apurv Shukla, Debabrota Basu</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given) preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied, there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with $K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE, asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set among the existing algorithms.</p>

In this paper, we present SafeSpace, a unified web application that integrates three modules: (1) toxicity detection in chats and screenshots using NLP models and Google's Perspective API, (2) a configurable safety ping system that issues emergency alerts with the user's live location (longitude and latitude) via SMTP-based emails when check-ins are missed or SOS alerts are manually triggered, and (3) a reflective questionnaire that evaluates relationship health and emotional resilience. The system employs Firebase for alert management and a modular architecture designed for usability, privacy, and scalability. The experimental evaluation shows 93% precision in toxicity detection, 100% reliability in safety alerts under emulator tests, and 92% alignment between automated and manual questionnaire scoring. SafeSpace, implemented as a web application, demonstrates the feasibility of integrating detection, protection, and reflection within a single platform, with future deployment envisioned as a mobile application for broader accessibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Tirta Wijaya, Michael Sun, Minghao Guo, Hans-Peter Seidel, Wojciech Matusik, Vahid Babaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task, RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in low-data settings.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16496">On Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Scott Jeen</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general, human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply, these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parker Seegmiller, Kartik Mehta, Soumya Saha, Chenyang Tao, Shereen Oraby, Arpit Gupta, Tagyoung Chung, Mohit Bansal, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems. To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments, we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies, outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5), GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hichem Cheriet, Khellat Kihel Badra, Chouraqui Samira</p>
<p>Abstract: The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes, different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to finding solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijian Zhou, Junyi An, Zongkai Liu, Yunfei Shi, Xuan Zhang, Fenglei Cao, Chao Qu, Yuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models. Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhijianZhou/RLPF/tree/verl_diffusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed, increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection (OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection, zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangzhan Jin, Sicheng Lv, Sifan Wu, Mohammad Hamdaqa</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to 15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2) Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top 20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4) Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners can use before costly RL fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces the Enhanced NIRMAL (Novel Integrated Robust Multi-Adaptation Learning with Damped Nesterov Acceleration) optimizer, an improved version of the original NIRMAL optimizer. By incorporating an $(\alpha, r)$-damped Nesterov acceleration mechanism, Enhanced NIRMAL improves convergence stability while retaining chess-inspired strategies of gradient descent, momentum, stochastic perturbations, adaptive learning rates, and non-linear transformations.
  We evaluate Enhanced NIRMAL against Adam, SGD with Momentum, Nesterov, and the original NIRMAL on four benchmark image classification datasets: MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, using tailored convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.
  Enhanced NIRMAL achieves a test accuracy of 46.06\% and the lowest test loss (1.960435) on CIFAR-100, surpassing the original NIRMAL (44.34\% accuracy) and closely rivaling SGD with Momentum (46.43\% accuracy). These results underscore Enhanced NIRMAL's superior generalization and stability, particularly on complex datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tainyi Zhang, Zheng-Peng Duan, Peng-Tao Jiang, Bo Li, Ming-Ming Cheng, Chun-Le Guo, Chongyi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder, which projects the same image into different latent features based on timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features, the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results with only a single step.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Chanin, Adri\`a Garriga-Alonso</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations, meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.</p>

<p>Abstract: The non-invasive assessment of increasingly incidentally discovered renal masses is a critical challenge in urologic oncology, where diagnostic uncertainty frequently leads to the overtreatment of benign or indolent tumors. In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866 CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726, representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous navigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a scalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex, real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs. Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections. This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts. Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Since the earliest proposals for artificial neural network (ANN) models of the mind and brain, critics have pointed out key weaknesses in these models compared to human cognitive abilities. Here we review recent work that uses metalearning to overcome several classic challenges, which we characterise as addressing the Problem of Incentive and Practice -- that is, providing machines with both incentives to improve specific skills and opportunities to practice those skills. This explicit optimization contrasts with more conventional approaches that hope the desired behaviour will emerge through optimising related but different objectives. We review applications of this principle to addressing four classic challenges for ANNs: systematic generalisation, catastrophic forgetting, few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning. We also discuss how large language models incorporate key aspects of this metalearning framework (namely, sequence prediction with feedback trained on diverse data), which helps to explain some of their successes on these classic challenges. Finally, we discuss the prospects for understanding aspects of human development through this framework, and whether natural environments provide the right incentives and practice for learning how to make challenging generalisations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulan Hu, Sheng Ouyang, Jinman Zhao, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Process Reward Model (PRM) plays a crucial role in mathematical reasoning tasks, requiring high-quality supervised process data. However, we observe that reasoning steps generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to exhibit strictly incremental information, leading to redundancy that can hinder effective reasoning. To address this issue, we propose CFPRM, a simple yet effective coarse-to-fine strategy. Instead of focusing on the detection of redundant steps, our approach first establishes a coarse-grained window to merge adjacent reasoning steps into unified, holistic steps. The window size is then progressively reduced to extract fine-grained reasoning steps, enabling data collection at multiple granularities for training. By leveraging this hierarchical refinement process, CFPRM mitigates redundancy while preserving essential fine-grained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two reasoning datasets across three loss criteria validate the CFPRM's effectiveness and versatility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Callewaert, Simon Vandevelde, Joost Vennekens</p>
<p>Abstract: A recent approach to neurosymbolic reasoning is to explicitly combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and symbolic solvers to tackle complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems</p>

Existing methods primarily aim to shorten reasoning paths by introducing additional training data and stages.

Experiments on four settings show that our method significantly decreases response length while maintaining or even improving performance. Specifically, in a logic reasoning setting, we achieve a 40% reduction in response length averaged by steps alongside a 14% gain in performance. For math problems, we reduce response length averaged by steps by 33% while preserving performance.</p>

The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena) construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis. Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed analysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beinuo Yang, Qishen Zhou, Junyi Li, Chenxing Su, Simon Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations: high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42%, narrow evaluation scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes, providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Lutz, Daniil Kaminskyi, Florian Wittbold, Simon Dierl, Falk Howar, Barbara K\"onig, Emmanuel M\"uller, Daniel Neider</p>
<p>Abstract: Automata learning is a successful tool for many application domains such as robotics and automatic verification. Typically, automata learning techniques operate in a supervised learning setting (active or passive) where they learn a finite state machine in contexts where additional information, such as labeled system executions, is available. However, other settings, such as learning from unlabeled data - an important aspect in machine learning - remain unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework for learning a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a given multi-set of unlabeled words. We show that this problem is computationally hard and develop three learning algorithms based on constraint optimization. Moreover, we introduce novel regularization schemes for our optimization problems that improve the overall interpretability of our DFAs. Using a prototype implementation, we demonstrate practical feasibility in the context of unsupervised anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Deng, Zifeng Ren, An Zhang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) enhance traditional ITSs by promoting effective learning through interactions and problem resolution in online education. Yet, proactive engagement, prioritizing resource optimization with planning and assessment capabilities, is often overlooked in current ITS designs. In this work, we investigate a new task, named Goal-oriented Intelligent Tutoring Systems (GITS), which aims to enable the student's mastery of a designated concept by strategically planning a customized sequence of exercises and assessment. To address the problem of goal-oriented policy learning in GITS, we propose a novel graph-based reinforcement learning framework, named Planning-Assessment-Interaction (PAI). Specifically, we first leverage cognitive structure information to improve state representation learning and action selection for planning the next action, which can be either to tutor an exercise or to assess the target concept. Further, we use a dynamically updated cognitive diagnosis model to simulate student responses to exercises and concepts. Three benchmark datasets across different subjects are constructed for enabling offline academic research on GITS. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PAI and extensive analyses of various types of students are conducted to showcase the challenges in this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Chakraborty, Christian Wirth, Christin Seifert</p>
<p>Abstract: Manual parameter tuning of cyber-physical systems is a common practice, but it is labor-intensive. Bayesian Optimization (BO) offers an automated alternative, yet its black-box nature reduces trust and limits human-BO collaborative system tuning. Experts struggle to interpret BO recommendations due to the lack of explanations. This paper addresses the post-hoc BO explainability problem for cyber-physical systems. We introduce TNTRules (Tune-No-Tune Rules), a novel algorithm that provides both global and local explanations for BO recommendations. TNTRules generates actionable rules and visual graphs, identifying optimal solution bounds and ranges, as well as potential alternative solutions. Unlike existing explainable AI (XAI) methods, TNTRules is tailored specifically for BO, by encoding uncertainty via a variance pruning technique and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. A multi-objective optimization approach allows maximizing explanation quality. We evaluate TNTRules using established XAI metrics (Correctness, Completeness, and Compactness) and compare it against adapted baseline methods. The results demonstrate that TNTRules generates high-fidelity, compact, and complete explanations, significantly outperforming three baselines on 5 multi-objective testing functions and 2 hyperparameter tuning problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonid Boytsov, Ameya Joshi, Filipe Condessa</p>
<p>Abstract: We experimented with front-end enhanced neural models where a differentiable and fully convolutional model with a skip connection is added before a frozen backbone classifier. By training such composite models using a small learning rate for about one epoch, we obtained models that retained the accuracy of the backbone classifier while being unusually resistant to gradient attacks-including APGD and FAB-T attacks from the AutoAttack package-which we attribute to gradient masking. Although gradient masking is not new, the degree we observe is striking for fully differentiable models without obvious gradient-shattering-e.g., JPEG compression-or gradient-diminishing components.
  The training recipe to produce such models is also remarkably stable and reproducible: We applied it to three datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet) and several modern architectures (including vision Transformers) without a single failure case. While black-box attacks such as the SQUARE attack and zero-order PGD can partially overcome gradient masking, these attacks are easily defeated by simple randomized ensembles. We estimate that these ensembles achieve near-SOTA AutoAttack accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet (while retaining almost all clean accuracy of the original classifiers) despite having near-zero accuracy under adaptive attacks.
  Adversarially training the backbone further amplifies this front-end "robustness". On CIFAR10, the respective randomized ensemble achieved 90.8$\pm 2.5\%$ (99\% CI) accuracy under the full AutoAttack while having only 18.2$\pm 3.6\%$ accuracy under the adaptive attack ($\varepsilon=8/255$, $L^\infty$ norm). We conclude the paper with a discussion of whether randomized ensembling can serve as a practical defense.

<p>Abstract: The field of deep generative modeling has grown rapidly in the last few years. With the availability of massive amounts of training data coupled with advances in scalable unsupervised learning paradigms, recent large-scale generative models show tremendous promise in synthesizing high-resolution images and text, as well as structured data such as videos and molecules. However, we argue that current large-scale generative AI models exhibit several fundamental shortcomings that hinder their widespread adoption across domains. In this work, our objective is to identify these issues and highlight key unresolved challenges in modern generative AI paradigms that should be addressed to further enhance their capabilities, versatility, and reliability. By identifying these challenges, we aim to provide researchers with insights for exploring fruitful research directions, thus fostering the development of more robust and accessible generative AI solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning to sample from intractable distributions over discrete sets without relying on corresponding training data is a central problem in a wide range of fields, including Combinatorial Optimization. Currently, popular deep learning-based approaches rely primarily on generative models that yield exact sample likelihoods. This work introduces a method that lifts this restriction and opens the possibility to employ highly expressive latent variable models like diffusion models. Our approach is conceptually based on a loss that upper bounds the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and evades the requirement of exact sample likelihoods. We experimentally validate our approach in data-free Combinatorial Optimization and demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Hu, Bowen Song, Xiaojian Xu, Liyue Shen, Jeffrey A. Fessler</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models can learn strong image priors from underlying data distribution and use them to solve inverse problems, but the training process is computationally expensive and requires lots of data. Such bottlenecks prevent most existing works from being feasible for high-dimensional and high-resolution data such as 3D images. This paper proposes a method to learn an efficient data prior for the entire image by training diffusion models only on patches of images. Specifically, we propose a patch-based position-aware diffusion inverse solver, called PaDIS, where we obtain the score function of the whole image through scores of patches and their positional encoding and utilize this as the prior for solving inverse problems. First of all, we show that this diffusion model achieves an improved memory efficiency and data efficiency while still maintaining the capability to generate entire images via positional encoding. Additionally, the proposed PaDIS model is highly flexible and can be plugged in with different diffusion inverse solvers (DIS). We demonstrate that the proposed PaDIS approach enables solving various inverse problems in both natural and medical image domains, including CT reconstruction, deblurring, and superresolution, given only patch-based priors. Notably, PaDIS outperforms previous DIS methods trained on entire image priors in the case of limited training data, demonstrating the data efficiency of our proposed approach by learning patch-based prior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Khai Le-Duc, Bach Phan Tat, Duy Le, Long Vo-Dang, Truong-Son Hy</p>
<p>Abstract: Transparency in AI healthcare decision-making is crucial. By incorporating rationales to explain reason for each predicted label, users could understand Large Language Models (LLMs)'s reasoning to make better decision. In this work, we introduce a new task - Sentiment Reasoning - for both speech and text modalities, and our proposed multimodal multitask framework and the world's largest multimodal sentiment analysis dataset. Sentiment Reasoning is an auxiliary task in sentiment analysis where the model predicts both the sentiment label and generates the rationale behind it based on the input transcript. Our study conducted on both human transcripts and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts shows that Sentiment Reasoning helps improve model transparency by providing rationale for model prediction with quality semantically comparable to humans while also improving model's classification performance (+2% increase in both accuracy and macro-F1) via rationale-augmented fine-tuning. Also, no significant difference in the semantic quality of generated rationales between human and ASR transcripts. All code, data (five languages - Vietnamese, English, Chinese, German, and French) and models are published online: https://github.com/leduckhai/Sentiment-Reasoning</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyu Gong, Gefei Shen, Luanzheng Guo, Nathan Tallent, Dongfang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Searching for the $k$-nearest neighbors (KNN) in multimodal data retrieval is computationally expensive, particularly due to the inherent difficulty in comparing similarity measures across different modalities. Recent advances in multimodal machine learning address this issue by mapping data into a shared embedding space; however, the high dimensionality of these embeddings (hundreds to thousands of dimensions) presents a challenge for time-sensitive vision applications. This work proposes Order-Preserving Dimension Reduction (OPDR), aiming to reduce the dimensionality of embeddings while preserving the ranking of KNN in the lower-dimensional space. One notable component of OPDR is a new measure function to quantify KNN quality as a global metric, based on which we derive a closed-form map between target dimensionality and key contextual parameters. We have integrated OPDR with multiple state-of-the-art dimension-reduction techniques, distance functions, and embedding models; experiments on a variety of multimodal datasets demonstrate that OPDR effectively retains recall high accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shresth Verma, Niclas Boehmer, Lingkai Kong, Milind Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI has shown its values for many software engineering tasks. Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many domains now employ AI-based decision-making aids, and although the potential for AI systems to assist with decision making is much discussed, human-AI collaboration often underperforms due to factors such as (mis)trust in the AI system and beliefs about AI being incapable of completing subjective tasks. One potential tool for influencing human decision making is performance pressure, which hasn't been much studied in interaction with human-AI decision making. In this work, we examine how pressure and explainable AI (XAI) techniques interact with AI advice-taking behavior. Using an inherently low-stakes task (spam review classification), we demonstrate effective and simple methods to apply pressure and influence human AI advice-taking behavior by manipulating financial incentives and imposing time limits. Our results show complex interaction effects, with different combinations of pressure and XAI techniques either improving or worsening AI advice taking behavior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these interactions, strategies to effectively use pressure, and encourage future research to incorporate pressure analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomer Barak, Yonatan Loewenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: When individuals encounter observations that violate their expectations, when will they adjust their expectations and when will they maintain them despite these observations? For example, when individuals expect objects of type A to be smaller than objects B, but observe the opposite, when will they adjust their expectation about the relationship between the two objects (to A being larger than B)? Naively, one would predict that the larger the violation, the greater the adaptation. However, experiments reveal that when violations are extreme, individuals are more likely to hold on to their prior expectations rather than adjust them. To address this puzzle, we tested the adaptation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of relational learning and found a similar phenomenon: Standard learning dynamics dictates that small violations would lead to adjustments of expected relations while larger ones would be resolved using a different mechanism -- a change in object representation that bypasses the need for adaptation of the relational expectations. These results suggest that the experimentally-observed stability of prior expectations when facing large expectation violations is a natural consequence of learning dynamics and does not require any additional mechanisms. We conclude by discussing the effect of intermediate adaptation steps on this stability.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop task scaling laws and model ladders to predict the individual task performance of pretrained language models (LMs) in the overtrained setting. Standard power laws for language modeling loss cannot accurately model task performance. Therefore, we leverage a two-step prediction approach: (1) use model and data size to predict an intermediate loss, then (2) use it to predict task performance. We train a set of small-scale "ladder" models, collect data points to fit the parameterized functions of the two prediction steps, and make predictions for two target models: a 7B model trained to 4T tokens and a 13B model trained to 5T tokens. Training the ladder models only costs 1% of the compute used for the target models. On four multiple-choice tasks formatted as ranked classification, we can predict the accuracy of both target models within 2 points of absolute error. We find that tasks with higher prediction error also have higher variance in the metrics over model checkpoints. We also contrast multiple design choices for predicting accuracy, and present recommendations for extending our method to new models and tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Today's generative AI systems are tuned to present information by default, rather than engage users in service of learning as a human tutor would. To address the wide range of potential education use cases for these systems, we reframe the challenge of injecting pedagogical behavior as one of \textit{pedagogical instruction following}, where training and evaluation examples include system-level instructions describing the specific pedagogy attributes present or desired in subsequent model turns. This framing avoids committing our models to any particular definition of pedagogy, and instead allows teachers or developers to specify desired model behavior. It also clears a path to improving Gemini models for learning -- by enabling the addition of our pedagogical data to post-training mixtures -- alongside their rapidly expanding set of capabilities. Both represent important changes from our initial tech report. We show how training with pedagogical instruction following produces a LearnLM model (available on Google AI Studio) that experts substantially prefer across a diverse set of learning scenarios, with average preference strengths of +31\% over GPT-4o, +11\% over Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and +13\% over the Gemini 1.5 Pro model on which LearnLM was based.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present methods and applications for the development of digital twins (DT) for urban traffic management. While the majority of studies on the DT focus on its ``eyes," which is the emerging sensing and perception like object detection and tracking, what really distinguishes the DT from a traditional simulator lies in its ``brain," the prediction and decision making capabilities of extracting patterns and making informed decisions from what has been seen and perceived. In order to add value to urban transportation management, DTs need to be powered by artificial intelligence and complement with low-latency high-bandwidth sensing and networking technologies, in other words, cyberphysical systems (CPS). We will first review the DT pipeline enabled by CPS and propose our DT architecture deployed on a real-world testbed in New York City. This paper can be a pointer to help researchers and practitioners identify challenges and opportunities for the development of DTs; a bridge to initiate conversations across disciplines; and a road map to exploiting potentials of DTs for diverse urban transportation applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuzhou Yuan, Zhan Qu, Ashish Yashwanth Kangen, Michael F\"arber</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), plausible but factually inaccurate text, are often viewed as undesirable. However, recent work suggests that such outputs may hold creative potential. In this paper, we investigate whether hallucinations can improve LLMs on molecule property prediction, a key task in early-stage drug discovery. We prompt LLMs to generate natural language descriptions from molecular SMILES strings and incorporate these often hallucinated descriptions into downstream classification tasks. Evaluating seven instruction-tuned LLMs across five datasets, we find that hallucinations significantly improve predictive accuracy for some models. Notably, Falcon3-Mamba-7B outperforms all baselines when hallucinated text is included, while hallucinations generated by GPT-4o consistently yield the greatest gains between models. We further identify and categorize over 18,000 beneficial hallucinations, with structural misdescriptions emerging as the most impactful type, suggesting that hallucinated statements about molecular structure may increase model confidence. Ablation studies show that larger models benefit more from hallucinations, while temperature has a limited effect. Our findings challenge conventional views of hallucination as purely problematic and suggest new directions for leveraging hallucinations as a useful signal in scientific modeling tasks like drug discovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: [Context] Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have transformed numerous domains by enhancing convenience and efficiency in information retrieval, content generation, and decision-making processes. However, deploying LLMs also presents diverse ethical challenges, and their mitigation strategies remain complex and domain-dependent. [Objective] This paper aims to identify and categorize the key ethical concerns associated with using LLMs, examine existing mitigation strategies, and assess the outstanding challenges in implementing these strategies across various domains. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study, reviewing 39 studies that discuss ethical concerns and mitigation strategies related to LLMs. We analyzed these ethical concerns using five ethical dimensions that we extracted based on various existing guidelines, frameworks, and an analysis of the mitigation strategies and implementation challenges. [Results] Our findings reveal that ethical concerns in LLMs are multi-dimensional and context-dependent. While proposed mitigation strategies address some of these concerns, significant challenges still remain. [Conclusion] Our results highlight that ethical issues often hinder the practical implementation of the mitigation strategies, particularly in high-stake areas like healthcare and public governance; existing frameworks often lack adaptability, failing to accommodate evolving societal expectations and diverse contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyang Zhao, Haoxian Chen, Ji Zhang, David D. Yao, Wenpin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which aligns a diffusion model with input prompt, has become a crucial step in building reliable generative AI models. Most works in this area use a discrete-time formulation, which is prone to induced discretization errors, and often not applicable to models with higher-order/black-box solvers. The objective of this study is to develop a disciplined approach to fine-tune diffusion models using continuous-time RL, formulated as a stochastic control problem with a reward function that aligns the end result (terminal state) with input prompt. The key idea is to treat score matching as controls or actions, and thereby making connections to policy optimization and regularization in continuous-time RL. To carry out this idea, we lay out a new policy optimization framework for continuous-time RL, and illustrate its potential in enhancing the value networks design space via leveraging the structural property of diffusion models. We validate the advantages of our method by experiments in downstream tasks of fine-tuning large-scale Text2Image models of Stable Diffusion v1.5.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhao Liao, Weihang Xia, Yuhong Cao, Weiheng Dai, Chengyang He, Wenjun Wu, Guillaume Sartoretti</p>
<p>Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem aims to determine the shortest and collision-free paths for multiple agents in a known, potentially obstacle-ridden environment. It is the core challenge for robotic deployments in large-scale logistics and transportation. Decentralized learning-based approaches have shown great potential for addressing the MAPF problems, offering more reactive and scalable solutions. However, existing learning-based MAPF methods usually rely on agents making decisions based on a limited field of view (FOV), resulting in short-sighted policies and inefficient cooperation in complex scenarios. There, a critical challenge is to achieve consensus on potential movements between agents based on limited observations and communications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new framework that applies sheaf theory to decentralized deep reinforcement learning, enabling agents to learn geometric cross-dependencies between each other through local consensus and utilize them for tightly cooperative decision-making. In particular, sheaf theory provides a mathematical proof of conditions for achieving global consensus through local observation. Inspired by this, we incorporate a neural network to approximately model the consensus in latent space based on sheaf theory and train it through self-supervised learning. During the task, in addition to normal features for MAPF as in previous works, each agent distributedly reasons about a learned consensus feature, leading to efficient cooperation on pathfinding and collision avoidance. As a result, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art learning-based MAPF planners, especially in relatively large and complex scenarios, demonstrating its superiority over baselines in various simulations and real-world robot experiments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Berestizshevsky, Renzo Andri, Lukas Cavigelli</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Top-Theta (Top-$\theta$) Attention, a training-free method for sparsifying transformer attention during inference. Our key insight is that static, per-head thresholds can be calibrated to retain the desired constant number of significant elements per attention row. This approach enables content-based sparsity without retraining, and it remains robust across data domains. We further introduce compensation techniques to preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsification, establishing attention thresholding as a practical and principled alternative to top-k attention. We provide extensive evaluation on natural language processing tasks, showing that Top-$\theta$ achieves 3-10x reduction in V-cache usage and up to 10x fewer attention elements during inference while degrading no more than 1% in accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinghui Li, Jiayi Kuang, Haojing Huang, Zhikun Xu, Xinnian Liang, Yi Yu, Wenlian Lu, Yangning Li, Xiaoyu Tan, Chao Qu, Ying Shen, Hai-Tao Zheng, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging mathematical Large Language Models (LLMs) for proof generation is a fundamental topic in LLMs research. We argue that the ability of current LLMs to prove statements largely depends on whether they have encountered the relevant proof process during training. This reliance limits their deeper understanding of mathematical theorems and related concepts. Inspired by the pedagogical method of "proof by counterexamples" commonly used in human mathematics education, our work aims to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct mathematical reasoning and proof through counterexamples. Specifically, we manually create a high-quality, university-level mathematical benchmark, CounterMATH, which requires LLMs to prove mathematical statements by providing counterexamples, thereby assessing their grasp of mathematical concepts. Additionally, we develop a data engineering framework to automatically obtain training data for further model improvement. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses demonstrate that CounterMATH is challenging, indicating that LLMs, such as OpenAI o1, have insufficient counterexample-driven proof capabilities. Moreover, our exploration into model training reveals that strengthening LLMs' counterexample-driven conceptual reasoning abilities is crucial for improving their overall mathematical capabilities. We believe that our work offers new perspectives on the community of mathematical LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somnath Banerjee, Sayan Layek, Pratyush Chatterjee, Animesh Mukherjee, Rima Hazra</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring consistent safety across multiple languages remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). We introduce Soteria, a lightweight yet powerful strategy that locates and minimally adjusts the "functional heads" most responsible for harmful content generation in each language. By altering only a fraction of parameters, Soteria drastically reduces policy violations without sacrificing overall model performance, even in low-resource settings. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we also present XThreatBench, a specialized multilingual dataset capturing fine-grained harmful behaviors drawn from real policy guidelines. Experiments with leading open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama, Qwen, Mistral) show that Soteria consistently improves safety metrics across high-, mid-, and low-resource languages. These findings highlight a promising path toward scalable, linguistically attuned, and ethically aligned LLMs worldwide.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Zhang, Zhiyu Zhu, Xinyi Wang, Silin Liao, Zhibo Jin, Flora D. Salim, Huaming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can lead to erroneous predictions. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can leverage the generators and discriminators model to quickly produce high-quality adversarial examples. Since both modules train in a competitive and simultaneous manner, GAN-based algorithms like AdvGAN can generate adversarial examples with better transferability compared to traditional methods. However, the generation of perturbations is usually limited to a single iteration, preventing these examples from fully exploiting the potential of the methods. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel approach named Progressive Auto-Regression AdvGAN (PAR-AdvGAN). It incorporates an auto-regressive iteration mechanism within a progressive generation network to craft adversarial examples with enhanced attack capability. We thoroughly evaluate our PAR-AdvGAN method with a large-scale experiment, demonstrating its superior performance over various state-of-the-art black-box adversarial attacks, as well as the original AdvGAN.Moreover, PAR-AdvGAN significantly accelerates the adversarial example generation, i.e., achieving the speeds of up to 335.5 frames per second on Inception-v3 model, outperforming the gradient-based transferable attack algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yan, Sheng Sun, Zixiang Tang, Teli Liu, Min Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Stance detection on social media aims to identify attitudes expressed in tweets towards specific targets. Current studies prioritize Large Language Models (LLMs) over Small Language Models (SLMs) due to the overwhelming performance improving provided by LLMs. However, heavily relying on LLMs for stance detection, regardless of the cost, is impractical for real-world social media monitoring systems that require vast data analysis. To this end, we propose \textbf{\underline{Co}}llaborative Stance Detection via Small-Large Language Model Consistency \textbf{\underline{Ver}}ification (\textbf{CoVer}) framework, which enhances LLM utilization via context-shared batch reasoning and logical verification between LLM and SLM. Specifically, instead of processing each text individually, CoVer processes texts batch-by-batch, obtaining stance predictions and corresponding explanations via LLM reasoning in a shared context. Then, to exclude the bias caused by context noises, CoVer introduces the SLM for logical consistency verification. Finally, texts that repeatedly exhibit low logical consistency are classified using consistency-weighted aggregation of prior LLM stance predictions. Our experiments show that CoVer outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks in the zero-shot setting, achieving 0.54 LLM queries per tweet while significantly enhancing performance. Our CoVer offers a more practical solution for LLM deploying for social media stance detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yan, Sheng Sun, Zenghao Duan, Teli Liu, Min Liu, Zhiyi Yin, Jiangyu Lei, Qi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Current studies have exposed the risk of Large Language Models (LLMs) generating harmful content by jailbreak attacks. However, they overlook that the direct generation of harmful content from scratch is more difficult than inducing LLM to calibrate benign content into harmful forms. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits AdVersArial meTAphoR (AVATAR) to induce the LLM to calibrate malicious metaphors for jailbreaking. Specifically, to answer harmful queries, AVATAR adaptively identifies a set of benign but logically related metaphors as the initial seed. Then, driven by these metaphors, the target LLM is induced to reason and calibrate about the metaphorical content, thus jailbroken by either directly outputting harmful responses or calibrating residuals between metaphorical and professional harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferable jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wang, Jacek Pawlak, Aruna Sivakumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Stated preference (SP) surveys are a key method to research how individuals make trade-offs in hypothetical, also futuristic, scenarios. In energy context this includes key decarbonisation enablement contexts, such as low-carbon technologies, distributed renewable energy generation, and demand-side response [1,2]. However, they tend to be costly, time-consuming, and can be affected by respondent fatigue and ethical constraints. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like textual responses, prompting growing interest in their application to survey research. This study investigates the use of LLMs to simulate consumer choices in energy-related SP surveys and explores their integration into data analysis workflows. A series of test scenarios were designed to systematically assess the simulation performance of several LLMs (LLaMA 3.1, Mistral, GPT-3.5 and DeepSeek-R1) at both individual and aggregated levels, considering contexts factors such as prompt design, in-context learning (ICL), chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, LLM types, integration with traditional choice models, and potential biases. Cloud-based LLMs do not consistently outperform smaller local models. In this study, the reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 achieves the highest average accuracy (77%) and outperforms non-reasoning LLMs in accuracy, factor identification, and choice distribution alignment. Across models, systematic biases are observed against the gas boiler and no-retrofit options, with a preference for more energy-efficient alternatives. The findings suggest that previous SP choices are the most effective input factor, while longer prompts with additional factors and varied formats can cause LLMs to lose focus, reducing accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoi Do, Binh-Son Hua</p>
<p>Abstract: Score distillation sampling is an effective technique to generate 3D models from text prompts, utilizing pre-trained large-scale text-to-image diffusion models as guidance. However, the produced 3D assets tend to be over-saturating, over-smoothing, with limited diversity. These issues are results from a reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence objective, which makes the optimization unstable and results in mode-seeking behavior. In this paper, we derive a bounded score distillation objective based on Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), which stabilizes the optimization process and produces high-quality 3D generation. JSD can match well generated and target distribution, therefore mitigating mode seeking. We provide a practical implementation of JSD by utilizing the theory of generative adversarial networks to define an approximate objective function for the generator, assuming the discriminator is well trained. By assuming the discriminator following a log-odds classifier, we propose a minority sampling algorithm to estimate the gradients of our proposed objective, providing a practical implementation for JSD. We conduct both theoretical and empirical studies to validate our method. Experimental results on T3Bench demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality and diversified 3D assets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Chakraborty, Christian Wirth, Christin Seifert</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Multi-Output LOcal Narrative Explanation (MOLONE), a novel comparative explanation method designed to enhance preference selection in human-in-the-loop Preference Bayesian optimization (PBO). The preference elicitation in PBO is a non-trivial task because it involves navigating implicit trade-offs between vector-valued outcomes, subjective priorities of decision-makers, and decision-makers' uncertainty in preference selection. Existing explainable AI (XAI) methods for BO primarily focus on input feature importance, neglecting the crucial role of outputs (objectives) in human preference elicitation. MOLONE addresses this gap by providing explanations that highlight both input and output importance, enabling decision-makers to understand the trade-offs between competing objectives and make more informed preference selections. MOLONE focuses on local explanations, comparing the importance of input features and outcomes across candidate samples within a local neighborhood of the search space, thus capturing nuanced differences relevant to preference-based decision-making. We evaluate MOLONE within a PBO framework using benchmark multi-objective optimization functions, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving convergence compared to noisy preference selections. Furthermore, a user study confirms that MOLONE significantly accelerates convergence in human-in-the-loop scenarios by facilitating more efficient identification of preferred options.</p>

CO-Bench includes structured problem formulations and curated data to support rigorous investigation of LLM agents. We evaluate multiple agentic frameworks against established human-designed algorithms, revealing the strengths and limitations of existing LLM agents and identifying promising directions for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengran Zhang, Minghao Tang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghun Yu, Jin-Hyun Ahn, Joonhyuk Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful framework for privacy-preserving distributed learning. It enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, handling noisy labels in FL remains a major challenge due to heterogeneous data distributions and communication constraints, which can severely degrade model performance. To address this issue, we propose FedEFC, a novel method designed to tackle the impact of noisy labels in FL. FedEFC mitigates this issue through two key techniques: (1) prestopping, which prevents overfitting to mislabeled data by dynamically halting training at an optimal point, and (2) loss correction, which adjusts model updates to account for label noise. In particular, we develop an effective loss correction tailored to the unique challenges of FL, including data heterogeneity and decentralized training. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis, leveraging the composite proper loss property, to demonstrate that the FL objective function under noisy label distributions can be aligned with the clean label distribution. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it consistently outperforms existing FL techniques in mitigating the impact of noisy labels, particularly under heterogeneous data settings (e.g., achieving up to 41.64% relative performance improvement over the existing loss correction method).</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern cutting-edge AI applications are being developed over fast-evolving, heterogeneous, nascent hardware devices. This requires frequent reworking of the AI software stack to adopt bottom-up changes from new hardware, which takes time for general-purpose software libraries. Consequently, real applications often develop custom software stacks optimized for their specific workloads and hardware. Custom stacks help in quick development and optimization, but incur a lot of redundant efforts across applications in writing non-portable code. This paper discusses an alternative communication library interface for AI applications that offers both portability and performance by reducing redundant efforts while maintaining flexibility for customization. We present MSCCL++, a novel abstraction of GPU communication based on separation of concerns: (1) a primitive interface provides a minimal hardware abstraction as a common ground for software and hardware developers to write custom communication, and (2) higher-level portable interfaces and specialized implementations enable optimization for different workloads and hardware environments. This approach makes the primitive interface reusable across applications while enabling highly flexible optimization. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines (NCCL, RCCL, and MSCCL), MSCCL++ achieves speedups of up to 5.4$\times$ for collective communication and up to 15% for real-world AI inference workloads. MSCCL++ is in production of multiple AI services provided by Microsoft Azure, and is also adopted by RCCL, the GPU collective communication library maintained by AMD.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multi-domain datasets, where domain sampling strategies significantly impact model performance due to varying domain importance across downstream tasks. Existing approaches for optimizing domain-level sampling strategies struggle with maintaining intra-domain consistency and accurately measuring domain impact. In this paper, we present Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling (DIDS). To ensure intra-domain consistency, a gradient clustering algorithm is proposed to group training data based on their learning effects, where a proxy language model and dimensionality reduction are employed to reduce computational overhead. To accurately measure domain impact, we develop a Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) guided metric that quantifies how domain-specific parameter updates affect the model's output distributions on downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, to determine optimal sampling ratios, DIDS combines both the FIM-guided domain impact assessment and loss learning trajectories that indicate domain-specific potential, while accounting for diminishing marginal returns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIDS achieves 3.4% higher average performance while maintaining comparable training efficiency.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks in areas that demand factual accuracy, e.g. industrial automation and healthcare. Key limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability (provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from an initial lexical graph. Subsequently, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification problem allowing for the optimization of information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts at significantly reduced lengths. An initial experimental evaluation of our approach on a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses given a set of medical concepts as well as a series of clinical guideline literature, indicates its potential to optimize information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts while significantly reducing their lengths, which, in turn, may lead to reduced costs as well as more consistent and reliable LLM outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain understudied. We present a comprehensive human-centered analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and healthy controls. Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot (repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91% zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA: p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization consistently reduced perceived quality across groups (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native listeners showed a non-significant trend toward higher original speech ratings (Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference was minimal after anonymization (Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic metrics; intelligibility was linked to perceived quality in original speech but not after anonymization. These findings underscore the need for listener-informed, disorder-specific anonymization strategies that preserve both privacy and perceptual integrity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mouath Abu Daoud, Chaimae Abouzahir, Leen Kharouf, Walid Al-Eisawi, Nizar Habash, Farah E. Shamout</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise for various applications in healthcare. However, their efficacy in the Arabic medical domain remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality domain-specific datasets and benchmarks. This study introduces MedArabiQ, a novel benchmark dataset consisting of seven Arabic medical tasks, covering multiple specialties and including multiple choice questions, fill-in-the-blank, and patient-doctor question answering. We first constructed the dataset using past medical exams and publicly available datasets. We then introduced different modifications to evaluate various LLM capabilities, including bias mitigation. We conducted an extensive evaluation with five state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5. Our findings highlight the need for the creation of new high-quality benchmarks that span different languages to ensure fair deployment and scalability of LLMs in healthcare. By establishing this benchmark and releasing the dataset, we provide a foundation for future research aimed at evaluating and enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs for the equitable use of generative AI in healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navya Sonal Agarwal, Jan Philipp Schneider, Kanchana Vaishnavi Gandikota, Syed Muhammad Kazim, John Meshreki, Ivo Ihrke, Michael Moeller</p>
<p>Abstract: The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %) while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time) significantly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Rodrigues, Mahmood Hegazy, Azzam Naeem</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a deployed, production-grade system designed to enhance and scale search query datasets for intent-based recommendation systems in digital banking. In real-world environments, the growing volume and complexity of user intents create substantial challenges for data management, resulting in suboptimal recommendations and delayed product onboarding. To overcome these challenges, our approach shifts the focus from model-centric enhancements to automated, data-centric strategies. The proposed system integrates three core modules: Synthetic Query Generation, Intent Disambiguation, and Intent Gap Analysis. Synthetic Query Generation produces diverse and realistic user queries. Our experiments reveal no statistically significant difference when using synthetic data for Clinc150, while Banking77 and a proprietary dataset show significant differences. We dig into the underlying factors driving these variations, demonstrating that our approach effectively alleviates the cold start problem (i.e. the challenge of recommending new products with limited historical data). Intent Disambiguation refines broad and overlapping intent categories into precise subintents, achieving an F1 score of 0.863 $\pm$ 0.127 against expert reannotations and leading to clearer differentiation and more precise recommendation mapping. Meanwhile, Intent Gap Analysis identifies latent customer needs by extracting novel intents from unlabeled queries; recovery rates reach up to 71\% in controlled evaluations. Deployed in a live banking environment, our system demonstrates significant improvements in recommendation precision and operation agility, ultimately delivering enhanced user experiences and strategic business benefits. This work underscores the role of high-quality, scalable data in modern AI-driven applications and advocates a proactive approach to data enhancement as a key driver of value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingren Liu, Shuning Xu, Yun Wang, Zhong Ji, Xiangyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: While diffusion-based models have shown remarkable generative capabilities in static settings, their extension to continual learning (CL) scenarios remains fundamentally constrained by Generative Catastrophic Forgetting (GCF). We observe that even with a rehearsal buffer, new generative skills often overwrite previous ones, degrading performance on earlier tasks. Although some initial efforts have explored this space, most rely on heuristics borrowed from continual classification methods or use trained diffusion models as ad hoc replay generators, lacking a principled, unified solution to mitigating GCF and often conducting experiments under fragmented and inconsistent settings. To address this gap, we introduce the Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG), a structured pipeline that redefines how diffusion models are implemented under CL and enables systematic evaluation of GCF. Beyond the empirical pipeline, we propose the first theoretical foundation for CDG, grounded in a cross-task analysis of diffusion-specific generative dynamics. Our theoretical investigation identifies three fundamental consistency principles essential for preserving knowledge in the rehearsal buffer over time: inter-task knowledge consistency, unconditional knowledge consistency, and prior knowledge consistency. These criteria expose the latent mechanisms through which generative forgetting manifests across sequential tasks. Motivated by these insights, we further propose \textit{Continual Consistency Diffusion} (CCD), a principled training framework that enforces these consistency objectives via hierarchical loss functions: $\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{PKC}$. Extensive experiments show that CCD achieves SOTA performance across various benchmarks, especially improving generative metrics in overlapping-task scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mouad Elaarabi, Domenico Borzacchiello, Philippe Le Bot, Nathan Lauzeral, Sebastien Comas-Cardona</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we explore the integration of Sequence Encoding for Online Parameter Identification with Physics-Informed Neural Networks to create a model that, once trained, can be utilized for real time applications with variable parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Recently, the combination of PINNs with Sparse Regression has emerged as a method for performing dynamical system identification through supervised learning and sparse regression optimization, while also solving the dynamics using PINNs. However, this approach can be limited by variations in parameters or boundary and initial conditions, requiring retraining of the model whenever changes occur. In this work, we introduce an architecture that employs Deep Sets or Sequence Encoders to encode dynamic parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions, using these encoded features as inputs for the PINN, enabling the model to adapt to changes in parameters, BCs, and ICs. We apply this approach to three different problems. First, we analyze the Rossler ODE system, demonstrating the robustness of the model with respect to noise and its ability to generalize. Next, we explore the model's capability in a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE problem involving flow past a cylinder with a parametric sinusoidal inlet velocity function, showing that the model can encode pressure data from a few points to identify the inlet velocity profile and utilize physics to compute velocity and pressure throughout the domain. Finally, we address a 1D heat monitoring problem using real data from the heating of glass fiber and thermoplastic composite plates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tonmoy Hasan, Razvan Bunescu</p>
<p>Abstract: The affective attitude of liking a recommended item reflects just one category in a wide spectrum of affective phenomena that also includes emotions such as entranced or intrigued, moods such as cheerful or buoyant, as well as more fine-grained affective states, such as "pleasantly surprised by the conclusion". In this paper, we introduce a novel recommendation task that can leverage a virtually unbounded range of affective states sought explicitly by the user in order to identify items that, upon consumption, are likely to induce those affective states. Correspondingly, we create a large dataset of user preferences containing expressions of fine-grained affective states that are mined from book reviews, and propose a Transformer-based architecture that leverages such affective expressions as input. We then use the resulting dataset of affective states preferences, together with the linked users and their histories of book readings, ratings, and reviews, to train and evaluate multiple recommendation models on the task of matching recommended items with affective preferences. Experiments show that the best results are obtained by models that can utilize textual descriptions of items and user affective preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungyoub Cha, Hyunjong Kim, Sungzoon Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), but its performance degrades on long inputs due to increased attention cost and reduced draft accuracy. We introduce SpecExtend, a drop-in enhancement that improves the performance of speculative decoding on long sequences without any additional training. First, SpecExtend integrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid Tree Attention into both the draft and target models. To improve draft accuracy and speed on long inputs without retraining, we propose Cross-model Retrieval, a novel KV cache eviction strategy that uses the target model's attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the draft model. Extensive evaluations on three long-context understanding datasets show that SpecExtend accelerates standard tree-based speculative decoding by up to 2.22x for inputs up to 16K tokens, providing an effective solution for speculative decoding of long sequences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yan, Sheng Sun, Zhifei Zheng, Ziji Hao, Teli Liu, Min Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: To construct responsible and secure AI applications, harmful information data is widely utilized for adversarial testing and the development of safeguards. Existing studies mainly leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize data to obtain high-quality task datasets at scale, thereby avoiding costly human annotation. However, limited by the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs, the synthesis of harmful data still faces challenges in generation reliability and content diversity. In this study, we propose a novel harmful information synthesis framework, PoisonSwarm, which applies the model crowdsourcing strategy to generate diverse harmful data while maintaining a high success rate. Specifically, we generate abundant benign data as the based templates in a counterfactual manner. Subsequently, we decompose each based template into multiple semantic units and perform unit-by-unit toxification and final refinement through dynamic model switching, thus ensuring the success of synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that PoisonSwarm achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing different categories of harmful data with high scalability and diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych</p>
<p>Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables efficient per-step annotation by jointly aligning solution steps to reference solutions and determine its accuracy with explicit reasoning in single generation. We demonstrate SPARE's effectiveness across four diverse datasets spanning mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH), multi-hop question answering (MuSiQue-Ans), and spatial reasoning (SpaRP), showing consistent improvements in two applications: (1) training Process Reward Models (PRMs) for ranking and aggregating multiple generations, and (2) fine-tuning models via offline reinforcement learning for greedy decoding. On ProcessBench, SPARE demonstrates data-efficient out-of-distribution generalization, using only $\sim$16% of training samples compared to human-labeled and other synthetically trained baselines. Additionally, it achieves competitive performance with MCTS-based methods while offering 2.3$\times$ speedup in terms of total token count. Manual analysis reveals complementary precision-recall characteristics with MCTS approaches, suggesting potential for ensemble methods. These results establish SPARE as a practical and scalable solution for automatic process supervision in LLM reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Andrews, Sam Witteveen</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.</p>

The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.</p>

<p>Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED (Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. Across the miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED consistently ranks as a top-performing metric, achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa on miniF2F and the joint-highest accuracy on ProofNet. This strong overall performance provides the community with a computationally lightweight and more faithful metric for automated evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Licheng Liu, Zihan Wang, Linjie Li, Chenwei Xu, Yiping Lu, Han Liu, Avirup Sil, Manling Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let's try again") after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohan Yao, Vikas Yadav</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks: MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0% to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingxu Wang, Mengzhu Wang, Zhichao Huang, Suyu Liu, Nan Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs by learning domain-invariant representations, which is essential in applications such as molecular property prediction and social network analysis. However, most existing GDA methods rely on the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world scenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely impairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain adaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e., semantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the feature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge domain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch selects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other, enabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels may still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to the noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware regularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to mitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of source overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains of up to 12.7% in accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingxu Wang, Shiqi Fan, Mengzhu Wang, Siyang Gao, Siwei Liu, Nan Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement, while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lynnette Hui Xian Ng, Kathleen M. Carley</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more sophisticated, there is a possibility to harness LLMs to power social media bots. This work investigates the realism of generating LLM-Powered social media bot networks. Through a combination of manual effort, network science and LLMs, we create synthetic bot agent personas, their tweets and their interactions, thereby simulating social media networks. We compare the generated networks against empirical bot/human data, observing that both network and linguistic properties of LLM-Powered Bots differ from Wild Bots/Humans. This has implications towards the detection and effectiveness of LLM-Powered Bots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Chen, Haotian Zhai, Can Zhang, Xiupeng Shi, Ruirui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Negar Foroutan, Clara Meister, Debjit Paul, Joel Niklaus, Sina Ahmadi, Antoine Bosselut, Rico Sennrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with <UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ishwar Balappanawar, Venkata Hasith Vattikuti, Greta Kintzley, Ronan Azimi-Mancel, Satvik Golechha</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting hidden behaviors in neural networks poses a significant challenge due to minimal prior knowledge and potential adversarial obfuscation. We explore this problem by framing detection as an adversarial game between two teams: the red team trains two similar models, one trained solely on benign data and the other trained on data containing hidden harmful behavior, with the performance of both being nearly indistinguishable on the benign dataset. The blue team, with limited to no information about the harmful behaviour, tries to identify the compromised model. We experiment using CNNs and try various blue team strategies, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated gradients, and adversarial attacks under different levels of hints provided by the red team. Results show high accuracy for adversarial-attack-based methods (100\% correct prediction, using hints), which is very promising, whilst the other techniques yield more varied performance. During our LLM-focused rounds, we find that there are not many parallel methods that we could apply from our study with CNNs. Instead, we find that effective LLM auditing methods require some hints about the undesired distribution, which can then used in standard black-box and open-weight methods to probe the models further and reveal their misalignment. We open-source our auditing games (with the model and data) and hope that our findings contribute to designing better audits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhan Liu, Xinyu Ma, Weiwei Sun, Yutao Zhu, Yuchen Li, Dawei Yin, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based listwise ranking has shown superior performance in many passage ranking tasks. With the development of Large Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement. During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based reward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive reranker \textbf{ReasonRank} outperforms existing baselines significantly and also achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. \textbf{Through further experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance 40.6 on the BRIGHT leaderboard\footnote{https://brightbenchmark.github.io/}.} Our codes are available at https://github.com/8421BCD/ReasonRank.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Zedda, Andrea Loddo, Cecilia Di Ruberto, Carsten Marr</p>
<p>Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are essential to human health, and their precise morphological analysis is important for diagnosing hematological disorders. Despite the promise of foundation models in medical diagnostics, comprehensive AI solutions for RBC analysis remain scarce. We present RedDino, a self-supervised foundation model designed for RBC image analysis. RedDino uses an RBC-specific adaptation of the DINOv2 self-supervised learning framework and is trained on a curated dataset of 1.25 million RBC images from diverse acquisition modalities and sources. Extensive evaluations show that RedDino outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on RBC shape classification. Through assessments including linear probing and nearest neighbor classification, we confirm its strong feature representations and generalization ability. Our main contributions are: (1) a foundation model tailored for RBC analysis, (2) ablation studies exploring DINOv2 configurations for RBC modeling, and (3) a detailed evaluation of generalization performance. RedDino addresses key challenges in computational hematology by capturing nuanced morphological features, advancing the development of reliable diagnostic tools. The source code and pretrained models for RedDino are available at https://github.com/Snarci/RedDino, and the pretrained models can be downloaded from our Hugging Face collection at https://huggingface.co/collections/Snarcy/reddino-689a13e29241d2e5690202fc</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saketh Reddy Vemula, Dipti Misra Sharma, Parameswari Krishnamurthy</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance, particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi (primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600 derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing. However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs. Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy showed no correlation with downstream performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuan-Tang Huang, Li-Wei Chen, Hung-Shin Lee, Berlin Chen, Hsin-Min Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks. However, their performance can degrade substantially when the input audio comes from different recording channels. While previous studies have demonstrated this phenomenon, it is often attributed to the mismatch between training and testing corpora. This study argues that variations in speech characteristics caused by different recording channels can fundamentally harm ASR performance. To address this limitation, we propose a normalization technique designed to mitigate the impact of channel variation by aligning internal feature representations in the ASR model with those derived from a clean reference channel. This approach significantly improves ASR performance on previously unseen channels and languages, highlighting its ability to generalize across channel and language differences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlihan Lu, Shijian Gao, Miaowen Wen, Yuxuan Liang, Liuqing Yang, Chan-Byoung Chae, H. Vincent Poor</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of the low-altitude economy, radio maps have become essential for ensuring reliable wireless connectivity to aerial platforms. Autonomous aerial agents are commonly deployed for data collection using waypoint-based navigation; however, their limited battery capacity significantly constrains coverage and efficiency. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly leverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach integrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that estimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based reinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a probabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and energy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent, non-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative regions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of \textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression \textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80 million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller}, the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further research building upon our contributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yechan Kim, Dongho Yoon, Younkwan Lee, Unse Fatima, Hong Kook Kim, Songjae Lee, Sanga Park, Jeong Ho Park, Seonjong Kang, Moongu Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit) label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present, such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools via protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces critical security vulnerabilities, including prompt injection, data exfiltration, and other threats. To counter these challenges, we propose MCP-Guard, a robust, layered defense architecture designed for LLM--tool interactions. MCP-Guard employs a three-stage detection pipeline that balances efficiency with accuracy: it progresses from lightweight static scanning for overt threats and a deep neural detector for semantic attacks, to our fine-tuned E5-based model achieves (96.01) accuracy in identifying adversarial prompts. Finally, a lightweight LLM arbitrator synthesizes these signals to deliver the final decision while minimizing false positives. To facilitate rigorous training and evaluation, we also introduce MCP-AttackBench, a comprehensive benchmark of over 70,000 samples. Sourced from public datasets and augmented by GPT-4, MCP-AttackBench simulates diverse, real-world attack vectors in the MCP format, providing a foundation for future research into securing LLM-tool ecosystems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Class-incremental with repetition (CIR), where previously trained classes repeatedly introduced in future tasks, is a more realistic scenario than the traditional class incremental setup, which assumes that each task contains unseen classes. CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.</p>

By operating in low-rank subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches, GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Jin, Yang Zhou, Qixin Zhang, Hongwu Peng, Di Zhang, Marco Pavone, Ligong Han, Zhang-Wei Hong, Tong Che, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model, matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms, our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data. These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex reasoning tasks in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention, chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM) memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance. We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory, Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongqi Li, Yitong Chen, Yujuan Wang, Weihang Ni, Haodong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis stands at the forefront of neuroscience and artificial intelligence research, where foundation models are reshaping the traditional EEG analysis paradigm by leveraging their powerful representational capacity and cross-modal generalization. However, the rapid proliferation of these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis, systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable, interpretable, and online actionable solutions.</p>
