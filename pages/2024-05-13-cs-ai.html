<p><b>Authors:</b> Aadesh Salecha, Molly E. Ireland, Shashanka Subrahmanya, Jo\~ao Sedoc, Lyle H. Ungar, Johannes C. Eichstaedt</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely used to model and simulate human behavior, understanding their biases becomes critical. We developed an experimental framework using Big Five personality surveys and uncovered a previously undetected social desirability bias in a wide range of LLMs. By systematically varying the number of questions LLMs were exposed to, we demonstrate their ability to infer when they are being evaluated. When personality evaluation is inferred, LLMs skew their scores towards the desirable ends of trait dimensions (i.e., increased extraversion, decreased neuroticism, etc). This bias exists in all tested models, including GPT-4/3.5, Claude 3, Llama 3, and PaLM-2. Bias levels appear to increase in more recent models, with GPT-4's survey responses changing by 1.20 (human) standard deviations and Llama 3's by 0.98 standard deviations-very large effects. This bias is robust to randomization of question order and paraphrasing. Reverse-coding all the questions decreases bias levels but does not eliminate them, suggesting that this effect cannot be attributed to acquiescence bias. Our findings reveal an emergent social desirability bias and suggest constraints on profiling LLMs with psychometric tests and on using LLMs as proxies for human participants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandra Zytek, Sara Pid\`o, Kalyan Veeramachaneni</p>
<p>Abstract: In response to the demand for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), we investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform ML explanations into natural, human-readable narratives. Rather than directly explaining ML models using LLMs, we focus on refining explanations computed using existing XAI algorithms. We outline several research directions, including defining evaluation metrics, prompt design, comparing LLM models, exploring further training methods, and integrating external data. Initial experiments and user study suggest that LLMs offer a promising way to enhance the interpretability and usability of XAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Nellikkath, Mathieu Tanneau, Pascal Van Hentenryck, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a valuable tool for power system operators, but it is a difficult problem to solve for large systems.
  Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, especially Neural Networks-based (NN) optimization proxies, have emerged as a promising new tool for solving OPF, by estimating the OPF solution much faster than traditional methods.
  However, these ML algorithms act as black boxes, and it is hard to assess their worst-case performance across the entire range of possible inputs than an OPF can have.
  Previous work has proposed a mixed-integer programming-based methodology to quantify the worst-case violations caused by a NN trained to estimate the OPF solution, throughout the entire input domain.
  This approach, however, does not scale well to large power systems and more complex NN models.
  This paper addresses these issues by proposing a scalable algorithm to compute worst-case violations of NN proxies used for approximating large power systems within a reasonable time limit.
  This will help build trust in ML models to be deployed in large industry-scale power grids.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srikanth Vemula, Eulises Franco, Michael Frye</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent detection and tracking of the vessels on the sea play a significant role in conducting traffic avoidance in unmanned surface vessels(USV). Current traffic avoidance software relies mainly on Automated Identification System (AIS) and radar to track other vessels to avoid collisions and acts as a typical perception system to detect targets. However, in a contested environment, emitting radar energy also presents the vulnerability to detection by adversaries. Deactivating these Radiofrequency transmitting sources will increase the threat of detection and degrade the USV's ability to monitor shipping traffic in the vicinity. Therefore, an intelligent visual perception system based on an onboard camera with passive sensing capabilities that aims to assist USV in addressing this problem is presented in this paper. This paper will present a novel low-cost vision perception system for detecting and tracking vessels in the maritime environment. This novel low-cost vision perception system is introduced using the deep learning framework. A neural network, DisBeaNet, can detect vessels, track, and estimate the vessel's distance and bearing from the monocular camera. The outputs obtained from this neural network are used to determine the latitude and longitude of the identified vessel.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joyce Fonteles, Eduardo Davalos, Ashwin T. S., Yike Zhang, Mengxi Zhou, Efrat Ayalon, Alicia Lane, Selena Steinberg, Gabriella Anton, Joshua Danish, Noel Enyedy, Gautam Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: Investigating children's embodied learning in mixed-reality environments, where they collaboratively simulate scientific processes, requires analyzing complex multimodal data to interpret their learning and coordination behaviors. Learning scientists have developed Interaction Analysis (IA) methodologies for analyzing such data, but this requires researchers to watch hours of videos to extract and interpret students' learning patterns. Our study aims to simplify researchers' tasks, using Machine Learning and Multimodal Learning Analytics to support the IA processes. Our study combines machine learning algorithms and multimodal analyses to support and streamline researcher efforts in developing a comprehensive understanding of students' scientific engagement through their movements, gaze, and affective responses in a simulated scenario. To facilitate an effective researcher-AI partnership, we present an initial case study to determine the feasibility of visually representing students' states, actions, gaze, affect, and movement on a timeline. Our case study focuses on a specific science scenario where students learn about photosynthesis. The timeline allows us to investigate the alignment of critical learning moments identified by multimodal and interaction analysis, and uncover insights into students' temporal learning progressions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Abdelshiheed, Jennifer K. Jacobs, Sidney K. D'Mello</p>
<p>Abstract: This work investigates how tutoring discourse interacts with students' proximal knowledge to explain and predict students' learning outcomes. Our work is conducted in the context of high-dosage human tutoring where 9th-grade students (N= 1080) attended small group tutorials and individually practiced problems on an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). We analyzed whether tutors' talk moves and students' performance on the ITS predicted scores on math learning assessments. We trained Random Forest Classifiers (RFCs) to distinguish high and low assessment scores based on tutor talk moves, student's ITS performance metrics, and their combination. A decision tree was extracted from each RFC to yield an interpretable model. We found AUCs of 0.63 for talk moves, 0.66 for ITS, and 0.77 for their combination, suggesting interactivity among the two feature sources. Specifically, the best decision tree emerged from combining the tutor talk moves that encouraged rigorous thinking and students' ITS mastery. In essence, tutor talk that encouraged mathematical reasoning predicted achievement for students who demonstrated high mastery on the ITS, whereas tutors' revoicing of students' mathematical ideas and contributions was predictive for students with low ITS mastery. Implications for practice are discussed.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06232">Learning to Solve Geometry Problems via Simulating Human Dual-Reasoning Process</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Xiao, Jiayu Liu, Zhenya Huang, Jinze Wu, Jing Sha, Shijin Wang, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometry Problem Solving (GPS), which is a classic and challenging math problem, has attracted much attention in recent years. It requires a solver to comprehensively understand both text and diagram, master essential geometry knowledge, and appropriately apply it in reasoning. However, existing works follow a paradigm of neural machine translation and only focus on enhancing the capability of encoders, which neglects the essential characteristics of human geometry reasoning. In this paper, inspired by dual-process theory, we propose a Dual-Reasoning Geometry Solver (DualGeoSolver) to simulate the dual-reasoning process of humans for GPS. Specifically, we construct two systems in DualGeoSolver, namely Knowledge System and Inference System. Knowledge System controls an implicit reasoning process, which is responsible for providing diagram information and geometry knowledge according to a step-wise reasoning goal generated by Inference System. Inference System conducts an explicit reasoning process, which specifies the goal in each reasoning step and applies the knowledge to generate program tokens for resolving it. The two systems carry out the above process iteratively, which behaves more in line with human cognition. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, GeoQA and GeoQA+. The results demonstrate the superiority of DualGeoSolver in both solving accuracy and robustness from explicitly modeling human reasoning process and knowledge application.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06266">A Multi-Channel Spatial-Temporal Transformer Model for Traffic Flow Forecasting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianli Xiao, Baichao Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting is a crucial task in transportation management and planning. The main challenges for traffic flow forecasting are that (1) as the length of prediction time increases, the accuracy of prediction will decrease; (2) the predicted results greatly rely on the extraction of temporal and spatial dependencies from the road networks. To overcome the challenges mentioned above, we propose a multi-channel spatial-temporal transformer model for traffic flow forecasting, which improves the accuracy of the prediction by fusing results from different channels of traffic data. Our approach leverages graph convolutional network to extract spatial features from each channel while using a transformer-based architecture to capture temporal dependencies across channels. We introduce an adaptive adjacency matrix to overcome limitations in feature extraction from fixed topological structures. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that introducing a multi-channel mechanism into the temporal model enhances performance and our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06296">Fast Evaluation of DNN for Past Dataset in Incremental Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Naoto Sato</p>
<p>Abstract: During the operation of a system including a deep neural network (DNN), new input values that were not included in the training dataset are given to the DNN. In such a case, the DNN may be incrementally trained with the new input values; however, that training may reduce the accuracy of the DNN in regard to the dataset that was previously obtained and used for the past training. It is necessary to evaluate the effect of the additional training on the accuracy for the past dataset. However, evaluation by testing all the input values included in the past dataset takes time. Therefore, we propose a new method to quickly evaluate the effect on the accuracy for the past dataset. In the proposed method, the gradient of the parameter values (such as weight and bias) for the past dataset is extracted by running the DNN before the training. Then, after the training, its effect on the accuracy with respect to the past dataset is calculated from the gradient and update differences of the parameter values. To show the usefulness of the proposed method, we present experimental results with several datasets. The results show that the proposed method can estimate the accuracy change by additional training in a constant time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongyu Zhang, Yun Chen, Chenrui Wu, Fangxin Wang, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-centric distributed learning framework, enabling model training on individual clients and central aggregation without necessitating data exchange. Nonetheless, FL implementations often suffer from non-i.i.d. and long-tailed class distributions across mobile applications, e.g., autonomous vehicles, which leads models to overfitting as local training may converge to sub-optimal. In our study, we explore the impact of data heterogeneity on model bias and introduce an innovative personalized FL framework, Multi-level Personalized Federated Learning (MuPFL), which leverages the hierarchical architecture of FL to fully harness computational resources at various levels. This framework integrates three pivotal modules: Biased Activation Value Dropout (BAVD) to mitigate overfitting and accelerate training; Adaptive Cluster-based Model Update (ACMU) to refine local models ensuring coherent global aggregation; and Prior Knowledge-assisted Classifier Fine-tuning (PKCF) to bolster classification and personalize models in accord with skewed local data with shared knowledge. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets for image classification and semantic segmentation validate that MuPFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, even under extreme non-i.i.d. and long-tail conditions, which enhances accuracy by as much as 7.39% and accelerates training by up to 80% at most, marking significant advancements in both efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Qian, Yongyi He, Rong Zhu, Jintao Huang, Zhijian Ma, Haibin Wang, Yaohua Wang, Xiuyu Sun, Defu Lian, Bolin Ding, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing effective data manipulation methods is a long standing problem in data lakes. Traditional methods, which rely on rules or machine learning models, require extensive human efforts on training data collection and tuning models. Recent methods apply Large Language Models (LLMs) to resolve multiple data manipulation tasks. They exhibit bright benefits in terms of performance but still require customized designs to fit each specific task. This is very costly and can not catch up with the requirements of big data lake platforms. In this paper, inspired by the cross-task generality of LLMs on NLP tasks, we pave the first step to design an automatic and general solution to tackle with data manipulation tasks. We propose UniDM, a unified framework which establishes a new paradigm to process data manipulation tasks using LLMs. UniDM formalizes a number of data manipulation tasks in a unified form and abstracts three main general steps to solve each task. We develop an automatic context retrieval to allow the LLMs to retrieve data from data lakes, potentially containing evidence and factual information. For each step, we design effective prompts to guide LLMs to produce high quality results. By our comprehensive evaluation on a variety of benchmarks, our UniDM exhibits great generality and state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of data manipulation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring that AI systems reliably and robustly avoid harmful or dangerous behaviours is a crucial challenge, especially for AI systems with a high degree of autonomy and general intelligence, or systems used in safety-critical contexts. In this paper, we will introduce and define a family of approaches to AI safety, which we will refer to as guaranteed safe (GS) AI. The core feature of these approaches is that they aim to produce AI systems which are equipped with high-assurance quantitative safety guarantees. This is achieved by the interplay of three core components: a world model (which provides a mathematical description of how the AI system affects the outside world), a safety specification (which is a mathematical description of what effects are acceptable), and a verifier (which provides an auditable proof certificate that the AI satisfies the safety specification relative to the world model). We outline a number of approaches for creating each of these three core components, describe the main technical challenges, and suggest a number of potential solutions to them. We also argue for the necessity of this approach to AI safety, and for the inadequacy of the main alternative approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Zepko, Ofer M. Shir</p>
<p>Abstract: Quadratically-constrained unbounded integer programs hold the distinction of being undecidable, suggesting a possible soft-spot for Mathematical Programming (MP) techniques, which otherwise constitute a good choice to treat integer or mixed-integer (MI) problems. We consider the challenge of minimizing MI convex quadratic objective functions subject to unbounded decision variables and quadratic constraints. Given the theoretical weakness of white-box MP solvers to handle such models, we turn to black-box meta-heuristics of the Evolution Strategies (ESs) family, and question their capacity to solve this challenge. Through an empirical assessment of quadratically-constrained quadratic objective functions, across varying Hessian forms and condition numbers, we compare the performance of the CPLEX solver to state-of-the-art MI ESs, which handle constraints by penalty. Our systematic investigation begins where the CPLEX solver encounters difficulties (timeouts as the search-space dimensionality increases, (D>=30), on which we report by means of detailed analyses. Overall, the empirical observations confirm that black-box and white-box solvers can be competitive, especially when the constraint function is separable, and that two common ESs' mutation operators can effectively handle the integer unboundedness. We also conclude that conditioning and separability are not intuitive factors in determining the complexity of this class of MI problems, where regular versus rough landscape structures can pose mirrored degrees of challenge for MP versus ESs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naeem Paeedeh, Mahardhika Pratama, Sunu Wibirama, Wolfgang Mayer, Zehong Cao, Ryszard Kowalczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning presents an extension of the Class Incremental Learning problem where a model is faced with the problem of data scarcity while addressing the catastrophic forgetting problem. This problem remains an open problem because all recent works are built upon the convolutional neural networks performing sub-optimally compared to the transformer approaches. Our paper presents Robust Transformer Approach built upon the Compact Convolution Transformer. The issue of overfitting due to few samples is overcome with the notion of the stochastic classifier, where the classifier's weights are sampled from a distribution with mean and variance vectors, thus increasing the likelihood of correct classifications, and the batch-norm layer to stabilize the training process. The issue of CF is dealt with the idea of delta parameters, small task-specific trainable parameters while keeping the backbone networks frozen. A non-parametric approach is developed to infer the delta parameters for the model's predictions. The prototype rectification approach is applied to avoid biased prototype calculations due to the issue of data scarcity. The advantage of ROBUSTA is demonstrated through a series of experiments in the benchmark problems where it is capable of outperforming prior arts with big margins without any data augmentation protocols.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhui Ouyang, Yijie Zhu, Xiang Yuan, Di Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The precise prediction of multi-scale traffic is a ubiquitous challenge in the urbanization process for car owners, road administrators, and governments. In the case of complex road networks, current and past traffic information from both upstream and downstream roads are crucial since various road networks have different semantic information about traffic. Rationalizing the utilization of semantic information can realize short-term, long-term, and unseen road traffic prediction. As the demands of multi-scale traffic analysis increase, on-demand interactions and visualizations are expected to be available for transportation participants. We have designed a multi-scale traffic generation system, namely TrafficGPT, using three AI agents to process multi-scale traffic data, conduct multi-scale traffic analysis, and present multi-scale visualization results. TrafficGPT consists of three essential AI agents: 1) a text-to-demand agent that is employed with Question & Answer AI to interact with users and extract prediction tasks through texts; 2) a traffic prediction agent that leverages multi-scale traffic data to generate temporal features and similarity, and fuse them with limited spatial features and similarity, to achieve accurate prediction of three tasks; and 3) a suggestion and visualization agent that uses the prediction results to generate suggestions and visualizations, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of traffic conditions. Our TrafficGPT system focuses on addressing concerns about traffic prediction from transportation participants, and conducted extensive experiments on five real-world road datasets to demonstrate its superior predictive and interactive performance</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Song, Zheng Miao, Ali Babalhavaeji, Saman Mehrnia, Mahdi Jalili, Xinghuo Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing installation of Photovoltaics (PV) cells leads to more generation of renewable energy sources (RES), but results in increased uncertainties of energy scheduling. Predicting PV power generation is important for energy management and dispatch optimization in smart grid. However, the PV power generation data is often collected across different types of customers (e.g., residential, agricultural, industrial, and commercial) while the customer information is always de-identified. This often results in a forecasting model trained with all PV power generation data, allowing the predictor to learn various patterns through intra-model self-learning, instead of constructing a separate predictor for each customer type. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based multitasking deep neural network (CM-DNN) framework for PV power generation prediction. K-means is applied to cluster the data into different customer types. For each type, a deep neural network (DNN) is employed and trained until the accuracy cannot be improved. Subsequently, for a specified customer type (i.e., the target task), inter-model knowledge transfer is conducted to enhance its training accuracy. During this process, source task selection is designed to choose the optimal subset of tasks (excluding the target customer), and each selected source task uses a coefficient to determine the amount of DNN model knowledge (weights and biases) transferred to the aimed prediction task. The proposed CM-DNN is tested on a real-world PV power generation dataset and its superiority is demonstrated by comparing the prediction performance on training the dataset with a single model without clustering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Bai, Ge Pei, Jindong Gu, Yong Yang, Xingjun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks. However, recent studies have shown that LLMs can memorize training data and simple repeated tokens can trick the model to leak the data. In this paper, we take a step further and show that certain special characters or their combinations with English letters are stronger memory triggers, leading to more severe data leakage. The intuition is that, since LLMs are trained with massive data that contains a substantial amount of special characters (e.g. structural symbols {, } of JSON files, and @, # in emails and online posts), the model may memorize the co-occurrence between these special characters and the raw texts. This motivates us to propose a simple but effective Special Characters Attack (SCA) to induce training data leakage. Our experiments verify the high effectiveness of SCA against state-of-the-art LLMs: they can leak diverse training data, such as code corpus, web pages, and personally identifiable information, and sometimes generate non-stop outputs as a byproduct. We further show that the composition of the training data corpus can be revealed by inspecting the leaked data -- one crucial piece of information for pre-training high-performance LLMs. Our work can help understand the sensitivity of LLMs to special characters and identify potential areas for improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoli Tang, Han Yu, Xiaoxiao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Auction-based Federated Learning (AFL) has attracted extensive research interest due to its ability to motivate data owners (DOs) to join FL through economic means. While many existing AFL methods focus on providing decision support to model users (MUs) and the AFL auctioneer, decision support for data owners remains open. To bridge this gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind agent-oriented joint Pricing, Acceptance and Sub-delegation decision support approach for data owners in AFL (PAS-AFL). By considering a DO's current reputation, pending FL tasks, willingness to train FL models, and its trust relationships with other DOs, it provides a systematic approach for a DO to make joint decisions on AFL bid acceptance, task sub-delegation and pricing based on Lyapunov optimization to maximize its utility. It is the first to enable each DO to take on multiple FL tasks simultaneously to earn higher income for DOs and enhance the throughput of FL tasks in the AFL ecosystem. Extensive experiments based on six benchmarking datasets demonstrate significant advantages of PAS-AFL compared to six alternative strategies, beating the best baseline by 28.77% and 2.64% on average in terms of utility and test accuracy of the resulting FL models, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengyi Gao, Xingyu Zhang, Sonish Sivarajkumar, Parker Denny, Bayan Aldhahwani, Shyam Visweswaran, Ryan Shi, William Hogan, Allyn Bove, Yanshan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we utilized statistical analysis and machine learning methods to examine whether rehabilitation exercises can improve patients post-stroke functional abilities, as well as forecast the improvement in functional abilities. Our dataset is patients' rehabilitation exercises and demographic information recorded in the unstructured electronic health records (EHRs) data and free-text rehabilitation procedure notes. We collected data for 265 stroke patients from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. We employed a pre-existing natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract data on rehabilitation exercises and developed a rule-based NLP algorithm to extract Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) scores, covering basic mobility (BM) and applied cognitive (AC) domains, from procedure notes. Changes in AM-PAC scores were classified based on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), and significance was assessed using Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. To identify impactful exercises, we used Chi-square tests, Fisher's exact tests, and logistic regression for odds ratios. Additionally, we developed five machine learning models-logistic regression (LR), Adaboost (ADB), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting (GB), and random forest (RF)-to predict outcomes in functional ability. Statistical analyses revealed significant associations between functional improvements and specific exercises. The RF model achieved the best performance in predicting functional outcomes. In this study, we identified three rehabilitation exercises that significantly contributed to patient post-stroke functional ability improvement in the first two months. Additionally, the successful application of a machine learning model to predict patient-specific functional outcomes underscores the potential for precision rehabilitation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihao Gong, Yang Yong, Shiqiao Gu, Yushi Huang, Yunchen Zhang, Xianglong Liu, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) are propelling us toward artificial general intelligence, thanks to their remarkable emergent abilities and reasoning capabilities. However, the substantial computational and memory requirements of LLMs limit their widespread adoption. Quan- tization, a key compression technique, offers a viable solution to mitigate these demands by compressing and accelerating LLMs, albeit with poten- tial risks to model accuracy. Numerous studies have aimed to minimize the accuracy loss associated with quantization. However, the quantization configurations in these studies vary and may not be optimized for hard- ware compatibility. In this paper, we focus on identifying the most effective practices for quantizing LLMs, with the goal of balancing performance with computational efficiency. For a fair analysis, we develop a quantization toolkit LLMC, and design four crucial principles considering the inference efficiency, quantized accuracy, calibration cost, and modularization. By benchmarking on various models and datasets with over 500 experiments, three takeaways corresponding to calibration data, quantization algorithm, and quantization schemes are derived. Finally, a best practice of LLM PTQ pipeline is constructed. All the benchmark results and the toolkit can be found at https://github.com/ModelTC/llmc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lihao Gan, Xin Man, Chenghong Zhang, Jie Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Weather forecasting is a crucial task for meteorologic research, with direct social and economic impacts. Recently, data-driven weather forecasting models based on deep learning have shown great potential, achieving superior performance compared with traditional numerical weather prediction methods. However, these models often require massive training data and computational resources. In this paper, we propose EWMoE, an effective model for accurate global weather forecasting, which requires significantly less training data and computational resources. Our model incorporates three key components to enhance prediction accuracy: meteorology-specific embedding, a core Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer, and two specific loss functions. We conduct our evaluation on the ERA5 dataset using only two years of training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EWMoE outperforms current models such as FourCastNet and ClimaX at all forecast time, achieving competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art Pangu-Weather model in evaluation metrics such as Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Additionally, ablation studies indicate that applying the MoE architecture to weather forecasting offers significant advantages in improving accuracy and resource efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used in many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. However, deploying them brings significant challenges due to the huge cost of memory, energy, and computation. To address these challenges, researchers have developed various model compression techniques such as model quantization and model pruning. Recently, there has been a surge in research of compression methods to achieve model efficiency while retaining the performance. Furthermore, more and more works focus on customizing the DNN hardware accelerators to better leverage the model compression techniques. In addition to efficiency, preserving security and privacy is critical for deploying DNNs. However, the vast and diverse body of related works can be overwhelming. This inspires us to conduct a comprehensive survey on recent research toward the goal of high-performance, cost-efficient, and safe deployment of DNNs. Our survey first covers the mainstream model compression techniques such as model quantization, model pruning, knowledge distillation, and optimizations of non-linear operations. We then introduce recent advances in designing hardware accelerators that can adapt to efficient model compression approaches. Additionally, we discuss how homomorphic encryption can be integrated to secure DNN deployment. Finally, we discuss several issues, such as hardware evaluation, generalization, and integration of various compression approaches. Overall, we aim to provide a big picture of efficient DNNs, from algorithm to hardware accelerators and security perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Z. Cui, Xiangyu Peng, Mark O. Riedl</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-ended worlds are those in which there are no pre-specified goals or environmental reward signal. As a consequence, an agent must know how to perform a multitude of tasks. However, when a new task is presented to an agent, we expect it to be able to reuse some of what it knows from previous tasks to rapidly learn that new task. We introduce a novel technique whereby policies for different a priori known tasks are combined into a Mixture-of-Experts model with an attention mechanism across a mix of frozen and unfrozen experts. The model learns when to attend to frozen task-specific experts when appropriate and learns new experts to handle novel situations. We work in an open-ended text-based environment in which the agent is tasked with behaving like different types of character roles and must rapidly learn behaviors associated with new character role types. We show that our agent both obtains more rewards in the zero-shot setting, and discovers these rewards with greater sample efficiency in the few-shot learning settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michelle Vaccaro, Abdullah Almaatouq, Thomas Malone</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the increasing use of AI to augment humans, researchers have studied human-AI systems involving different tasks, systems, and populations. Despite such a large body of work, we lack a broad conceptual understanding of when combinations of humans and AI are better than either alone. Here, we addressed this question by conducting a meta-analysis of over 100 recent experimental studies reporting over 300 effect sizes. First, we found that, on average, human-AI combinations performed significantly worse than the best of humans or AI alone. Second, we found performance losses in tasks that involved making decisions and significantly greater gains in tasks that involved creating content. Finally, when humans outperformed AI alone, we found performance gains in the combination, but when the AI outperformed humans alone we found losses. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of the effects of human-AI collaboration and point to promising avenues for improving human-AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Ge, Sudeshna Das, Karen O'Connor, Mohammed Ali Al-Garadi, Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez, Abeed Sarker</p>
<p>Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a growing concern globally, necessitating enhanced understanding of the problem and its trends through data-driven research. Social media are unique and important sources of information about SUDs, particularly since the data in such sources are often generated by people with lived experiences. In this paper, we introduce Reddit-Impacts, a challenging Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset curated from subreddits dedicated to discussions on prescription and illicit opioids, as well as medications for opioid use disorder. The dataset specifically concentrates on the lesser-studied, yet critically important, aspects of substance use--its clinical and social impacts. We collected data from chosen subreddits using the publicly available Application Programming Interface for Reddit. We manually annotated text spans representing clinical and social impacts reported by people who also reported personal nonmedical use of substances including but not limited to opioids, stimulants and benzodiazepines. Our objective is to create a resource that can enable the development of systems that can automatically detect clinical and social impacts of substance use from text-based social media data. The successful development of such systems may enable us to better understand how nonmedical use of substances affects individual health and societal dynamics, aiding the development of effective public health strategies. In addition to creating the annotated data set, we applied several machine learning models to establish baseline performances. Specifically, we experimented with transformer models like BERT, and RoBERTa, one few-shot learning model DANN by leveraging the full training dataset, and GPT-3.5 by using one-shot learning, for automatic NER of clinical and social impacts. The dataset has been made available through the 2024 SMM4H shared tasks.</p>

We present a novel framework which accomplishes these purposes, Skeet, which was recently released to general use, alongside an initial evaluation. Skeet provides an app structure that reflects current trends in architecture, and tool suites that allow developers with minimal knowledge of AI internals to easily incorporate such technologies into their apps and deploy them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Wen, Chenjia Bai, Kang Xu, Xudong Yu, Yang Zhang, Xuelong Li, Zhen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning leverages source domain data with diverse transition dynamics to alleviate the data requirement for the target domain. However, simply merging the data of two domains leads to performance degradation due to the dynamics mismatch. Existing methods address this problem by measuring the dynamics gap via domain classifiers while relying on the assumptions of the transferability of paired domains. In this paper, we propose a novel representation-based approach to measure the domain gap, where the representation is learned through a contrastive objective by sampling transitions from different domains. We show that such an objective recovers the mutual-information gap of transition functions in two domains without suffering from the unbounded issue of the dynamics gap in handling significantly different domains. Based on the representations, we introduce a data filtering algorithm that selectively shares transitions from the source domain according to the contrastive score functions. Empirical results on various tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance, using only 10% of the target data to achieve 89.2% of the performance on 100% target dataset with state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Dhakal, Rabin Adhikari, Safal Thapaliya, Bishesh Khanal</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained using large-scale open-domain images and text pairs have recently been adapted to develop Vision-Language Segmentation Models (VLSMs) that allow providing text prompts during inference to guide image segmentation. If robust and powerful VLSMs can be built for medical images, it could aid medical professionals in many clinical tasks where they must spend substantial time delineating the target structure of interest. VLSMs for medical images resort to fine-tuning base VLM or VLSM pretrained on open-domain natural image datasets due to fewer annotated medical image datasets; this fine-tuning is resource-consuming and expensive as it usually requires updating all or a significant fraction of the pretrained parameters. Recently, lightweight blocks called adapters have been proposed in VLMs that keep the pretrained model frozen and only train adapters during fine-tuning, substantially reducing the computing resources required. We introduce a novel adapter, VLSM-Adapter, that can fine-tune pretrained vision-language segmentation models using transformer encoders. Our experiments in widely used CLIP-based segmentation models show that with only 3 million trainable parameters, the VLSM-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art and is comparable to the upper bound end-to-end fine-tuning.

<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art model for zero-shot cross-lingual spoken language understanding performs cross-lingual unsupervised contrastive learning to achieve the label-agnostic semantic alignment between each utterance and its code-switched data. However, it ignores the precious intent/slot labels, whose label information is promising to help capture the label-aware semantics structure and then leverage supervised contrastive learning to improve both source and target languages' semantics. In this paper, we propose Hybrid and Cooperative Contrastive Learning to address this problem. Apart from cross-lingual unsupervised contrastive learning, we design a holistic approach that exploits source language supervised contrastive learning, cross-lingual supervised contrastive learning and multilingual supervised contrastive learning to perform label-aware semantics alignments in a comprehensive manner. Each kind of supervised contrastive learning mechanism includes both single-task and joint-task scenarios. In our model, one contrastive learning mechanism's input is enhanced by others. Thus the total four contrastive learning mechanisms are cooperative to learn more consistent and discriminative representations in the virtuous cycle during the training process. Experiments show that our model obtains consistent improvements over 9 languages, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Zhang, Neil Gong, Michael K. Reiter</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning method that enables participants to collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data. Despite its privacy and scalability benefits, FL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison the local training data of a subset of clients using a backdoor trigger, aiming to make the aggregated model produce malicious results when the same backdoor condition is met by an inference-time input. Existing backdoor attacks in FL suffer from common deficiencies: fixed trigger patterns and reliance on the assistance of model poisoning. State-of-the-art defenses based on Byzantine-robust aggregation exhibit a good defense performance on these attacks because of the significant divergence between malicious and benign model updates. To effectively conceal malicious model updates among benign ones, we propose DPOT, a backdoor attack strategy in FL that dynamically constructs backdoor objectives by optimizing a backdoor trigger, making backdoor data have minimal effect on model updates. We provide theoretical justifications for DPOT's attacking principle and display experimental results showing that DPOT, via only a data-poisoning attack, effectively undermines state-of-the-art defenses and outperforms existing backdoor attack techniques on various datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: As one of the most advanced techniques in AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques can offer reliable and up-to-date external knowledge, providing huge convenience for numerous tasks. Particularly in the era of AI-generated content (AIGC), the powerful capacity of retrieval in RAG in providing additional knowledge enables retrieval-augmented generation to assist existing generative AI in producing high-quality outputs. Recently, large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary abilities in language understanding and generation, while still facing inherent limitations, such as hallucinations and out-of-date internal knowledge. Given the powerful abilities of RAG in providing the latest and helpful auxiliary information, retrieval-augmented large language models have emerged to harness external and authoritative knowledge bases, rather than solely relying on the model's internal knowledge, to augment the generation quality of LLMs. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies in retrieval-augmented large language models (RA-LLMs), covering three primary technical perspectives: architectures, training strategies, and applications. As the preliminary knowledge, we briefly introduce the foundations and recent advances of LLMs. Then, to illustrate the practical significance of RAG for LLMs, we categorize mainstream relevant work by application areas, detailing specifically the challenges of each and the corresponding capabilities of RA-LLMs. Finally, to deliver deeper insights, we discuss current limitations and several promising directions for future research.</p>

To demonstrate the model's effectiveness, we compared SaudiBERT with six different multidialect Arabic language models across 11 evaluation datasets, which are divided into two groups: sentiment analysis and text classification. SaudiBERT achieved average F1-scores of 86.15\% and 87.86\% in these groups respectively, significantly outperforming all other comparative models. Additionally, we present two novel Saudi dialectal corpora: the Saudi Tweets Mega Corpus (STMC), which contains over 141 million tweets in Saudi dialect, and the Saudi Forums Corpus (SFC), which includes 15.2 GB of text collected from five Saudi online forums. Both corpora are used in pretraining the proposed model, and they are the largest Saudi dialectal corpora ever reported in the literature. The results confirm the effectiveness of SaudiBERT in understanding and analyzing Arabic text expressed in Saudi dialect, achieving state-of-the-art results in most tasks and surpassing other language models included in the study.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Zhang, Xin Liu, Meng Wu, Wei Yan, Mingyu Yan, Xiaochun Ye, Dongrui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as potent models for graph learning. Distributing the training process across multiple computing nodes is the most promising solution to address the challenges of ever-growing real-world graphs. However, current adversarial attack methods on GNNs neglect the characteristics and applications of the distributed scenario, leading to suboptimal performance and inefficiency in attacking distributed GNN training.
  In this study, we introduce Disttack, the first framework of adversarial attacks for distributed GNN training that leverages the characteristics of frequent gradient updates in a distributed system. Specifically, Disttack corrupts distributed GNN training by injecting adversarial attacks into one single computing node. The attacked subgraphs are precisely perturbed to induce an abnormal gradient ascent in backpropagation, disrupting gradient synchronization between computing nodes and thus leading to a significant performance decline of the trained GNN. We evaluate Disttack on four large real-world graphs by attacking five widely adopted GNNs. Compared with the state-of-the-art attack method, experimental results demonstrate that Disttack amplifies the model accuracy degradation by 2.75$\times$ and achieves speedup by 17.33$\times$ on average while maintaining unnoticeability.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to apple detection and position estimation utilizing an object detection model, YOLOv5.

To achieve this, we curated an autonomously labeled dataset comprising diverse apple tree images, which was utilized for both training and evaluation purposes. Through rigorous experimentation, we compared the performance of our YOLOv5-based system with other popular object detection models, including SSD. Our results demonstrate that the YOLOv5 model outperforms its counterparts, achieving an impressive apple detection accuracy of approximately 85%. We believe that our proposed system's accurate apple detection and position estimation capabilities represent a significant advancement in agricultural robotics, laying the groundwork for more efficient and sustainable fruit harvesting practices.</p>

However, top MBRL agents such as Dreamer often struggle with visual pixel-based inputs in the presence of exogenous or irrelevant noise in the observation space, due to failure to capture task-specific features while filtering out irrelevant spatio-temporal details. To tackle this problem, we apply a spatio-temporal masking strategy, a bisimulation principle, combined with latent reconstruction, to capture endogenous task-specific aspects of the environment for world models, effectively eliminating non-essential information. Joint training of representations, dynamics, and policy often leads to instabilities. To further address this issue, we develop a Hybrid Recurrent State-Space Model (HRSSM) structure, enhancing state representation robustness for effective policy learning. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing methods in a range of visually complex control tasks such as Maniskill \cite{gu2023maniskill2} with exogenous distractors from the Matterport environment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Nazary, Yashar Deldjoo, Tommaso Di Noia, Eugenio di Sciascio</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare diagnostics offers a promising avenue for clinical decision-making. This study outlines the development of a novel method for zero-shot/few-shot in-context learning (ICL) by integrating medical domain knowledge using a multi-layered structured prompt. We also explore the efficacy of two communication styles between the user and LLMs: the Numerical Conversational (NC) style, which processes data incrementally, and the Natural Language Single-Turn (NL-ST) style, which employs long narrative prompts. Our study systematically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and risk factors, including gender bias and false negative rates, using a dataset of 920 patient records in various few-shot scenarios. Results indicate that traditional clinical machine learning (ML) models generally outperform LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings. However, the performance gap narrows significantly when employing few-shot examples alongside effective explainable AI (XAI) methods as sources of domain knowledge. Moreover, with sufficient time and an increased number of examples, the conversational style (NC) nearly matches the performance of ML models. Most notably, LLMs demonstrate comparable or superior cost-sensitive accuracy relative to ML models. This research confirms that, with appropriate domain knowledge and tailored communication strategies, LLMs can significantly enhance diagnostic processes. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing the number of training examples and communication styles to improve accuracy and reduce biases in LLM applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bandhav Veluri, Malek Itani, Tuochao Chen, Takuya Yoshioka, Shyamnath Gollakota</p>
<p>Abstract: In crowded settings, the human brain can focus on speech from a target speaker, given prior knowledge of how they sound. We introduce a novel intelligent hearable system that achieves this capability, enabling target speech hearing to ignore all interfering speech and noise, but the target speaker. A naive approach is to require a clean speech example to enroll the target speaker. This is however not well aligned with the hearable application domain since obtaining a clean example is challenging in real world scenarios, creating a unique user interface problem. We present the first enrollment interface where the wearer looks at the target speaker for a few seconds to capture a single, short, highly noisy, binaural example of the target speaker. This noisy example is used for enrollment and subsequent speech extraction in the presence of interfering speakers and noise. Our system achieves a signal quality improvement of 7.01 dB using less than 5 seconds of noisy enrollment audio and can process 8 ms of audio chunks in 6.24 ms on an embedded CPU. Our user studies demonstrate generalization to real-world static and mobile speakers in previously unseen indoor and outdoor multipath environments. Finally, our enrollment interface for noisy examples does not cause performance degradation compared to clean examples, while being convenient and user-friendly. Taking a step back, this paper takes an important step towards enhancing the human auditory perception with artificial intelligence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rochana Chaturvedi, Abari Bhattacharya, Shweta Yadav</p>
<p>Abstract: Community Question-Answering (CQA) forums have revolutionized how people seek information, especially those related to their healthcare needs, placing their trust in the collective wisdom of the public. However, there can be several answers in response to a single query, which makes it hard to grasp the key information related to the specific health concern. Typically, CQA forums feature a single top-voted answer as a representative summary for each query. However, a single answer overlooks the alternative solutions and other information frequently offered in other responses. Our research focuses on aspect-based summarization of health answers to address this limitation. Summarization of responses under different aspects such as suggestions, information, personal experiences, and questions can enhance the usability of the platforms. We formalize a multi-stage annotation guideline and contribute a unique dataset comprising aspect-based human-written health answer summaries. We build an automated multi-faceted answer summarization pipeline with this dataset based on task-specific fine-tuning of several state-of-the-art models. The pipeline leverages question similarity to retrieve relevant answer sentences, subsequently classifying them into the appropriate aspect type. Following this, we employ several recent abstractive summarization models to generate aspect-based summaries. Finally, we present a comprehensive human analysis and find that our summaries rank high in capturing relevant content and a wide range of solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingzhi Hu, Dusit Niyato, Jun Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is pivotal for 6G communications and is boosted by the rapid development of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). Using the channel state information (CSI) across multiple frequency bands, RIS-aided multi-band ISAC systems can potentially track users' positions with high precision. Though tracking with CSI is desirable as no communication overheads are incurred, it faces challenges due to the multi-modalities of CSI samples, irregular and asynchronous data traffic, and sparse labeled data for learning the tracking function. This paper proposes the X2Track framework, where we model the tracking function by a hierarchical architecture, jointly utilizing multi-modal CSI indicators across multiple bands, and optimize it in a cross-domain manner, tackling the sparsity of labeled data for the target deployment environment (namely, target domain) by adapting the knowledge learned from another environment (namely, source domain). Under X2Track, we design an efficient deep learning algorithm to minimize tracking errors, based on transformer neural networks and adversarial learning techniques. Simulation results verify that X2Track achieves decimeter-level axial tracking errors even under scarce UL data traffic and strong interference conditions and can adapt to diverse deployment environments with fewer than 5% training data, or equivalently, 5 minutes of UE tracks, being labeled.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Universal Similarity Metric (USM) has been demonstrated to give practically useful measures of "similarity" between sequence data. Here we have used the USM as an alternative distance metric in a K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) learner to allow effective pattern recognition of variable length sequence data. We compare this USM approach with the commonly used string-to-word vector approach. Our experiments have used two data sets of divergent domains: (1) spam email filtering and (2) protein subcellular localization. Our results with this data reveal that the USM-based K-NN learner (1) gives predictions with higher classification accuracy than those output by techniques that use the string-to-word vector approach, and (2) can be used to generate reliable probability forecasts.</p>

<p>Abstract: The correlation dimension of natural language is measured by applying the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm to high-dimensional sequences produced by a large-scale language model. This method, previously studied only in a Euclidean space, is reformulated in a statistical manifold via the Fisher-Rao distance. Language exhibits a multifractal, with global self-similarity and a universal dimension around 6.5, which is smaller than those of simple discrete random sequences and larger than that of a Barab\'asi-Albert process. Long memory is the key to producing self-similarity. Our method is applicable to any probabilistic model of real-world discrete sequences, and we show an application to music data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teerath Kumar, Alessandra Mileo, Malika Bendechache</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced image data augmentation techniques play a pivotal role in enhancing the training of models for diverse computer vision tasks. Notably, SalfMix and KeepAugment have emerged as popular strategies, showcasing their efficacy in boosting model performance. However, SalfMix reliance on duplicating salient features poses a risk of overfitting, potentially compromising the model's generalization capabilities. Conversely, KeepAugment, which selectively preserves salient regions and augments non-salient ones, introduces a domain shift that hinders the exchange of crucial contextual information, impeding overall model understanding. In response to these challenges, we introduce KeepOriginalAugment, a novel data augmentation approach. This method intelligently incorporates the most salient region within the non-salient area, allowing augmentation to be applied to either region. Striking a balance between data diversity and information preservation, KeepOriginalAugment enables models to leverage both diverse salient and non-salient regions, leading to enhanced performance. We explore three strategies for determining the placement of the salient region minimum, maximum, or random and investigate swapping perspective strategies to decide which part (salient or non-salient) undergoes augmentation. Our experimental evaluations, conducted on classification datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate the superior performance of KeepOriginalAugment compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Maran, Alberto Maria Metelli, Matteo Papini, Marcello Restelli</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in a general class of continuous-space Markov decision processes (MDPs) having smooth Bellman operators. Given access to a generative model, we achieve rate-optimal sample complexity by performing a simple, \emph{perturbed} version of least-squares value iteration with orthogonal trigonometric polynomials as features. Key to our solution is a novel projection technique based on ideas from harmonic analysis. Our~$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2-d/(\nu+1)})$ sample complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of the state-action space and $\nu$ the order of smoothness, recovers the state-of-the-art result of discretization approaches for the special case of Lipschitz MDPs $(\nu=0)$. At the same time, for $\nu\to\infty$, it recovers and greatly generalizes the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ rate of low-rank MDPs, which are more amenable to regression approaches. In this sense, our result bridges the gap between two popular but conflicting perspectives on continuous-space MDPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David E. Ru\'iz-Guirola, Onel L. A. L\'opez, Samuel Montejo-S\'anchez, Israel Leyva Mayorga, Zhu Han, Petar Popovski</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach for energy-neutral Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios where the IoT devices (IoTDs) rely entirely on their energy harvesting capabilities to sustain operation. We use a Markov chain to represent the operation and transmission states of the IoTDs, a modulated Poisson process to model their energy harvesting process, and a discrete-time Markov chain to model their battery state. The aim is to efficiently manage the duty cycling of the IoTDs, so as to prolong their battery life and reduce instances of low-energy availability. We propose a duty-cycling management based on K- nearest neighbors, aiming to strike a trade-off between energy efficiency and detection accuracy. This is done by incorporating spatial and temporal correlations among IoTDs' activity, as well as their energy harvesting capabilities. We also allow the base station to wake up specific IoTDs if more information about an event is needed upon initial detection. Our proposed scheme shows significant improvements in energy savings and performance, with up to 11 times lower misdetection probability and 50\% lower energy consumption for high-density scenarios compared to a random duty cycling benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional proficiency in natural language processing but often fall short of generating creative and original responses to open-ended questions. To enhance LLM creativity, our key insight is to emulate the human process of inducing collective creativity through engaging discussions with participants from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. To this end, we propose LLM Discussion, a three-phase discussion framework that facilitates vigorous and diverging idea exchanges and ensures convergence to creative answers. Moreover, we adopt a role-playing technique by assigning distinct roles to LLMs to combat the homogeneity of LLMs. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework with the Alternative Uses Test, Similarities Test, Instances Test, and Scientific Creativity Test through both LLM evaluation and human study. Our proposed framework outperforms single-LLM approaches and existing multi-LLM frameworks across various creativity metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Yu, Shaokun Wang, Yuhang He, Junzhe Chen, Yihong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Novel Class Discovery (CNCD) aims to continually discover novel classes without labels while maintaining the recognition capability for previously learned classes. The main challenges faced by CNCD include the feature-discrepancy problem, the inter-session confusion problem, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Enhancement and Adaptation method for the CNCD to tackle the above challenges, which consists of a guide-to-novel framework, a centroid-to-samples similarity constraint (CSS), and a boundary-aware prototype constraint (BAP). More specifically, the guide-to-novel framework is established to continually discover novel classes under the guidance of prior distribution. Afterward, the CSS is designed to constrain the relationship between centroid-to-samples similarities of different classes, thereby enhancing the distinctiveness of features among novel classes. Finally, the BAP is proposed to keep novel class features aware of the positions of other class prototypes during incremental sessions, and better adapt novel class features to the shared feature space. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, especially in more challenging protocols with more incremental sessions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a general artificial intelligence benchmark that is currently unsolvable by any Machine Learning method, including Large Language Models (LLMs). It demands strong generalization and reasoning capabilities which are known to be weaknesses of Neural Network based systems. In this work, we propose a Program Synthesis system that uses Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), a branch of Symbolic AI, to solve ARC. We have manually defined a simple Domain Specific Language (DSL) that corresponds to a small set of object-centric abstractions relevant to ARC. This is the Background Knowledge used by ILP to create Logic Programs that provide reasoning capabilities to our system. The full system is capable of generalize to unseen tasks, since ILP can create Logic Program(s) from few examples, in the case of ARC: pairs of Input-Output grids examples for each task. These Logic Programs are able to generate Objects present in the Output grid and the combination of these can form a complete program that transforms an Input grid into an Output grid. We randomly chose some tasks from ARC that dont require more than the small number of the Object primitives we implemented and show that given only these, our system can solve tasks that require each, such different reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: While a number of knowledge graph representation learning (KGRL) methods have been proposed over the past decade, very few theoretical analyses have been conducted on them. In this paper, we present the first PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for KGRL methods. To analyze a broad class of KGRL models, we propose a generic framework named ReED (Relation-aware Encoder-Decoder), which consists of a relation-aware message passing encoder and a triplet classification decoder. Our ReED framework can express at least 15 different existing KGRL models, including not only graph neural network-based models such as R-GCN and CompGCN but also shallow-architecture models such as RotatE and ANALOGY. Our generalization bounds for the ReED framework provide theoretical grounds for the commonly used tricks in KGRL, e.g., parameter-sharing and weight normalization schemes, and guide desirable design choices for practical KGRL methods. We empirically show that the critical factors in our generalization bounds can explain actual generalization errors on three real-world knowledge graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In real-world scenarios, time series forecasting often demands timeliness, making research on model backbones a perennially hot topic. To meet these performance demands, we propose a novel backbone from the perspective of information fusion. Introducing the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module and the Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN), based on evidence theory, allows us to achieve superior performance. On the other hand, the perspective of multi-source information fusion effectively improves the accuracy of forecasting. Due to the fact that BPA is generated by fuzzy theory, TEFN also has considerable interpretability. In real data experiments, the TEFN partially achieved state-of-the-art, with low errors comparable to PatchTST, and operating efficiency surpass performance models such as Dlinear. Meanwhile, TEFN has high robustness and small error fluctuations in the random hyperparameter selection. TEFN is not a model that achieves the ultimate in single aspect, but a model that balances performance, accuracy, stability, and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Z. Ye, Eduardo B. Sandoval, Pamela Carreno-Medrano, Francisco Cru</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotics has been a popular field of research in the past few decades, with much success in industrial applications such as manufacturing and logistics. This success is led by clearly defined use cases and controlled operating environments. However, robotics has yet to make a large impact in domestic settings. This is due in part to the difficulty and complexity of designing mass-manufactured robots that can succeed in the variety of homes and environments that humans live in and that can operate safely in close proximity to humans. This paper explores the use of contextual affordances to enable safe exploration and learning in robotic scenarios targeted in the home. In particular, we propose a simple state representation that allows us to extend contextual affordances to larger state spaces and showcase how affordances can improve the success and convergence rate of a reinforcement learning algorithm in simulation. Our results suggest that after further iterations, it is possible to consider the implementation of this approach in a real robot manipulator. Furthermore, in the long term, this work could be the foundation for future explorations of human-robot interactions in complex domestic environments. This could be possible once state-of-the-art robot manipulators achieve the required level of dexterity for the described affordances in this paper.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assessing response quality to instructions in language models is vital but challenging due to the complexity of human language across different contexts. This complexity often results in ambiguous or inconsistent interpretations, making accurate assessment difficult. To address this issue, we propose a novel Uncertainty-aware Reward Model (URM) that introduces a robust uncertainty estimation for the quality of paired responses based on Bayesian approximation. Trained with preference datasets, our uncertainty-enabled proxy not only scores rewards for responses but also evaluates their inherent uncertainty. Empirical results demonstrate significant benefits of incorporating the proposed proxy into language model training. Our method boosts the instruction following capability of language models by refining data curation for training and improving policy optimization objectives, thereby surpassing existing methods by a large margin on benchmarks such as Vicuna and MT-bench. These findings highlight that our proposed approach substantially advances language model training and paves a new way of harnessing uncertainty within language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work critically analyzes existing models for open-vocabulary EEG-to-Text translation. We identify a crucial limitation: previous studies often employed implicit teacher-forcing during evaluation, artificially inflating performance metrics. Additionally, they lacked a critical benchmark - comparing model performance on pure noise inputs. We propose a methodology to differentiate between models that truly learn from EEG signals and those that simply memorize training data. Our analysis reveals that model performance on noise data can be comparable to that on EEG data. These findings highlight the need for stricter evaluation practices in EEG-to-Text research, emphasizing transparent reporting and rigorous benchmarking with noise inputs. This approach will lead to more reliable assessments of model capabilities and pave the way for robust EEG-to-Text communication systems.</p>

These platforms utilize advanced AI and massive data analytics to enhance user engagement, creating a cycle of attention capture and data extraction. We review contemporary (neuro)cognitive theories of attention and platform engagement design techniques and criticize classical cognitivist and behaviourist theories for their inadequacies in addressing the potential harms of such engagement on user autonomy and wellbeing. 4E approaches to cognitive science, instead, emphasizing the embodied, extended, enactive, and ecological aspects of cognition, offer us an intrinsic normative standpoint and a more integrated understanding of how attentional patterns are actively constituted by adaptive digital environments. By examining the precarious nature of habit formation in digital contexts, we reveal the techno-economic underpinnings that threaten personal autonomy by disaggregating habits away from the individual, into an AI managed collection of behavioural patterns. Our current predicament suggests the necessity of a paradigm shift towards an ecology of attention. This shift aims to foster environments that respect and preserve human cognitive and social capacities, countering the exploitative tendencies of cognitive capitalism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leif Eriksson, Victor Lagerkvist, George Osipov, Sebastian Ordyniak, Fahad Panolan, Mateusz Rychlicki</p>
<p>Abstract: The quantified Boolean formula (QBF) problem is an important decision problem generally viewed as the archetype for PSPACE-completeness. Many problems of central interest in AI are in general not included in NP, e.g., planning, model checking, and non-monotonic reasoning, and for such problems QBF has successfully been used as a modelling tool. However, solvers for QBF are not as advanced as state of the art SAT solvers, which has prevented QBF from becoming a universal modelling language for PSPACE-complete problems. A theoretical explanation is that QBF (as well as many other PSPACE-complete problems) lacks natural parameters} guaranteeing fixed-parameter tractability (FPT).
  In this paper we tackle this problem and consider a simple but overlooked parameter: the number of existentially quantified variables. This natural parameter is virtually unexplored in the literature which one might find surprising given the general scarcity of FPT algorithms for QBF. Via this parameterization we then develop a novel FPT algorithm applicable to QBF instances in conjunctive normal form (CNF) of bounded clause length. We complement this by a W[1]-hardness result for QBF in CNF of unbounded clause length as well as sharper lower bounds for the bounded arity case under the (strong) exponential-time hypothesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghan Yu, Ming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Peptide identification in mass spectrometry-based proteomics is crucial for understanding protein function and dynamics. Traditional database search methods, though widely used, rely on heuristic scoring functions and statistical estimations have to be introduced for a higher identification rate. Here, we introduce DeepSearch, the first deep learning-based end-to-end database search method for tandem mass spectrometry. DeepSearch leverages a modified transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture under the contrastive learning framework. Unlike conventional methods that rely on ion-to-ion matching, DeepSearch adopts a data-driven approach to score peptide spectrum matches. DeepSearch is also the first deep learning-based method that can profile variable post-translational modifications in a zero-shot manner. We showed that DeepSearch's scoring scheme expressed less bias and did not require any statistical estimation. We validated DeepSearch's accuracy and robustness across various datasets, including those from species with diverse protein compositions and a modification-enriched dataset. DeepSearch sheds new light on database search methods in tandem mass spectrometry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yili Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved excellent performance in handling heterogeneous information networks (HINs). Curriculum learning is a machine learning strategy where training examples are presented to a model in a structured order, starting with easy examples and gradually increasing difficulty, aiming to improve learning efficiency and generalization. To better exploit the rich information in HINs, previous methods have started to explore the use of curriculum learning strategy to train HGNNs. Specifically, these works utilize the absolute value of the loss at each training epoch to evaluate the learning difficulty of each training sample. However, the relative loss, rather than the absolute value of loss, reveals the learning difficulty. Therefore, we propose a novel loss-decrease-aware training schedule (LDTS). LDTS uses the trend of loss decrease between each training epoch to better evaluating the difficulty of training samples, thereby enhancing the curriculum learning of HGNNs for downstream tasks. Additionally, we propose a sampling strategy to alleviate training imbalance issues. Our method further demonstrate the efficacy of curriculum learning in enhancing HGNNs capabilities. We call our method Loss-decrease-aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (LDHGNN). The code is public at https://github.com/wangyili00/LDHGNN.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper aims to enrich the capabilities of existing deep learning-based automated valuation models through an efficient graph representation of peer dependencies, thus capturing intricate spatial relationships. In particular, we develop two novel graph neural network models that effectively identify sequences of neighboring houses with similar features, employing different message passing algorithms. The first strategy consider standard spatial graph convolutions, while the second one utilizes transformer graph convolutions. This approach confers scalability to the modeling process. The experimental evaluation is conducted using a proprietary dataset comprising approximately 200,000 houses located in Santiago, Chile. We show that employing tailored graph neural networks significantly improves the accuracy of house price prediction, especially when utilizing transformer convolutional message passing layers.</p>

We exploit a Mamba-based regression model to characterize speech signals and build an SE system upon Mamba, termed SEMamba.

SEMamba demonstrates promising results and attains a PESQ score of 3.55 on the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset. When combined with the perceptual contrast stretching technique, the proposed SEMamba yields a new state-of-the-art PESQ score of 3.69.</p>

<p>Abstract: Engaging in recreational activities in public spaces poses challenges for blind people, often involving dependency on sighted help. Window shopping is a key recreational activity that remains inaccessible. In this paper, we investigate the information needs, challenges, and current approaches blind people have to recreational window shopping to inform the design of existing wayfinding and navigation technology for supporting blind shoppers in exploration and serendipitous discovery. We conduct a formative study with a total of 18 blind participants that include both focus groups (N=8) and interviews for requirements analysis (N=10). We find that there is a desire for push notifications of promotional information and pull notifications about shops of interest such as the targeted audience of a brand. Information about obstacles and points-of-interest required customization depending on one's mobility aid as well as presence of a crowd, children, and wheelchair users. We translate these findings into specific information modalities and rendering in the context of two existing AI-infused assistive applications: NavCog (a turn-by-turn navigation app) and Cabot (a navigation robot).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Drew Prinster, Samuel Stanton, Anqi Liu, Suchi Saria</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning (ML) gains widespread adoption, practitioners are increasingly seeking means to quantify and control the risk these systems incur. This challenge is especially salient when ML systems have autonomy to collect their own data, such as in black-box optimization and active learning, where their actions induce sequential feedback-loop shifts in the data distribution. Conformal prediction has emerged as a promising approach to uncertainty and risk quantification, but existing variants either fail to accommodate sequences of data-dependent shifts, or do not fully exploit the fact that agent-induced shift is under our control. In this work we prove that conformal prediction can theoretically be extended to \textit{any} joint data distribution, not just exchangeable or quasi-exchangeable ones, although it is exceedingly impractical to compute in the most general case. For practical applications, we outline a procedure for deriving specific conformal algorithms for any data distribution, and we use this procedure to derive tractable algorithms for a series of agent-induced covariate shifts. We evaluate the proposed algorithms empirically on synthetic black-box optimization and active learning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We evaluate the zero-shot ability of GPT-4 and LLaVa to perform simple Visual Network Analysis (VNA) tasks on small-scale graphs. We evaluate the Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 5 tasks related to three foundational network science concepts: identifying nodes of maximal degree on a rendered graph, identifying whether signed triads are balanced or unbalanced, and counting components. The tasks are structured to be easy for a human who understands the underlying graph theoretic concepts, and can all be solved by counting the appropriate elements in graphs. We find that while GPT-4 consistently outperforms LLaVa, both models struggle with every visual network analysis task we propose. We publicly release the first benchmark for the evaluation of VLMs on foundational VNA tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khanh Nguyen, Dimosthenis Karatzas</p>
<p>Abstract: An important handicap of document analysis research is that documents tend to be copyrighted or contain private information, which prohibits their open publication and the creation of centralised, large-scale document datasets. Instead, documents are scattered in private data silos, making extensive training over heterogeneous data a tedious task. In this work, we explore the use of a federated learning (FL) scheme as a way to train a shared model on decentralised private document data. We focus on the problem of Document VQA, a task particularly suited to this approach, as the type of reasoning capabilities required from the model can be quite different in diverse domains. Enabling training over heterogeneous document datasets can thus substantially enrich DocVQA models. We assemble existing DocVQA datasets from diverse domains to reflect the data heterogeneity in real-world applications. We explore the self-pretraining technique in this multi-modal setting, where the same data is used for both pretraining and finetuning, making it relevant for privacy preservation. We further propose combining self-pretraining with a Federated DocVQA training method using centralized adaptive optimization that outperforms the FedAvg baseline. With extensive experiments, we also present a multi-faceted analysis on training DocVQA models with FL, which provides insights for future research on this task. We show that our pretraining strategies can effectively learn and scale up under federated training with diverse DocVQA datasets and tuning hyperparameters is essential for practical document tasks under federation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungwook Han, Idan Shenfeld, Akash Srivastava, Yoon Kim, Pulkit Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to cater to different human preferences, learning new skills, and unlearning harmful behavior is an important problem. Search-based methods, such as Best-of-N or Monte-Carlo Tree Search, are performant, but impractical for LLM adaptation due to their high inference cost. On the other hand, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptation is computationally efficient, but performs worse due to the optimization challenges in co-training the value function and the policy. We present a new framework for reward optimization, Value Augmented Sampling (VAS), that can maximize different reward functions using data sampled from only the initial, frozen LLM. VAS solves for the optimal reward-maximizing policy without co-training the policy and the value function, making the optimization stable, outperforming established baselines, such as PPO and DPO, on standard benchmarks, and achieving comparable results to Best-of-128 with lower inference cost. Unlike existing RL methods that require changing the weights of the LLM, VAS does not require access to the weights of the pre-trained LLM. Thus, it can even adapt LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT), which are available only as APIs. In addition, our algorithm unlocks the new capability of composing several rewards and controlling the extent of each one during deployment time, paving the road ahead for the future of aligned, personalized LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atasi Panda, Anand Louis, Prajakta Nimbhorkar</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the probabilistic assignment of items to platforms that satisfies both group and individual fairness constraints. Each item belongs to specific groups and has a preference ordering over platforms. Each platform enforces group fairness by limiting the number of items per group that can be assigned to it. There could be multiple optimal solutions that satisfy the group fairness constraints, but this alone ignores item preferences. Our approach explores a `best of both worlds fairness' solution to get a randomized matching, which is ex-ante individually fair and ex-post group-fair. Thus, we seek a `probabilistic individually fair' distribution over `group-fair' matchings where each item has a `high' probability of matching to one of its top choices. This distribution is also ex-ante group-fair. Users can customize fairness constraints to suit their requirements. Our first result is a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a distribution over `group-fair' matchings such that the individual fairness constraints are approximately satisfied and the expected size of a matching is close to OPT. We empirically test this on real-world datasets. We present two additional polynomial-time bi-criteria approximation algorithms that users can choose from to balance group fairness and individual fairness trade-offs.
  For disjoint groups, we provide an exact polynomial-time algorithm adaptable to additional lower `group fairness' bounds. Extending our model, we encompass `maxmin group fairness,' amplifying underrepresented groups, and `mindom group fairness,' reducing the representation of dominant groups.'</p>

Specifically, several works in the literature provide quantitative explanations by computing the attribution scores of arguments. These works disregard the importance of attacks and supports, even though they play an essential role when explaining arguments' strength. In this paper, we propose a novel theory of Relation Attribution Explanations (RAEs), adapting Shapley values from game theory to offer fine-grained insights into the role of attacks and supports in quantitative bipolar argumentation towards obtaining the arguments' strength. We show that RAEs satisfy several desirable properties. We also propose a probabilistic algorithm to approximate RAEs efficiently. Finally, we show the application value of RAEs in fraud detection and large language models case studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tactile predictive models can be useful across several robotic manipulation tasks, e.g. robotic pushing, robotic grasping, slip avoidance, and in-hand manipulation. However, available tactile prediction models are mostly studied for image-based tactile sensors and there is no comparison study indicating the best performing models. In this paper, we presented two novel data-driven action-conditioned models for predicting tactile signals during real-world physical robot interaction tasks (1) action condition tactile prediction and (2) action conditioned tactile-video prediction models. We use a magnetic-based tactile sensor that is challenging to analyse and test state-of-the-art predictive models and the only existing bespoke tactile prediction model. We compare the performance of these models with those of our proposed models. We perform the comparison study using our novel tactile-enabled dataset containing 51,000 tactile frames of a real-world robotic manipulation task with 11 flat-surfaced household objects. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed tactile prediction models in terms of qualitative, quantitative and slip prediction scores.</p>

We investigate how non-random messages may encode information about the physical properties, such as dimension and length scales of the space in which a signal or message may have been originally encoded, embedded, or generated.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mevan Ekanayake, Zhifeng Chen, Mehrtash Harandi, Gary Egan, Zhaolin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), image acquisitions are often undersampled in the measurement domain to accelerate the scanning process, at the expense of image quality. However, image quality is a crucial factor that influences the accuracy of clinical diagnosis; hence, high-quality image reconstruction from undersampled measurements has been a key area of research. Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have emerged as the state-of-the-art for MRI reconstruction, typically involving deep neural networks to transform undersampled MRI images into high-quality MRI images through data-driven processes. Nevertheless, there is clear and significant room for improvement in undersampled DL MRI reconstruction to meet the high standards required for clinical diagnosis, in terms of eliminating aliasing artifacts and reducing image noise. In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised pretraining procedure using contrastive learning to improve the accuracy of undersampled DL MRI reconstruction. We use contrastive learning to transform the MRI image representations into a latent space that maximizes mutual information among different undersampled representations and optimizes the information content at the input of the downstream DL reconstruction models. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy across a range of acceleration factors and datasets, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, our extended experiments validate the proposed framework's robustness under adversarial conditions, such as measurement noise, different k-space sampling patterns, and pathological abnormalities, and also prove the transfer learning capabilities on MRI datasets with completely different anatomy. Additionally, we conducted experiments to visualize and analyze the properties of the proposed MRI contrastive learning latent space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Calibrating deep neural models plays an important role in building reliable, robust AI systems in safety-critical applications. Recent work has shown that modern neural networks that possess high predictive capability are poorly calibrated and produce unreliable model predictions. Though deep learning models achieve remarkable performance on various benchmarks, the study of model calibration and reliability is relatively underexplored. Ideal deep models should have not only high predictive performance but also be well calibrated. There have been some recent advances in calibrating deep models. In this survey, we review the state-of-the-art calibration methods and their principles for performing model calibration. First, we start with the definition of model calibration and explain the root causes of model miscalibration. Then we introduce the key metrics that can measure this aspect. It is followed by a summary of calibration methods that we roughly classify into four categories: post-hoc calibration, regularization methods, uncertainty estimation, and composition methods. We also cover recent advancements in calibrating large models, particularly large language models (LLMs). Finally, we discuss some open issues, challenges, and potential directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes and develops a physics-inspired neural network (PiNN) for learning the parameters of commercially implemented adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems in automotive industry. To emulate the core functionality of stock ACC systems, which have proprietary control logic and undisclosed parameters, the constant time-headway policy (CTHP) is adopted. Leveraging the multi-layer artificial neural networks as universal approximators, the developed PiNN serves as a surrogate model for the longitudinal dynamics of ACC-engaged vehicles, efficiently learning the unknown parameters of the CTHP. The PiNNs allow the integration of physical laws directly into the learning process. The ability of the PiNN to infer the unknown ACC parameters is meticulously assessed using both synthetic and high-fidelity empirical data of space-gap and relative velocity involving ACC-engaged vehicles in platoon formation. The results have demonstrated the superior predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in learning the unknown design parameters of stock ACC systems from different car manufacturers. The set of ACC model parameters obtained from the PiNN revealed that the stock ACC systems of the considered vehicles in three experimental campaigns are neither $\mathcal{L}_2$ nor $\mathcal{L}_\infty$ string stable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyue Yang, Zhen Fang, Yonggang Zhang, Yali Du, Furui Liu, Jean-Francois Ton, Jianhong Wang, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is indispensable for learning models in the wild, where testing distribution typically unknown and different from the training. Recent methods derived from causality have shown great potential in achieving OOD generalization. However, existing methods mainly focus on the invariance property of causes, while largely overlooking the property of \textit{sufficiency} and \textit{necessity} conditions. Namely, a necessary but insufficient cause (feature) is invariant to distribution shift, yet it may not have required accuracy. By contrast, a sufficient yet unnecessary cause (feature) tends to fit specific data well but may have a risk of adapting to a new domain. To capture the information of sufficient and necessary causes, we employ a classical concept, the probability of sufficiency and necessary causes (PNS), which indicates the probability of whether one is the necessary and sufficient cause. To associate PNS with OOD generalization, we propose PNS risk and formulate an algorithm to learn representation with a high PNS value. We theoretically analyze and prove the generalizability of the PNS risk. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The details of the implementation can be found at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ymy4323460/CaSN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Log data can reveal valuable information about how users interact with Web search services, what they want, and how satisfied they are. However, analyzing user intents in log data is not easy, especially for emerging forms of Web search such as AI-driven chat. To understand user intents from log data, we need a way to label them with meaningful categories that capture their diversity and dynamics. Existing methods rely on manual or machine-learned labeling, which are either expensive or inflexible for large and dynamic datasets. We propose a novel solution using large language models (LLMs), which can generate rich and relevant concepts, descriptions, and examples for user intents. However, using LLMs to generate a user intent taxonomy and apply it for log analysis can be problematic for two main reasons: (1) such a taxonomy is not externally validated; and (2) there may be an undesirable feedback loop. To address this, we propose a new methodology with human experts and assessors to verify the quality of the LLM-generated taxonomy. We also present an end-to-end pipeline that uses an LLM with human-in-the-loop to produce, refine, and apply labels for user intent analysis in log data. We demonstrate its effectiveness by uncovering new insights into user intents from search and chat logs from the Microsoft Bing commercial search engine. The proposed work's novelty stems from the method for generating purpose-driven user intent taxonomies with strong validation. This method not only helps remove methodological and practical bottlenecks from intent-focused research, but also provides a new framework for generating, validating, and applying other kinds of taxonomies in a scalable and adaptable way with reasonable human effort.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongfu Jiang, Yishan Li, Ge Zhang, Wenhao Huang, Bill Yuchen Lin, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present TIGERScore, a \textbf{T}rained metric that follows \textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{G}uidance to perform \textbf{E}xplainable, and \textbf{R}eference-free evaluation over a wide spectrum of text generation tasks. Different from other automatic evaluation methods that only provide arcane scores, TIGERScore is guided by natural language instruction to provide error analysis to pinpoint the mistakes in the generated text. Our metric is based on LLaMA-2, trained on our meticulously curated instruction-tuning dataset MetricInstruct which covers 6 text generation tasks and 23 text generation datasets. The dataset consists of 42K quadruple in the form of (instruction, input, system output $\rightarrow$ error analysis). We collected the `system outputs' through from a large variety of models to cover different types of errors. To quantitatively assess our metric, we evaluate its correlation with human ratings on 5 held-in datasets, 2 held-out datasets and show that TIGERScore can achieve the open-source SoTA correlation with human ratings across these datasets and almost approaches GPT-4 evaluator. As a reference-free metric, its correlation can even surpass the best existing reference-based metrics. To further qualitatively assess the rationale generated by our metric, we conduct human evaluation on the generated explanations and found that the explanations are 70.8\% accurate. Through these experimental results, we believe TIGERScore demonstrates the possibility of building universal explainable metrics to evaluate any text generation task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atharva Sehgal, Arya Grayeli, Jennifer J. Sun, Swarat Chaudhuri</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Cosmos, a framework for object-centric world modeling that is designed for compositional generalization (CompGen), i.e., high performance on unseen input scenes obtained through the composition of known visual "atoms." The central insight behind Cosmos is the use of a novel form of neurosymbolic grounding. Specifically, the framework introduces two new tools: (i) neurosymbolic scene encodings, which represent each entity in a scene using a real vector computed using a neural encoder, as well as a vector of composable symbols describing attributes of the entity, and (ii) a neurosymbolic attention mechanism that binds these entities to learned rules of interaction. Cosmos is end-to-end differentiable; also, unlike traditional neurosymbolic methods that require representations to be manually mapped to symbols, it computes an entity's symbolic attributes using vision-language foundation models. Through an evaluation that considers two different forms of CompGen on an established blocks-pushing domain, we show that the framework establishes a new state-of-the-art for CompGen in world modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Singh, Raviteja Chukkapalli, Shravan Chaudhari, Luoyao Chen, Mei Chen, Jinqian Pan, Craig Smuda, Jacopo Cirrone</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in clinical treatment are increasingly constrained by the limitations of supervised learning techniques, which depend heavily on large volumes of annotated data. The annotation process is not only costly but also demands substantial time from clinical specialists. Addressing this issue, we introduce the S4MI (Self-Supervision and Semi-Supervision for Medical Imaging) pipeline, a novel approach that leverages advancements in self-supervised and semi-supervised learning. These techniques engage in auxiliary tasks that do not require labeling, thus simplifying the scaling of machine supervision compared to fully-supervised methods. Our study benchmarks these techniques on three distinct medical imaging datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in classification and segmentation tasks. Notably, we observed that self supervised learning significantly surpassed the performance of supervised methods in the classification of all evaluated datasets. Remarkably, the semi-supervised approach demonstrated superior outcomes in segmentation, outperforming fully-supervised methods while using 50% fewer labels across all datasets. In line with our commitment to contributing to the scientific community, we have made the S4MI code openly accessible, allowing for broader application and further development of these methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parth Rawal, Mrunal Sompura, Wolfgang Hintze</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data is being used lately for training deep neural networks in computer vision applications such as object detection, object segmentation and 6D object pose estimation. Domain randomization hereby plays an important role in reducing the simulation to reality gap. However, this generalization might not be effective in specialized domains like a production environment involving complex assemblies. Either the individual parts, trained with synthetic images, are integrated in much larger assemblies making them indistinguishable from their counterparts and result in false positives or are partially occluded just enough to give rise to false negatives. Domain knowledge is vital in these cases and if conceived effectively while generating synthetic data, can show a considerable improvement in bridging the simulation to reality gap. This paper focuses on synthetic data generation procedures for parts and assemblies used in a production environment. The basic procedures for synthetic data generation and their various combinations are evaluated and compared on images captured in a production environment, where results show up to 15% improvement using combinations of basic procedures. Reducing the simulation to reality gap in this way can aid to utilize the true potential of robot assisted production using artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Tang, Jialu Wang, Yang Liu, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We reveal and address the frequently overlooked yet important issue of disguised procedural unfairness, namely, the potentially inadvertent alterations on the behavior of neutral (i.e., not problematic) aspects of data generating process, and/or the lack of procedural assurance of the greatest benefit of the least advantaged individuals. Inspired by John Rawls's advocacy for pure procedural justice, we view automated decision-making as a microcosm of social institutions, and consider how the data generating process itself can satisfy the requirements of procedural fairness. We propose a framework that decouples the objectionable data generating components from the neutral ones by utilizing reference points and the associated value instantiation rule. Our findings highlight the necessity of preventing disguised procedural unfairness, drawing attention not only to the objectionable data generating components that we aim to mitigate, but also more importantly, to the neutral components that we intend to keep unaffected.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taeyoon Kwon, Kai Tzu-iunn Ong, Dongjin Kang, Seungjun Moon, Jeong Ryong Lee, Dosik Hwang, Yongsik Sim, Beomseok Sohn, Dongha Lee, Jinyoung Yeo</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine reasoning has made great progress in recent years owing to large language models (LLMs). In the clinical domain, however, most NLP-driven projects mainly focus on clinical classification or reading comprehension, and under-explore clinical reasoning for disease diagnosis due to the expensive rationale annotation with clinicians. In this work, we present a "reasoning-aware" diagnosis framework that rationalizes the diagnostic process via prompt-based learning in a time- and labor-efficient manner, and learns to reason over the prompt-generated rationales. Specifically, we address the clinical reasoning for disease diagnosis, where the LLM generates diagnostic rationales providing its insight on presented patient data and the reasoning path towards the diagnosis, namely Clinical Chain-of-Thought (Clinical CoT). We empirically demonstrate LLMs/LMs' ability of clinical reasoning via extensive experiments and analyses on both rationale generation and disease diagnosis in various settings. We further propose a novel set of criteria for evaluating machine-generated rationales' potential for real-world clinical settings, facilitating and benefiting future research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chirag Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs make their way into many aspects of our lives, one place that warrants increased scrutiny with LLM usage is scientific research. Using LLMs for generating or analyzing data for research purposes is gaining popularity. But when such application is marred with ad-hoc decisions and engineering solutions, we need to be concerned about how it may affect that research, its findings, or any future works based on that research. We need a more scientific approach to using LLMs in our research. While there are several active efforts to support more systematic construction of prompts, they are often focused more on achieving desirable outcomes rather than producing replicable and generalizable knowledge with sufficient transparency, objectivity, or rigor. This article presents a new methodology inspired by codebook construction through qualitative methods to address that. Using humans in the loop and a multi-phase verification processes, this methodology lays a foundation for more systematic, objective, and trustworthy way of applying LLMs for analyzing data. Specifically, we show how a set of researchers can work through a rigorous process of labeling, deliberating, and documenting to remove subjectivity and bring transparency and replicability to prompt generation process. A set of experiments are presented to show how this methodology can be put in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niki Triantafyllou, Maria M. Papathanasiou</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces a framework to address the computational complexity inherent in Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) models by harnessing the potential of deep learning. By employing deep learning, we construct problem-specific heuristics that identify and exploit common structures across MIP instances. We train deep learning models to estimate complicating binary variables for target MIP problem instances. The resulting reduced MIP models are solved using standard off-the-shelf solvers. We present an algorithm for generating synthetic data enhancing the robustness and generalizability of our models across diverse MIP instances. We compare the effectiveness of (a) feed-forward neural networks (ANN) and (b) convolutional neural networks (CNN). To enhance the framework's performance, we employ Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, aiming to maximize the occurrence of global optimum solutions. We apply this framework to a flow-based facility location allocation MIP formulation that describes long-term investment planning and medium-term tactical scheduling in a personalized medicine supply chain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diwas Paudel, Tapas K. Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Players in pricing games with complex structures are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) aided learning algorithms to make pricing decisions for maximizing profits. This is raising concern for the antitrust agencies as the practice of using AI may promote tacit algorithmic collusion among otherwise independent players. Recent studies of games in canonical forms have shown contrasting claims ranging from none to a high level of tacit collusion among AI-guided players. In this paper, we examine the concern for tacit collusion by considering a practical game where EV charging hubs compete by dynamically varying their prices. Such a game is likely to be commonplace in the near future as EV adoption grows in all sectors of transportation. The hubs source power from the day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) electricity markets as well as from in-house battery storage systems. Their goal is to maximize profits via pricing and efficiently managing the cost of power usage. To aid our examination, we develop a two-step data-driven methodology. The first step obtains the DA commitment by solving a stochastic model. The second step generates the pricing strategies by solving a competitive Markov decision process model using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework. We evaluate the resulting pricing strategies using an index for the level of tacit algorithmic collusion. An index value of zero indicates no collusion (perfect competition) and one indicates full collusion (monopolistic behavior). Results from our numerical case study yield collusion index values between 0.14 and 0.45, suggesting a low to moderate level of collusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nouar AlDahoul, Talal Rahwan, Yasir Zaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative AI models such as Stable Diffusion are used daily by millions worldwide. However, the extent to which these models exhibit racial and gender stereotypes is not yet fully understood. Here, we document significant biases in Stable Diffusion across six races, two genders, 32 professions, and eight attributes. Additionally, we examine the degree to which Stable Diffusion depicts individuals of the same race as being similar to one another. This analysis reveals significant racial homogenization, e.g., depicting nearly all middle eastern men as dark-skinned, bearded, and wearing a traditional headdress. We then propose novel debiasing solutions that address the above stereotypes. Finally, using a preregistered experiment, we show that being presented with inclusive AI-generated faces reduces people's racial and gender biases, while being presented with non-inclusive ones increases such biases. This persists regardless of whether the images are labeled as AI-generated. Taken together, our findings emphasize the need to address biases and stereotypes in AI-generated content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulun Zhang, He Jiang, Varun Bhatt, Stefanos Nikolaidis, Jiaoyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We study how to use guidance to improve the throughput of lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). Previous studies have demonstrated that, while incorporating guidance, such as highways, can accelerate MAPF algorithms, this often results in a trade-off with solution quality. In addition, how to generate good guidance automatically remains largely unexplored, with current methods falling short of surpassing manually designed ones. In this work, we introduce the guidance graph as a versatile representation of guidance for lifelong MAPF, framing Guidance Graph Optimization as the task of optimizing its edge weights. We present two GGO algorithms to automatically generate guidance for arbitrary lifelong MAPF algorithms and maps. The first method directly optimizes edge weights, while the second method optimizes an update model capable of generating edge weights. Empirically, we show that (1) our guidance graphs improve the throughput of three representative lifelong MAPF algorithms in eight benchmark maps, and (2) our update model can generate guidance graphs for as large as $93 \times 91$ maps and as many as 3,000 agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro G. Bottero, Carlos E. Luis, Julia Vinogradska, Felix Berkenkamp, Jan Peters</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a sequential decision making task, where the goal is to optimize an unknown function without evaluating parameters that violate an a~priori unknown (safety) constraint. A common approach is to place a Gaussian process prior on the unknown functions and allow evaluations only in regions that are safe with high probability. Most current methods rely on a discretization of the domain and cannot be directly extended to the continuous case. Moreover, the way in which they exploit regularity assumptions about the constraint introduces an additional critical hyperparameter. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic safe exploration criterion that directly exploits the GP posterior to identify the most informative safe parameters to evaluate. The combination of this exploration criterion with a well known Bayesian optimization acquisition function yields a novel safe Bayesian optimization selection criterion. Our approach is naturally applicable to continuous domains and does not require additional explicit hyperparameters. We theoretically analyze the method and show that we do not violate the safety constraint with high probability and that we learn about the value of the safe optimum up to arbitrary precision. Empirical evaluations demonstrate improved data-efficiency and scalability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective incident management is pivotal for the smooth operation of enterprises-level cloud services. In order to expedite incident mitigation, service teams compile troubleshooting knowledge into Troubleshooting Guides (TSGs) accessible to on-call engineers (OCEs). While automated pipelines are enabled to resolve the most frequent and easy incidents, there still exist complex incidents that require OCEs' intervention. However, TSGs are often unstructured and incomplete, which requires manual interpretation by OCEs, leading to on-call fatigue and decreased productivity, especially among new-hire OCEs. In this work, we propose Nissist which leverages TSGs and incident mitigation histories to provide proactive suggestions, reducing human intervention. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLM), Nissist extracts insights from unstructured TSGs and historical incident mitigation discussions, forming a comprehensive knowledge base. Its multi-agent system design enhances proficiency in precisely discerning user queries, retrieving relevant information, and delivering systematic plans consecutively. Through our user case and experiment, we demonstrate that Nissist significant reduce Time to Mitigate (TTM) in incident mitigation, alleviating operational burdens on OCEs and improving service reliability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh-Hao Van, Alycia N. Carey, Xintao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Correctly classifying brain tumors is imperative to the prompt and accurate treatment of a patient. While several classification algorithms based on classical image processing or deep learning methods have been proposed to rapidly classify tumors in MR images, most assume the unrealistic setting of noise-free training data. In this work, we study a difficult but realistic setting of training a deep learning model on noisy MR images to classify brain tumors. We propose two training methods that are robust to noisy MRI training data, Influence-based Sample Reweighing (ISR) and Influence-based Sample Perturbation (ISP), which are based on influence functions from robust statistics. Using the influence functions, in ISR, we adaptively reweigh training examples according to how helpful/harmful they are to the training process, while in ISP, we craft and inject helpful perturbation proportional to the influence score. Both ISR and ISP harden the classification model against noisy training data without significantly affecting the generalization ability of the model on test data. We conduct empirical evaluations over a common brain tumor dataset and compare ISR and ISP to three baselines. Our empirical results show that ISR and ISP can efficiently train deep learning models robust against noisy training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangming Huang, Yingya Li, Shoaib Jameel, Yunfei Long, Giorgos Papanastasiou</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has substantially enhanced natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare research. However, the increasing complexity of DL-based NLP necessitates transparent model interpretability, or at least explainability, for reliable decision-making. This work presents a thorough scoping review of explainable and interpretable DL in healthcare NLP. The term "eXplainable and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence" (XIAI) is introduced to distinguish XAI from IAI. Different models are further categorized based on their functionality (model-, input-, output-based) and scope (local, global). Our analysis shows that attention mechanisms are the most prevalent emerging IAI technique. The use of IAI is growing, distinguishing it from XAI. The major challenges identified are that most XIAI does not explore "global" modelling processes, the lack of best practices, and the lack of systematic evaluation and benchmarks. One important opportunity is to use attention mechanisms to enhance multi-modal XIAI for personalized medicine. Additionally, combining DL with causal logic holds promise. Our discussion encourages the integration of XIAI in Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain-specific smaller models. In conclusion, XIAI adoption in healthcare requires dedicated in-house expertise. Collaboration with domain experts, end-users, and policymakers can lead to ready-to-use XIAI methods across NLP and medical tasks. While challenges exist, XIAI techniques offer a valuable foundation for interpretable NLP algorithms in healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: Does language help make sense of the visual world? How important is it to actually see the world rather than having it described with words? These basic questions about the nature of intelligence have been difficult to answer because we only had one example of an intelligent system -- humans -- and limited access to cases that isolated language or vision. However, the development of sophisticated Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by artificial intelligence researchers offers us new opportunities to explore the contributions that language and vision make to learning about the world. We ablate components from the cognitive architecture of these models to identify their contributions to learning new tasks from limited data. We find that a language model leveraging all components recovers a majority of a VLM's performance, despite its lack of visual input, and that language seems to allow this by providing access to prior knowledge and reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Biedma, Xiaoyuan Yi, Linus Huang, Maosong Sun, Xing Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the AI field but also pose potential safety and ethical risks. Deciphering LLMs' embedded values becomes crucial for assessing and mitigating their risks. Despite extensive investigation into LLMs' values, previous studies heavily rely on human-oriented value systems in social sciences. Then, a natural question arises: Do LLMs possess unique values beyond those of humans? Delving into it, this work proposes a novel framework, ValueLex, to reconstruct LLMs' unique value system from scratch, leveraging psychological methodologies from human personality/value research. Based on Lexical Hypothesis, ValueLex introduces a generative approach to elicit diverse values from 30+ LLMs, synthesizing a taxonomy that culminates in a comprehensive value framework via factor analysis and semantic clustering. We identify three core value dimensions, Competence, Character, and Integrity, each with specific subdimensions, revealing that LLMs possess a structured, albeit non-human, value system. Based on this system, we further develop tailored projective tests to evaluate and analyze the value inclinations of LLMs across different model sizes, training methods, and data sources. Our framework fosters an interdisciplinary paradigm of understanding LLMs, paving the way for future AI alignment and regulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxi Li, Jiajie Jin, Yujia Zhou, Yuyao Zhang, Peitian Zhang, Yutao Zhu, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) systems are crucial tools for users to access information, which have long been dominated by traditional methods relying on similarity matching. With the advancement of pre-trained language models, generative information retrieval (GenIR) emerges as a novel paradigm, attracting increasing attention. Currently, research in GenIR can be categorized into two aspects: generative document retrieval (GR) and reliable response generation. GR leverages the generative model's parameters for memorizing documents, enabling retrieval by directly generating relevant document identifiers without explicit indexing. Reliable response generation, on the other hand, employs language models to directly generate the information users seek, breaking the limitations of traditional IR in terms of document granularity and relevance matching, offering more flexibility, efficiency, and creativity, thus better meeting practical needs. This paper aims to systematically review the latest research progress in GenIR. We will summarize the advancements in GR regarding model training and structure, document identifier, incremental learning, etc., as well as progress in reliable response generation in aspects of internal knowledge memorization, external knowledge augmentation, etc. We also review the evaluation, challenges and future developments in GenIR systems. This review aims to offer a comprehensive reference for researchers, encouraging further development in the GenIR field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangchen Pan, Junfeng Wen, Chenjun Xiao, Philip Torr</p>
<p>Abstract: In traditional statistical learning, data points are usually assumed to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) following an unknown probability distribution. This paper presents a contrasting viewpoint, perceiving data points as interconnected and employing a Markov reward process (MRP) for data modeling. We reformulate the typical supervised learning as an on-policy policy evaluation problem within reinforcement learning (RL), introducing a generalized temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm as a resolution. Theoretically, our analysis draws connections between the solutions of linear TD learning and ordinary least squares (OLS). We also show that under specific conditions, particularly when noises are correlated, the TD's solution proves to be a more effective estimator than OLS. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of our generalized TD algorithms under linear function approximation. Empirical studies verify our theoretical results, examine the vital design of our TD algorithm and show practical utility across various datasets, encompassing tasks such as regression and image classification with deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoliang Dong, Haoyu Wang, Jun Sun, Xinyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: By training on text in various languages, large language models (LLMs) typically possess multilingual support and demonstrate remarkable capabilities in solving tasks described in different languages. However, LLMs can exhibit linguistic discrimination due to the uneven distribution of training data across languages. That is, LLMs are hard to keep the consistency of responses when faced with the same task but depicted in different languages.
  In this study, we first explore the consistency in the LLMs' outputs responding to queries in various languages from two aspects: safety and quality. We conduct this analysis with two datasets (AdvBench and NQ) based on four LLMs (Llama2-13b, Gemma-7b, GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini-pro). The results show that LLMs exhibit stronger human alignment capabilities with queries in English, French, Russian, and Spanish (only 1.04\% of harmful queries successfully jailbreak on average) compared to queries in Bengali, Georgian, Nepali and Maithili (27.7\% of harmful queries jailbreak successfully on average). Moreover, for queries in English, Danish, Czech and Slovenian, LLMs tend to produce responses with a higher quality (with 0.1494 $F_1$ score on average) compared to the other languages. Upon these findings, we propose LDFighter, a similarity-based voting, to mitigate the linguistic discrimination in LLMs. LDFighter ensures consistent service for different language speakers. We evaluate LDFighter with both benign queries and harmful queries. The results show that LDFighter not only significantly reduces the jailbreak success rate but also improve the response quality on average, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Liu, Ran Liu, Ye Zhu, Hua Wang, Youyang Qu, Rongsheng Li, Yongpan Sheng, Wray Buntine</p>
<p>Abstract: ChatGPT has changed the AI community and an active research line is the performance evaluation of ChatGPT. A key challenge for the evaluation is that ChatGPT is still closed-source and traditional benchmark datasets may have been used by ChatGPT as the training data. In this paper, (i) we survey recent studies which uncover the real performance levels of ChatGPT in seven categories of NLP tasks, (ii) review the social implications and safety issues of ChatGPT, and (iii) emphasize key challenges and opportunities for its evaluation. We hope our survey can shed some light on its blackbox manner, so that researchers are not misleaded by its surface generation.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04532">QServe: W4A8KV4 Quantization and System Co-design for Efficient LLM Serving</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujun Lin, Haotian Tang, Shang Yang, Zhekai Zhang, Guangxuan Xiao, Chuang Gan, Song Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference. Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving. We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM. Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization. As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Won-Gi Paeng, Daesuk Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: This short note is written for rapid communication of long context training and to share the idea of how to train it with low memory usage. In the note, we generalize the attention algorithm and neural network of Generative Pre-Trained Transformers and reinterpret it in Path integral formalism. First, the role of the transformer is understood as the time evolution of the token state and second, it is suggested that the all key-token states in the same time as the query-token can attend to the attention with the query token states. As a result of the repetitive time evolution, it is discussed that the token states in the past sequence meats the token states in the present sequence so that the attention between separated sequences becomes possible for maintaining infinite contextual information just by using low memory for limited size of sequence. For the experiment, the $12$ input token window size was taken and one GPU with $24$GB memory was used for the pre-training. It was confirmed that more than $150$ length context is preserved. The sampling result of the training, the code and the other details will be included in the revised version of this note later.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roelien C. Timmer, David Liebowitz, Surya Nepal, Salil S. Kanhere</p>
<p>Abstract: Honeyfiles are a particularly useful type of honeypot: fake files deployed to detect and infer information from malicious behaviour. This paper considers the challenge of naming honeyfiles so they are camouflaged when placed amongst real files in a file system. Based on cosine distances in semantic vector spaces, we develop two metrics for filename camouflage: one based on simple averaging and one on clustering with mixture fitting. We evaluate and compare the metrics, showing that both perform well on a publicly available GitHub software repository dataset.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04883">FreeBind: Free Lunch in Unified Multimodal Space via Knowledge Fusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehan Wang, Ziang Zhang, Xize Cheng, Rongjie Huang, Luping Liu, Zhenhui Ye, Haifeng Huang, Yang Zhao, Tao Jin, Peng Gao, Zhou Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Unified multi-model representation spaces are the foundation of multimodal understanding and generation. However, the billions of model parameters and catastrophic forgetting problems make it challenging to further enhance pre-trained unified spaces. In this work, we propose FreeBind, an idea that treats multimodal representation spaces as basic units, and freely augments pre-trained unified space by integrating knowledge from extra expert spaces via "space bonds". Specifically, we introduce two kinds of basic space bonds: 1) Space Displacement Bond and 2) Space Combination Bond. Based on these basic bonds, we design Complex Sequential & Parallel Bonds to effectively integrate multiple spaces simultaneously. Benefiting from the modularization concept, we further propose a coarse-to-fine customized inference strategy to flexibly adjust the enhanced unified space for different purposes. Experimentally, we bind ImageBind with extra image-text and audio-text expert spaces, resulting in three main variants: ImageBind++, InternVL_IB, and InternVL_IB++. These resulting spaces outperform ImageBind on 5 audio-image-text downstream tasks across 9 datasets. Moreover, via customized inference, it even surpasses the advanced audio-text and image-text expert spaces.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05858">Free-Moving Object Reconstruction and Pose Estimation with Virtual Camera</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haixin Shi, Yinlin Hu, Daniel Koguciuk, Juan-Ting Lin, Mathieu Salzmann, David Ferstl</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an approach for reconstructing free-moving object from a monocular RGB video. Most existing methods either assume scene prior, hand pose prior, object category pose prior, or rely on local optimization with multiple sequence segments. We propose a method that allows free interaction with the object in front of a moving camera without relying on any prior, and optimizes the sequence globally without any segments. We progressively optimize the object shape and pose simultaneously based on an implicit neural representation. A key aspect of our method is a virtual camera system that reduces the search space of the optimization significantly. We evaluate our method on the standard HO3D dataset and a collection of egocentric RGB sequences captured with a head-mounted device. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms most methods significantly, and is on par with recent techniques that assume prior information.</p>
