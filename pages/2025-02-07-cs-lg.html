<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihui Xie, Jie chen, Liyu Chen, Weichao Mao, Jingjing Xu, Lingpeng Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to critique and refine their outputs is crucial for building systems that can iteratively improve, yet it is fundamentally limited by the ability to provide accurate judgments and actionable suggestions. In this work, we study LLM critics for code generation and propose $\texttt{CTRL}$, a framework for $\texttt{C}$ritic $\texttt{T}$raining via $\texttt{R}$einforcement $\texttt{L}$earning, which trains a critic model to generate feedback that maximizes correction performance for a fixed generator model without human supervision. Our results demonstrate that critics trained with $\texttt{CTRL}$ significantly enhance pass rates and mitigate compounding errors across both base and stronger generator models. Furthermore, we show that these critic models act as accurate generative reward models and enable test-time scaling through iterative critique-revision, achieving up to 106.1% relative improvements across challenging code generation benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fred Zhangzhi Peng, Zachary Bezemek, Sawan Patel, Sherwood Yao, Jarrid Rector-Brooks, Alexander Tong, Pranam Chatterjee</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how the order in which tokens are unmasked during masked diffusion models (MDMs) inference affects generative quality. We derive an expanded evidence lower bound (ELBO) that introduces a planner, responsible for selecting which tokens to unmask at each step. Our analysis suggests that alternative unmasking strategies can improve generative performance. Based on these insights, we propose Path Planning (P2), a sampling framework that leverages pre-trained BERT or the denoiser itself to guide unmasking decisions. P2 generalizes all known MDM sampling strategies and enables significant improvements across diverse domains including language generation (in-context learning, code generation, story infilling, mathematical reasoning, reverse curse correction) and biological sequence generation (protein and RNA sequences).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Lin, Pengcheng Wang, Jeff Schneider, Guanya Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms that combine model-based planning and learned value/policy prior have gained significant recognition for their high data efficiency and superior performance in continuous control. However, we discover that existing methods that rely on standard SAC-style policy iteration for value learning, directly using data generated by the planner, often result in \emph{persistent value overestimation}. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we argue that this issue is deeply rooted in the structural policy mismatch between the data generation policy that is always bootstrapped by the planner and the learned policy prior. To mitigate such a mismatch in a minimalist way, we propose a policy regularization term reducing out-of-distribution (OOD) queries, thereby improving value learning. Our method involves minimum changes on top of existing frameworks and requires no additional computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach improves performance over baselines such as TD-MPC2 by large margins, particularly in 61-DoF humanoid tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele La Malfa, Christoph Weinhuber, Orazio Torre, Fangru Lin, X. Angelo Huang, Samuele Marro, Anthony Cohn, Nigel Shadbolt, Michael Wooldridge</p>
<p>Abstract: Many reasoning, planning, and problem-solving tasks share an intrinsic algorithmic nature: correctly simulating each step is a sufficient condition to solve them correctly. We collect pairs of naturalistic and synthetic reasoning tasks to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM). While naturalistic tasks often require careful human handcrafting, we show that synthetic data is, in many cases, a good proxy that is much easier to collect at scale. We leverage common constructs in programming as the counterpart of the building blocks of naturalistic reasoning tasks, such as straight-line programs, code that contains critical paths, and approximate and redundant instructions. We further assess the capabilities of LLMs on sorting problems and repeated operations via sorting algorithms and nested loops. Our synthetic datasets further reveal that while the most powerful LLMs exhibit relatively strong execution capabilities, the process is fragile: it is negatively affected by memorisation and seems to rely heavily on pattern recognition. Our contribution builds upon synthetically testing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs as a scalable complement to handcrafted human-annotated problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michelle M. Li, Kevin Li, Yasha Ektefaie, Shvat Messica, Marinka Zitnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequence models generate counterfactuals by modifying parts of a sequence based on a given condition, enabling reasoning about "what if" scenarios. While these models excel at conditional generation, they lack fine-grained control over when and where edits occur. Existing approaches either focus on univariate sequences or assume that interventions affect the entire sequence globally. However, many applications require precise, localized modifications, where interventions take effect only after a specified time and impact only a subset of co-occurring variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for counterfactual reasoning about both immediate and delayed effects. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when interventions should influence a sequence. With these concepts, CLEF selectively edits relevant time steps while preserving unaffected portions of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on cellular and patient trajectory datasets, where gene regulation affects only certain genes at specific time steps, or medical interventions alter only a subset of lab measurements. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing by up to 36.01% in MAE compared to baselines. Unlike prior methods, CLEF enables one-step generation of counterfactual sequences at any future time step, outperforming baselines by up to 65.71% in MAE. A case study on patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus shows that CLEF identifies clinical interventions that shift patient trajectories toward healthier outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liran Nochumsohn, Hedi Zisling, Omri Azencot</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data is important in many engineering and scientific applications. Recent state-of-the-art works ignore the inter-relations between variates, using their model on each variate independently. This raises several research questions related to proper modeling of multivariate data. In this work, we propose to view multivariate forecasting as a multi-task learning problem, facilitating the analysis of forecasting by considering the angle between task gradients and their balance. To do so, we analyze linear models to characterize the behavior of tasks. Our analysis suggests that tasks can be defined by grouping similar variates together, which we achieve via a simple clustering that depends on correlation-based similarities. Moreover, to balance tasks, we scale gradients with respect to their prediction error. Then, each task is solved with a linear model within our MTLinear framework. We evaluate our approach on challenging benchmarks in comparison to strong baselines, and we show it obtains on-par or better results on multivariate forecasting problems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damien Berriaud, Roger Wattenhofer</p>
<p>Abstract: We are given a set of elements in a metric space. The distribution of the elements is arbitrary, possibly adversarial. Can we weigh the elements in a way that is resistant to such (adversarial) manipulations? This problem arises in various contexts. For instance, the elements could represent data points, requiring robust domain adaptation. Alternatively, they might represent tasks to be aggregated into a benchmark; or questions about personal political opinions in voting advice applications. This article introduces a theoretical framework for dealing with such problems. We propose clone-proof representation functions as a solution concept. These functions distribute importance across elements of a set such that similar objects (``clones'') share (some of) their weights, thus avoiding a potential bias introduced by their multiplicity. Our framework extends the maximum uncertainty principle to accommodate general metric spaces and includes a set of axioms - symmetry, continuity, and clone-proofness - that guide the construction of representation functions. Finally, we address the existence of representation functions satisfying our axioms in the significant case of Euclidean spaces and propose a general method for their construction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anneke von Seeger, Dongmian Zou, Gilad Lerman</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) leverages information from a labeled source dataset to improve accuracy on a related but unlabeled target dataset. A common approach to UDA is aligning representations from the source and target domains by minimizing the distance between their data distributions. Previous methods have employed distances such as Wasserstein distance and maximum mean discrepancy. However, these approaches are less effective when the target data is significantly scarcer than the source data. Stein discrepancy is an asymmetric distance between distributions that relies on one distribution only through its score function. In this paper, we propose a novel \ac{uda} method that uses Stein discrepancy to measure the distance between source and target domains. We develop a learning framework using both non-kernelized and kernelized Stein discrepancy. Theoretically, we derive an upper bound for the generalization error. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods using other domain discrepancy measures when only small amounts of target data are available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03604">Bilevel ZOFO: Bridging Parameter-Efficient and Zeroth-Order Techniques for Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning and Meta-Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Shirkavand, Qi He, Peiran Yu, Heng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks using First-Order (FO) optimizers presents significant computational challenges. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) methods have been proposed to address these challenges by freezing most model parameters and training only a small subset. While PEFT is efficient, it may not outperform full fine-tuning when high task-specific performance is required. Zeroth-Order (ZO) methods offer an alternative for fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model by approximating gradients using only the forward pass, thus eliminating the computational burden of back-propagation in first-order methods. However, when implementing ZO methods, a hard prompt is crucial, and relying on simple, fixed hard prompts may not be optimal. In this paper, we propose a bilevel optimization framework that complements ZO methods with PEFT to mitigate sensitivity to hard prompts while efficiently and effectively fine-tuning LLMs. Our Bilevel ZOFO (Zeroth-Order-First-Order) method employs a double-loop optimization strategy, where only the gradient of the PEFT model and the forward pass of the base model are required. We provide convergence guarantees for Bilevel ZOFO. Empirically, we demonstrate that Bilevel ZOFO outperforms both PEFT and ZO methods in single-task settings while maintaining similar memory efficiency. Additionally, we show its strong potential for multitask learning. Compared to current first-order meta-training algorithms for multitask learning, our method has significantly lower computational demands while maintaining or improving performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03608">(GG) MoE vs. MLP on Tabular Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Chernov</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, significant efforts have been directed toward adapting modern neural network architectures for tabular data. However, despite their larger number of parameters and longer training and inference times, these models often fail to consistently outperform vanilla multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. Moreover, MLP-based ensembles have recently demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to advanced deep learning methods. Therefore, rather than focusing on building deeper and more complex deep learning models, we propose investigating whether MLP neural networks can be replaced with more efficient architectures without sacrificing performance. In this paper, we first introduce GG MoE, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with a Gumbel-Softmax gating function. We then demonstrate that GG MoE with an embedding layer achieves the highest performance across $38$ datasets compared to standard MoE and MLP models. Finally, we show that both MoE and GG MoE utilize significantly fewer parameters than MLPs, making them a promising alternative for scaling and ensemble methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sushil Shakya, Robert Abbas, Sasa Maric</p>
<p>Abstract: The IoT facilitates a connected, intelligent, and sustainable society; therefore, it is imperative to protect the IoT ecosystem. The IoT-based 5G and 6G will leverage the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) more to pave the way for autonomous and collaborative secure IoT networks. Zero-touch, zero-trust IoT security with AI and machine learning (ML) enablement frameworks offers a powerful approach to securing the expanding landscape of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This paper presents a novel framework based on the integration of Zero Trust, Zero Touch, and AI/ML powered for the detection, mitigation, and prevention of DDoS attacks in modern IoT ecosystems. The focus will be on the new integrated framework by establishing zero trust for all IoT traffic, fixed and mobile 5G/6G IoT network traffic, and data security (quarantine-zero touch and dynamic policy enforcement). We perform a comparative analysis of five machine learning models, namely, XGBoost, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Native Bayes, by comparing these models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Results show that the best performance in detecting and mitigating different DDoS vectors comes from the ensemble-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damjan Kalajdzievski</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of mechanistic interpretability in pre-trained transformer models has demonstrated substantial evidence supporting the ''linear representation hypothesis'', which is the idea that high level concepts are encoded as vectors in the space of activations of a model. Studies also show that model generation behavior can be steered toward a given concept by adding the concept's vector to the corresponding activations. We show how to leverage these properties to build a form of logical implication into models, enabling transparent and interpretable adjustments that induce a chosen generation behavior in response to the presence of any given concept. Our method, Logical Implication Model Steering (LIMS), unlocks new hand engineered reasoning capabilities by integrating neuro-symbolic logic into pre-trained transformer models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donald W. Peltier III, Isaac Kaminer, Abram Clark, Marko Orescanin</p>
<p>Abstract: Having the ability to infer characteristics of autonomous agents would profoundly revolutionize defense, security, and civil applications. Our previous work was the first to demonstrate that supervised neural network time series classification (NN TSC) could rapidly predict the tactics of swarming autonomous agents in military contexts, providing intelligence to inform counter-maneuvers. However, most autonomous interactions, especially military engagements, are fraught with uncertainty, raising questions about the practicality of using a pretrained classifier. This article addresses that challenge by leveraging expected operational variations to construct a richer dataset, resulting in a more robust NN with improved inference performance in scenarios characterized by significant uncertainties. Specifically, diverse datasets are created by simulating variations in defender numbers, defender motions, and measurement noise levels. Key findings indicate that robust NNs trained on an enriched dataset exhibit enhanced classification accuracy and offer operational flexibility, such as reducing resources required and offering adherence to trajectory constraints. Furthermore, we present a new framework for optimally deploying a trained NN by the defenders. The framework involves optimizing defender trajectories that elicit adversary responses that maximize the probability of correct NN tactic classification while also satisfying operational constraints imposed on the defenders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikael M{\o}ller H{\o}gsgaard</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in the binary classification setting by Hanneke [2016b] and Larsen [2023] have resulted in optimal PAC learners. These learners leverage, respectively, a clever deterministic subsampling scheme and the classic heuristic of bagging Breiman [1996]. Both optimal PAC learners use, as a subroutine, the natural algorithm of empirical risk minimization. Consequently, the computational cost of these optimal PAC learners is tied to that of the empirical risk minimizer algorithm. In this work, we seek to provide an alternative perspective on the computational cost imposed by the link to the empirical risk minimizer algorithm. To this end, we show the existence of an optimal PAC learner, which offers a different tradeoff in terms of the computational cost induced by the empirical risk minimizer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuli Jiang, Pranay Sharma, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Gauri Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of differentially private (DP) convex empirical risk minimization (ERM). While the standard DP-SGD algorithm is theoretically well-established, practical implementations often rely on shuffled gradient methods that traverse the training data sequentially rather than sampling with replacement in each iteration. Despite their widespread use, the theoretical privacy-accuracy trade-offs of private shuffled gradient methods (\textit{DP-ShuffleG}) remain poorly understood, leading to a gap between theory and practice. In this work, we leverage privacy amplification by iteration (PABI) and a novel application of Stein's lemma to provide the first empirical excess risk bound of \textit{DP-ShuffleG}. Our result shows that data shuffling results in worse empirical excess risk for \textit{DP-ShuffleG} compared to DP-SGD. To address this limitation, we propose \textit{Interleaved-ShuffleG}, a hybrid approach that integrates public data samples in private optimization. By alternating optimization steps that use private and public samples, \textit{Interleaved-ShuffleG} effectively reduces empirical excess risk. Our analysis introduces a new optimization framework with surrogate objectives, adaptive noise injection, and a dissimilarity metric, which can be of independent interest. Our experiments on diverse datasets and tasks demonstrate the superiority of \textit{Interleaved-ShuffleG} over several baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Indrashis Das, Mahmoud Safari, Steven Adriaensen, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation functions are fundamental elements of deep learning architectures as they significantly influence training dynamics. ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinglong Sun, Maying Shen, Hongxu Yin, Lei Mao, Pavlo Molchanov, Jose M. Alvarez</p>
<p>Abstract: Pruning aims to accelerate and compress models by removing redundant parameters, identified by specifically designed importance scores which are usually imperfect. This removal is irreversible, often leading to subpar performance in pruned models. Dynamic sparse training, while attempting to adjust sparse structures during training for continual reassessment and refinement, has several limitations including criterion inconsistency between pruning and growth, unsuitability for structured sparsity, and short-sighted growth strategies. Our paper introduces an efficient, innovative paradigm to enhance a given importance criterion for either unstructured or structured sparsity. Our method separates the model into an active structure for exploitation and an exploration space for potential updates. During exploitation, we optimize the active structure, whereas in exploration, we reevaluate and reintegrate parameters from the exploration space through a pruning and growing step consistently guided by the same given importance criterion. To prepare for exploration, we briefly "reactivate" all parameters in the exploration space and train them for a few iterations while keeping the active part frozen, offering a preview of the potential performance gains from reintegrating these parameters. We show on various datasets and configurations that existing importance criterion even simple as magnitude can be enhanced with ours to achieve state-of-the-art performance and training cost reductions. Notably, on ImageNet with ResNet50, ours achieves an +1.3 increase in Top-1 accuracy over prior art at 90% ERK sparsity. Compared with the SOTA latency pruning method HALP, we reduced its training cost by over 70% while attaining a faster and more accurate pruned model.</p>

Although many studies have demonstrated the privacy threats brought by GANs, no existing survey has systematically categorized the privacy and utility perspectives of GANs and VAEs. In this article, we comprehensively study privacy-preserving generative models, articulating the novel taxonomies for both privacy and utility metrics by analyzing 100 research publications. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future research directions that help new researchers gain insight into the underlying concepts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yikai Wu, Haoyu Zhao, Sanjeev Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: AI methods, such as generative models and reinforcement learning, have recently been applied to combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, especially NP-hard ones. This paper compares such GPU-based methods with classical CPU-based methods on Maximum Independent Set (MIS). Experiments on standard graph families show that AI-based algorithms fail to outperform and, in many cases, to match the solution quality of the state-of-art classical solver KaMIS running on a single CPU. Some GPU-based methods even perform similarly to the simplest heuristic, degree-based greedy. Even with post-processing techniques like local search, AI-based methods still perform worse than CPU-based solvers.
  We develop a new mode of analysis to reveal that non-backtracking AI methods, e.g. LTFT (which is based on GFlowNets), end up reasoning similarly to the simplest degree-based greedy approach, and thus worse than KaMIS. We also find that CPU-based algorithms, notably KaMIS, have strong performance on sparse random graphs, which appears to refute a well-known conjectured upper bound for efficient algorithms from Coja-Oghlan & Efthymiou (2015).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \'Isak P\'etursson, Mar\'ia \'Oskarsd\'ottir</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) are fundamental to modeling complex systems in physics, finance, and engineering, yet their numerical estimation remains a formidable challenge. Traditional methods rely on discretization, introducing computational inefficiencies, and limiting applicability in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we introduce a novel neural framework for SPDE estimation that eliminates the need for discretization, enabling direct estimation of expected values across arbitrary spatio-temporal points. We develop and compare two distinct neural architectures: Loss Enforced Conditions (LEC), which integrates physical constraints into the loss function, and Model Enforced Conditions (MEC), which embeds these constraints directly into the network structure. Through extensive experiments on the stochastic heat equation, Burgers' equation, and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, we reveal a trade-off: While LEC achieves superior residual minimization and generalization, MEC enforces initial conditions with absolute precision and exceptionally high accuracy in boundary condition enforcement. Our findings highlight the immense potential of neural-based SPDE solvers, particularly for high-dimensional problems where conventional techniques falter. By circumventing discretization and explicitly modeling uncertainty, our approach opens new avenues for solving SPDEs in fields ranging from quantitative finance to turbulence modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first neural framework capable of directly estimating the expected values of SPDEs in an entirely non-discretized manner, offering a step forward in scientific computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushagra Pandey, Farrin Marouf Sofian, Felix Draxler, Theofanis Karaletsos, Stephan Mandt</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit excellent sample quality, but existing guidance methods often require additional model training or are limited to specific tasks. We revisit guidance in diffusion models from the perspective of variational inference and control, introducing Diffusion Trajectory Matching (DTM) that enables guiding pretrained diffusion trajectories to satisfy a terminal cost. DTM unifies a broad class of guidance methods and enables novel instantiations. We introduce a new method within this framework that achieves state-of-the-art results on several linear and (blind) non-linear inverse problems without requiring additional model training or modifications. For instance, in ImageNet non-linear deblurring, our model achieves an FID score of 34.31, significantly improving over the best pretrained-method baseline (FID 78.07). We will make the code available in a future update.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khanh Nguyen, Raouf Kerkouche, Mario Fritz, Dimosthenis Karatzas</p>
<p>Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) has introduced a new paradigm for end-to-end document understanding, and quickly became one of the standard benchmarks for multimodal LLMs. Automating document processing workflows, driven by DocVQA models, presents significant potential for many business sectors. However, documents tend to contain highly sensitive information, raising concerns about privacy risks associated with training such DocVQA models. One significant privacy vulnerability, exploited by the membership inference attack, is the possibility for an adversary to determine if a particular record was part of the model's training data. In this paper, we introduce two novel membership inference attacks tailored specifically to DocVQA models. These attacks are designed for two different adversarial scenarios: a white-box setting, where the attacker has full access to the model architecture and parameters, and a black-box setting, where only the model's outputs are available. Notably, our attacks assume the adversary lacks access to auxiliary datasets, which is more realistic in practice but also more challenging. Our unsupervised methods outperform existing state-of-the-art membership inference attacks across a variety of DocVQA models and datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness and highlighting the privacy risks in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Basavasagar Patil, Akansha Kalra, Guanhong Tao, Daniel S. Brown</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) algorithms have shown promising results in robotic manipulation tasks, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on both classic and recently proposed algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC), LSTM-GMM, Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC), Diffusion Policy (DP), and VQ-Behavior Transformer (VQ-BET). We study the vulnerability of these methods to untargeted, targeted and universal adversarial perturbations. While explicit policies, such as BC, LSTM-GMM and VQ-BET can be attacked in the same manner as standard computer vision models, we find that attacks for implicit and denoising policy models are nuanced and require developing novel attack methods. Our experiments on several simulated robotic manipulation tasks reveal that most of the current methods are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. We also show that these attacks are transferable across algorithms, architectures, and tasks, raising concerning security vulnerabilities with potentially a white-box threat model. In addition, we test the efficacy of a randomized smoothing, a widely used adversarial defense technique, and highlight its limitation in defending against attacks on complex and multi-modal action distribution common in complex control tasks. In summary, our findings highlight the vulnerabilities of modern BC algorithms, paving way for future work in addressing such limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziang Chen, Qiao Zhang, Runzhong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in graph-related contexts. It is known that the separation power of GNNs is equivalent to that of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test; hence, GNNs are imperfect at identifying all non-isomorphic graphs, which severely limits their expressive power. This work investigates $k$-hop subgraph GNNs that aggregate information from neighbors with distances up to $k$ and incorporate the subgraph structure. We prove that under appropriate assumptions, the $k$-hop subgraph GNNs can approximate any permutation-invariant/equivariant continuous function over graphs without cycles of length greater than $2k+1$ within any error tolerance. We also provide an extension to $k$-hop GNNs without incorporating the subgraph structure. Our numerical experiments on established benchmarks and novel architectures validate our theory on the relationship between the information aggregation distance and the cycle size.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a machine learning approach to the optimal control of fluid restless multi-armed bandits (FRMABs) with state equations that are either affine or quadratic in the state variables. By deriving fundamental properties of FRMAB problems, we design an efficient machine learning based algorithm. Using this algorithm, we solve multiple instances with varying initial states to generate a comprehensive training set. We then learn a state feedback policy using Optimal Classification Trees with hyperplane splits (OCT-H). We test our approach on machine maintenance, epidemic control and fisheries control problems. Our method yields high-quality state feedback policies and achieves a speed-up of up to 26 million times compared to a direct numerical algorithm for fluid problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongkang Guo, Yuqing Kong, Jialiang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Rating aggregation plays a crucial role in various fields, such as product recommendations, hotel rankings, and teaching evaluations. However, traditional averaging methods can be affected by participation bias, where some raters do not participate in the rating process, leading to potential distortions. In this paper, we consider a robust rating aggregation task under the participation bias. We assume that raters may not reveal their ratings with a certain probability depending on their individual ratings, resulting in partially observed samples. Our goal is to minimize the expected squared loss between the aggregated ratings and the average of all underlying ratings (possibly unobserved) in the worst-case scenario.
  We focus on two settings based on whether the sample size (i.e. the number of raters) is known. In the first setting, where the sample size is known, we propose an aggregator, named as the Balanced Extremes Aggregator. It estimates unrevealed ratings with a balanced combination of extreme ratings. When the sample size is unknown, we derive another aggregator, the Polarizing-Averaging Aggregator, which becomes optimal as the sample size grows to infinity. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed aggregators in mitigating participation bias, compared to simple averaging and the spectral method. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our aggregators on a real-world dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hee-Jun Jung, Jaehyoung Jeong, Kangil Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Disentanglement learning is a core issue for understanding and re-using trained information in Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), and effective inductive bias has been reported as a key factor. However, the actual implementation of such bias is still vague. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Multiple Invertible and partial-equivariant transformation (MIPE-transformation), to inject inductive bias by 1) guaranteeing the invertibility of latent-to-latent vector transformation while preserving a certain portion of equivariance of input-to-latent vector transformation, called Invertible and partial-equivariant transformation (IPE-transformation), 2) extending the form of prior and posterior in VAE frameworks to an unrestricted form through a learnable conversion to an approximated exponential family, called Exponential Family conversion (EF-conversion), and 3) integrating multiple units of IPE-transformation and EF-conversion, and their training. In experiments on 3D Cars, 3D Shapes, and dSprites datasets, MIPE-transformation improves the disentanglement performance of state-of-the-art VAEs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a critical problem in optimization and machine learning, where accuracy and efficiency are paramount. Although entropic regularization and the Sinkhorn algorithm improve scalability, they frequently encounter numerical instability and slow convergence, especially when the regularization parameter is small. In this work, we introduce Proximal Iterations with Sparse Newton and Sinkhorn methods (PINS) to efficiently compute highly accurate solutions for large-scale OT problems. A reduced computational complexity through overall sparsity and global convergence are guaranteed by rigorous theoretical analysis. Our approach offers three key advantages: it achieves accuracy comparable to exact solutions, progressively accelerates each iteration for greater efficiency, and enhances robustness by reducing sensitivity to regularization parameters. Extensive experiments confirm these advantages, demonstrating superior performance compared to related methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapidly growing field of single-cell transcriptomic sequencing (scRNAseq) presents challenges for data analysis due to its massive datasets. A common method in manifold learning consists in hypothesizing that datasets lie on a lower dimensional manifold. This allows to study the geometry of point clouds by extracting meaningful descriptors like curvature. In this work, we will present Adaptive Local PCA (AdaL-PCA), a data-driven method for accurately estimating various notions of intrinsic curvature on data manifolds, in particular principal curvatures for surfaces. The model relies on local PCA to estimate the tangent spaces. The evaluation of AdaL-PCA on sampled surfaces shows state-of-the-art results. Combined with a PHATE embedding, the model applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data allows us to identify key variations in the cellular differentiation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) facilitates rapid adaptation to unseen tasks but faces challenges in long-horizon environments. Skill-based approaches tackle this by decomposing state-action sequences into reusable skills and employing hierarchical decision-making. However, these methods are highly susceptible to noisy offline demonstrations, resulting in unstable skill learning and degraded performance. To overcome this, we propose Prioritized Refinement for Skill-Based Meta-RL (PRISM), a robust framework that integrates exploration near noisy data to generate online trajectories and combines them with offline data. Through prioritization, PRISM extracts high-quality data to learn task-relevant skills effectively. By addressing the impact of noise, our method ensures stable skill learning and achieves superior performance in long-horizon tasks, even with noisy and sub-optimal data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weizhi Li, Natalie Klein, Brendan Gifford, Elizabeth Sklute, Carey Legett, Samuel Clegg</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of characterizing the chemical composition of planetary surfaces using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we seek to predict the multi-oxide weights of rock samples based on spectroscopic data collected under Martian conditions. We frame this problem as a multi-target regression task and propose a novel regularization method based on f-divergence. The f-divergence regularization is designed to constrain the distributional discrepancy between predictions and noisy targets. This regularizer serves a dual purpose: on the one hand, it mitigates overfitting by enforcing a constraint on the distributional difference between predictions and noisy targets. On the other hand, it acts as an auxiliary loss function, penalizing the neural network when the divergence between the predicted and target distributions becomes too large. To enable backpropagation during neural network training, we develop a differentiable f-divergence and incorporate it into the f-divergence regularization, making the network training feasible. We conduct experiments using spectra collected in a Mars-like environment by the remote-sensing instruments aboard the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers. Experimental results on multi-oxide weight prediction demonstrate that the proposed $f$-divergence regularization performs better than or comparable to standard regularization methods including $L_1$, $L_2$, and dropout. Notably, combining the $f$-divergence regularization with these standard regularization further enhances performance, outperforming each regularization method used independently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Louai Shehab, Antoine Aspeel, Necmiye Ozay</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning is the problem of inferring a reward function from an optimal policy. In this work, it is assumed that the reward is expressed as a reward machine whose transitions depend on atomic propositions associated with the state of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our goal is to identify the true reward machine using finite information. To this end, we first introduce the notion of a prefix tree policy which associates a distribution of actions to each state of the MDP and each attainable finite sequence of atomic propositions. Then, we characterize an equivalence class of reward machines that can be identified given the prefix tree policy. Finally, we propose a SAT-based algorithm that uses information extracted from the prefix tree policy to solve for a reward machine. It is proved that if the prefix tree policy is known up to a sufficient (but finite) depth, our algorithm recovers the exact reward machine up to the equivalence class. This sufficient depth is derived as a function of the number of MDP states and (an upper bound on) the number of states of the reward machine. Several examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic prompt caches reduce the latency and cost of large language model (LLM) inference by reusing cached LLM-generated responses for semantically similar prompts. Vector similarity metrics assign a numerical score to quantify the similarity between an embedded prompt and its nearest neighbor in the cache. Existing systems rely on a static threshold to classify whether the similarity score is sufficiently high to result in a cache hit. We show that this one-size-fits-all threshold is insufficient across different prompts. We propose VectorQ, a framework to learn embedding-specific threshold regions that adapt to the complexity and uncertainty of an embedding. Through evaluations on a combination of four diverse datasets, we show that VectorQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems across all static thresholds, achieving up to 12x increases in cache hit rate and error rate reductions up to 92%.</p>

However, many circumstances where these are demanded are adversarial in nature, meaning the involved parties have misaligned interests and are incentivized to manipulate explanations for their purpose.

<p>Abstract: Neighbor embedding is widely employed to visualize high-dimensional data; however, it frequently overlooks the global structure, e.g., intercluster similarities, thereby impeding accurate visualization. To address this problem, this paper presents Star-attracted Manifold Approximation and Projection (StarMAP), which incorporates the advantage of principal component analysis (PCA) in neighbor embedding. Inspired by the property of PCA embedding, which can be viewed as the largest shadow of the data, StarMAP introduces the concept of \textit{star attraction} by leveraging the PCA embedding. This approach yields faithful global structure preservation while maintaining the interpretability and computational efficiency of neighbor embedding. StarMAP was compared with existing methods in the visualization tasks of toy datasets, single-cell RNA sequencing data, and deep representation. The experimental results show that StarMAP is simple but effective in realizing faithful visualizations.</p>

Our analysis establishes that, under mild smoothness and contractivity assumptions, a generalized update scheme not only unifies classical methods such as mirror descent and dynamic programming but also captures modern chain-of-thought reasoning processes in large language models. In particular, we prove that our accelerated iterative update achieves an $O(1/t^2)$ convergence rate in the absence of persistent perturbations, and we further demonstrate that feedback (iterative) architectures are necessary to approximate certain fixed-point functions efficiently. These theoretical insights bridge classical acceleration techniques with contemporary applications in neural computation and optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youssef Marzouk, Zhi Ren, Jakob Zech</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide expressive representations of invertible transport maps that can be used to approximate complex probability distributions, e.g., for generative modeling, density estimation, and Bayesian inference. We show that for a large class of transport maps $T$, there exists a time-dependent ODE velocity field realizing a straight-line interpolation $(1-t)x + tT(x)$, $t \in [0,1]$, of the displacement induced by the map. Moreover, we show that such velocity fields are minimizers of a training objective containing a specific minimum-energy regularization. We then derive explicit upper bounds for the $C^k$ norm of the velocity field that are polynomial in the $C^k$ norm of the corresponding transport map $T$; in the case of triangular (Knothe--Rosenblatt) maps, we also show that these bounds are polynomial in the $C^k$ norms of the associated source and target densities. Combining these results with stability arguments for distribution approximation via ODEs, we show that Wasserstein or Kullback--Leibler approximation of the target distribution to any desired accuracy $\epsilon > 0$ can be achieved by a deep neural network representation of the velocity field whose size is bounded explicitly in terms of $\epsilon$, the dimension, and the smoothness of the source and target densities. The same neural network ansatz yields guarantees on the value of the regularized training objective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Hu, Zhenjie Zheng, Monica Menendez, Wei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Network-wide traffic flow, which captures dynamic traffic volume on each link of a general network, is fundamental to smart mobility applications. However, the observed traffic flow from sensors is usually limited across the entire network due to the associated high installation and maintenance costs. To address this issue, existing research uses various supplementary data sources to compensate for insufficient sensor coverage and estimate the unobserved traffic flow. Although these studies have shown promising results, the inconsistent availability and quality of supplementary data across cities make their methods typically face a trade-off challenge between accuracy and generality. In this research, we first time advocate using the Global Open Multi-Source (GOMS) data within an advanced deep learning framework to break the trade-off. The GOMS data primarily encompass geographical and demographic information, including road topology, building footprints, and population density, which can be consistently collected across cities. More importantly, these GOMS data are either causes or consequences of transportation activities, thereby creating opportunities for accurate network-wide flow estimation. Furthermore, we use map images to represent GOMS data, instead of traditional tabular formats, to capture richer and more comprehensive geographical and demographic information. To address multi-source data fusion, we develop an attention-based graph neural network that effectively extracts and synthesizes information from GOMS maps while simultaneously capturing spatiotemporal traffic dynamics from observed traffic data. A large-scale case study across 15 cities in Europe and North America was conducted. The results demonstrate stable and satisfactory estimation accuracy across these cities, which suggests that the trade-off challenge can be successfully addressed using our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elise Zhang, Fran\c{c}ois Mirall\`es, Rapha\"el Rousseau-Rizzi, Arnaud Zinflou, Di Wu, Benoit Boulet</p>
<p>Abstract: Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) is a powerful method for detecting causality in coupled nonlinear dynamical systems, providing a model-free approach to capture dynamic causal interactions. Partial Cross Mapping (PCM) was introduced as an extension of CCM to address indirect causality in three-variable systems by comparing cross-mapping quality between direct cause-effect mapping and indirect mapping through an intermediate conditioning variable. However, PCM remains limited to univariate delay embeddings in its cross-mapping processes. In this work, we extend PCM to the multivariate setting, introducing multiPCM, which leverages multivariate embeddings to more effectively distinguish indirect causal relationships. We further propose a multivariate cross-mapping framework (MXMap) for causal discovery in dynamical systems. This two-phase framework combines (1) pairwise CCM tests to establish an initial causal graph and (2) multiPCM to refine the graph by pruning indirect causal connections. Through experiments on simulated data and the ERA5 Reanalysis weather dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MXMap. Additionally, MXMap is compared against several baseline methods, showing advantages in accuracy and causal graph refinement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijiashun Qi, Quanchao Lu, Shiyu Dou, Xiaoxuan Sun, Muqing Li, Yankaiqi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a hierarchical mining framework for high-dimensional imbalanced data, leveraging a depth graph model to address the inherent performance limitations of conventional approaches in handling complex, high-dimensional data distributions with imbalanced sample representations. By constructing a structured graph representation of the dataset and integrating graph neural network (GNN) embeddings, the proposed method effectively captures global interdependencies among samples. Furthermore, a hierarchical strategy is employed to enhance the characterization and extraction of minority class feature patterns, thereby facilitating precise and robust imbalanced data mining. Empirical evaluations across multiple experimental scenarios validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, demonstrating substantial improvements over traditional methods in key performance metrics, including pattern discovery count, average support, and minority class coverage. Notably, the method exhibits superior capabilities in minority-class feature extraction and pattern correlation analysis. These findings underscore the potential of depth graph models, in conjunction with hierarchical mining strategies, to significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of imbalanced data analysis. This research contributes a novel computational framework for high-dimensional complex data processing and lays the foundation for future extensions to dynamically evolving imbalanced data and multi-modal data applications, thereby expanding the applicability of advanced data mining methodologies to more intricate analytical domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Iwaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Regularization is a core component of recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Mirror Descent Value Iteration (MDVI) uses both Kullback-Leibler divergence and entropy as regularizers in its value and policy updates. Despite its empirical success in discrete action domains and strong theoretical guarantees, the performance of a MDVI-based method does not surpass an entropy-only-regularized method in continuous action domains. In this study, we propose Mirror Descent Actor Critic (MDAC) as an actor-critic style instantiation of MDVI for continuous action domains, and show that its empirical performance is significantly boosted by bounding the actor's log-density terms in the critic's loss function, compared to a non-bounded naive instantiation. Further, we relate MDAC to Advantage Learning by recalling that the actor's log-probability is equal to the regularized advantage function in tabular cases, and theoretically discuss when and why bounding the advantage terms is validated and beneficial. We also empirically explore a good choice for the bounding function, and show that MDAC perfoms better than strong non-regularized and entropy-only-regularized methods with an appropriate choice of the bounding function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Du, Dongheng Chen, Hao Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection based on 3D point cloud data is an important research problem and receives more and more attention recently. Untrained anomaly detection based on only one sample is an emerging research problem motivated by real manufacturing industries such as personalized manufacturing that only one sample can be collected without any additional labels. How to accurately identify anomalies based on one 3D point cloud sample is a critical challenge in both industrial applications and the field of machine learning. This paper aims to provide a formal definition of untrained anomaly detection problem based on 3D point cloud data, discuss the differences between untrained anomaly detection and current unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Unlike unsupervised learning, untrained methods do not rely on any data, including unlabeled data. Instead, they leverage prior knowledge about the manufacturing surfaces and anomalies. Examples are used to illustrate these prior knowledge and untrained machine learning model. Afterwards, literature review on untrained anomaly detection based on 3D point cloud data is also provided, and the potential of untrained deep neural networks for anomaly detection is also discussed as outlooks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peizhuang Cong, Wenpu Liu, Wenhan Yu, Haochen Zhao, Tong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various tasks, accompanied by a continuous increase in their parameter size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), address the challenges of fine-tuning LLMs by significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Recent studies have integrated LoRA with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, leveraging multiple adapter experts and gating mechanisms to further improve fine-tuning performance. However, existing approaches primarily focus on adjusting the allocations of adapter experts per layer to optimize the introduced trainable parameter size, while neglecting a critical factor of adapters' rank. To this end, we propose a hierarchical scheme for expert allocation and rank configuration, HILO, which dynamically adjusts the number and rank of adapter experts across layers, matching the varying representational complexity of model layers in adapter-granularity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate that HILO outperforms existing methods in accuracy while introducing fewer trainable parameters, providing an efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a transformer architecture-based foundation model for tasks at high-energy particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider. We train the model to classify jets using a self-supervised strategy inspired by the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture. We use the JetClass dataset containing 100M jets of various known particles to pre-train the model with a data-centric approach -- the model uses a fraction of the jet constituents as the context to predict the embeddings of the unseen target constituents. Our pre-trained model fares well with other datasets for standard classification benchmark tasks. We test our model on two additional downstream tasks: top tagging and differentiating light-quark jets from gluon jets. We also evaluate our model with task-specific metrics and baselines and compare it with state-of-the-art models in high-energy physics. Project site: https://hep-jepa.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanyuan Li, Neeraj Sarna, Yang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning models are being extensively used in safety critical applications where errors from these models could cause harm to the user. Such risks are amplified when multiple machine learning models, which are deployed concurrently, interact and make errors simultaneously. This paper explores three scenarios where error correlations between multiple models arise, resulting in such aggregated risks. Using real-world data, we simulate these scenarios and quantify the correlations in errors of different models. Our findings indicate that aggregated risks are substantial, particularly when models share similar algorithms, training datasets, or foundational models. Overall, we observe that correlations across models are pervasive and likely to intensify with increased reliance on foundational models and widely used public datasets, highlighting the need for effective mitigation strategies to address these challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor OK Li, Yang Han, Jacqueline CK Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects over 55 million people globally, yet the key genetic contributors remain poorly understood. Leveraging recent advancements in genomic foundation models, we present the innovative Reverse-Gene-Finder technology, a ground-breaking neuron-to-gene-token backtracking approach in a neural network architecture to elucidate the novel causal genetic biomarkers driving AD onset. Reverse-Gene-Finder comprises three key innovations. Firstly, we exploit the observation that genes with the highest probability of causing AD, defined as the most causal genes (MCGs), must have the highest probability of activating those neurons with the highest probability of causing AD, defined as the most causal neurons (MCNs). Secondly, we utilize a gene token representation at the input layer to allow each gene (known or novel to AD) to be represented as a discrete and unique entity in the input space. Lastly, in contrast to the existing neural network architectures, which track neuron activations from the input layer to the output layer in a feed-forward manner, we develop an innovative backtracking method to track backwards from the MCNs to the input layer, identifying the Most Causal Tokens (MCTs) and the corresponding MCGs. Reverse-Gene-Finder is highly interpretable, generalizable, and adaptable, providing a promising avenue for application in other disease scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the potential of multimodal data integration, which combines electroencephalogram (EEG) data with sociodemographic characteristics like age, sex, education, and intelligence quotient (IQ), to diagnose mental diseases like schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety. Using Apache Spark and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a data-driven classification pipeline has been developed for big data environment to effectively analyze massive datasets. In order to evaluate brain activity and connection patterns associated with mental disorders, EEG parameters such as power spectral density (PSD) and coherence are examined. The importance of coherence features is highlighted by comparative analysis, which shows significant improvement in classification accuracy and robustness. This study emphasizes the significance of holistic approaches for efficient diagnostic tools by integrating a variety of data sources. The findings open the door for creative, data-driven approaches to treating psychiatric diseases by demonstrating the potential of utilizing big data, sophisticated deep learning methods, and multimodal datasets to enhance the precision, usability, and comprehension of mental health diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yousef Koka, David Selby, Gerrit Gro{\ss}mann, Sebastian Vollmer</p>
<p>Abstract: Data preprocessing is a critical yet frequently neglected aspect of machine learning, often paid little attention despite its potentially significant impact on model performance. While automated machine learning pipelines are starting to recognize and integrate data preprocessing into their solutions for classification and regression tasks, this integration is lacking for more specialized tasks like survival or time-to-event models. As a result, survival analysis not only faces the general challenges of data preprocessing but also suffers from the lack of tailored, automated solutions in this area.
  To address this gap, this paper presents 'CleanSurvival', a reinforcement-learning-based solution for optimizing preprocessing pipelines, extended specifically for survival analysis. The framework can handle continuous and categorical variables, using Q-learning to select which combination of data imputation, outlier detection and feature extraction techniques achieves optimal performance for a Cox, random forest, neural network or user-supplied time-to-event model. The package is available on GitHub: https://github.com/datasciapps/CleanSurvival
  Experimental benchmarks on real-world datasets show that the Q-learning-based data preprocessing results in superior predictive performance to standard approaches, finding such a model up to 10 times faster than undirected random grid search. Furthermore, a simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness in different types and levels of missingness and noise in the data.</p>

<p>Abstract: From medical diagnosis to autonomous vehicles, critical applications rely on the integration of multiple heterogeneous data modalities. Multimodal Variational Autoencoders offer versatile and scalable methods for generating unobserved modalities from observed ones. Recent models using mixturesof-experts aggregation suffer from theoretically grounded limitations that restrict their generation quality on complex datasets. In this article, we propose a novel interpretable model able to learn both joint and conditional distributions without introducing mixture aggregation. Our model follows a multistage training process: first modeling the joint distribution with variational inference and then modeling the conditional distributions with Normalizing Flows to better approximate true posteriors. Importantly, we also propose to extract and leverage the information shared between modalities to improve the conditional coherence of generated samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose an innovative algorithm for non-convex composite federated learning that decouples the proximal operator evaluation and the communication between server and clients. Moreover, each client uses local updates to communicate less frequently with the server, sends only a single d-dimensional vector per communication round, and overcomes issues with client drift. In the analysis, challenges arise from the use of decoupling strategies and local updates in the algorithm, as well as from the non-convex and non-smooth nature of the problem. We establish sublinear and linear convergence to a bounded residual error under general non-convexity and the proximal Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality, respectively. In the numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keon Vin Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical constraints into deep learning models. However, standard PINNs often require a large number of training samples to achieve high accuracy, leading to increased computational costs. To address this issue, we propose Active Learning-Driven PINNs (AL-PINN), which integrates Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Active Learning (AL) strategies to optimize sample selection dynamically.
  AL-PINN utilizes Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate epistemic uncertainty in the model predictions, enabling the adaptive selection of high-uncertainty regions for additional training. This approach significantly enhances learning efficiency by focusing computational resources on the most informative data points. We evaluate AL-PINN on benchmark PDE problems with known analytical solutions and real-world WeatherBench climate data. Our results demonstrate that AL-PINN achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to traditional PINNs while reducing the number of required training samples.
  The proposed framework is particularly beneficial for scientific and engineering applications where data collection is expensive or limited, such as climate modeling, medical simulations, and material science. Our findings highlight the potential of active learning in accelerating PINN-based PDE solvers while maintaining high accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Individual's general well-being is greatly impacted by mental health conditions including depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), underscoring the importance of early detection and precise diagnosis in order to facilitate prompt clinical intervention. An advanced multimodal deep learning system for the automated classification of PTSD and depression is presented in this paper. Utilizing textual and audio data from clinical interview datasets, the method combines features taken from both modalities by combining the architectures of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory).Although text features focus on speech's semantic and grammatical components; audio features capture vocal traits including rhythm, tone, and pitch. This combination of modalities enhances the model's capacity to identify minute patterns connected to mental health conditions. Using test datasets, the proposed method achieves classification accuracies of 92% for depression and 93% for PTSD, outperforming traditional unimodal approaches and demonstrating its accuracy and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Rosa Friesacher, Emma Svensson, Susanne Winiwarter, Lewis Mervin, Adam Arany, Ola Engkvist</p>
<p>Abstract: The estimation of uncertainties associated with predictions from quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models can accelerate the drug discovery process by identifying promising experiments and allowing an efficient allocation of resources. Several computational tools exist that estimate the predictive uncertainty in machine learning models. However, deviations from the i.i.d. setting have been shown to impair the performance of these uncertainty quantification methods. We use a real-world pharmaceutical dataset to address the pressing need for a comprehensive, large-scale evaluation of uncertainty estimation methods in the context of realistic distribution shifts over time. We investigate the performance of several uncertainty estimation methods, including ensemble-based and Bayesian approaches. Furthermore, we use this real-world setting to systematically assess the distribution shifts in label and descriptor space and their impact on the capability of the uncertainty estimation methods. Our study reveals significant shifts over time in both label and descriptor space and a clear connection between the magnitude of the shift and the nature of the assay. Moreover, we show that pronounced distribution shifts impair the performance of popular uncertainty estimation methods used in QSAR models. This work highlights the challenges of identifying uncertainty quantification methods that remain reliable under distribution shifts introduced by real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcin Mazur, Piotr Ko\'scielniak, {\L}ukasz Struski</p>
<p>Abstract: Among various mathematical tools of particular interest are those that provide a common basis for researchers in different scientific fields. One of them is Jensen's inequality, which states that the expectation of a convex function is greater than or equal to the function evaluated at the expectation. The resulting difference, known as Jensen's gap, became the subject of investigation by both the statistical and machine learning communities. Among many related topics, finding lower and upper bounds on Jensen's gap (under different assumptions on the underlying function and distribution) has recently become a problem of particular interest. In our paper, we take another step in this direction by providing a novel general and mathematically rigorous technique, motivated by the recent results of Struski et al. (2023). In addition, by studying in detail the case of the logarithmic function and the log-normal distribution, we explore a method for tightly estimating the log-likelihood of generative models trained on real-world datasets. Furthermore, we present both analytical and experimental arguments in support of the superiority of our approach in comparison to existing state-of-the-art solutions, contingent upon fulfillment of the criteria set forth by theoretical studies and corresponding experiments on synthetic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiu-Chou Lin, I-Chen Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In competitive games, strength ratings like Elo are widely used to quantify player skill and support matchmaking by accounting for skill disparities better than simple win rate statistics. However, scalar ratings cannot handle complex intransitive relationships, such as counter strategies seen in Rock-Paper-Scissors. To address this, recent work introduced Neural Rating Table and Neural Counter Table, which combine scalar ratings with discrete counter categories to model intransitivity. While effective, these methods rely on neural network training and cannot perform real-time updates. In this paper, we propose an online update algorithm that extends Elo principles to incorporate real-time learning of counter categories. Our method dynamically adjusts both ratings and counter relationships after each match, preserving the explainability of scalar ratings while addressing intransitivity. Experiments on zero-sum competitive games demonstrate its practicality, particularly in scenarios without complex team compositions.</p>

We introduce the first Policy Optimization algorithms for this setting. In the known-dynamics case, we achieve the first \textit{optimal} regret bound of $\tilde \Theta(H^2\sqrt{SAK})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $H$ is the episode horizon, $S$ is the number of states, and $A$ is the number of actions. In the unknown dynamics case we establish regret bound of $\tilde O(H^3 S \sqrt{AK})$, significantly improving the best known result by a factor of $H^2 S^5 A^2$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keon Vin Park, Jisu Kim, Jaemin Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces PINT (Physics-Informed Neural Time Series Models), a framework that integrates physical constraints into neural time series models to improve their ability to capture complex dynamics. We apply PINT to the ERA5 WeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data. PINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed prior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures. This equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate rigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed constraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from its exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in data-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future observations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first 90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years, addressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the WeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic trends, and align with physical principles. This study highlights the potential of physics-informed neural models in bridging machine learning and interpretable climate applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc Wanner, Johan Jonasson, Emil Carlsson, Devdatt Dubhashi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to variational Quantum algorithms (VQA) via continuous bandits. VQA are a class of hybrid Quantum-classical algorithms where the parameters of Quantum circuits are optimized by classical algorithms. Previous work has used zero and first order gradient based methods, however such algorithms suffer from the barren plateau (BP) problem where gradients and loss differences are exponentially small. We introduce an approach using bandits methods which combine global exploration with local exploitation. We show how VQA can be formulated as a best arm identification problem in a continuous space of arms with Lipschitz smoothness. While regret minimization has been addressed in this setting, existing methods for pure exploration only cover discrete spaces. We give the first results for pure exploration in a continuous setting and derive a fixed-confidence, information-theoretic, instance specific lower bound. Under certain assumptions on the expected payoff, we derive a simple algorithm, which is near-optimal with respect to our lower bound. Finally, we apply our continuous bandit algorithm to two VQA schemes: a PQC and a QAOA quantum circuit, showing that we significantly outperform the previously known state of the art methods (which used gradient based methods).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikunj Gupta, James Zachary Hare, Rajgopal Kannan, Viktor Prasanna</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents deep meta coordination graphs (DMCG) for learning cooperative policies in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Coordination graph formulations encode local interactions and accordingly factorize the joint value function of all agents to improve efficiency in MARL. However, existing approaches rely solely on pairwise relations between agents, which potentially oversimplifies complex multi-agent interactions. DMCG goes beyond these simple direct interactions by also capturing useful higher-order and indirect relationships among agents. It generates novel graph structures accommodating multiple types of interactions and arbitrary lengths of multi-hop connections in coordination graphs to model such interactions. It then employs a graph convolutional network module to learn powerful representations in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate its effectiveness in multiple coordination problems in MARL where other state-of-the-art methods can suffer from sample inefficiency or fail entirely.

Some studies employ transfer learning techniques to predict drug responses in individual cells and patients, but they require access to target-domain data during training, which is often unavailable or only obtainable in future. In this study, we propose a novel domain generalization framework, termed panCancerDR, to address this challenge. We conceptualize each cancer type as a distinct source domain, with its cell lines serving as domain-specific samples. Our primary objective is to extract domain-invariant features from the expression profiles of cell lines across diverse cancer types, thereby generalize the predictive capacity to out-of-distribution samples. To enhance robustness, we introduce a latent independence projection (LIP) module that encourages the encoder to extract informative yet non-redundant features. Also, we propose an asymmetric adaptive clustering constraint, which clusters drug-sensitive samples into a compact group while drives resistant samples dispersed across separate clusters in the latent space. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that panCancerDR effectively learns task-relevant features from diverse source domains, and achieves accurate predictions of drug response for unseen cancer type during training. Furthermore, when evaluated on single-cell and patient-level prediction tasks, our model-trained solely on in vitro cell line data without access to target-domain information-consistently outperforms and matched current state-of-the-art methods. These findings highlights the potential of our method for real-world clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Wang, Zeyu Qin, Li Shen, Xueqian Wang, Minhao Cheng, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Training safe LLMs is one of the most critical research challenge. However, the commonly used method, Refusal Training (RT), struggles to generalize against various OOD jailbreaking attacks. Many safety training methods have been proposed to address this issue. While they offer valuable insights, we aim to complement this line of research by investigating whether OOD attacks truly exceed the capability of RT model. Conducting evaluation with BoN, we observe significant improvements on generalization as N increases. This underscores that the model possesses sufficient safety-related latent knowledge, but RT fails to consistently elicit this knowledge when addressing OOD attacks. Further analysis based on domain adaptation reveals that training with direct refusal causes model to rely on superficial shortcuts, resulting in learning of non-robust representation mappings. Based on our findings, we propose training model to perform safety reasoning for each query. Reasoning supervision encourages model to perform more computations, explicitly eliciting and using latent knowledge through reasoning. To achieve this, we synthesize reasoning supervision based on pre-guidelines, training the model to reason in alignment with them, thereby effectively eliciting and utilizing latent knowledge from diverse perspectives. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves generalization performance against OOD attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chonghe Jiang, Bao Nguyen, Anthony Man-Cho So, Viet Anh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) can produce texts that appear accurate and coherent but contain untruthful or toxic content. Inference-time interventions that edit the hidden activations have shown promising results in steering the LMs towards desirable generations. Existing activation intervention methods often comprise an activation probe to detect undesirable generation, triggering the activation modification to steer subsequent generation. This paper proposes a probe-free intervention method FLORAIN for all attention heads in a specific activation layer. It eliminates the need to train classifiers for probing purposes. The intervention function is parametrized by a sample-wise nonlinear low-rank mapping, which is trained by minimizing the distance between the modified activations and their projection onto the manifold of desirable content. Under specific constructions of the manifold and projection distance, we show that the intervention strategy can be computed efficiently by solving a smooth optimization problem. The empirical results, benchmarked on multiple base models, demonstrate that FLORAIN consistently outperforms several baseline methods in enhancing model truthfulness and quality across generation and multiple-choice tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayan Biswas, Mark Dras, Pedro Faustini, Natasha Fernandes, Annabelle McIver, Catuscia Palamidessi, Parastoo Sadeghi</p>
<p>Abstract: Within the machine learning community, reconstruction attacks are a principal concern and have been identified even in federated learning (FL), which was designed with privacy preservation in mind. In response to these threats, the privacy community recommends the use of differential privacy (DP) in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, termed DP-SGD. However, the proliferation of variants of DP in recent years\textemdash such as metric privacy\textemdash has made it challenging to conduct a fair comparison between different mechanisms due to the different meanings of the privacy parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ across different variants. Thus, interpreting the practical implications of $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ in the FL context and amongst variants of DP remains ambiguous. In this paper, we lay a foundational framework for comparing mechanisms with differing notions of privacy guarantees, namely $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and metric privacy. We provide two foundational means of comparison: firstly, via the well-established $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantees, made possible through the R\'enyi differential privacy framework; and secondly, via Bayes' capacity, which we identify as an appropriate measure for reconstruction threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sascha Marton, Moritz Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and State-Space Models have shown great success in handling sequential data by learning temporal dependencies. Decision Trees (DTs), on the other hand, remain a widely used class of models for structured tabular data but are typically not designed to capture sequential patterns directly. Instead, DT-based approaches for time-series data often rely on feature engineering, such as manually incorporating lag features, which can be suboptimal for capturing complex temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we introduce ReMeDe Trees, a novel recurrent DT architecture that integrates an internal memory mechanism, similar to RNNs, to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. Our model learns hard, axis-aligned decision rules for both output generation and state updates, optimizing them efficiently via gradient descent. We provide a proof-of-concept study on synthetic benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunbo Long, Liming Xu, Alexandra Brintrup</p>
<p>Abstract: Current evaluations of synthetic tabular data mainly focus on how well joint distributions are modeled, often overlooking the assessment of their effectiveness in preserving realistic event sequences and coherent entity relationships across columns.This paper proposes three evaluation metrics designed to assess the preservation of logical relationships among columns in synthetic tabular data. We validate these metrics by assessing the performance of both classical and state-of-the-art generation methods on a real-world industrial dataset.Experimental results reveal that existing methods often fail to rigorously maintain logical consistency (e.g., hierarchical relationships in geography or organization) and dependencies (e.g., temporal sequences or mathematical relationships), which are crucial for preserving the fine-grained realism of real-world tabular data. Building on these insights, this study also discusses possible pathways to better capture logical relationships while modeling the distribution of synthetic tabular data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Younghye Hwang, Hyojin Lee, Joonhyuk Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) combine transformer architectures with diffusion models. However, their computational complexity imposes significant limitations on real-time applications and sustainability of AI systems. In this study, we aim to enhance the computational efficiency through model quantization, which represents the weights and activation values with lower precision. Multi-region quantization (MRQ) is introduced to address the asymmetric distribution of network values in DiT blocks by allocating two scaling parameters to sub-regions. Additionally, time-grouping quantization (TGQ) is proposed to reduce quantization error caused by temporal variation in activations. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable to the original full-precision model with only a 0.29 increase in FID at W8A8. Furthermore, it outperforms other baselines at W6A6, thereby confirming its suitability for low-bit quantization. These results highlight the potential of our method to enable efficient real-time generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahran Rahman Alve, Muhammad Zawad Mahmud, Samiha Islam, Md. Asaduzzaman Chowdhury, Jahirul Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: In the growing terrain of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is vital that networks are secure to protect against a range of cyber threats. Based on the strong machine learning framework, this study proposes novel lightweight ensemble approaches for improving multi-class attack detection of IoT devices. Using the large CICIoT 2023 dataset with 34 attack types distributed amongst 10 attack categories, we systematically evaluated the performance of a wide variety of modern machine learning methods with the aim of establishing the best-performing algorithmic choice to secure IoT applications. In particular, we explore approaches based on ML classifiers to tackle the biocharges characterized by the challenging and heterogeneous nature of attack vectors in IoT environments. The method that performed best was the Decision Tree, with an accuracy of 99.56% and an F1 score of 99.62%, showing that this model is capable of accurately and reliably detecting threats.The Random Forest model was the next best-performing model with 98.22% and an F1 score of 98.24%, suggesting that ML methods are quite effective in a situation of high-dimensional data. Our results highlight the potential for using ML classifiers in bolstering security for IoT devices and also serve as motivations for future investigations targeting scalable, keystroke-based attack detection systems. We believe that our method provides a new path to develop complex machine learning algorithms for low-resource IoT devices, balancing both accuracy and time efficiency needs. In summary, these contributions enrich the state of the art of the IoT security literature, laying down solid ground and guidelines for the deployment of smart, adaptive security in IoT settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagi Meir, Tommer D. Keidar, Shlomi Reuveni, Barak Hirshberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models have become indispensable tools in applications across the physical sciences. Their training is often time-consuming, vastly exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done \textit{ad hoc} by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We demonstrate that this is the case when training a CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and use this approach to identify an optimal perturbation and frequency. Our work allows optimization of training protocols of machine learning models using a statistical mechanical approach.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04131">On the importance of structural identifiability for machine learning with partially observed dynamical systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Janis Norden, Elisa Oostwal, Michael Chappell, Peter Tino, Kerstin Bunte</p>
<p>Abstract: The successful application of modern machine learning for time series classification is often hampered by limitations in quality and quantity of available training data. To overcome these limitations, available domain expert knowledge in the form of parametrised mechanistic dynamical models can be used whenever it is available and time series observations may be represented as an element from a given class of parametrised dynamical models. This makes the learning process interpretable and allows the modeller to deal with sparsely and irregularly sampled data in a natural way. However, the internal processes of a dynamical model are often only partially observed. This can lead to ambiguity regarding which particular model realization best explains a given time series observation. This problem is well-known in the literature, and a dynamical model with this issue is referred to as structurally unidentifiable. Training a classifier that incorporates knowledge about a structurally unidentifiable dynamical model can negatively influence classification performance. To address this issue, we employ structural identifiability analysis to explicitly relate parameter configurations that are associated with identical system outputs. Using the derived relations in classifier training, we demonstrate that this method significantly improves the classifier's ability to generalize to unseen data on a number of example models from the biomedical domain. This effect is especially pronounced when the number of training instances is limited. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for structural identifiability, a topic that has received relatively little attention from the machine learning community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) can decode imagined speech from neural activity. However, these systems typically require extensive training sessions where participants imaginedly repeat words, leading to mental fatigue and difficulties identifying the onset of words, especially when imagining sequences of words. This paper addresses these challenges by transferring a classifier trained in overt speech data to covert speech classification. We used electroencephalogram (EEG) features derived from the Hilbert envelope and temporal fine structure, and used them to train a bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) model for classification. Our method reduces the burden of extensive training and achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy: 86.44% for overt speech and 79.82% for covert speech using the overt speech classifier.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many physical processes can be expressed through partial differential equations (PDEs). Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wesley A. Suttle, Aamodh Suresh, Carlos Nieto-Granda</p>
<p>Abstract: Entropy-based objectives are widely used to perform state space exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) and dataset generation for offline RL. Behavioral entropy (BE), a rigorous generalization of classical entropies that incorporates cognitive and perceptual biases of agents, was recently proposed for discrete settings and shown to be a promising metric for robotic exploration problems. In this work, we propose using BE as a principled exploration objective for systematically generating datasets that provide diverse state space coverage in complex, continuous, potentially high-dimensional domains. To achieve this, we extend the notion of BE to continuous settings, derive tractable $k$-nearest neighbor estimators, provide theoretical guarantees for these estimators, and develop practical reward functions that can be used with standard RL methods to learn BE-maximizing policies. Using standard MuJoCo environments, we experimentally compare the performance of offline RL algorithms for a variety of downstream tasks on datasets generated using BE, R\'{e}nyi, and Shannon entropy-maximizing policies, as well as the SMM and RND algorithms. We find that offline RL algorithms trained on datasets collected using BE outperform those trained on datasets collected using Shannon entropy, SMM, and RND on all tasks considered, and on 80% of the tasks compared to datasets collected using R\'{e}nyi entropy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Su Hyeong Lee, Manzil Zaheer, Tian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed optimization has become the default training paradigm in modern machine learning due to the growing scale of models and datasets. To mitigate communication overhead, local updates are often applied before global aggregation, resulting in a nested optimization approach with inner and outer steps. However, heavy-tailed stochastic gradient noise remains a significant challenge, particularly in attention-based models, hindering effective training. In this work, we propose TailOPT, an efficient framework designed to address heavy-tailed noise by leveraging adaptive optimization or clipping techniques. We establish convergence guarantees for the TailOPT framework under heavy-tailed noise with potentially unbounded gradient variance and local updates. Among its variants, we highlight a memory and communication efficient instantiation which we call $Bi^2Clip$, which performs coordinate-wise clipping at both the inner and outer optimizers, achieving adaptive-like performance (e.g., Adam) without the cost of maintaining or transmitting additional gradient statistics. Empirically, TailOPT, including $Bi^2Clip$, demonstrates superior performance on several language tasks and models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) is a matrix decomposition method that identifies distinct patterns using convex combinations of the data points denoted archetypes with each data point in turn reconstructed as convex combinations of the archetypes. AA thereby forms a polytope representing trade-offs of the distinct aspects in the data. Most existing methods for AA are designed for continuous data and do not exploit the structure of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose two new optimization frameworks for archetypal analysis for binary data. i) A second order approximation of the AA likelihood based on the Bernoulli distribution with efficient closed-form updates using an active set procedure for learning the convex combinations defining the archetypes, and a sequential minimal optimization strategy for learning the observation specific reconstructions. ii) A Bernoulli likelihood based version of the principal convex hull analysis (PCHA) algorithm originally developed for least squares optimization. We compare these approaches with the only existing binary AA procedure relying on multiplicative updates and demonstrate their superiority on both synthetic and real binary data. Notably, the proposed optimization frameworks for AA can easily be extended to other data distributions providing generic efficient optimization frameworks for AA based on tailored likelihood functions reflecting the underlying data distribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have shown remarkable performance in enhancing response accuracy and relevance by integrating external knowledge into generative models. However, existing RAG methods primarily focus on providing text-only answers, even in multimodal retrieval-augmented generation scenarios. In this work, we introduce the Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) task, which aims to generate answers that combine both text and images, fully leveraging the multimodal data within a corpus. Despite the importance of this task, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive benchmark to effectively evaluate MRAMG performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce the MRAMG-Bench, a carefully curated, human-annotated dataset comprising 4,346 documents, 14,190 images, and 4,800 QA pairs, sourced from three categories: Web Data, Academic Papers, and Lifestyle. The dataset incorporates diverse difficulty levels and complex multi-image scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating multimodal generation tasks. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, our MRAMG-Bench incorporates a comprehensive suite of both statistical and LLM-based metrics, enabling a thorough analysis of the performance of popular generative models in the MRAMG task. Besides, we propose an efficient multimodal answer generation framework that leverages both LLMs and MLLMs to generate multimodal responses.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered multi-agent systems extend the cognitive boundaries of individual agents through disciplined collaboration and interaction, while constructing these systems often requires labor-intensive manual designs. Despite the availability of methods to automate the design of agentic workflows, they typically seek to identify a static, complex, one-size-fits-all system, which, however, fails to dynamically allocate inference resources based on the difficulty and domain of each query. To address this challenge, we shift away from the pursuit of a monolithic agentic system, instead optimizing the \textbf{agentic supernet}, a probabilistic and continuous distribution of agentic architectures. We introduce MaAS, an automated framework that samples query-dependent agentic systems from the supernet, delivering high-quality solutions and tailored resource allocation (\textit{e.g.}, LLM calls, tool calls, token cost). Comprehensive evaluation across six benchmarks demonstrates that MaAS \textbf{(I)} requires only $6\sim45\%$ of the inference costs of existing handcrafted or automated multi-agent systems, \textbf{(II)} surpasses them by $0.54\%\sim11.82\%$, and \textbf{(III)} enjoys superior cross-dataset and cross-LLM-backbone transferability.</p>

To mitigate attacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e., training LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to behave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays a critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on adversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a jailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\Theta(M)$, it is enough to align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length $\Theta(\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context learning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust generalization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term $\Theta(\sqrt{M_{\text{test}}}/M_{\text{train}})$, where $M_{\text{train}}$ and $M_{\text{test}}$ are the number of adversarially perturbed in-context samples during training and testing. Empirically, we conduct AT on popular open-source LLMs and evaluate their robustness against jailbreak attacks of different adversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a positive correlation between the attack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix during jailbreaking to the length during AT. Our findings show that it is practical to defend "long-length" jailbreak attacks via efficient "short-length" AT. The code is available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirmohammad Farzaneh, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter selection is a critical step in the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly in the current era of foundational, pre-trained, models. By framing hyperparameter selection as a multiple hypothesis testing problem, recent research has shown that it is possible to provide statistical guarantees on population risk measures attained by the selected hyperparameter. This paper reviews the Learn-Then-Test (LTT) framework, which formalizes this approach, and explores several extensions tailored to engineering-relevant scenarios. These extensions encompass different risk measures and statistical guarantees, multi-objective optimization, the incorporation of prior knowledge and dependency structures into the hyperparameter selection process, as well as adaptivity. The paper also includes illustrative applications for communication systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Wendong, Simon Buchholz, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the relationship between causality, symmetry, and compression. We build on and generalize the known connection between learning and compression to a setting where causal models are not identifiable. We propose a framework where causality emerges as a consequence of compressing data across multiple environments. We define algorithmic causality as an alternative definition of causality when traditional assumptions for causal identifiability do not hold. We demonstrate how algorithmic causal and symmetric structures can emerge from minimizing upper bounds on Kolmogorov complexity, without knowledge of intervention targets. We hypothesize that these insights may also provide a novel perspective on the emergence of causality in machine learning models, such as large language models, where causal relationships may not be explicitly identifiable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge L. Franco, Manoel V. Machado Neto, Filipe A. N. Verri, Diego R. Amancio</p>
<p>Abstract: Flight delays due to holding maneuvers are a critical and costly phenomenon in aviation, driven by the need to manage air traffic congestion and ensure safety. Holding maneuvers occur when aircraft are instructed to circle in designated airspace, often due to factors such as airport congestion, adverse weather, or air traffic control restrictions. This study models the prediction of flight delays due to holding maneuvers as a graph problem, leveraging advanced Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML) techniques to capture complex interdependencies in air traffic networks. Holding maneuvers, while crucial for safety, cause increased fuel usage, emissions, and passenger dissatisfaction, making accurate prediction essential for operational efficiency. Traditional machine learning models, typically using tabular data, often overlook spatial-temporal relations within air traffic data. To address this, we model the problem of predicting holding as edge feature prediction in a directed (multi)graph where we apply both CatBoost, enriched with graph features capturing network centrality and connectivity, and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which excel in relational data contexts. Our results indicate that CatBoost outperforms GAT in this imbalanced dataset, effectively predicting holding events and offering interpretability through graph-based feature importance. Additionally, we discuss the model's potential operational impact through a web-based tool that allows users to simulate real-time delay predictions. This research underscores the viability of graph-based approaches for predictive analysis in aviation, with implications for enhancing fuel efficiency, reducing delays, and improving passenger experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyue Zhang, Haohao Fu, Guanbo Huang, Yaoyuan Liang, Chang Chu, Tianren Peng, Yanru Wu, Qi Li, Yang Li, Shao-Lun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-source transfer learning provides an effective solution to data scarcity in real-world supervised learning scenarios by leveraging multiple source tasks. In this field, existing works typically use all available samples from sources in training, which constrains their training efficiency and may lead to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework that answers the question: what is the optimal quantity of source samples needed from each source task to jointly train the target model? Specifically, we introduce a generalization error measure that aligns with cross-entropy loss, and minimize it based on the Cram\'er-Rao Bound to determine the optimal transfer quantity for each source task. Additionally, we develop an architecture-agnostic and data-efficient algorithm OTQMS to implement our theoretical results for training deep multi-source transfer learning models. Experimental studies on diverse architectures and two real-world benchmark datasets show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and data efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihui Dai, Christian Cianfarani, Arjun Bhagoji, Vikash Sehwag, Prateek Mittal</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust training methods typically defend against specific attack types, such as Lp attacks with fixed budgets, and rarely account for the fact that defenders may encounter new attacks over time. A natural solution is to adapt the defended model to new adversaries as they arise via fine-tuning, a method which we call continual robust training (CRT). However, when implemented naively, fine-tuning on new attacks degrades robustness on previous attacks. This raises the question: how can we improve the initial training and fine-tuning of the model to simultaneously achieve robustness against previous and new attacks? We present theoretical results which show that the gap in a model's robustness against different attacks is bounded by how far each attack perturbs a sample in the model's logit space, suggesting that regularizing with respect to this logit space distance can help maintain robustness against previous attacks. Extensive experiments on 3 datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNette) and over 100 attack combinations demonstrate that the proposed regularization improves robust accuracy with little overhead in training time. Our findings and open-source code lay the groundwork for the deployment of models robust to evolving attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush K. Varshney, Vicen\c{c} Torra</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Unlearning allows participants to remove their data from a trained machine learning model in order to preserve their privacy, and security. However, the machine unlearning literature for generative models is rather limited. The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model) considers minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I model for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the machine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained model will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not generate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise. In this paper, we consider that the model after unlearning should treat forget samples as out-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., the unlearned model should no longer recognize or encode the specific patterns found in the forget samples. To achieve this, we propose a framework which decouples the model parameters with gradient ascent, ensuring that forget samples are OOD for unlearned model with theoretical guarantee. We also provide $(\epsilon, \delta)$-unlearning guarantee for model updates with gradient ascent. The unlearned model is further fine-tuned on the remaining samples to maintain its performance. We also propose an attack model to ensure that the unlearned model has effectively removed the influence of forget samples. Extensive empirical evaluation on two large-scale datasets, ImageNet-1K and Places365 highlights the superiority of our approach. To show comparable performance with retrained model, we also show the comparison of a simple AutoEncoder on various baselines on CIFAR-10 dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piersilvio De Bartolomeis, Javier Abad, Guanbo Wang, Konstantin Donhauser, Raymond M. Duch, Fanny Yang, Issa J. Dahabreh</p>
<p>Abstract: Randomized experiments are the preferred approach for evaluating the effects of interventions, but they are costly and often yield estimates with substantial uncertainty. On the other hand, in silico experiments leveraging foundation models offer a cost-effective alternative that can potentially attain higher statistical precision. However, the benefits of in silico experiments come with a significant risk: statistical inferences are not valid if the models fail to accurately predict experimental responses to interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the predictions from multiple foundation models with experimental data while preserving valid statistical inference. Our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal, with asymptotic variance no larger than the standard estimator based on experimental data alone. Importantly, these statistical properties hold even when model predictions are arbitrarily biased. Empirical results across several randomized experiments show that our estimator offers substantial precision gains, equivalent to a reduction of up to 20% in the sample size needed to match the same precision as the standard estimator based on experimental data alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunzhen Feng, Ariel Kwiatkowski, Kunhao Zheng, Julia Kempe, Yaqi Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models increasingly drive real-world applications, aligning them with human values becomes paramount. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique, translating preference data into reward models when oracle human values remain inaccessible. In practice, RLHF mostly relies on approximate reward models, which may not consistently guide the policy toward maximizing the underlying human values. We propose Policy-Interpolated Learning for Aligned Feedback (PILAF), a novel response sampling strategy for preference labeling that explicitly aligns preference learning with maximizing the underlying oracle reward. PILAF is theoretically grounded, demonstrating optimality from both an optimization and a statistical perspective. The method is straightforward to implement and demonstrates strong performance in iterative and online RLHF settings where feedback curation is critical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentyn Melnychuk, Dennis Frauen, Jonas Schweisthal, Stefan Feuerriegel</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning is widely used for estimating causal quantities (e.g., the conditional average treatment effect) from observational data. While existing representation learning methods have the benefit of allowing for end-to-end learning, they do not have favorable theoretical properties of Neyman-orthogonal learners, such as double robustness and quasi-oracle efficiency. Also, such representation learning methods often employ additional constraints, like balancing, which may even lead to inconsistent estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel class of Neyman-orthogonal learners for causal quantities defined at the representation level, which we call OR-learners. Our OR-learners have several practical advantages: they allow for consistent estimation of causal quantities based on any learned representation, while offering favorable theoretical properties including double robustness and quasi-oracle efficiency. In multiple experiments, we show that, under certain regularity conditions, our OR-learners improve existing representation learning methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance. To the best of our knowledge, our OR-learners are the first work to offer a unified framework of representation learning methods and Neyman-orthogonal learners for causal quantities estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: A wide variety of resource allocation problems operate under resource constraints that are managed by a central arbitrator, with agents who evaluate and communicate preferences over these resources. We formulate this broad class of problems as Distributed Evaluation, Centralized Allocation (DECA) problems and propose methods to learn fair and efficient policies in centralized resource allocation. Our methods are applied to learning long-term fairness in a novel and general framework for fairness in multi-agent systems. We show three different methods based on Double Deep Q-Learning: (1) A joint weighted optimization of fairness and utility, (2) a split optimization, learning two separate Q-estimators for utility and fairness, and (3) an online policy perturbation to guide existing black-box utility functions toward fair solutions. Our methods outperform existing fair MARL approaches on multiple resource allocation domains, even when evaluated using diverse fairness functions, and allow for flexible online trade-offs between utility and fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Zhang, Divya Chaudhary</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) early detection is critical for enabling timely intervention and improving patient outcomes. This paper presents a DMV framework using Llama3-70B and GPT-4o as embedding models to analyze clinical notes and predict a continuous risk score associated with early AD onset. Framing the task as a regression problem, we model the relationship between linguistic features in clinical notes (inputs) and a target variable (data value) that answers specific questions related to AD risk within certain topic categories. By leveraging a multi-faceted feature set that includes geolocation data, we capture additional environmental context potentially linked to AD. Our results demonstrate that the integration of the geolocation information significantly decreases the error of predicting early AD risk scores over prior models by 28.57% (Llama3-70B) and 33.47% (GPT4-o). Our findings suggest that this combined approach can enhance the predictive accuracy of AD risk assessment, supporting early diagnosis and intervention in clinical settings. Additionally, the framework's ability to incorporate geolocation data provides a more comprehensive risk assessment model that could help healthcare providers better understand and address environmental factors contributing to AD development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fares Fourati, Salma Kharrat, Vaneet Aggarwal, Mohamed-Slim Alouini</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing expensive, non-convex, black-box Lipschitz continuous functions presents significant challenges, particularly when the Lipschitz constant of the underlying function is unknown. Such problems often demand numerous function evaluations to approximate the global optimum, which can be prohibitive in terms of time, energy, or resources. In this work, we introduce Every Call is Precious (ECP), a novel global optimization algorithm that minimizes unpromising evaluations by strategically focusing on potentially optimal regions. Unlike previous approaches, ECP eliminates the need to estimate the Lipschitz constant, thereby avoiding additional function evaluations. ECP guarantees no-regret performance for infinite evaluation budgets and achieves minimax-optimal regret bounds within finite budgets. Extensive ablation studies validate the algorithm's robustness, while empirical evaluations show that ECP outperforms 10 benchmark algorithms including Lipschitz, Bayesian, bandits, and evolutionary methods across 30 multi-dimensional non-convex synthetic and real-world optimization problems, which positions ECP as a competitive approach for global optimization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04297">Statistical guarantees for continuous-time policy evaluation: blessing of ellipticity and new tradeoffs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlong Mou</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the estimation of the value function for continuous-time Markov diffusion processes using a single, discretely observed ergodic trajectory. Our work provides non-asymptotic statistical guarantees for the least-squares temporal-difference (LSTD) method, with performance measured in the first-order Sobolev norm. Specifically, the estimator attains an $O(1 / \sqrt{T})$ convergence rate when using a trajectory of length $T$; notably, this rate is achieved as long as $T$ scales nearly linearly with both the mixing time of the diffusion and the number of basis functions employed.
  A key insight of our approach is that the ellipticity inherent in the diffusion process ensures robust performance even as the effective horizon diverges to infinity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Markovian component of the statistical error can be controlled by the approximation error, while the martingale component grows at a slower rate relative to the number of basis functions. By carefully balancing these two sources of error, our analysis reveals novel trade-offs between approximation and statistical errors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph generation is a critical yet challenging task as empirical analyses require a deep understanding of complex, non-Euclidean structures. Although diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, these models typically adapt from the frameworks designed for image generation, making them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose a novel Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff) model that follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum and is guided by higher-order information, enabling the progressive generation of plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines.

As such, significant effort has been invested in developing approaches to defining, detecting, and eliminating unfair outcomes in algorithms. In this paper, we focus on performing statistical inference for fairness. Prior work in fairness inference has largely focused on inferring the fairness properties of a given predictive algorithm. Here, we expand fairness inference by evaluating fairness in the data generating process itself, referred to here as data fairness. We perform inference on data fairness using targeted learning, a flexible framework for nonparametric inference. We derive estimators demographic parity, equal opportunity, and conditional mutual information. Additionally, we find that our estimators for probabilistic metrics exploit double robustness. To validate our approach, we perform several simulations and apply our estimators to real data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning methods are well suited to searching for anomalies at scale but can struggle with the high-dimensional representation of many modern datasets, hence dimensionality reduction (DR) is often performed first. In this paper we analyse unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) from the perspective of the manifold created in DR. We present an idealised illustration, "Finding Pegasus", and a novel formal framework with which we categorise AD methods and their results into "on manifold" and "off manifold". We define these terms and show how they differ. We then use this insight to develop an approach of combining AD methods which significantly boosts AD recall without sacrificing precision in situations employing high DR. When tested on MNIST data, our approach of combining AD methods improves recall by as much as 16 percent compared with simply combining with the best standalone AD method (Isolation Forest), a result which shows great promise for its application to real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghui Li, A. Martina Neuman</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning leverages data augmentation to develop feature representation without relying on large labeled datasets. However, despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of contrastive learning remain incomplete, with many essential guarantees left unaddressed, particularly the realizability assumption concerning neural approximability of an optimal spectral contrastive loss solution. In this work, we overcome these limitations by analyzing the pointwise and spectral consistency of the augmentation graph Laplacian. We establish that, under specific conditions for data generation and graph connectivity, as the augmented dataset size increases, the augmentation graph Laplacian converges to a weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator on the natural data manifold. These consistency results ensure that the graph Laplacian spectrum effectively captures the manifold geometry. Consequently, they give way to a robust framework for establishing neural approximability, directly resolving the realizability assumption in a current paradigm.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Language Model (LM) capabilities advance, evaluating and supervising them at scale is getting harder for humans. There is hope that other language models can automate both these tasks, which we refer to as "AI Oversight". We study how model similarity affects both aspects of AI oversight by proposing a probabilistic metric for LM similarity based on overlap in model mistakes. Using this metric, we first show that LLM-as-a-judge scores favor models similar to the judge, generalizing recent self-preference results. Then, we study training on LM annotations, and find complementary knowledge between the weak supervisor and strong student model plays a crucial role in gains from "weak-to-strong generalization". As model capabilities increase, it becomes harder to find their mistakes, and we might defer more to AI oversight. However, we observe a concerning trend -- model mistakes are becoming more similar with increasing capabilities, pointing to risks from correlated failures. Our work underscores the importance of reporting and correcting for model similarity, especially in the emerging paradigm of AI oversight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yik Siu Chan, Narutatsu Ri, Yuxin Xiao, Marzyeh Ghassemi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.</p>

<p>Abstract: First proposed by Rahimi and Recht, random features are used to decrease the computational cost of kernel machines in large-scale problems. The Mondrian kernel is one such example of a fast random feature approximation of the Laplace kernel, generated by a computationally efficient hierarchical random partition of the input space known as the Mondrian process. In this work, we study a variation of this random feature map by using uniformly randomly rotated Mondrian processes to approximate a kernel that is invariant under rotations. We obtain a closed-form expression for this isotropic kernel, as well as a uniform convergence rate of the uniformly rotated Mondrian kernel to this limit. To this end, we utilize techniques from the theory of stationary random tessellations in stochastic geometry and prove a new result on the geometry of the typical cell of the superposition of uniformly random rotations of Mondrian tessellations. Finally, we test the empirical performance of this random feature map on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its improved performance over the Mondrian kernel on a debiased dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oleh Rybkin, Michal Nauman, Preston Fu, Charlie Snell, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, Aviral Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling data and compute is critical to the success of machine learning. However, scaling demands predictability: we want methods to not only perform well with more compute or data, but also have their performance be predictable from small-scale runs, without running the large-scale experiment. In this paper, we show that value-based off-policy RL methods are predictable despite community lore regarding their pathological behavior. First, we show that data and compute requirements to attain a given performance level lie on a Pareto frontier, controlled by the updates-to-data (UTD) ratio. By estimating this frontier, we can predict this data requirement when given more compute, and this compute requirement when given more data. Second, we determine the optimal allocation of a total resource budget across data and compute for a given performance and use it to determine hyperparameters that maximize performance for a given budget. Third, this scaling behavior is enabled by first estimating predictable relationships between hyperparameters, which is used to manage effects of overfitting and plasticity loss unique to RL. We validate our approach using three algorithms: SAC, BRO, and PQL on DeepMind Control, OpenAI gym, and IsaacGym, when extrapolating to higher levels of data, compute, budget, or performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Yi Lin, Patanamon Thongtanunam, Christoph Treude, Michael W. Godfrey, Chunhua Liu, Wachiraphan Charoenwet</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern code review is a ubiquitous software quality assurance process aimed at identifying potential issues within newly written code. Despite its effectiveness, the process demands large amounts of effort from the human reviewers involved. To help alleviate this workload, researchers have trained deep learning models to imitate human reviewers in providing natural language code reviews. Formally, this task is known as code review comment generation. Prior work has demonstrated improvements in this task by leveraging machine learning techniques and neural models, such as transfer learning and the transformer architecture. However, the quality of the model generated reviews remain sub-optimal due to the quality of the open-source code review data used in model training. This is in part due to the data obtained from open-source projects where code reviews are conducted in a public forum, and reviewers possess varying levels of software development experience, potentially affecting the quality of their feedback. To accommodate for this variation, we propose a suite of experience-aware training methods that utilise the reviewers' past authoring and reviewing experiences as signals for review quality. Specifically, we propose experience-aware loss functions (ELF), which use the reviewers' authoring and reviewing ownership of a project as weights in the model's loss function. Through this method, experienced reviewers' code reviews yield larger influence over the model's behaviour. Compared to the SOTA model, ELF was able to generate higher quality reviews in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and comment types generated. The key contribution of this work is the demonstration of how traditional software engineering concepts such as reviewer experience can be integrated into the design of AI-based automated code review models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diana Koldasbayeva, Alexey Zaytsev</p>
<p>Abstract: Species Distribution Models (SDMs) often suffer from spatial autocorrelation (SAC), leading to biased performance estimates. We tested cross-validation (CV) strategies - random splits, spatial blocking with varied distances, environmental (ENV) clustering, and a novel spatio-temporal method - under two proposed training schemes: LAST FOLD, widely used in spatial CV at the cost of data loss, and RETRAIN, which maximizes data usage but risks reintroducing SAC. LAST FOLD consistently yielded lower errors and stronger correlations. Spatial blocking at an optimal distance (SP 422) and ENV performed best, achieving Spearman and Pearson correlations of 0.485 and 0.548, respectively, although ENV may be unsuitable for long-term forecasts involving major environmental shifts. A spatio-temporal approach yielded modest benefits in our moderately variable dataset, but may excel with stronger temporal changes. These findings highlight the need to align CV approaches with the spatial and temporal structure of SDM data, ensuring rigorous validation and reliable predictive outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the growing interest in human-AI decision making, experimental studies with domain experts remain rare, largely due to the complexity of working with domain experts and the challenges in setting up realistic experiments. In this work, we conduct an in-depth collaboration with radiologists in prostate cancer diagnosis based on MRI images. Building on existing tools for teaching prostate cancer diagnosis, we develop an interface and conduct two experiments to study how AI assistance and performance feedback shape the decision making of domain experts. In Study 1, clinicians were asked to provide an initial diagnosis (human), then view the AI's prediction, and subsequently finalize their decision (human-AI team). In Study 2 (after a memory wash-out period), the same participants first received aggregated performance statistics from Study 1, specifically their own performance, the AI's performance, and their human-AI team performance, and then directly viewed the AI's prediction before making their diagnosis (i.e., no independent initial diagnosis). These two workflows represent realistic ways that clinical AI tools might be used in practice, where the second study simulates a scenario where doctors can adjust their reliance and trust on AI based on prior performance feedback. Our findings show that, while human-AI teams consistently outperform humans alone, they still underperform the AI due to under-reliance, similar to prior studies with crowdworkers. Providing clinicians with performance feedback did not significantly improve the performance of human-AI teams, although showing AI decisions in advance nudges people to follow AI more. Meanwhile, we observe that the ensemble of human-AI teams can outperform AI alone, suggesting promising directions for human-AI collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marko Niemel\"a, Mikaela von Bonsdorff, Sami \"Ayr\"am\"o, Tommi K\"arkk\"ainen</p>
<p>Abstract: Dementia is a general term for a group of syndromes that affect cognitive functions such as memory, thinking, reasoning, and the ability to perform daily tasks. The number of dementia patients is increasing as the population ages, and it is estimated that over 10 million people develop dementia each year. Dementia progresses gradually, and the sooner a patient receives help and support, the better their chances of maintaining their functional abilities. For this reason, early diagnosis of dementia is important. In recent years, machine learning models based on naturally spoken language have been developed for the early diagnosis of dementia. These methods have proven to be user-friendly, cost-effective, scalable, and capable of providing extremely fast diagnoses. This study utilizes the well-known ADReSS challenge dataset for classifying healthy controls and Alzheimer's patients. The dataset contains speech recordings from a picture description task featuring a kitchen scene, collected from both healthy controls and dementia patients. Unlike most studies, this research does not segment the audio recordings into active speech segments; instead, acoustic features are extracted from entire recordings. The study employs Ridge linear regression, Extreme Minimal Learning Machine, and Linear Support Vector Machine machine learning models to compute feature importance scores based on model outputs. The Ridge model performed best in Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation, achieving a classification accuracy of 87.8%. The EMLM model, proved to be effective in both cross-validation and the classification of a separate test dataset, with accuracies of 85.3% and 79.2%, respectively. The study's results rank among the top compared to other studies using the same dataset and acoustic feature extraction for dementia diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Johnston, Nora Belrose</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior work has found that transformers have an inconsistent ability to learn to answer latent two-hop questions -- questions of the form "Who is Bob's mother's boss?" We study why this is the case by examining how transformers' capacity to learn datasets of two-hop questions and answers (two-hop QA) scales with their size, motivated by prior work on transformer knowledge capacity for simple factual memorization. We find that capacity scaling and generalization both support the hypothesis that latent two-hop QA requires transformers to learn each fact twice, while two-hop QA with chain of thought does not. We also show that with appropriate dataset parameters, it is possible to "trap" very small models in a regime where they memorize answers to two-hop questions independently, even though they would perform better if they could learn to answer them with function composition. Our findings show that measurement of capacity scaling can complement existing interpretability methods, though there are challenges in using it for this purpose.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehui Li, Vallijah Subasri, Yifei Shen, Dongsheng Li, Yiren Zhao, Guy-Bart Stan, Caihua Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable generalizability across diverse tasks, yet genomic foundation models (GFMs) still require separate finetuning for each downstream application, creating significant overhead as model sizes grow. Moreover, existing GFMs are constrained by rigid output formats, limiting their applicability to various genomic tasks. In this work, we revisit the transformer-based auto-regressive models and introduce Omni-DNA, a family of cross-modal multi-task models ranging from 20 million to 1 billion parameters. Our approach consists of two stages: (i) pretraining on DNA sequences with next token prediction objective, and (ii) expanding the multi-modal task-specific tokens and finetuning for multiple downstream tasks simultaneously. When evaluated on the Nucleotide Transformer and GB benchmarks, Omni-DNA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 18 out of 26 tasks. Through multi-task finetuning, Omni-DNA addresses 10 acetylation and methylation tasks at once, surpassing models trained on each task individually. Finally, we design two complex genomic tasks, DNA2Function and Needle-in-DNA, which map DNA sequences to textual functional descriptions and images, respectively, indicating Omni-DNA's cross-modal capabilities to broaden the scope of genomic applications.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we aim to address the unmet demand for automated prompting and enhanced human-model interactions of SAM and SAM2 for the sake of promoting their widespread clinical adoption. Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We examine two in context learning (ICL) tasks with mathematical functions in several train and test settings for transformer models. Our study generalizes work on linear functions by showing that small transformers, even models with attention layers only, can approximate arbitrary polynomial functions and hence continuous functions under certain conditions. Our models also can approximate previously unseen classes of polynomial functions, as well as the zeros of complex functions. Our models perform far better on this task than LLMs like GPT4 and involve complex reasoning when provided with suitable training data and methods. Our models also have important limitations; they fail to generalize outside of training distributions and so don't learn class forms of functions. We explain why this is so.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a motion-based learning network with a global-local self-attention module (MoGLo-Net) to enhance 3D reconstruction in handheld photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) imaging. Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoning Zhang, Siying Wang, Wenyu Chen, Yang Zhou, Zhitong Zhao, Zixuan Zhang, Ruijie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm is widely used in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, due to the representational limitations of traditional monotonic value decomposition methods, algorithms can underestimate optimal actions, leading policies to suboptimal solutions. To address this challenge, we propose Optimistic $\epsilon$-Greedy Exploration, focusing on enhancing exploration to correct value estimations. The underestimation arises from insufficient sampling of optimal actions during exploration, as our analysis indicated. We introduce an optimistic updating network to identify optimal actions and sample actions from its distribution with a probability of $\epsilon$ during exploration, increasing the selection frequency of optimal actions. Experimental results in various environments reveal that the Optimistic $\epsilon$-Greedy Exploration effectively prevents the algorithm from suboptimal solutions and significantly improves its performance compared to other algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present AlphaGeometry2, a significantly improved version of AlphaGeometry introduced in Trinh et al. (2024), which has now surpassed an average gold medalist in solving Olympiad geometry problems. To achieve this, we first extend the original AlphaGeometry language to tackle harder problems involving movements of objects, and problems containing linear equations of angles, ratios, and distances. This, together with other additions, has markedly improved the coverage rate of the AlphaGeometry language on International Math Olympiads (IMO) 2000-2024 geometry problems from 66% to 88%. The search process of AlphaGeometry2 has also been greatly improved through the use of Gemini architecture for better language modeling, and a novel knowledge-sharing mechanism that combines multiple search trees. Together with further enhancements to the symbolic engine and synthetic data generation, we have significantly boosted the overall solving rate of AlphaGeometry2 to 84% for $\textit{all}$ geometry problems over the last 25 years, compared to 54% previously. AlphaGeometry2 was also part of the system that achieved silver-medal standard at IMO 2024 https://dpmd.ai/imo-silver. Last but not least, we report progress towards using AlphaGeometry2 as a part of a fully automated system that reliably solves geometry problems directly from natural language input.</p>

For these dependent samples, we derive nearly optimal convergence rates. Our findings extend existing error bounds for i.i.d. observations, demonstrating that the i.i.d. case is a special instance of our framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darina Koishigarina, Arnas Uselis, Seong Joon Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) has become a popular choice for various downstream tasks. However, recent studies have questioned its ability to represent compositional concepts effectively. These works suggest that CLIP often acts like a bag-of-words (BoW) model, interpreting images and text as sets of individual concepts without grasping the structural relationships. In particular, CLIP struggles to correctly bind attributes to their corresponding objects when multiple objects are present in an image or text. In this work, we investigate why CLIP exhibits this BoW-like behavior. We find that the correct attribute-object binding information is already present in individual text and image modalities. Instead, the issue lies in the cross-modal alignment, which relies on cosine similarity. To address this, we propose Linear Attribute Binding CLIP or LABCLIP. It applies a linear transformation to text embeddings before computing cosine similarity. This approach significantly improves CLIP's ability to bind attributes to correct objects, thereby enhancing its compositional understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Zhang, Haiying Shen, Shay Vargaftik, Ran Ben Basat, Michael Mitzenmacher, Minlan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Disaggregated Large Language Model (LLM) inference has gained popularity as it separates the computation-intensive prefill stage from the memory-intensive decode stage, avoiding the prefill-decode interference and improving resource utilization. However, transmitting Key-Value (KV) data between the two stages can be a bottleneck, especially for long prompts. Additionally, the computation time overhead for prefill and decode is key for optimizing Job Completion Time (JCT), and KV data size can become prohibitive for long prompts and sequences. Existing KV quantization methods can alleviate the transmission bottleneck and reduce memory requirements, but they introduce significant dequantization overhead, exacerbating the computation time.
  We propose Homomorphic Acceleration via Compression of the KV cache (HACK) for disaggregated LLM inference. HACK eliminates the heavy KV dequantization step, and directly performs computations on quantized KV data to approximate and reduce the cost of the expensive matrix-multiplication step. Extensive trace-driven experiments show that HACK reduces JCT by up to 70.9% compared to disaggregated LLM inference baseline and by up to 52.3% compared to state-of-the-art KV quantization methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models hold significant potential in robotics, enabling the generation of diverse and smooth trajectories directly from raw representations of the environment. Despite this promise, applying diffusion models to motion planning remains challenging due to their difficulty in enforcing critical constraints, such as collision avoidance and kinematic feasibility. These limitations become even more pronounced in Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), where multiple robots must coordinate in shared spaces. To address this challenge, this work proposes Simultaneous MRMP Diffusion (SMD), a novel approach integrating constrained optimization into the diffusion sampling process to produce collision-free, kinematically feasible trajectories. Additionally, the paper introduces a comprehensive MRMP benchmark to evaluate trajectory planning algorithms across scenarios with varying robot densities, obstacle complexities, and motion constraints. Experimental results show SMD consistently outperforms classical and learning-based motion planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in complex multi-robot environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michal Klein, Louis Bethune, Eugene Ndiaye, Marco Cuturi</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) quantifies the uncertainty of machine learning models by constructing sets of plausible outputs. These sets are constructed by leveraging a so-called conformity score, a quantity computed using the input point of interest, a prediction model, and past observations. CP sets are then obtained by evaluating the conformity score of all possible outputs, and selecting them according to the rank of their scores. Due to this ranking step, most CP approaches rely on a score functions that are univariate. The challenge in extending these scores to multivariate spaces lies in the fact that no canonical order for vectors exists. To address this, we leverage a natural extension of multivariate score ranking based on optimal transport (OT). Our method, OTCP, offers a principled framework for constructing conformal prediction sets in multidimensional settings, preserving distribution-free coverage guarantees with finite data samples. We demonstrate tangible gains in a benchmark dataset of multivariate regression problems and address computational \& statistical trade-offs that arise when estimating conformity scores through OT maps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuowei Li, Haizhou Shi, Yunhe Gao, Di Liu, Zhenting Wang, Yuxiao Chen, Ting Liu, Long Zhao, Hao Wang, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can reason effectively over both textual and visual inputs, but they tend to hallucinate syntactically coherent yet visually ungrounded contents. In this paper, we investigate the internal dynamics of hallucination by examining the tokens logits rankings throughout the generation process, revealing three key patterns in how LVLMs process information: (1) gradual visual information loss -- visually grounded tokens gradually become less favored throughout generation, and (2) early excitation -- semantically meaningful tokens achieve peak activation in the layers earlier than the final layer. (3) hidden genuine information -- visually grounded tokens though not being eventually decided still retain relatively high rankings at inference. Based on these insights, we propose VISTA (Visual Information Steering with Token-logit Augmentation), a training-free inference-time intervention framework that reduces hallucination while promoting genuine information. VISTA works by combining two complementary approaches: reinforcing visual information in activation space and leveraging early layer activations to promote semantically meaningful decoding. Compared to existing methods, VISTA requires no external supervision and is applicable to various decoding strategies. Extensive experiments show that VISTA on average reduces hallucination by abount 40% on evaluated open-ended generation task, and it consistently outperforms existing methods on four benchmarks across four architectures under three decoding strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Sushko, Ayana Bharadwaj, Zhi Yang Lim, Vasily Ilin, Ben Caffee, Dongping Chen, Mohammadreza Salehi, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing image editing models struggle to meet real-world demands. Despite excelling in academic benchmarks, they have yet to be widely adopted for real user needs. Datasets that power these models use artificial edits, lacking the scale and ecological validity necessary to address the true diversity of user requests. We introduce REALEDIT, a large-scale image editing dataset with authentic user requests and human-made edits sourced from Reddit. REALEDIT includes a test set of 9300 examples to evaluate models on real user requests. Our results show that existing models fall short on these tasks, highlighting the need for realistic training data. To address this, we introduce 48K training examples and train our REALEDIT model, achieving substantial gains - outperforming competitors by up to 165 Elo points in human judgment and 92 percent relative improvement on the automated VIEScore metric. We deploy our model on Reddit, testing it on new requests, and receive positive feedback. Beyond image editing, we explore REALEDIT's potential in detecting edited images by partnering with a deepfake detection non-profit. Finetuning their model on REALEDIT data improves its F1-score by 14 percentage points, underscoring the dataset's value for broad applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Levy, Siba Smarak Panigrahi, S\'ekou-Oumar Kaba, Qiang Zhu, Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Mikhail Galkin, Santiago Miret, Siamak Ravanbakhsh</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating novel crystalline materials has potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rebecca M. M. Hicke, David Mimno</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that language models can be trained to identify the author of much shorter literary passages than has been thought feasible for traditional stylometry. We replicate these results for authorship and extend them to a new dataset measuring novel genre. We find that LLMs are able to distinguish authorship and genre, but they do so in different ways. Some models seem to rely more on memorization, while others benefit more from training to learn author/genre characteristics. We then use three methods to probe one high-performing LLM for features that define style. These include direct syntactic ablations to input text as well as two methods that look at model internals. We find that authorial style is easier to define than genre-level style and is more impacted by minor syntactic decisions and contextual word usage. However, some traits like pronoun usage and word order prove significant for defining both kinds of literary style.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Santos de Oliveira Marques, Arthur Caio Vargas Pinto, Kaike Sa Teles Rocha Alves, Eduardo Pestana de Aguiar</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world data contain uncertainty and variations that can be correlated to external variables, known as randomness. An alternative cause of randomness is chaos, which can be an important component of chaotic time series. One of the existing methods to deal with this type of data is the use of the evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFSs), which have been proven to be a powerful class of models for time series forecasting, due to their autonomy to handle the data and highly complex problems in real-world applications. However, due to its working structure, type-2 fuzzy sets can outperform type-1 fuzzy sets for highly uncertain scenarios. We then propose ePL-KRLS-FSM+, an enhanced class of evolving fuzzy modeling approach that combines participatory learning (PL), a kernel recursive least squares method (KRLS), type-2 fuzzy logic and data transformation into fuzzy sets (FSs). This improvement allows to create and measure type-2 fuzzy sets for better handling uncertainties in the data, generating a model that can predict chaotic data with increased accuracy. The model is evaluated using two complex datasets: the chaotic time series Mackey-Glass delay differential equation with different degrees of chaos, and the main stock index of the Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index - TAIEX. Model performance is compared to related state-of-the-art rule-based eFS models and classical approaches and is analyzed in terms of error metrics, runtime and the number of final rules. Forecasting results show that the proposed model is competitive and performs consistently compared with type-1 models, also outperforming other forecasting methods by showing the lowest error metrics and number of final rules.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation is the concept of condensing large datasets into smaller but highly representative synthetic samples. While previous research has primarily focused on image classification, its application to image Super-Resolution (SR) remains underexplored. This exploratory work studies multiple dataset distillation techniques applied to SR, including pixel- and latent-space approaches under different aspects. Our experiments demonstrate that a 91.12% dataset size reduction can be achieved while maintaining comparable SR performance to the full dataset. We further analyze initialization strategies and distillation methods to optimize memory efficiency and computational costs. Our findings provide new insights into dataset distillation for SR and set the stage for future advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santiago Miret, Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Carmelo Gonzales, Sajid Mannan, N. M. Anoop Krishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Universal Machine Learning Interactomic Potentials (MLIPs) enable accelerated simulations for materials discovery. However, current research efforts fail to impactfully utilize MLIPs due to: 1. Overreliance on Density Functional Theory (DFT) for MLIP training data creation; 2. MLIPs' inability to reliably and accurately perform large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for diverse materials; 3. Limited understanding of MLIPs' underlying capabilities. To address these shortcomings, we aargue that MLIP research efforts should prioritize: 1. Employing more accurate simulation methods for large-scale MLIP training data creation (e.g. Coupled Cluster Theory) that cover a wide range of materials design spaces; 2. Creating MLIP metrology tools that leverage large-scale benchmarking, visualization, and interpretability analyses to provide a deeper understanding of MLIPs' inner workings; 3. Developing computationally efficient MLIPs to execute MD simulations that accurately model a broad set of materials properties. Together, these interdisciplinary research directions can help further the real-world application of MLIPs to accurately model complex materials at device scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Hu, Tai An, Zidong Yu, Junliang Du, Yuanshuai Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a cold start recommendation model that integrates contrastive learning, aiming to solve the problem of performance degradation of recommendation systems in cold start scenarios due to the scarcity of user and item interaction data. The model dynamically adjusts the weights of key features through an adaptive feature selection module and effectively integrates user attributes, item meta-information, and contextual features by combining a multimodal feature fusion mechanism, thereby improving recommendation performance. In addition, the model introduces a contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of feature representation by constructing positive and negative sample pairs. Experiments are conducted on the MovieLens-1M dataset. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms mainstream recommendation methods such as Matrix Factorization, LightGBM, DeepFM, and AutoRec in terms of HR, NDCG, MRR, and Recall, especially in cold start scenarios. Ablation experiments further verify the key role of each module in improving model performance, and the learning rate sensitivity analysis shows that a moderate learning rate is crucial to the optimization effect of the model. This study not only provides a new solution to the cold start problem but also provides an important reference for the application of contrastive learning in recommendation systems. In the future, this model is expected to play a role in a wider range of scenarios, such as real-time recommendation and cross-domain recommendation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonghun Kim, Boris Kramer</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerical simulations of complex multiphysics systems, such as char combustion considered herein, yield numerous state variables that inherently exhibit physical constraints. This paper presents a new approach to augment Operator Inference -- a methodology within scientific machine learning that enables learning from data a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional system governed by nonlinear partial differential equations -- by embedding such state constraints in the reduced-order model predictions. In the model learning process, we propose a new way to choose regularization hyperparameters based on a key performance indicator. Since embedding state constraints improves the stability of the Operator Inference reduced-order model, we compare the proposed state constraints-embedded Operator Inference with the standard Operator Inference and other stability-enhancing approaches. For an application to char combustion, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields state predictions superior to the other methods regarding stability and accuracy. It extrapolates over 200\% past the training regime while being computationally efficient and physically consistent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Tang, Zhenhao Chen, Loka Li, Xiangchen Song, Yunlong Deng, Yifan Shen, Guangyi Chen, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The autoregressive decoding for text generation in large language models (LLMs), while widely used, is inherently suboptimal due to the lack of a built-in mechanism to perform refinement and/or correction of the generated content. In this paper, we consider optimality in terms of the joint probability over the generated response, when jointly considering all tokens at the same time. We theoretically characterize the potential deviation of the autoregressively generated response from its globally optimal counterpart that is of the same length. Our analysis suggests that we need to be cautious when noticeable uncertainty arises during text generation, which may signal the sub-optimality of the generation history. To address the pitfall of autoregressive decoding for text generation, we propose an approach that incorporates a sliding reflection window and a pausing criterion, such that refinement and generation can be carried out interchangeably as the decoding proceeds. Our selective refinement framework strikes a balance between efficiency and optimality, and our extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Pynadath, Ruqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Controlled text generation allows for enforcing user-defined constraints on large language model outputs, an increasingly important field as LLMs become more prevalent in everyday life. One common approach uses energy-based decoding, which defines a target distribution through an energy function that combines multiple constraints into a weighted average. However, these methods often struggle to balance fluency with constraint satisfaction, even with extensive tuning of the energy function's coefficients. In this paper, we identify that this suboptimal balance arises from sampling in continuous space rather than the natural discrete space of text tokens. To address this, we propose Discrete Auto-regressive Biasing, a controlled decoding algorithm that leverages gradients while operating entirely in the discrete text domain. Specifically, we introduce a new formulation for controlled text generation by defining a joint distribution over the generated sequence and an auxiliary bias sequence. To efficiently sample from this joint distribution, we propose a Langevin-within-Gibbs sampling algorithm using gradient-based discrete MCMC. Our method significantly improves constraint satisfaction while maintaining comparable or better fluency, all with even lower computational costs. We demonstrate the advantages of our controlled decoding method on sentiment control, language detoxification, and keyword-guided generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gian Mario Favero, Parham Saremi, Emily Kaczmarek, Brennan Nichyporuk, Tal Arbel</p>
<p>Abstract: Discriminative classifiers have become a foundational tool in deep learning for medical imaging, excelling at learning separable features of complex data distributions. However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that learned Bloom filters, which combine machine learning with the classical Bloom filter, can achieve superior memory efficiency. However, existing learned Bloom filters face two critical unresolved challenges: the balance between the machine learning model size and the Bloom filter size is not optimal, and the reject time cannot be minimized effectively. We propose the Cascaded Learned Bloom Filter (CLBF) to address these issues. Our dynamic programming-based optimization automatically selects configurations that achieve an optimal balance between the model and filter sizes while minimizing reject time. Experiments on real-world datasets show that CLBF reduces memory usage by up to 24% and decreases reject time by up to 14 times compared to state-of-the-art learned Bloom filters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Smee, Fred Roosta, Stephen J. Wright</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient descent is the primary workhorse for optimizing large-scale problems in machine learning. However, its performance is highly sensitive to the choice of the learning rate. A key limitation of gradient descent is its lack of natural scaling, which often necessitates expensive line searches or heuristic tuning to determine an appropriate step size. In this paper, we address this limitation by incorporating Hessian information to scale the gradient direction. By accounting for the curvature of the function along the gradient, our adaptive, Hessian-aware scaling method ensures a local unit step size guarantee, even in nonconvex settings. Near a local minimum that satisfies the second-order sufficient conditions, our approach achieves linear convergence with a unit step size. We show that our method converges globally under a significantly weaker version of the standard Lipschitz gradient smoothness assumption. Even when Hessian information is inexact, the local unit step size guarantee and global convergence properties remain valid under mild conditions. Finally, we validate our theoretical results empirically on a range of convex and nonconvex machine learning tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: One critical challenge in the institutional adoption journey of Large Language Models (LLMs) stems from their propensity to hallucinate in generated responses. To address this, we propose MultiQ&A, a systematic approach for evaluating the robustness and consistency of LLM-generated answers. We demonstrate MultiQ&A's ability to crowdsource question perturbations and their respective answers through independent LLM agents at scale. Our experiments culminated in the examination of 1.9 million question perturbations and 2.3 million answers. Furthermore, MultiQ&A shows that ensembled LLMs, such as gpt-3.5-turbo, remain relatively robust and consistent under perturbations. MultiQ&A provides clarity in the response generation space, offering an effective method for inspecting disagreements and variability. Therefore, our system offers a potential framework for institutional LLM adoption with the ability to measure confidence, consistency, and the quantification of hallucinations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Universal Sparse Autoencoders (USAEs), a framework for uncovering and aligning interpretable concepts spanning multiple pretrained deep neural networks. Unlike existing concept-based interpretability methods, which focus on a single model, USAEs jointly learn a universal concept space that can reconstruct and interpret the internal activations of multiple models at once. Our core insight is to train a single, overcomplete sparse autoencoder (SAE) that ingests activations from any model and decodes them to approximate the activations of any other model under consideration. By optimizing a shared objective, the learned dictionary captures common factors of variation-concepts-across different tasks, architectures, and datasets. We show that USAEs discover semantically coherent and important universal concepts across vision models; ranging from low-level features (e.g., colors and textures) to higher-level structures (e.g., parts and objects). Overall, USAEs provide a powerful new method for interpretable cross-model analysis and offers novel applications, such as coordinated activation maximization, that open avenues for deeper insights in multi-model AI systems</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic communication systems, which leverage Generative AI (GAI) to transmit semantic meaning rather than raw data, are poised to revolutionize modern communications. However, they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, a type of poisoning manipulation that embeds malicious triggers into training datasets. As a result, Backdoor attacks mislead the inference for poisoned samples while clean samples remain unaffected. The existing defenses may alter the model structure (such as neuron pruning that potentially degrades inference performance on clean inputs, or impose strict requirements on data formats (such as ``Semantic Shield" that requires image-text pairs). To address these limitations, this work proposes a defense mechanism that leverages semantic similarity to detect backdoor attacks without modifying the model structure or imposing data format constraints. By analyzing deviations in semantic feature space and establishing a threshold-based detection framework, the proposed approach effectively identifies poisoned samples. The experimental results demonstrate high detection accuracy and recall across varying poisoning ratios, underlining the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Action recognition in dark, low-light (under-exposed) or noisy videos is a challenging task due to visibility degradation, which can hinder critical spatiotemporal details. This paper proposes MD-BERT, a novel multi-stream approach that integrates complementary pre-processing techniques such as gamma correction and histogram equalization alongside raw dark frames to address these challenges. We introduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, extending existing attentional fusion methods to a three-stream setting, thereby capturing fine-grained and global contextual information across different brightness and contrast enhancements. The fused spatiotemporal features are then processed by a BERT-based temporal model, which leverages its bidirectional self-attention to effectively capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships across frames. Extensive experiments on the ARID V1.0 and ARID V1.5 dark video datasets show that MD-BERT outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each input stream and the effectiveness of the proposed DFF and BERT modules.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rupesh Dulal, Rabin Dulal</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying the extent of brain tumors is a significant challenge in brain cancer treatment. The main difficulty is in the approximate detection of tumor size. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a critical diagnostic tool. However, manually detecting the boundaries of brain tumors from MRI scans is a labor-intensive task that requires extensive expertise. Deep learning and computer-aided detection techniques have led to notable advances in machine learning for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a modified You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) model to accurately detect the tumors within the MRI images. The proposed model replaced the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm with a Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT- DETR) in the detection head. NMS filters out redundant or overlapping bounding boxes in the detected tumors, but they are hand-designed and pre-set. RT-DETR removes hand-designed components. The second improvement was made by replacing the normal convolution block with ghost convolution. Ghost Convolution reduces computational and memory costs while maintaining high accuracy and enabling faster inference, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. The third improvement was made by introducing a vision transformer block in the backbone of YOLOv8 to extract context-aware features. We used a publicly available dataset of brain tumors in the proposed model. The proposed model performed better than the original YOLOv8 model and also performed better than other object detectors (Faster R- CNN, Mask R-CNN, YOLO, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, SSD, RetinaNet, EfficientDet, and DETR). The proposed model achieved 0.91 mAP (mean Average Precision)@0.5.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Sung, Anastasis Kratsios, Noah Forman</p>
<p>Abstract: We demonstrate that applying an eventual decay to the learning rate (LR) in empirical risk minimization (ERM), where the mean-squared-error loss is minimized using standard gradient descent (GD) for training a two-layer neural network with Lipschitz activation functions, ensures that the resulting network exhibits a high degree of Lipschitz regularity, that is, a small Lipschitz constant. Moreover, we show that this decay does not hinder the convergence rate of the empirical risk, now measured with the Huber loss, toward a critical point of the non-convex empirical risk. From these findings, we derive generalization bounds for two-layer neural networks trained with GD and a decaying LR with a sub-linear dependence on its number of trainable parameters, suggesting that the statistical behaviour of these networks is independent of overparameterization. We validate our theoretical results with a series of toy numerical experiments, where surprisingly, we observe that networks trained with constant step size GD exhibit similar learning and regularity properties to those trained with a decaying LR. This suggests that neural networks trained with standard GD may already be highly regular learners.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, but its decentralized nature exposes it to client-side data poisoning attacks (DPAs) and model poisoning attacks (MPAs) that degrade global model performance. While numerous proposed defenses claim substantial effectiveness, their evaluation is typically done in isolation with limited attack strategies, raising concerns about their validity. Additionally, existing studies overlook the mutual effectiveness of defenses against both DPAs and MPAs, causing fragmentation in this field. This paper aims to provide a unified benchmark and analysis of defenses against DPAs and MPAs, clarifying the distinction between these two similar but slightly distinct domains. We present a systematic taxonomy of poisoning attacks and defense strategies, outlining their design, strengths, and limitations. Then, a unified comparative evaluation across FL algorithms and data heterogeneity is conducted to validate their individual and mutual effectiveness and derive key insights for design principles and future research. Along with the analysis, we frame our work to a unified benchmark, FLPoison, with high modularity and scalability to evaluate 15 representative poisoning attacks and 17 defense strategies, facilitating future research in this domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyi Shin Khant, Hong Yi Lin, Patanamon Thongtanunam</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based techniques, especially advanced pre-trained models for code have demonstrated capabilities in code understanding and generation, solving diverse software engineering (SE) tasks. Despite the promising results, current training approaches may not fully optimize model performance, as they typically involve learning from randomly shuffled training data. Recent work shows that Curriculum Learning (CL) can improve performance on code-related tasks through incremental learning based on the difficulty of synthetic code. Yet, the effectiveness of CL with conventional difficulty measures in SE tasks remains largely unexplored. In this study, we explore two conventional code metrics: code length and cyclomatic complexity to determine the difficulty levels. We investigate how the pre-trained code model (CodeT5) learns under CL, through the tasks of code clone detection and code summarization. Our empirical study on the CodeXGLUE benchmark showed contrasting results to prior studies, where the model exhibited signs of catastrophic forgetting and shortcut learning. Surprisingly, model performance saturates after only the first quartile of training, potentially indicating a limit in the model's representation capacity and/or the task's inherent difficulty. Future work should further explore various CL strategies with different code models across a wider range of SE tasks for a more holistic understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanzhao Wang, Hasti Nourmohammadi Sigaroudi, Bo Sun, Omid Ardakanian, Xiaoqi Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the online conversion problem, which involves sequentially trading a divisible resource (e.g., energy) under dynamically changing prices to maximize profit. A key challenge in online conversion is managing decisions under horizon uncertainty, where the duration of trading is either known, revealed partway, or entirely unknown. We propose a unified algorithm that achieves optimal competitive guarantees across these horizon models, accounting for practical constraints such as box constraints, which limit the maximum allowable trade per step. Additionally, we extend the algorithm to a learning-augmented version, leveraging horizon predictions to adaptively balance performance: achieving near-optimal results when predictions are accurate while maintaining strong guarantees when predictions are unreliable. These results advance the understanding of online conversion under various degrees of horizon uncertainty and provide more practical strategies to address real world constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenchen Shou, Guyue Liu, Hao Nie, Huaiyu Meng, Yu Zhou, Yinmin Jiang, Wenqing Lv, Yelong Xu, Yuanwei Lu, Zhang Chen, Yanbo Yu, Yichen Shen, Yibo Zhu, Daxin Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling Large Language Model (LLM) training relies on multi-dimensional parallelism, where High-Bandwidth Domains (HBDs) are critical for communication-intensive parallelism like Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Expert Parallelism (EP). However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 takes a middle-ground approach by leveraging Optical Circuit Switches, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs).
  We propose InfinitePOD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfinitePOD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt into variable-size rings. This design provides: i) datacenter-wide scalability without cost explosion; ii) fault resilience by isolating failures to a single node, and iii) full bandwidth utilization for fault-free GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic (SiPh) based low-cost OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology co-designed with intra-/inter-node communication, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm maximizing GPU utilization while minimizing cross-ToR datacenter network traffic. The evaluation demonstrates that InfinitePOD achieves 31% of the cost of NVL-72, near-zero GPU waste ratio (over one order of magnitude lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), near-zero cross-ToR traffic when node fault ratios under 7%, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs per Node).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Lanfer, Dominik Brockmann, Nils Aschenbruck</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) require correctly labelled, representative and diverse datasets for an accurate evaluation and development. However, several widely used datasets do not include labels which are fine-grained enough and, together with small sample sizes, can lead to overfitting issues that also remain undetected when using test data. Additionally, the cybersecurity sector is evolving fast, and new attack mechanisms require the continuous creation of up-to-date datasets. To address these limitations, we developed a modular traffic generator that can simulate a wide variety of benign and malicious traffic. It incorporates multiple protocols, variability through randomization techniques and can produce attacks along corresponding benign traffic, as it occurs in real-world scenarios. Using the traffic generator, we create a dataset capturing over 12 million samples with 82 flow-level features and 21 fine-grained labels. Additionally, we include several web attack types which are often underrepresented in other datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan Garber, Mhna Massalha</p>
<p>Abstract: We revisit Blackwell's celebrated approachability problem which considers a repeated vector-valued game between a player and an adversary. Motivated by settings in which the action set of the player or adversary (or both) is difficult to optimize over, for instance when it corresponds to the set of all possible solutions to some NP-Hard optimization problem, we ask what can the player guarantee \textit{efficiently}, when only having access to these sets via approximation algorithms with ratios $\alpha_{\mX} \geq 1$ and $ 1 \geq \alpha_{\mY} > 0$, respectively. Assuming the player has monotone preferences, in the sense that he does not prefer a vector-valued loss $\ell_1$ over $\ell_2$ if $\ell_2 \leq \ell_1$, we establish that given a Blackwell instance with an approachable target set $S$, the downward closure of the appropriately-scaled set $\alpha_{\mX}\alpha_{\mY}^{-1}S$ is \textit{efficiently} approachable with optimal rate. In case only the player's or adversary's set is equipped with an approximation algorithm, we give simpler and more efficient algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongya Jia, Zhuo Chen, Jiawei Chen, Chenpeng Du, Jian Wu, Jian Cong, Xiaobin Zhuang, Chumin Li, Zhen Wei, Yuping Wang, Yuxuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele La Malfa, Jie M. Zhang, Michael Luck, Elizabeth Black</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness in multi-agent systems (MAS) focuses on equitable reward distribution among agents in scenarios involving sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status. This paper introduces fairness in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a penalty term derived from demographic parity, counterfactual fairness, and conditional statistical parity. The proposed method balances reward maximisation with fairness by integrating two penalty components: a retrospective component that minimises disparities in past outcomes and a prospective component that ensures fairness in future decision-making. We evaluate our approach in the Allelopathic Harvest game, a cooperative and competitive MAS focused on resource collection, where some agents possess a sensitive attribute. Experiments demonstrate that fair-PPO achieves fairer policies across all fairness metrics than classic PPO. Fairness comes at the cost of reduced rewards, namely the Price of Fairness, although agents with and without the sensitive attribute renounce comparable amounts of rewards. Additionally, the retrospective and prospective penalties effectively change the agents' behaviour and improve fairness. These findings underscore the potential of fair-PPO to address fairness challenges in MAS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guinan Su, Jonas Geiping</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning capabilities represent a critical frontier for large language models (LLMs), but developing them requires extensive proprietary datasets and computational resources. One way to efficiently supplement capabilities with is by model merging, which offers a promising alternative by combining multiple models without retraining. However, current merging approaches rely on manually-designed strategies for merging hyperparameters, limiting the exploration of potential model combinations and requiring significant human effort. We propose an Automated Model Merging Framework that enables fine-grained exploration of merging strategies while reducing costs through multi-fidelity approximations. We support both single and multi-objective optimization and introduce two novel search spaces: layerwise fusion (LFS) and depth-wise integration (DIS). Evaluating across a number of benchmarks, we find that the search autonomously finds 1) Merges that further boost single-objective performance, even on tasks the model has already been finetuned on, and 2) Merges that optimize multi-objective frontiers across tasks. Effective merges are found with limited compute, e.g. within less than 500 search steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongfu Gao, Feipeng Zhang, Hao Zeng, Deyu Meng, Bingyi Jing, Hongxin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on downstream tasks through in-context learning (ICL), which heavily relies on the demonstrations selected from annotated datasets. Existing selection methods may hinge on the distribution of annotated datasets, which can often be long-tailed in real-world scenarios. In this work, we show that imbalanced class distributions in annotated datasets significantly degrade the performance of ICL across various tasks and selection methods. Moreover, traditional rebalance methods fail to ameliorate the issue of class imbalance in ICL. Our method is motivated by decomposing the distributional differences between annotated and test datasets into two-component weights: class-wise weights and conditional bias. The key idea behind our method is to estimate the conditional bias by minimizing the empirical error on a balanced validation dataset and to employ the two-component weights to modify the original scoring functions during selection. Our approach can prevent selecting too many demonstrations from a single class while preserving the effectiveness of the original selection methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average accuracy by up to 5.46 on common benchmarks with imbalanced datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyue Yang, Jie Wang, Xing Li, Zhihai Wang, Chen Chen, Lei Chen, Xianzhi Yu, Wulong Liu, Jianye Hao, Mingxuan Yuan, Bin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.</p>

We propose an alternative: a data-driven reconstruction method inspired by the classic Tikhonov regularization. Our approach iteratively refines intermediate reconstructions by solving a sequence of quadratic problems. These updates have two key components: (i) learned filters to extract salient image features, and (ii) an attention mechanism that locally adjusts the penalty of filter responses. Our method achieves performance on par with leading plug-and-play and learned regularizer approaches while offering interpretability, robustness, and convergent behavior. In effect, we bridge traditional regularization and deep learning with a principled reconstruction approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work presents a data-driven approach to estimating the sound absorption coefficient of an infinite porous slab using a neural network and a two-microphone measurement on a finite porous sample. A 1D-convolutional network predicts the sound absorption coefficient from the complex-valued transfer function between the sound pressure measured at the two microphone positions. The network is trained and validated with numerical data generated by a boundary element model using the Delany-Bazley-Miki model, demonstrating accurate predictions for various numerical samples. The method is experimentally validated with baffled rectangular samples of a fibrous material, where sample size and source height are varied. The results show that the neural network offers the possibility to reliably predict the in-situ sound absorption of a porous material using the traditional two-microphone method as if the sample were infinite. The normal-incidence sound absorption coefficient obtained by the network compares well with that obtained theoretically and in an impedance tube. The proposed method has promising perspectives for estimating the sound absorption coefficient of acoustic materials after installation and in realistic operational conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Onintze Zaballa, Ver\'onica \'Alvarez, Santiago Mazuelas</p>
<p>Abstract: Load forecasting is essential for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective management of power systems. Load forecasting performance can be improved by learning the similarities among multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings). Techniques based on multi-task learning obtain predictions by leveraging consumption patterns from the historical load demand of multiple entities and their relationships. However, existing techniques cannot effectively assess inherent uncertainties in load demand or account for dynamic changes in consumption patterns. This paper proposes a multi-task learning technique for online and probabilistic load forecasting. This technique provides accurate probabilistic predictions for the loads of multiple entities by leveraging their dynamic similarities. The method's performance is evaluated using datasets that register the load demand of multiple entities and contain diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly enhance the effectiveness of current multi-task learning approaches across a wide variety of load consumption scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Zhang, Qirun Dai, Hao Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data are crucial for eliciting strong capabilities from pretrained large language models (LLMs). Typically, instructions are paired with multiple responses sampled from other LLMs, which are often out of the distribution of the target model to be fine-tuned. This, at scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance and robustness. We propose **GRAPE**, a novel SFT framework that accounts for the unique characteristics of the target model. For each instruction, it gathers responses from various LLMs and selects the one with the highest probability measured by the target model, indicating that it aligns most closely with the target model's pretrained distribution; it then proceeds with standard SFT training.
  We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various solutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune commonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on GRAPE-selected data. GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to 13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum performance improvement of 17.3%. GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to realistic settings. We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3 and Olmo-2. GRAPE outperforms strong baselines trained on 4.5 times more data by 6.1% and a state-of-the-art data selection approach by 3% on average performance. Remarkably, using 1/3 of the data and half the number of epochs, GRAPE enables LLaMA3.1-8B to surpass the performance of Tulu3-SFT by 3.5%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many competitive clustering pipelines have a multi-modal design, leveraging large language models (LLMs) or other text encoders, and text-image pairs, which are often unavailable in real-world downstream applications. Additionally, such frameworks are generally complicated to train and require substantial computational resources, making widespread adoption challenging. In this work, we show that in deep clustering, competitive performance with more complex state-of-the-art methods can be achieved using a text-free and highly simplified training pipeline. In particular, our approach, Simple Clustering via Pre-trained models (SCP), trains only a small cluster head while leveraging pre-trained vision model feature representations and positive data pairs. Experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-20, CIFAR-100, STL-10, ImageNet-10, and ImageNet-Dogs, demonstrate that SCP achieves highly competitive performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result explaining why, at least under ideal conditions, additional text-based embeddings may not be necessary to achieve strong clustering performance in vision.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative audio synthesis and editing technologies has raised significant concerns about copyright infringement, data provenance, and the spread of misinformation through deepfake audio. Watermarking offers a proactive solution by embedding imperceptible, identifiable, and traceable marks into audio content. While recent neural network-based watermarking methods like WavMark and AudioSeal have improved robustness and quality, they struggle to achieve both robust detection and accurate attribution simultaneously. This paper introduces Cross-Attention Robust Audio Watermark (XAttnMark), which bridges this gap by leveraging partial parameter sharing between the generator and the detector, a cross-attention mechanism for efficient message retrieval, and a temporal conditioning module for improved message distribution. Additionally, we propose a psychoacoustic-aligned temporal-frequency masking loss that captures fine-grained auditory masking effects, enhancing watermark imperceptibility. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both detection and attribution, demonstrating superior robustness against a wide range of audio transformations, including challenging generative editing with strong editing strength.

Specifically, we show that, if the parameters of a BNN follow a Gaussian prior distribution, and the variance of both the last hidden layer and the Gaussian likelihood function follows an Inverse-Gamma prior distribution, then the resulting posterior BNN converges to a Student-t process in the infinite-width limit. Our proof leverages the Wasserstein metric to establish control over the convergence rate of the Student-t process approximation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Walters, Rafael Kaufmann, Justice Sefas, Thomas Kopinski</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the Free Energy Principle as a foundation for measuring risk in agentic and multi-agent systems. From these principles we introduce a Cumulative Risk Exposure metric that is flexible to differing contexts and needs. We contrast this to other popular theories for safe AI that hinge on massive amounts of data or describing arbitrarily complex world models. In our framework, stakeholders need only specify their preferences over system outcomes, providing straightforward and transparent decision rules for risk governance and mitigation. This framework naturally accounts for uncertainty in both world model and preference model, allowing for decision-making that is epistemically and axiologically humble, parsimonious, and future-proof. We demonstrate this novel approach in a simplified autonomous vehicle environment with multi-agent vehicles whose driving policies are mediated by gatekeepers that evaluate, in an online fashion, the risk to the collective safety in their neighborhood, and intervene through each vehicle's policy when appropriate. We show that the introduction of gatekeepers in an AV fleet, even at low penetration, can generate significant positive externalities in terms of increased system safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junayed Mahmud, Antu Saha, Oscar Chaparro, Kevin Moran, Andrian Marcus</p>
<p>Abstract: Bug reports are essential for developers to confirm software problems, investigate their causes, and validate fixes. Unfortunately, reports often miss important information or are written unclearly, which can cause delays, increased issue resolution effort, or even the inability to solve issues. One of the most common components of reports that are problematic is the steps to reproduce the bug(s) (S2Rs), which are essential to replicate the described program failures and reason about fixes. Given the proclivity for deficiencies in reported S2Rs, prior work has proposed techniques that assist reporters in writing or assessing the quality of S2Rs. However, automated understanding of S2Rs is challenging, and requires linking nuanced natural language phrases with specific, semantically related program information. Prior techniques often struggle to form such language to program connections - due to issues in language variability and limitations of information gleaned from program analyses.
  To more effectively tackle the problem of S2R quality annotation, we propose a new technique called AstroBR, which leverages the language understanding capabilities of LLMs to identify and extract the S2Rs from bug reports and map them to GUI interactions in a program state model derived via dynamic analysis. We compared AstroBR to a related state-of-the-art approach and we found that AstroBR annotates S2Rs 25.2% better (in terms of F1 score) than the baseline. Additionally, AstroBR suggests more accurate missing S2Rs than the baseline (by 71.4% in terms of F1 score).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Mistretta, Alberto Baldrati, Lorenzo Agnolucci, Marco Bertini, Andrew D. Bagdanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained multi-modal Vision-Language Models like CLIP are widely used off-the-shelf for a variety of applications. In this paper, we show that the common practice of individually exploiting the text or image encoders of these powerful multi-modal models is highly suboptimal for intra-modal tasks like image-to-image retrieval. We argue that this is inherently due to the CLIP-style inter-modal contrastive loss that does not enforce any intra-modal constraints, leading to what we call intra-modal misalignment. To demonstrate this, we leverage two optimization-based modality inversion techniques that map representations from their input modality to the complementary one without any need for auxiliary data or additional trained adapters. We empirically show that, in the intra-modal tasks of image-to-image and text-to-text retrieval, approaching these tasks inter-modally significantly improves performance with respect to intra-modal baselines on more than fifteen datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that approaching a native inter-modal task (e.g. zero-shot image classification) intra-modally decreases performance, further validating our findings. Finally, we show that incorporating an intra-modal term in the pre-training objective or narrowing the modality gap between the text and image feature embedding spaces helps reduce the intra-modal misalignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santiago Acevedo-Mancera, Vladimir Vargas-Calder\'on, Herbert Vinck-Posada</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision diagrams (DDs) have emerged as an efficient tool for simulating quantum circuits due to their capacity to exploit data redundancies in quantum states and quantum operations, enabling the efficient computation of probability amplitudes. However, their application in quantum machine learning (QML) has remained unexplored. This paper introduces variational decision diagrams (VDDs), a novel graph structure that combines the structural benefits of DDs with the adaptability of variational methods for efficiently representing quantum states. We investigate the trainability of VDDs by applying them to the ground state estimation problem for transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg Hamiltonians. Analysis of gradient variance suggests that training VDDs is possible, as no signs of vanishing gradients--also known as barren plateaus--are observed. This work provides new insights into the use of decision diagrams in QML as an alternative to design and train variational ans\"atze.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romina Gaburro, Patrick Healy, Shraddha Naidu, Clifford Nolan</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem in Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) of identifying one or multiple inclusions in a background-conducting body $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, from the knowledge of a finite number of electrostatic measurements taken on its boundary $\partial\Omega$ and modelled by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (D-N) matrix. Once the presence of one inclusion in $\Omega$ is established, our model, combined with the machine learning techniques of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), may be used to determine the size of the inclusion, the presence of multiple inclusions, and also that of anisotropy within the inclusion(s). Utilising both real and simulated datasets within a 16-electrode setup, we achieve a high rate of inclusion detection and show that two measurements are sufficient to achieve a good level of accuracy when predicting the size of an inclusion. This underscores the substantial potential of integrating machine learning approaches with the more classical analysis of EIT and the inverse inclusion problem to extract critical insights, such as the presence of anisotropy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrosynthesis strategically plans the synthesis of a chemical target compound from simpler, readily available precursor compounds. This process is critical for synthesizing novel inorganic materials, yet traditional methods in inorganic chemistry continue to rely on trial-and-error experimentation. Emerging machine-learning approaches struggle to generalize to entirely new reactions due to their reliance on known precursors, as they frame retrosynthesis as a multi-label classification task. To address these limitations, we propose Retro-Rank-In, a novel framework that reformulates the retrosynthesis problem by embedding target and precursor materials into a shared latent space and learning a pairwise ranker on a bipartite graph of inorganic compounds. We evaluate Retro-Rank-In's generalizability on challenging retrosynthesis dataset splits designed to mitigate data duplicates and overlaps. For instance, for Cr2AlB2, it correctly predicts the verified precursor pair CrB + Al despite never seeing them in training, a capability absent in prior work. Extensive experiments show that Retro-Rank-In sets a new state-of-the-art, particularly in out-of-distribution generalization and candidate set ranking, offering a powerful tool for accelerating inorganic material synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quality statistical inference requires a sufficient amount of data, which can be missing or hard to obtain. To this end, prediction-powered inference has risen as a promising methodology, but existing approaches are largely limited to Z-estimation problems such as inference of means and quantiles. In this paper, we apply ideas of prediction-powered inference to e-values. By doing so, we inherit all the usual benefits of e-values -- such as anytime-validity, post-hoc validity and versatile sequential inference -- as well as greatly expand the set of inferences achievable in a prediction-powered manner. In particular, we show that every inference procedure that can be framed in terms of e-values has a prediction-powered counterpart, given by our method. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework across a wide range of inference tasks, from simple hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to more involved procedures for change-point detection and causal discovery, which were out of reach of previous techniques. Our approach is modular and easily integrable into existing algorithms, making it a compelling choice for practical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Heterogeneous Masked Autoregression (HMA) for modeling action-video dynamics to generate high-quality data and evaluation in scaling robot learning. Building interactive video world models and policies for robotics is difficult due to the challenge of handling diverse settings while maintaining computational efficiency to run in real time. HMA uses heterogeneous pre-training from observations and action sequences across different robotic embodiments, domains, and tasks. HMA uses masked autoregression to generate quantized or soft tokens for video predictions. \ourshort achieves better visual fidelity and controllability than the previous robotic video generation models with 15 times faster speed in the real world. After post-training, this model can be used as a video simulator from low-level action inputs for evaluating policies and generating synthetic data.

<p>Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills, such as tool use, presents a significant challenge. Current approaches can be broadly categorized into two strategies: human teleoperation (for imitation learning) and sim-to-real reinforcement learning. The first approach is difficult as it is hard for humans to produce safe and dexterous motions on a different embodiment without touch feedback. The second RL-based approach struggles with the domain gap and involves highly task-specific reward engineering on complex tasks. Our key insight is that RL is effective at learning low-level motion primitives, while humans excel at providing coarse motion commands for complex, long-horizon tasks. Therefore, the optimal solution might be a combination of both approaches. In this paper, we introduce DexterityGen (DexGen), which uses RL to pretrain large-scale dexterous motion primitives, such as in-hand rotation or translation. We then leverage this learned dataset to train a dexterous foundational controller. In the real world, we use human teleoperation as a prompt to the controller to produce highly dexterous behavior. We evaluate the effectiveness of DexGen in both simulation and real world, demonstrating that it is a general-purpose controller that can realize input dexterous manipulation commands and significantly improves stability by 10-100x measured as duration of holding objects across diverse tasks. Notably, with DexGen we demonstrate unprecedented dexterous skills including diverse object reorientation and dexterous tool use such as pen, syringe, and screwdriver for the first time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamer Ali Yuksel, Hassan Sawaf</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, these models are typically deployed with fixed weights, which limits their ability to adapt dynamically to the variability inherent in real-world data during inference. This paper introduces ChamaleonLLM, a novel framework that enables inference-time adaptation of LLMs by leveraging batch-aware clustering and on-the-fly generation of low-rank updates. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or methods that rely on a fixed set of pre-learned uniforms (changeable masks), our method dynamically generates adaptive modifications to the decoder weights based on the aggregated statistics of clustered batches. By intelligently grouping similar inputs and computing context-aware low-rank updates via a hyper-network, ChamaleonLLM achieves significant performance gains, outperforming conventional LoRA methods while eliminating the overhead of maintaining multiple expert models. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a versatile and highly adaptive solution for language model inference.

<p>Abstract: Do the rich representations of multi-modal diffusion transformers (DiTs) exhibit unique properties that enhance their interpretability? We introduce ConceptAttention, a novel method that leverages the expressive power of DiT attention layers to generate high-quality saliency maps that precisely locate textual concepts within images. Without requiring additional training, ConceptAttention repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce highly contextualized concept embeddings, contributing the major discovery that performing linear projections in the output space of DiT attention layers yields significantly sharper saliency maps compared to commonly used cross-attention mechanisms. Remarkably, ConceptAttention even achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot image segmentation benchmarks, outperforming 11 other zero-shot interpretability methods on the ImageNet-Segmentation dataset and on a single-class subset of PascalVOC. Our work contributes the first evidence that the representations of multi-modal DiT models like Flux are highly transferable to vision tasks like segmentation, even outperforming multi-modal foundation models like CLIP.</p>

The method returns a set of rules along with their optimal weights indicating the importance of each rule for learning. We address interpretability and fairness by assigning cost coefficients to the rules and introducing additional constraints. In particular, we focus on local interpretability and generalize a separation criterion in fairness to multiple sensitive attributes and classes. We test the performance of the proposed methodology on a collection of datasets and present a case study to elaborate on its different aspects. The proposed rule-based learning method exhibits a good compromise between local interpretability and fairness on the one side, and accuracy on the other side.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we establish the global optimality and convergence rate of an off-policy actor critic algorithm in the tabular setting without using density ratio to correct the discrepancy between the state distribution of the behavior policy and that of the target policy. Our work goes beyond existing works on the optimality of policy gradient methods in that existing works use the exact policy gradient for updating the policy parameters while we use an approximate and stochastic update step. Our update step is not a gradient update because we do not use a density ratio to correct the state distribution, which aligns well with what practitioners do. Our update is approximate because we use a learned critic instead of the true value function. Our update is stochastic because at each step the update is done for only the current state action pair. Moreover, we remove several restrictive assumptions from existing works in our analysis. Central to our work is the finite sample analysis of a generic stochastic approximation algorithm with time-inhomogeneous update operators on time-inhomogeneous Markov chains, based on its uniform contraction properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayan Talaei, Matin Ansaripour, Giorgi Nadiradze, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed optimization is the standard way of speeding up machine learning training, and most of the research in the area focuses on distributed first-order, gradient-based methods. Yet, there are settings where some computationally-bounded nodes may not be able to implement first-order, gradient-based optimization, while they could still contribute to joint optimization tasks. In this paper, we initiate the study of hybrid decentralized optimization, studying settings where nodes with zeroth-order and first-order optimization capabilities co-exist in a distributed system, and attempt to jointly solve an optimization task over some data distribution. We essentially show that, under reasonable parameter settings, such a system can not only withstand noisier zeroth-order agents but can even benefit from integrating such agents into the optimization process, rather than ignoring their information. At the core of our approach is a new analysis of distributed optimization with noisy and possibly-biased gradient estimators, which may be of independent interest. Our results hold for both convex and non-convex objectives. Experimental results on standard optimization tasks confirm our analysis, showing that hybrid first-zeroth order optimization can be practical, even when training deep neural networks.</p>

In this paper, we perform a generalization analysis of a state-of-the-art ADMM-based unfolding network, which jointly learns a decoder for CS and a sparsifying redundant analysis operator. To this end, we first impose a structural constraint on the learnable sparsifier, which parametrizes the network's hypothesis class. For the latter, we estimate its Rademacher complexity. With this estimate in hand, we deliver generalization error bounds -- which scale like the square root of the number of layers -- for the examined network. Finally, the validity of our theory is assessed and numerical comparisons to a state-of-the-art unfolding network are made, on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework complies with our theoretical findings and outperforms the baseline, consistently for all datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehrnaz Mofakhami, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Gauthier Gidel</p>
<p>Abstract: Performative prediction is a framework for learning models that influence the data they intend to predict. We focus on finding classifiers that are performatively stable, i.e. optimal for the data distribution they induce. Standard convergence results for finding a performatively stable classifier with the method of repeated risk minimization assume that the data distribution is Lipschitz continuous to the model's parameters. Under this assumption, the loss must be strongly convex and smooth in these parameters; otherwise, the method will diverge for some problems. In this work, we instead assume that the data distribution is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the model's predictions, a more natural assumption for performative systems. As a result, we are able to significantly relax the assumptions on the loss function. In particular, we do not need to assume convexity with respect to the model's parameters. As an illustration, we introduce a resampling procedure that models realistic distribution shifts and show that it satisfies our assumptions. We support our theory by showing that one can learn performatively stable classifiers with neural networks making predictions about real data that shift according to our proposed procedure.</p>

<p>Abstract: Feature selection is popular for obtaining small, interpretable, yet highly accurate prediction models. Conventional feature-selection methods typically yield one feature set only, which might not suffice in some scenarios. For example, users might be interested in finding alternative feature sets with similar prediction quality, offering different explanations of the data. In this article, we introduce alternative feature selection and formalize it as an optimization problem. In particular, we define alternatives via constraints and enable users to control the number and dissimilarity of alternatives. We consider sequential as well as simultaneous search for alternatives. Next, we discuss how to integrate conventional feature-selection methods as objectives. In particular, we describe solver-based search methods to tackle the optimization problem. Further, we analyze the complexity of this optimization problem and prove NP-hardness. Additionally, we show that a constant-factor approximation exists under certain conditions and propose corresponding heuristic search methods. Finally, we evaluate alternative feature selection in comprehensive experiments with 30 binary-classification datasets. We observe that alternative feature sets may indeed have high prediction quality, and we analyze factors influencing this outcome.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gradient-based optimization has been a cornerstone of machine learning enabling the vast advances of AI development over the past decades. However, since this type of optimization requires differentiation, it reduces flexibility in the choice of model and objective. With recent evidence of the benefits of non-differentiable (e.g. neuromorphic) architectures over classical models, such constraints can become limiting in the future. We present Layer-wise Feedback Propagation (LFP), a novel training principle for neural network-like predictors utilizing methods from the domain of explainability to decompose a reward to individual neurons based on their respective contributions to solving a given task without imposing any differentiability requirements. Leveraging these neuron-wise rewards, our method then implements a greedy approach reinforcing helpful parts of the network and weakening harmful ones. While having comparable computational complexity to gradient descent, LFP offers the advantage that it obtains sparse models due to an implicit weight scaling. We establish the convergence of LFP theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness on various models and datasets. We further investigate two applications for LFP: Firstly, neural network pruning, and secondly, the optimization of neuromorphic architectures such as Heaviside step function activated Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). In the first setting, LFP naturally generates sparse models that are easily prunable and thus efficiently encode and compute information. In the second setting, LFP achieves comparable performance to surrogate gradient descent, but provides approximation-free training, which eases the implementation on neuromorphic hardware. Consequently, LFP combines efficiency in terms of computation and representation with flexibility w.r.t. model architecture and objective function. Our code is available.</p>

In addition to obtaining accurate sequence models, this paper highlights that tractability, the ability to exactly and efficiently answer various probabilistic queries, plays an important role in offline RL. Specifically, due to the fundamental stochasticity from the offline data-collection policies and the environment dynamics, highly non-trivial conditional/constrained generation is required to elicit rewarding actions. it is still possible to approximate such queries, we observe that such crude estimates significantly undermine the benefits brought by expressive sequence models. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes Trifle (Tractable Inference for Offline RL), which leverages modern Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) to bridge the gap between good sequence models and high expected returns at evaluation time. Empirically, Trifle achieves the most state-of-the-art scores in 9 Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks against strong baselines. Further, owing to its tractability, Trifle significantly outperforms prior approaches in stochastic environments and safe RL tasks (e.g. with action constraints) with minimum algorithmic modifications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Xu, Yifei Wang, Yunrui Li, Lin Liu, Pengyu Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: The versatility of multimodal deep learning holds tremendous promise for advancing scientific research and practical applications. As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transformative innovations, opening new frontiers in chemical understanding and drug discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML), a specifically designed approach to enhance molecular understanding and accelerate advancements in drug discovery. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder with 5 layers, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet and Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC). Ultimately, ACML exemplifies its potential to revolutionize molecular representational learning, offering deeper insights into the chemical semantics of diverse modalities and paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in chemical research and drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qifang Zhao, Weidong Ren, Tianyu Li, Hong Liu, Xingsheng He, Xiaoxiao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduceGraphGPT, a novel self-supervised generative pre-trained model for graph learning based on the Graph Eulerian Transformer (GET). First, we propose GET, which combines a standard transformer encoder or decoder architecture with an innovative graph-to-sequence transformation method. This method converts graphs or sampled subgraphs into sequences of tokens representing nodes, edges, and attributes in a reversible manner using Eulerian paths. We pre-train GET using either of the two self-supervised tasks: next-token prediction (NTP) and scheduled masked-token prediction (SMTP). The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as graph-, edge-, and node-level prediction. Despite its simplicity, GraphGPT achieves performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets. It demonstrates exceptional results on the molecular property prediction dataset PCQM4Mv2 and the protein-protein interaction dataset ogbl-ppa. Notably, generative pre-training enables scaling GraphGPT to 2 billion parameters while maintaining performance gains - a breakthrough that overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and prior graph transformers (GTs). To advance research in graph foundation models and facilitate scientific discovery in chemistry, materials science, and related fields, we will release the source code (https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt) and pre-trained checkpoints.</p>

<p>Abstract: An important challenge in multi-objective reinforcement learning is obtaining a Pareto front of policies to attain optimal performance under different preferences. We introduce Iterated Pareto Referent Optimisation (IPRO), which decomposes finding the Pareto front into a sequence of constrained single-objective problems. This enables us to guarantee convergence while providing an upper bound on the distance to undiscovered Pareto optimal solutions at each step. We evaluate IPRO using utility-based metrics and its hypervolume and find that it matches or outperforms methods that require additional assumptions. By leveraging problem-specific single-objective solvers, our approach also holds promise for applications beyond multi-objective reinforcement learning, such as planning and pathfinding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongkang Guo, Yuqing Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a robust aggregation problem in the presence of both truthful and adversarial experts. The truthful experts will report their private signals truthfully, while the adversarial experts can report arbitrarily. We assume experts are marginally symmetric in the sense that they share the same common prior and marginal posteriors. The rule maker needs to design an aggregator to predict the true world state from these experts' reports, without knowledge of the underlying information structures or adversarial strategies. We aim to find the optimal aggregator that outputs a forecast minimizing regret under the worst information structure and adversarial strategies. The regret is defined by the difference in expected loss between the aggregator and a benchmark who aggregates optimally given the information structure and reports of truthful experts.
  We focus on binary states and reports. Under L1 loss, we show that the truncated mean aggregator is optimal. When there are at most k adversaries, this aggregator discards the k lowest and highest reported values and averages the remaining ones. For L2 loss, the optimal aggregators are piecewise linear functions. All the optimalities hold when the ratio of adversaries is bounded above by a value determined by the experts' priors and posteriors. The regret only depends on the ratio of adversaries, not on their total number. For hard aggregators that output a decision, we prove that a random version of the truncated mean is optimal for both L1 and L2. This aggregator randomly follows a remaining value after discarding the $k$ lowest and highest reported values. We extend the hard aggregator to multi-state setting. We evaluate our aggregators numerically in an ensemble learning task. We also obtain negative results for general adversarial aggregation problems under broader information structures and report spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cevat Volkan Karada\u{g}, Nezih Topalo\u{g}lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of extensive neural network architectures, particularly deep learning models, presents a challenge in terms of resource-intensive training. GPU memory constraints have become a notable bottleneck in training such sizable models. Existing strategies, including data parallelism, model parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and fully sharded data parallelism, offer partial solutions. Model parallelism, in particular, enables the distribution of the entire model across multiple GPUs, yet the ensuing data communication between these partitions slows down training. Additionally, the substantial memory overhead required to store auxiliary parameters on each GPU compounds computational demands. Instead of using the entire model for training, this study advocates partitioning the model across GPUs and generating synthetic intermediate labels to train individual segments. These labels, produced through a random process, mitigate memory overhead and computational load. This approach results in a more efficient training process that minimizes data communication while maintaining model accuracy. To validate this method, a 6-layer fully connected neural network is partitioned into two parts and its performance is assessed on the extended MNIST dataset. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves similar testing accuracies to conventional training methods, while significantly reducing memory and computational requirements. This work contributes to mitigating the resource-intensive nature of training large neural networks, paving the way for more efficient deep learning model development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinbao Qiao, Meng Zhang, Ming Tang, Ermin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning strives to uphold the data owners' right to be forgotten by enabling models to selectively forget specific data. Recent advances suggest pre-computing and storing statistics extracted from second-order information and implementing unlearning through Newton-style updates. However, the Hessian matrix operations are extremely costly and previous works conduct unlearning for empirical risk minimizer with the convexity assumption, precluding their applicability to high-dimensional over-parameterized models and the nonconvergence condition. In this paper, we propose an efficient Hessian-free unlearning approach. The key idea is to maintain a statistical vector for each training data, computed through affine stochastic recursion of the difference between the retrained and learned models. We prove that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the unlearning and generalization guarantees, the deletion capacity, and the time/storage complexity, under the same regularity conditions. Through the strategy of recollecting statistics for removing data, we develop an online unlearning algorithm that achieves near-instantaneous data removal, as it requires only vector addition. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme surpasses existing results by orders of magnitude in terms of time/storage costs with millisecond-level unlearning execution, while also enhancing test accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Categorical Distributional Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) has demonstrated superior sample efficiency in learning complex tasks compared to conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. However, the practical application of CDRL is encumbered by challenging projection steps, detailed parameter tuning, and domain knowledge. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a pioneering Continuous Distributional Model-Free RL algorithm tailored for continuous action spaces. The proposed algorithm simplifies the implementation of distributional RL, adopting an actor-critic architecture wherein the critic outputs a continuous probability distribution. Additionally, we propose an ensemble of multiple critics fused through a Kalman fusion mechanism to mitigate overestimation bias. Through a series of experiments, we validate that our proposed method provides a sample-efficient solution for executing complex continuous-control tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guner Dilsad Er, Sebastian Trimpe, Michael Muehlebach</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a distributed learning problem, where agents minimize a global objective function by exchanging information over a network. Our approach has two distinct features: (i) It substantially reduces communication by triggering communication only when necessary, and (ii) it is agnostic to the data-distribution among the different agents. We therefore guarantee convergence even if the local data-distributions of the agents are arbitrarily distinct. We analyze the convergence rate of the algorithm both in convex and nonconvex settings and derive accelerated convergence rates for the convex case. We also characterize the effect of communication failures and demonstrate that our algorithm is robust to these. The article concludes by presenting numerical results from distributed learning tasks on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experiments underline communication savings of 35% or more due to the event-based communication strategy, show resilience towards heterogeneous data-distributions, and highlight that our approach outperforms common baselines such as FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD and FedADMM.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a study of robust policy networks in deep reinforcement learning. We investigate the benefits of policy parameterizations that naturally satisfy constraints on their Lipschitz bound, analyzing their empirical performance and robustness on two representative problems: pendulum swing-up and Atari Pong. We illustrate that policy networks with smaller Lipschitz bounds are more robust to disturbances, random noise, and targeted adversarial attacks than unconstrained policies composed of vanilla multi-layer perceptrons or convolutional neural networks. However, the structure of the Lipschitz layer is important. We find that the widely-used method of spectral normalization is too conservative and severely impacts clean performance, whereas more expressive Lipschitz layers such as the recently-proposed Sandwich layer can achieve improved robustness without sacrificing clean performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Meanwhile, a novel quality evaluation criterion is proposed to quantitatively assess the quality of existing studies. Through an extensive review and analysis of 169 studies, we present recent technical advancements, discuss existing challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14425">When predict can also explain: few-shot prediction to select better neural latents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kabir Dabholkar, Omri Barak</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent variable models serve as powerful tools to infer underlying dynamics from observed neural activity. Ideally, the inferred dynamics should align with true ones. However, due to the absence of ground truth data, prediction benchmarks are often employed as proxies. One widely-used method, *co-smoothing*, involves jointly estimating latent variables and predicting observations along held-out channels to assess model performance. In this study, we reveal the limitations of the co-smoothing prediction framework and propose a remedy. In a student-teacher setup with Hidden Markov Models, we demonstrate that the high co-smoothing model space encompasses models with arbitrary extraneous dynamics in their latent representations. To address this, we introduce a secondary metric -- *few-shot co-smoothing*, performing regression from the latent variables to held-out channels in the data using fewer trials. Our results indicate that among models with near-optimal co-smoothing, those with extraneous dynamics underperform in the few-shot co-smoothing compared to 'minimal' models that are devoid of such dynamics. We provide analytical insights into the origin of this phenomenon and further validate our findings on real neural data using two state-of-the-art methods: LFADS and STNDT. In the absence of ground truth, we suggest a novel measure to validate our approach. By cross-decoding the latent variables of all model pairs with high co-smoothing, we identify models with minimal extraneous dynamics. We find a correlation between few-shot co-smoothing performance and this new measure. In summary, we present a novel prediction metric designed to yield latent variables that more accurately reflect the ground truth, offering a significant improvement for latent dynamics inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudio Battiloro, Ege Karaismailo\u{g}lu, Mauricio Tec, George Dasoulas, Michelle Audirac, Francesca Dominici</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks excel at modeling pairwise interactions, but they cannot flexibly accommodate higher-order interactions and features. Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation, reflection, and translation equivariance. Moreover, being TDL models, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how E(n)-equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different scales: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, as they match or surpass SotA equivariant TDL models with a significantly smaller computational burden, thus highlighting the benefits of a principled geometric inductive bias. Our implementation of ETNNs can be found at https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects/topological-equivariant-networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Dominici, Pietro Barbiero, Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga, Alberto Termine, Martin Gjoreski, Giuseppe Marra, Marc Langheinrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal opacity denotes the difficulty in understanding the "hidden" causal structure underlying the decisions of deep neural network (DNN) models. This leads to the inability to rely on and verify state-of-the-art DNN-based systems, especially in high-stakes scenarios. For this reason, circumventing causal opacity in DNNs represents a key open challenge at the intersection of deep learning, interpretability, and causality. This work addresses this gap by introducing Causal Concept Graph Models (Causal CGMs), a class of interpretable models whose decision-making process is causally transparent by design. Our experiments show that Causal CGMs can: (i) match the generalisation performance of causally opaque models, (ii) enable human-in-the-loop corrections to mispredicted intermediate reasoning steps, boosting not just downstream accuracy after corrections but also the reliability of the explanations provided for specific instances, and (iii) support the analysis of interventional and counterfactual scenarios, thereby improving the model's causal interpretability and supporting the effective verification of its reliability and fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yannick Limmer, Anastasis Kratsios, Xuwei Yang, Raeid Saqur, Blanka Horvath</p>
<p>Abstract: An inherent challenge in computing fully-explicit generalization bounds for transformers involves obtaining covering number estimates for the given transformer class $T$. Crude estimates rely on a uniform upper bound on the local-Lipschitz constants of transformers in $T$, and finer estimates require an analysis of their higher-order partial derivatives. Unfortunately, these precise higher-order derivative estimates for (realistic) transformer models are not currently available in the literature as they are combinatorially delicate due to the intricate compositional structure of transformer blocks.
  This paper fills this gap by precisely estimating all the higher-order derivatives of all orders for the transformer model. We consider realistic transformers with multiple (non-linearized) attention heads per block and layer normalization. We obtain fully-explicit estimates of all constants in terms of the number of attention heads, the depth and width of each transformer block, and the number of normalization layers. Further, we explicitly analyze the impact of various standard activation function choices (e.g. SWISH and GeLU). As an application, we obtain explicit pathwise generalization bounds for transformers on a single trajectory of an exponentially-ergodic Markov process valid at a fixed future time horizon. We conclude that real-world transformers can learn from $N$ (non-i.i.d.) samples of a single Markov process's trajectory at a rate of ${O}(\operatorname{polylog}(N)/\sqrt{N})$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Gerd Fritsch, Cennet Oguz, Vitor Fortes Rey, Lala Ray, Maximilian Kiefer-Emmanouilidis, Paul Lukowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is a long-standing problem in artificial intelligence with applications in a broad range of areas, including healthcare, sports and fitness, security, and more. The performance of HAR in real-world settings is strongly dependent on the type and quality of the input signal that can be acquired. Given an unobstructed, high-quality camera view of a scene, computer vision systems, in particular in conjunction with foundation models, can today fairly reliably distinguish complex activities. On the other hand, recognition using modalities such as wearable sensors (which are often more broadly available, e.g., in mobile phones and smartwatches) is a more difficult problem, as the signals often contain less information and labeled training data is more difficult to acquire. To alleviate the need for labeled data, we introduce our comprehensive Fitness Multimodal Activity Dataset (FiMAD) in this work, which can be used with the proposed pre-training method MuJo (Multimodal Joint Feature Space Learning) to enhance HAR performance across various modalities. FiMAD was created using YouTube fitness videos and contains parallel video, language, pose, and simulated IMU sensor data. MuJo utilizes this dataset to learn a joint feature space for these modalities. We show that classifiers pre-trained on FiMAD can increase the performance on real HAR datasets such as MM-Fit, MyoGym, MotionSense, and MHEALTH. For instance, on MM-Fit, we achieve a Macro F1-Score of up to 0.855 when fine-tuning on only 2% of the training data and 0.942 when utilizing the complete training set for classification tasks. We compare our approach with other self-supervised ones and show that, unlike them, ours consistently improves compared to the baseline network performance while also providing better data efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rylan Schaeffer, Hailey Schoelkopf, Brando Miranda, Gabriel Mukobi, Varun Madan, Adam Ibrahim, Herbie Bradley, Stella Biderman, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting changes from scaling advanced AI systems is a desirable property for engineers, economists, governments and industry alike, and, while a well-established literature exists on how pretraining performance scales, predictable scaling behavior on downstream capabilities remains elusive. While many factors are certainly responsible, this paper identifies a significant factor that makes predicting scaling behavior on widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks challenging and illuminates a path towards making such downstream evaluations predictable with scale. Using five model families and twelve well-established multiple-choice benchmarks, we demonstrate that downstream performance is computed from negative log likelihoods via a sequence of transformations that progressively degrades the statistical relationship between performance and scale. We then pinpoint the mechanism causing this degradation: downstream metrics require comparing the correct choice against a small number of specific incorrect choices, meaning accurately predicting downstream capabilities requires predicting not just how probability mass concentrates on the correct choice with scale, but also how probability mass fluctuates on the alternative incorrect choices with scale. We empirically study how probability mass on the correct choice co-varies with probability mass on incorrect choices with increasing compute, suggesting that scaling laws for \textit{incorrect} choices might be achievable. Our work also explains why pretraining scaling laws are commonly regarded as more predictable than downstream capabilities and contributes towards establishing scaling-predictable evaluations of frontier AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz Lampert, Christopher Bl\"ocker, Ingo Scholtes</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic link prediction is an important problem often considered in recent works proposing various approaches for learning temporal edge patterns. To assess their efficacy, models are evaluated on benchmark datasets involving continuous-time and discrete-time temporal graphs. However, as we show in this work, the suitability of common batch-oriented evaluation depends on the datasets' characteristics, which can cause multiple issues: For continuous-time temporal graphs, fixed-size batches create time windows with different durations, resulting in an inconsistent dynamic link prediction task. For discrete-time temporal graphs, the sequence of batches can additionally introduce temporal dependencies that are not present in the data. In this work, we empirically show that this common evaluation approach leads to skewed model performance and hinders the fair comparison of methods. We mitigate this problem by reformulating dynamic link prediction as a link forecasting task that better accounts for temporal information present in the data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anming Gu, Edward Chien, Kristjan Greenewald</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Agustin Duque, Milad Aghajohari, Tim Cooijmans, Razvan Ciuca, Tianyu Zhang, Gauthier Gidel, Aaron Courville</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificially intelligent agents are increasingly being integrated into human decision-making: from large language model (LLM) assistants to autonomous vehicles. These systems often optimize their individual objective, leading to conflicts, particularly in general-sum games where naive reinforcement learning agents empirically converge to Pareto-suboptimal Nash equilibria. To address this issue, opponent shaping has emerged as a paradigm for finding socially beneficial equilibria in general-sum games. In this work, we introduce Advantage Alignment, a family of algorithms derived from first principles that perform opponent shaping efficiently and intuitively. We achieve this by aligning the advantages of interacting agents, increasing the probability of mutually beneficial actions when their interaction has been positive. We prove that existing opponent shaping methods implicitly perform Advantage Alignment. Compared to these methods, Advantage Alignment simplifies the mathematical formulation of opponent shaping, reduces the computational burden and extends to continuous action domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms across a range of social dilemmas, achieving state-of-the-art cooperation and robustness against exploitation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivana Kaji\'c, Olivia Wiles, Isabela Albuquerque, Matthias Bauer, Su Wang, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Aida Nematzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models are capable of producing high-quality images that often faithfully depict concepts described using natural language. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate a range of text-to-image models on numerical reasoning tasks of varying difficulty, and show that even the most advanced models have only rudimentary numerical skills. Specifically, their ability to correctly generate an exact number of objects in an image is limited to small numbers, it is highly dependent on the context the number term appears in, and it deteriorates quickly with each successive number. We also demonstrate that models have poor understanding of linguistic quantifiers (such as "a few" or "as many as"), the concept of zero, and struggle with more advanced concepts such as partial quantities and fractional representations. We bundle prompts, generated images and human annotations into GeckoNum, a novel benchmark for evaluation of numerical reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Rowbottom, Georg Maierhofer, Teo Deveney, Eike Mueller, Alberto Paganini, Katharina Schratz, Pietro Li\`o, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb, Chris Budd</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel, and effective, approach to achieve optimal mesh relocation in finite element methods (FEMs). The cost and accuracy of FEMs is critically dependent on the choice of mesh points. Mesh relocation (r-adaptivity) seeks to optimise the mesh geometry to obtain the best solution accuracy at given computational budget. Classical r-adaptivity relies on the solution of a separate nonlinear "meshing" PDE to determine mesh point locations. This incurs significant cost at remeshing, and relies on estimates that relate interpolation- and FEM-error. Recent machine learning approaches have focused on the construction of fast surrogates for such classical methods. Instead, our new approach trains a graph neural network (GNN) to determine mesh point locations by directly minimising the FE solution error from the PDE system Firedrake to achieve higher solution accuracy. Our GNN architecture closely aligns the mesh solution space to that of classical meshing methodologies, thus replacing classical estimates for optimality with a learnable strategy. This allows for rapid and robust training and results in an extremely efficient and effective GNN approach to online r-adaptivity. Our method outperforms both classical, and prior ML, approaches to r-adaptive meshing. In particular, it achieves lower FE solution error, whilst retaining the significant speed-up over classical methods observed in prior ML work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Frauen, Konstantin Hess, Stefan Feuerriegel</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) over time is crucial in many disciplines such as personalized medicine. For example, electronic health records are commonly collected over several time periods and then used to personalize treatment decisions. Existing works for this task have mostly focused on model-based learners (i.e., learners that adapt specific machine-learning models). In contrast, model-agnostic learners -- so-called meta-learners -- are largely unexplored. In our paper, we propose several meta-learners that are model-agnostic and thus can be used in combination with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., transformers) to estimate HTEs over time. Here, our focus is on learners that can be obtained via weighted pseudo-outcome regressions, which allows for efficient estimation by targeting the treatment effect directly. We then provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis that characterizes the different learners and that allows us to offer insights into when specific learners are preferable. Finally, we confirm our theoretical insights through numerical experiments. In sum, while meta-learners are already state-of-the-art for the static setting, we are the first to propose a comprehensive set of meta-learners for estimating HTEs in the time-varying setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DA) consists of adapting a model trained on a labeled source domain to perform well on an unlabeled target domain with some data distribution shift. While many methods have been proposed in the literature, fair and realistic evaluation remains an open question, particularly due to methodological difficulties in selecting hyperparameters in the unsupervised setting. With SKADA-bench, we propose a framework to evaluate DA methods on diverse modalities, beyond computer vision task that have been largely explored in the literature. We present a complete and fair evaluation of existing shallow algorithms, including reweighting, mapping, and subspace alignment. Realistic hyperparameter selection is performed with nested cross-validation and various unsupervised model selection scores, on both simulated datasets with controlled shifts and real-world datasets across diverse modalities, such as images, text, biomedical, and tabular data. Our benchmark highlights the importance of realistic validation and provides practical guidance for real-life applications, with key insights into the choice and impact of model selection approaches. SKADA-bench is open-source, reproducible, and can be easily extended with novel DA methods, datasets, and model selection criteria without requiring re-evaluating competitors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Zhang, Haiying Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: In large-language models, memory constraints in the Key-Value Cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference. In this work, we propose ZACK, the first KV dimensionality compression system that achieves zero-overhead compression and decompression and also reduces attention computation time. It complements and can be combined with eviction-based and quantization-based methods to further enhance KV compression. Moreover, ZACK employs adaptive compression, tailoring KV compression rates across heads and layers based on their contributions to inference to maximize overall compression while maintaining an accuracy loss constraint. Additionally, ZACK enhances the self-attention kernel to balance the uneven workloads caused by the adaptive compression approach to further reduce attention computation latency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when combined with ZACK, state-of-the-art eviction-based and quantization-based methods for KV compression further reduce KV size by up to 68%, Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 44%, and Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) by up to 55% and achieve up to 1.72X throughput under the same latency, while maintaining 99% of the baseline accuracy.

<p>Abstract: Deep Generative Models are frequently used to learn continuous representations of complex data distributions using a finite number of samples. For any generative model, including pre-trained foundation models with Diffusion or Transformer architectures, generation performance can significantly vary across the learned data manifold. In this paper we study the local geometry of the learned manifold and its relationship to generation outcomes for a wide range of generative models, including DDPM, Diffusion Transformer (DiT), and Stable Diffusion 1.4. Building on the theory of continuous piecewise-linear (CPWL) generators, we characterize the local geometry in terms of three geometric descriptors - scaling ($\psi$), rank ($\nu$), and complexity/un-smoothness ($\delta$). We provide quantitative and qualitative evidence showing that for a given latent-image pair, the local descriptors are indicative of generation aesthetics, diversity, and memorization by the generative model. Finally, we demonstrate that by training a reward model on the local scaling for Stable Diffusion, we can self-improve both generation aesthetics and diversity using `geometry reward' based guidance during denoising.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc Canby, Adam Davies, Chirag Rastogi, Julia Hockenmaier</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal probing aims to analyze foundation models by examining how intervening on their representation of various latent properties impacts their outputs. Recent works have cast doubt on the theoretical basis of several leading causal probing methods, but it has been unclear how to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in practice. To address this, we define two key causal probing desiderata: completeness (how thoroughly the representation of the target property has been transformed) and selectivity (how little non-targeted properties have been impacted). We find that there is an inherent tradeoff between the two, which we define as reliability, their harmonic mean. We introduce an empirical analysis framework to measure and evaluate these quantities, allowing us to make the first direct comparisons between different families of leading causal probing methods (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear, or concept removal vs. counterfactual interventions). We find that: (1) no method is reliable across all layers; (2) more reliable methods have a greater impact on LLM behavior; (3) nonlinear interventions are more reliable in early and intermediate layers, and linear interventions are more reliable in later layers; and (4) concept removal methods are far less reliable than counterfactual interventions, suggesting that they may not be an effective approach to causal probing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehoon Oh, Seungjun Shin, Dokwan Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Massive activations, which manifest in specific feature dimensions of hidden states, introduce a significant bias in large language models (LLMs), leading to an overemphasis on the corresponding token. In this paper, we identify that massive activations originate not from the hidden state but from the intermediate state of a feed-forward network module in an early layer. Expanding on the previous observation that massive activations occur only in specific feature dimensions, we dive deep into the weights that cause massive activations. Specifically, we define top-$k$ massive weights as the weights that contribute to the dimensions with the top-$k$ magnitudes in the intermediate state. When these massive weights are set to zero, the functionality of LLMs is entirely disrupted. However, when all weights except for massive weights are set to zero, it results in a relatively minor performance drop, even though a much larger number of weights are set to zero. This implies that during the pre-training process, learning is dominantly focused on massive weights. Building on this observation, we propose a simple plug-and-play method called MacDrop (massive weights curriculum dropout), to rely less on massive weights during parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This method applies dropout to the pre-trained massive weights, starting with a high dropout probability and gradually decreasing it as fine-tuning progresses. Through various experiments, including zero-shot downstream tasks, long-context tasks, and ablation studies, we demonstrate that \texttt{MacDrop} generally improves performance and strengthens robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neurosymbolic learning enables the integration of symbolic reasoning with deep learning but faces significant challenges in scaling to complex symbolic programs, large datasets, or both. We introduce Dolphin, a framework that tackles these challenges by supporting neurosymbolic programs in Python, executing complex symbolic reasoning on the CPU while vectorizing probabilistic computations and gradient propagation on the GPU. Across 13 benchmarks spanning tasks over text, image, and video data, with symbolic reasoning features like recursion and black-box functions, Dolphin converges to state-of-the-art accuracies on the more complex benchmarks while existing frameworks such as Scallop, ISED, and IndeCateR+ fail to converge within the time limit. On simpler benchmarks, Dolphin matches their performance, while achieving these results 1.71x to 62x faster than the baselines. Overall, Dolphin advances the scalability of neurosymbolic frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency and convergence on difficult benchmarks where existing frameworks struggle.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05063">Control-oriented Clustering of Visual Latent Representation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Qi, Haocheng Yin, Heng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We initiate a study of the geometry of the visual representation space -- the information channel from the vision encoder to the action decoder -- in an image-based control pipeline learned from behavior cloning. Inspired by the phenomenon of neural collapse (NC) in image classification (arXiv:2008.08186), we empirically demonstrate the prevalent emergence of a similar law of clustering in the visual representation space. Specifically, in discrete image-based control (e.g., Lunar Lander), the visual representations cluster according to the natural discrete action labels; in continuous image-based control (e.g., Planar Pushing and Block Stacking), the clustering emerges according to "control-oriented" classes that are based on (a) the relative pose between the object and the target in the input or (b) the relative pose of the object induced by expert actions in the output. Each of the classes corresponds to one relative pose orthant (REPO).
  Beyond empirical observation, we show such a law of clustering can be leveraged as an algorithmic tool to improve test-time performance when training a policy with limited expert demonstrations. Particularly, we pretrain the vision encoder using NC as a regularization to encourage control-oriented clustering of the visual features. Surprisingly, such an NC-pretrained vision encoder, when finetuned end-to-end with the action decoder, boosts the test-time performance by 10% to 35%. Real-world vision-based planar pushing experiments confirmed the surprising advantage of control-oriented visual representation pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueru Wen, Jie Lou, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xing Yu, Xinyu Lu, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Debing Zhang, Le Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are crucial for aligning language models with human preferences. Currently, the evaluation of RMs depends on measuring accuracy against a validation set of manually annotated preference data. Although this method is straightforward and widely adopted, the relationship between RM accuracy and downstream policy performance remains under-explored. In this work, we conduct experiments in a synthetic setting to investigate how differences in RM measured by accuracy translate into gaps in optimized policy performance. Our findings reveal that while there is a weak positive correlation between accuracy and downstream performance, policies optimized towards RMs with similar accuracy can exhibit quite different performance. Moreover, we discover that the way of measuring accuracy significantly impacts its ability to predict the final policy performance. Through the lens of the Regressional Goodhart effect, we recognize that accuracy, when used for measuring RM quality, can fail to fully capture the potential RM overoptimization. This underscores the inadequacy of relying solely on accuracy to reflect their impact on policy optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Razin, Sadhika Malladi, Adithya Bhaskar, Danqi Chen, Sanjeev Arora, Boris Hanin</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants are increasingly used for aligning language models with human preferences. Although these methods are designed to teach a model to generate preferred responses more frequently relative to dispreferred responses, prior work has observed that the likelihood of preferred responses often decreases during training. The current work sheds light on the causes and implications of this counter-intuitive phenomenon, which we term likelihood displacement. We demonstrate that likelihood displacement can be catastrophic, shifting probability mass from preferred responses to responses with an opposite meaning. As a simple example, training a model to prefer $\texttt{No}$ over $\texttt{Never}$ can sharply increase the probability of $\texttt{Yes}$. Moreover, when aligning the model to refuse unsafe prompts, we show that such displacement can unintentionally lead to unalignment, by shifting probability mass from preferred refusal responses to harmful responses (e.g., reducing the refusal rate of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 74.4% to 33.4%). We theoretically characterize that likelihood displacement is driven by preferences that induce similar embeddings, as measured by a centered hidden embedding similarity (CHES) score. Empirically, the CHES score enables identifying which training samples contribute most to likelihood displacement in a given dataset. Filtering out these samples effectively mitigated unintentional unalignment in our experiments. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of curating data with sufficiently distinct preferences, for which we believe the CHES score may prove valuable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonatan Slutzky, Yotam Alexander, Noam Razin, Nadav Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are powered by an implicit bias: a tendency of gradient descent to fit training data in a way that generalizes to unseen data. A recent class of neural network models gaining increasing popularity is structured state space models (SSMs), regarded as an efficient alternative to transformers. Prior work argued that the implicit bias of SSMs leads to generalization in a setting where data is generated by a low dimensional teacher. In this paper, we revisit the latter setting, and formally establish a phenomenon entirely undetected by prior work on the implicit bias of SSMs. Namely, we prove that while implicit bias leads to generalization under many choices of training data, there exist special examples whose inclusion in training completely distorts the implicit bias, to a point where generalization fails. This failure occurs despite the special training examples being labeled by the teacher, i.e. having clean labels! We empirically demonstrate the phenomenon, with SSMs trained independently and as part of non-linear neural networks. In the area of adversarial machine learning, disrupting generalization with cleanly labeled training examples is known as clean-label poisoning. Given the proliferation of SSMs, particularly in large language models, we believe significant efforts should be invested in further delineating their susceptibility to clean-label poisoning, and in developing methods for overcoming this susceptibility.</p>

Meanwhile, theoretical work suggests that exploiting the target function's structure can enhance MBO performance. We present Cliqueformer, a transformer-based architecture that learns the black-box function's structure through functional graphical models (FGM), addressing distribution shift without relying on explicit conservative approaches. Across various domains, including chemical and genetic design tasks, Cliqueformer demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Wu, Jacob Hilton</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of low probability estimation: given a machine learning model and a formally-specified input distribution, how can we estimate the probability of a binary property of the model's output, even when that probability is too small to estimate by random sampling? This problem is motivated by the need to improve worst-case performance, which distribution shift can make much more likely. We study low probability estimation in the context of argmax sampling from small transformer language models. We compare two types of methods: importance sampling, which involves searching for inputs giving rise to the rare output, and activation extrapolation, which involves extrapolating a probability distribution fit to the model's logits. We find that importance sampling outperforms activation extrapolation, but both outperform naive sampling. Finally, we explain how minimizing the probability estimate of an undesirable behavior generalizes adversarial training, and argue that new methods for low probability estimation are needed to provide stronger guarantees about worst-case performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Post-training of pre-trained LLMs, which typically consists of the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage and the preference learning (RLHF or DPO) stage, is crucial to effective and safe LLM applications. The widely adopted approach in post-training popular open-source LLMs is to sequentially perform SFT and RLHF/DPO. However, sequential training is sub-optimal in terms of SFT and RLHF/DPO trade-off: the LLM gradually forgets about the first stage's training when undergoing the second stage's training. We theoretically prove the sub-optimality of sequential post-training. Furthermore, we propose a practical joint post-training framework with theoretical convergence guarantees and empirically outperforms sequential post-training framework, while having similar computational cost.

<p>Abstract: What happens when generative machine learning models are pretrained on web-scale datasets containing data generated by earlier models? Some prior work warns of "model collapse" as the web is overwhelmed by synthetic data; other work suggests the problem can be contained (i.e. collapse can be avoided) by managing how available data are used in pretraining. In this paper, we report experiments on three ways of using data (training-workflows), across three generative model task-settings (multivariate Gaussian estimation, kernel density estimation, and language-model fine-tuning) to further confirm the possibility of containment: (a) we confirm that the training-workflow of {\it replacing} all real data by successive generations of purely synthetic data indeed suffers model collapse in all task-settings studied; (b) we consider the training-workflow of {\it accumulating} synthetic data alongside real data and training on all data combined and confirming that, although the proportion of real data eventually becomes zero, models remain stable and their test losses do not diverge under this training-workflow; (c) we consider a training-workflow where real and synthetic data accumulate together but successive generations of pretraining are constrained to use fixed-size data subsets each generation. In this workflow, we observe slow and gradual rather than explosive degradation of test loss performance across generations. Our insights are particularly important when forecasting whether future frontier generative models will collapse or thrive, and our results open avenues for empirically and mathematically studying the context-dependent value of synthetic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Su Hyeong Lee, Sidharth Sharma, Manzil Zaheer, Tian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive optimization is critical in federated learning, where enabling adaptivity on both the server and client sides has proven essential for achieving optimal performance. However, the scalability of such jointly adaptive systems is often hindered by resource limitations in communication and memory. In this paper, we introduce a class of efficient adaptive algorithms, named $FedAda^2$ and its enhanced version $FedAda^2$++, designed specifically for large-scale, cross-device federated environments. $FedAda^2$ optimizes communication efficiency by avoiding the transfer of preconditioners between the server and clients. Additionally, $FedAda^2$++ extends this approach by incorporating memory-efficient adaptive optimizers on the client side, further reducing on-device memory usage. Theoretically, we demonstrate that $FedAda^2$ and $FedAda^2$++ achieve the same convergence rates for general, non-convex objectives as its more resource-intensive counterparts that directly integrate joint adaptivity. Extensive empirical evaluations on image and text datasets demonstrate both the advantages of joint adaptivity and the effectiveness of $FedAda^2$/$FedAda^2$++.</p>

<p>Abstract: Disentanglement, or identifying statistically independent factors of the data, is relevant to much of machine learning, from controlled data generation and robust classification to efficient encoding and improving our understanding of the data itself. Disentanglement arises in several generative paradigms including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Recent progress has been made in understanding disentanglement in VAEs, where a choice of diagonal posterior covariance matrices is shown to promote mutual orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. We build on this to show how such orthogonality, a geometric property, translates to disentanglement, a statistical property, furthering our understanding of how a VAE identifies independent components of, or disentangles, the data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Yang, Shubham Ugare, Yifan Zhao, Gagandeep Singh, Sasa Misailovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed precision quantization has become an important technique for optimizing the execution of deep neural networks (DNNs). Certified robustness, which provides provable guarantees about a model's ability to withstand different adversarial perturbations, has rarely been addressed in quantization due to unacceptably high cost of certifying robustness. This paper introduces ARQ, an innovative mixed-precision quantization method that not only preserves the clean accuracy of the smoothed classifiers but also maintains their certified robustness. ARQ uses reinforcement learning to find accurate and robust DNN quantization, while efficiently leveraging randomized smoothing, a popular class of statistical DNN verification algorithms. ARQ consistently performs better than multiple state-of-the-art quantization techniques across all the benchmarks and the input perturbation levels. The performance of ARQ quantized networks reaches that of the original DNN with floating-point weights, but with only 1.5% instructions and the highest certified radius.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohan Lyu, Yadi Cao, Duncan Watson-Parris, Leon Bergen, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Rose Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in solving simple scientific problems but, even with domain-specific fine-tuning, often produce hallucinations for complex ones. While integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this reliability issue, models finetuned on tool usage only often over-rely on them, incurring unnecessary costs from resource-intensive scientific tools even for simpler problems. Inspired by how human experts assess the complexity of the problem before choosing the solutions, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method, Adapting While Learning (AWL). In the first component, World Knowledge Learning (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific knowledge by learning from tools-generated solutions. In the second component, Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we classify questions as easy or hard based on the WKL-trained model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for simple problems while switching to tools for challenging ones. We validate our method on 6 scientific benchmark datasets in climate science, epidemiology, and mathematics. Compared to the base 8B model, our trained models achieve 28.27% higher answer accuracy and 13.76% better tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 on 4 custom-created datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sima Noorani, Orlando Romero, Nicolo Dal Fabbro, Hamed Hassani, George J. Pappas</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a distribution-free framework for achieving probabilistic guarantees on black-box models. CP is generally applied to a model post-training. Recent research efforts, on the other hand, have focused on optimizing CP efficiency during training. We formalize this concept as the problem of conformal risk minimization (CRM). In this direction, conformal training (ConfTr) by Stutz et al.(2022) is a technique that seeks to minimize the expected prediction set size of a model by simulating CP in-between training updates. Despite its potential, we identify a strong source of sample inefficiency in ConfTr that leads to overly noisy estimated gradients, introducing training instability and limiting practical use. To address this challenge, we propose variance-reduced conformal training (VR-ConfTr), a CRM method that incorporates a variance reduction technique in the gradient estimation of the ConfTr objective function. Through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that VR-ConfTr consistently achieves faster convergence and smaller prediction sets compared to baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parikshit Bansal, Ali Kavis, Sujay Sanghavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning attempts to learn representations from un-labeled data; it does so via a loss function that encourages the embedding of a point to be close to that of its augmentations. This simple idea performs remarkably well, yet it is not precisely theoretically understood why this is the case. In this paper we analyze self-supervised learning in a natural context: dimensionality reduction in Gaussian Mixture Models. Crucially, we define an augmentation of a data point as being another independent draw from the same underlying mixture component. We show that vanilla contrastive learning (specifically, the InfoNCE loss) is able to find the optimal lower-dimensional subspace even when the Gaussians are not isotropic -- something that vanilla spectral techniques cannot do. We also prove a similar result for "non-contrastive" self-supervised learning (i.e., SimSiam loss). We further extend our analyses to multi-modal contrastive learning algorithms (e.g., CLIP). In this setting we show that contrastive learning learns the subset of fisher-optimal subspace, effectively filtering out all the noise from the learnt representations. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical finding through synthetic data experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> T. E. R\"ober, R. Goedhart, S. \.I. Birbil</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) holds the promise of advancing the implementation and adoption of AI-based tools in practice, especially in high-stakes environments like healthcare. However, most of the current research lacks input from end users, and therefore their practical value is limited. To address this, we conducted semi-structured interviews with clinicians to discuss their thoughts, hopes, and concerns. Clinicians from our sample generally think positively about developing AI-based tools for clinical practice, but they have concerns about how these will fit into their workflow and how it will impact clinician-patient relations. We further identify training of clinicians on AI as a crucial factor for the success of AI in healthcare and highlight aspects clinicians are looking for in (X)AI-based tools. In contrast to other studies, we take on a holistic and exploratory perspective to identify general requirements for (X)AI products for healthcare before moving on to testing specific tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyeok Lee, Keisuke Sakaguchi, JinYeong Bak</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-training approach for large language models (LLMs) improves reasoning abilities by training the models on their self-generated rationales. Previous approaches have labeled rationales that produce correct answers for a given question as appropriate for training. However, a single measure risks misjudging rationale quality, leading the models to learn flawed reasoning patterns. To address this issue, we propose CREST (Consistency-driven Rationale Evaluation for Self-Training), a self-training framework that further evaluates each rationale through follow-up questions and leverages this evaluation to guide its training. Specifically, we introduce two methods: (1) filtering out rationales that frequently result in incorrect answers on follow-up questions and (2) preference learning based on mixed preferences from rationale evaluation results of both original and follow-up questions. Experiments on three question-answering datasets using open LLMs show that CREST not only improves the logical robustness and correctness of rationales but also improves reasoning abilities compared to previous self-training approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Huang, Qiyang Min, Hongzhi Huang, Defa Zhu, Yutao Zeng, Ran Guo, Xun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: It is widely acknowledged that the performance of Transformer models is logarithmically related to their number of parameters and computational complexity. While approaches like Mixture of Experts (MoE) decouple parameter count from computational complexity, they still face challenges in inference due to high memory access costs. This work introduces UltraMem, incorporating large-scale, ultra-sparse memory layer to address these limitations. Our approach significantly reduces inference latency while maintaining model performance. We also investigate the scaling laws of this new architecture, demonstrating that it not only exhibits favorable scaling properties but outperforms MoE. In experiments, the largest UltraMem we train has 20 million memory slots. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art inference speed and model performance within a given computational budget, paving the way for billions of slots or experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yadi Cao, Yuxuan Liu, Liu Yang, Rose Yu, Hayden Schaeffer, Stanley Osher</p>
<p>Abstract: In-Context Operator Networks (ICONs) are models that learn operators across different types of PDEs using a few-shot, in-context approach. Although they show successful generalization to various PDEs, existing methods treat each data point as a single token, and suffer from computational inefficiency when processing dense data, limiting their application in higher spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose \textit{Vision In-Context Operator Networks} (VICON), incorporating a vision transformer architecture that efficiently processes 2D functions through patch-wise operations. We evaluated our method on three fluid dynamics datasets, demonstrating both superior performance (reducing the rescaled $L^2$ error by $40\%$ and $61.6\%$ for two benchmark datasets for compressible flows, respectively) and computational efficiency (requiring only one-third of the inference time per frame) in long-term rollout predictions compared to the current state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model with fixed timestep prediction: Multiple Physics Pretraining (MPP). Compared to MPP, our method preserves the benefits of in-context operator learning, enabling flexible context formation when dealing with insufficient frame counts or varying timestep values.</p>

<p>Abstract: Concept drift refers to the change of data distributions over time. While drift poses a challenge for learning models, requiring their continual adaption, it is also relevant in system monitoring to detect malfunctions, system failures, and unexpected behavior. In the latter case, the robust and reliable detection of drifts is imperative. This work studies the shortcomings of commonly used drift detection schemes. We show how to construct data streams that are drifting without being detected. We refer to those as drift adversarials. In particular, we compute all possible adversairals for common detection schemes and underpin our theoretical findings with empirical evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide critical insights for applications in disease diagnosis and healthcare. However, the scarcity of labeled EEG data poses a significant challenge. Foundation models offer a promising solution by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data through pre-training, enabling strong performance across diverse tasks. While both temporal dynamics and inter-channel relationships are vital for understanding EEG signals, existing EEG foundation models primarily focus on the former, overlooking the latter. To address this limitation, we propose a novel foundation model for EEG that integrates both temporal and inter-channel information. Our architecture combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which effectively capture relational structures, with a masked autoencoder to enable efficient pre-training. We evaluated our approach using three downstream tasks and experimented with various GNN architectures. The results demonstrate that our proposed model, particularly when employing the GCN architecture with optimized configurations, consistently outperformed baseline methods across all tasks. These findings suggest that our model serves as a robust foundation model for EEG analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Subgraph representation learning has been effective in solving various real-world problems. However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) produce suboptimal results for subgraph-level tasks due to their inability to capture complex interactions within and between subgraphs. To provide a more expressive and efficient alternative, we propose WLKS, a Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel generalized for subgraphs by applying the WL algorithm on induced $k$-hop neighborhoods. We combine kernels across different $k$-hop levels to capture richer structural information that is not fully encoded in existing models. Our approach can balance expressiveness and efficiency by eliminating the need for neighborhood sampling. In experiments on eight real-world and synthetic benchmarks, WLKS significantly outperforms leading approaches on five datasets while reducing training time, ranging from 0.01x to 0.25x compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kehan Wen, Yutong Hu, Yao Mu, Lei Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions, rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nithia Vijayan, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a framework for adaptive data-centric collaborative machine learning among self-interested agents, coordinated by an arbiter. Designed to handle the incremental nature of real-world data, the framework operates in an online manner: at each time step, the arbiter collects a batch of data from agents, trains a machine learning model, and provides each agent with a distinct model reflecting its data contributions. This setup establishes a feedback loop where shared data influence model updates, and the resulting models guide future data-sharing policies. Agents evaluate and partition their data, selecting a partition to share using a stochastic parameterized policy, learned via policy gradient methods to optimize the utility of the received model as defined by agent-specific evaluation functions. On the arbiter side, the expected loss function over the true data distribution is optimized, incorporating agent-specific weights to account for distributional differences arising from diverse sources and selective sharing. A bilevel optimization algorithm jointly learns the model parameters and agent-specific weights. Mean-zero noise, computed using a distortion function that adjusts these agent-specific weights, is introduced to generate distinct agent-specific models, promoting valuable data sharing without requiring separate training. Our framework is underpinned by non-asymptotic analyses, ensuring convergence of the agent-side policy optimization to an approximate stationary point of the evaluation functions and convergence of the arbiter-side optimization to an approximate stationary point of the expected loss function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhong Chen, Ying Ma, Xubo Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditionally, learning the structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network has been centralized, requiring all data to be pooled in one location. However, in real-world scenarios, data are often distributed across multiple entities (e.g., companies, devices) that seek to collaboratively learn a Dynamic Bayesian Network while preserving data privacy and security. More importantly, due to the presence of diverse clients, the data may follow different distributions, resulting in data heterogeneity. This heterogeneity poses additional challenges for centralized approaches. In this study, we first introduce a federated learning approach for estimating the structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network from homogeneous time series data that are horizontally distributed across different parties. We then extend this approach to heterogeneous time series data by incorporating a proximal operator as a regularization term in a personalized federated learning framework. To this end, we propose \texttt{FDBNL} and \texttt{PFDBNL}, which leverage continuous optimization, ensuring that only model parameters are exchanged during the optimization process. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, particularly in scenarios with many clients and limited individual sample sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ousmane Touat, Jezekael Brunon, Yacine Belal, Julien Nicolas, Mohamed Maouche, C\'esar Sabater, Sonia Ben Mokhtar</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary promise of decentralized learning is to allow users to engage in the training of machine learning models in a collaborative manner while keeping their data on their premises and without relying on any central entity. However, this paradigm necessitates the exchange of model parameters or gradients between peers. Such exchanges can be exploited to infer sensitive information about training data, which is achieved through privacy attacks (e.g Membership Inference Attacks -- MIA). In order to devise effective defense mechanisms, it is important to understand the factors that increase/reduce the vulnerability of a given decentralized learning architecture to MIA. In this study, we extensively explore the vulnerability to MIA of various decentralized learning architectures by varying the graph structure (e.g number of neighbors), the graph dynamics, and the aggregation strategy, across diverse datasets and data distributions. Our key finding, which to the best of our knowledge we are the first to report, is that the vulnerability to MIA is heavily correlated to (i) the local model mixing strategy performed by each node upon reception of models from neighboring nodes and (ii) the global mixing properties of the communication graph. We illustrate these results experimentally using four datasets and by theoretically analyzing the mixing properties of various decentralized architectures. Our paper draws a set of lessons learned for devising decentralized learning systems that reduce by design the vulnerability to MIA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in various downstream tasks, such as molecular property prediction and drug design. To accurately represent molecules, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers (GTs) have shown potential in the realm of self-supervised pretraining. However, existing approaches often overlook the relationship between molecular structure and electronic information, as well as the internal semantic reasoning within molecules. This omission of fundamental chemical knowledge in graph semantics leads to incomplete molecular representations, missing the integration of structural and electronic data. To address these issues, we introduce MOL-Mamba, a framework that enhances molecular representation by combining structural and electronic insights. MOL-Mamba consists of an Atom & Fragment Mamba-Graph (MG) for hierarchical structural reasoning and a Mamba-Transformer (MT) fuser for integrating molecular structure and electronic correlation learning. Additionally, we propose a Structural Distribution Collaborative Training and E-semantic Fusion Training framework to further enhance molecular representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOL-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across eleven chemical-biological molecular datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language model alignment is a critical step in training modern generative language models. Alignment targets to improve win rate of a sample from the aligned model against the base model. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. We show that this train/test mismatch makes standard RLHF framework sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. To this end, we propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (InfAlign), which aims to optimize inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the base model. We prove that for any inference-time decoding procedure, the optimal aligned policy is the solution to the standard RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the calibrate-and-transform RL (InfAlign-CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. For best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, we propose specific transformations offering up to 3-8% improvement on inference-time win rates. Finally, we also show that our proposed reward calibration method is a strong baseline for optimizing standard win rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Ehsani, Fenglian Pan, Qingpei Hu, Jian Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of spatial-temporal (ST) information in dynamic systems, such as urban mobility and weather patterns, is a crucial yet challenging problem. The complexity stems from the intricate interplay between spatial proximity and temporal relevance, where both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations are present in convoluted patterns. Existing approaches, including traditional statistical methods and conventional neural networks, may provide inaccurate results due to the lack of an effective mechanism that simultaneously incorporates information at variable temporal depths while maintaining spatial context, resulting in a trade-off between comprehensive long-term historical analysis and responsiveness to short-term new information. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network (BDMNN) with bidirectional depth modulation that enables a comprehensive understanding of both long-term seasonality and short-term fluctuations, adapting to the complex ST context. Case studies with real-world public data demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy, with a 12% reduction in Mean Squared Error for urban traffic prediction and a 15% improvement in rain precipitation forecasting compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, without demanding extra computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewoo Song, Fangzhen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization for deep neural networks (DNNs) is the process of mapping the parameter values of DNNs from original data types to other data types of lower precision to reduce model sizes and make inference faster. Quantization often maps different original values to a single quantized value because the range of the original values is larger than the range of the quantized values. This leads to the degradation of the accuracy of the quantized DNNs. Outliers are a main cause of the degradation of quantization resolution because they enlarge the range of original values. To solve the problem, the percentile method is often used to clip outliers. However, clipping the outliers has another problem of removing the important and strong signals in the DNNs. This paper proposes SplitQuant to keep the outliers and improve the quantization resolution at the same time. SplitQuant narrows down the range of the original values and mitigates the effect of outliers by splitting each quantizable layer into three mathematically equivalent layers and applies different scaling factors. Especially, weights and biases are clustered into lower, middle and upper clusters for optimized split. By preprocessing DNNs with SplitQuant, quantization algorithms can achieve better results. SplitQuant was applied on two BERT-Tiny models and improved the accuracy of INT2 quantization by 3.3%p and 2.1%p, achieving accuracies comparable to those of the original FP32 models.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13484">MambaQuant: Quantizing the Mamba Family with Variance Aligned Rotation Methods</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zukang Xu, Yuxuan Yue, Xing Hu, Zhihang Yuan, Zixu Jiang, Zhixuan Chen, Jiangyong Yu, Chen Xu, Sifan Zhou, Dawei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mamba is an efficient sequence model that rivals Transformers and demonstrates significant potential as a foundational architecture for various tasks. Quantization is commonly used in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to Mamba remains underexplored, and existing quantization methods, which have been effective for CNN and Transformer models, appear inadequate for Mamba models (e.g., Quarot suffers a 21% accuracy drop on Vim-T$^\dagger$ even under W8A8). We have pioneered the exploration of this issue and identified several key challenges. First, significant outliers are present in gate projections, output projections, and matrix multiplications. Second, Mamba's unique parallel scan further amplifies these outliers, leading to uneven and heavy-tailed data distributions. Third, even with the application of the Hadamard transform, the variance across channels in weights and activations still remains inconsistent. To these ends, we propose MambaQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: 1) Karhunen-Loeve Transformation (KLT) enhanced rotation, rendering the rotation matrix adaptable to diverse channel distributions. 2) Smooth-Fused rotation, which equalizes channel variances and can merge additional parameters into model weights. Experiments show that MambaQuant can quantize both weights and activations into 8-bit with less than 1% accuracy loss for Mamba-based vision and language tasks. To the best of our knowledge, MambaQuant is the first comprehensive PTQ design for the Mamba family, paving the way for further advancements in its application.</p>

<p>Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve over 90\% accuracy on popular benchmarks like MMLU, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. In response, we introduce Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 3,000 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable, but cannot be quickly answered via internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peilin Yu, Yuwei Wu, Zhi Gao, Xiaomeng Fan, Yunde Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Riemannian meta-optimization provides a promising approach to solving non-linear constrained optimization problems, which trains neural networks as optimizers to perform optimization on Riemannian manifolds. However, existing Riemannian meta-optimization methods take up huge memory footprints in large-scale optimization settings, as the learned optimizer can only adapt gradients of a fixed size and thus cannot be shared across different Riemannian parameters. In this paper, we propose an efficient Riemannian meta-optimization method that significantly reduces the memory burden for large-scale optimization via a subspace adaptation scheme. Our method trains neural networks to individually adapt the row and column subspaces of Riemannian gradients, instead of directly adapting the full gradient matrices in existing Riemannian meta-optimization methods. In this case, our learned optimizer can be shared across Riemannian parameters with different sizes. Our method reduces the model memory consumption by six orders of magnitude when optimizing an orthogonal mainstream deep neural network (e.g., ResNet50). Experiments on multiple Riemannian tasks show that our method can not only reduce the memory consumption but also improve the performance of Riemannian meta-optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amitay Sicherman, Kira Radinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenge in computational biology and drug discovery lies in creating comprehensive representations of proteins and molecules that capture their intrinsic properties and interactions. Traditional methods often focus on unimodal data, such as protein sequences or molecular structures, limiting their ability to capture complex biochemical relationships. This work enhances these representations by integrating biochemical reactions encompassing interactions between molecules and proteins. By leveraging reaction data alongside pre-trained embeddings from state-of-the-art protein and molecule models, we develop ReactEmbed, a novel method that creates a unified embedding space through contrastive learning. We evaluate ReactEmbed across diverse tasks, including drug-target interaction, protein-protein interaction, protein property prediction, and molecular property prediction, consistently surpassing all current state-of-the-art models. Notably, we showcase ReactEmbed's practical utility through successful implementation in lipid nanoparticle-based drug delivery, enabling zero-shot prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability for protein-nanoparticle complexes. The code and comprehensive database of reaction pairs are available for open use at \href{https://github.com/amitaysicherman/ReactEmbed}{GitHub}.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19215">Strassen Attention: Unlocking Compositional Abilities in Transformers Based on a New Lower Bound Method</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Kozachinskiy, Felipe Urrutia, Hector Jimenez, Tomasz Steifer, Germ\'an Pizarro, Mat\'ias Fuentes, Francisco Meza, Cristian B. Calderon, Crist\'obal Rojas</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to evaluate the theoretical limits of Transformers, allowing us to prove the first lower bounds against one-layer softmax Transformers with infinite precision. We establish those bounds for three tasks that require advanced reasoning. The first task, Match3 (Sanford et al., 2023), requires looking at all triples of positions. The second and third tasks address compositionality-based reasoning: one is composition of functions (Peng et al., 2024) and the other is composition of binary relations. We formally prove the inability of one-layer softmax Transformers to solve any of these tasks. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we introduce Strassen attention and prove that with this mechanism a one-layer Transformer can in principle solve all these tasks. We also show that it enjoys sub-cubic running-time complexity, making it more scalable than similar previously proposed mechanisms, such as higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023). To complement our theoretical findings, we experimentally studied Strassen attention and compared it against standard (Vaswani et al, 2017), higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023) and triangular attention (Bergen et al. 2021). Our results help to disentangle all these attention mechanisms, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In particular, Strassen attention outperforms standard attention significantly on all the tasks. Altogether, understanding the theoretical limitations can guide research towards scalable attention mechanisms that improve the reasoning abilities of Transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Liu, Zhi Han, Yandong Tang, Hai Zhang, Shaojie Tang, Yao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the noisy matrix sensing problem in the over-parameterization setting, where the estimated rank $r$ is larger than the true rank $r_\star$. Specifically, our main objective is to recover a matrix $ X_\star \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times n_2} $ with rank $ r_\star $ from noisy measurements using an over-parameterized factorized form $ LR^\top $, where $ L \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times r}, \, R \in \mathbb{R}^{n_2 \times r} $ and $ \min\{n_1, n_2\} \ge r > r_\star $, with the true rank $ r_\star $ being unknown. Recently, preconditioning methods have been proposed to accelerate the convergence of matrix sensing problem compared to vanilla gradient descent, incorporating preconditioning terms $ (L^\top L + \lambda I)^{-1} $ and $ (R^\top R + \lambda I)^{-1} $ into the original gradient. However, these methods require careful tuning of the damping parameter $\lambda$ and are sensitive to initial points and step size. To address these limitations, we propose the alternating preconditioned gradient descent (APGD) algorithm, which alternately updates the two factor matrices, eliminating the need for the damping parameter and enabling faster convergence with larger step sizes. We theoretically prove that APGD achieves near-optimal error convergence at a linear rate, starting from arbitrary random initializations. Through extensive experiments, we validate our theoretical results and demonstrate that APGD outperforms other methods, achieving the fastest convergence rate. Notably, both our theoretical analysis and experimental results illustrate that APGD does not rely on the initialization procedure, making it more practical and versatile.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwoo Kim, Joonhyung Lee, Gunho Park, Byeongwook Kim, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsoo Lee, Youngjoo Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The introduction of 8-bit floating-point (FP8) computation units in modern AI accelerators has generated significant interest in FP8-based large language model (LLM) inference. Unlike 16-bit floating-point formats, FP8 in deep learning requires a shared scaling factor. Additionally, while E4M3 and E5M2 are well-defined at the individual value level, their scaling and accumulation methods remain unspecified and vary across hardware and software implementations. As a result, FP8 behaves more like a quantization format than a standard numeric representation. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of FP8 computation and acceleration on two AI accelerators: the NVIDIA H100 and Intel Gaudi 2. Our findings highlight that the Gaudi 2, by leveraging FP8, achieves higher throughput-to-power efficiency during LLM inference, offering valuable insights into the practical implications of FP8 adoption for datacenter-scale LLM serving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kim Yong Tan, Yueming Lyu, Ivor Tsang, Yew-Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion-model to address the specific downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training of the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, the offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in the real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaofan Lin, Jiaming Tang, Shuo Yang, Hanshuo Wang, Tian Tang, Boyu Tian, Ion Stoica, Song Han, Mingyu Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging attention sparsity to accelerate long-context large language models (LLMs) has been a hot research topic. However, current algorithms such as sparse attention or key-value (KV) cache compression tend to use a fixed budget, which presents a significant challenge during deployment because it fails to account for the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency can vary greatly. In this paper, we find that borrowing top-$p$ sampling (nucleus sampling) to sparse attention can surprisingly achieve adaptive budgeting. Based on this, we propose Twilight, a framework to bring adaptive sparsity to any existing sparse attention algorithm without sacrificing their accuracy. Empirical results show that Twilight can adaptively prune at most 98% of redundant tokens, leading to $15.4\times$ acceleration in self-attention operations and $3.9\times$ acceleration in end-to-end per token latency in long context LLM decoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Calvin Yeung, Kenjiro Ide, Taiga Someya, Keisuke Fujii</p>
<p>Abstract: Sports analytics has become both more professional and sophisticated, driven by the growing availability of detailed performance data. This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayang Meng, Tao Huang, Xin Shi, Qingyu Huang, Chen Hou, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of deep learning models in privacy-sensitive domains has amplified concerns regarding privacy risks, particularly those stemming from gradient leakage during training. Current privacy assessments primarily rely on post-training attack simulations. However, these methods are inherently reactive, unable to encompass all potential attack scenarios, and often based on idealized adversarial assumptions. These limitations underscore the need for proactive approaches to privacy risk assessment during the training process. To address this gap, we propose the concept of privacy tokens, which are derived directly from private gradients during training. Privacy tokens encapsulate gradient features and, when combined with data features, offer valuable insights into the extent of private information leakage from training data, enabling real-time measurement of privacy risks without relying on adversarial attack simulations. Additionally, we employ Mutual Information (MI) as a robust metric to quantify the relationship between training data and gradients, providing precise and continuous assessments of privacy leakage throughout the training process. Extensive experiments validate our framework, demonstrating the effectiveness of privacy tokens and MI in identifying and quantifying privacy risks. This proactive approach marks a significant advancement in privacy monitoring, promoting the safer deployment of deep learning models in sensitive applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixian Xie, Haode Zhang, Yizhe Feng, Wanxin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward design for reinforcement learning and optimal control agents is challenging. Preference-based alignment addresses this by enabling agents to learn rewards from ranked trajectory pairs provided by humans. However, existing methods often struggle from poor robustness to unknown false human preferences. In this work, we propose a robust and efficient reward alignment method based on a novel and geometrically interpretable perspective: hypothesis space batched cutting. Our method iteratively refines the reward hypothesis space through "cuts" based on batches of human preferences. Within each batch, human preferences, queried based on disagreement, are grouped using a voting function to determine the appropriate cut, ensuring a bounded human query complexity. To handle unknown erroneous preferences, we introduce a conservative cutting method within each batch, preventing erroneous human preferences from making overly aggressive cuts to the hypothesis space. This guarantees provable robustness against false preferences. We evaluate our method in a model predictive control setting across diverse tasks, including DM-Control, dexterous in-hand manipulation, and locomotion. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods in error-free settings while significantly outperforming existing method when handling high percentage of erroneous human preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniil Laptev, Nikita Balagansky, Yaroslav Aksenov, Daniil Gavrilov</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new approach to systematically map features discovered by sparse autoencoder across consecutive layers of large language models, extending earlier work that examined inter-layer feature links. By using a data-free cosine similarity technique, we trace how specific features persist, transform, or first appear at each stage. This method yields granular flow graphs of feature evolution, enabling fine-grained interpretability and mechanistic insights into model computations. Crucially, we demonstrate how these cross-layer feature maps facilitate direct steering of model behavior by amplifying or suppressing chosen features, achieving targeted thematic control in text generation. Together, our findings highlight the utility of a causal, cross-layer interpretability framework that not only clarifies how features develop through forward passes but also provides new means for transparent manipulation of large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Tong (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Lingfei Wu (University of Pittsburgh), James Allen Evans (University of Chicago)</p>
<p>Abstract: Substantial scholarship has estimated the susceptibility of jobs to automation, but little has examined how job contents evolve in the information age as new technologies substitute for tasks, shifting required skills rather than eliminating entire jobs. Here we explore patterns of occupational skill change and characterize occupations and workers subject to the greatest reskilling requirements. Recent work found that changing skill requirements are greatest for STEM occupations in the 2010s. Nevertheless, analyzing 167 million online job posts covering 727 occupations, we find that skill change is greatest for low-skilled occupations when accounting for distance between skills. We further investigate the differences in skill change across employer and market size, as well as social demographic groups. We find that jobs from small employers and markets experienced larger skill upgrades to catch up with the skill demands of their large employers and markets. Female and minority workers are disproportionately employed in low-skilled jobs and face the most significant skill adjustments. While these varied skill changes could create uneven reskilling pressures across workers, they may also lead to a narrowing of gaps in job quality and prospects. We conclude by showcasing our model's potential to chart job evolution directions using skill embedding spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kelin Yu, Yunhai Han, Qixian Wang, Vaibhav Saxena, Danfei Xu, Ye Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Tactile sensing is critical to fine-grained, contact-rich manipulation tasks, such as insertion and assembly. Prior research has shown the possibility of learning tactile-guided policy from teleoperated demonstration data. However, to provide the demonstration, human users often rely on visual feedback to control the robot. This creates a gap between the sensing modality used for controlling the robot (visual) and the modality of interest (tactile). To bridge this gap, we introduce "MimicTouch", a novel framework for learning policies directly from demonstrations provided by human users with their hands. The key innovations are i) a human tactile data collection system which collects multi-modal tactile dataset for learning human's tactile-guided control strategy, ii) an imitation learning-based framework for learning human's tactile-guided control strategy through such data, and iii) an online residual RL framework to bridge the embodiment gap between the human hand and the robot gripper. Through comprehensive experiments, we highlight the efficacy of utilizing human's tactile-guided control strategy to resolve contact-rich manipulation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqiao Wen, Behzad Shayegh, Chenyang Huang, Yanshuai Cao, Lili Mou</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of zero-shot translation emerges when we train a multilingual model with certain translation directions; the model can then directly translate in unseen directions. Alternatively, zero-shot translation can be accomplished by pivoting through a third language (e.g., English). In our work, we observe that both direct and pivot translations are noisy and achieve less satisfactory performance. We propose EBBS, an ensemble method with a novel bi-level beam search algorithm, where each ensemble component explores its own prediction step by step at the lower level but they are synchronized by a "soft voting" mechanism at the upper level. Results on two popular multilingual translation datasets show that EBBS consistently outperforms direct and pivot translations as well as existing ensemble techniques. Further, we can distill the ensemble's knowledge back to the multilingual model to improve inference efficiency; profoundly, our EBBS-based distillation does not sacrifice, or even improves, the translation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Muchen Sun, Ayush Gaggar, Peter Trautman, Todd Murphey</p>
<p>Abstract: Ergodic search enables optimal exploration of an information distribution while guaranteeing the asymptotic coverage of the search space. However, current methods typically have exponential computation complexity in the search space dimension and are restricted to Euclidean space. We introduce a computationally efficient ergodic search method. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we develop a kernel-based ergodic metric and generalize it from Euclidean space to Lie groups. We formally prove the proposed metric is consistent with the standard ergodic metric while guaranteeing linear complexity in the search space dimension. Secondly, we derive the first-order optimality condition of the kernel ergodic metric for nonlinear systems, which enables efficient trajectory optimization. Comprehensive numerical benchmarks show that the proposed method is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed algorithm with a peg-in-hole insertion task. We formulate the problem as a coverage task in the space of SE(3) and use a 30-second-long human demonstration as the prior distribution for ergodic coverage. Ergodicity guarantees the asymptotic solution of the peg-in-hole problem so long as the solution resides within the prior information distribution, which is seen in the 100% success rate.</p>

<p>Abstract: The automated generation of diverse and complex training scenarios has been an important ingredient in many complex learning tasks. Especially in real-world application domains, such as autonomous driving, auto-curriculum generation is considered vital for obtaining robust and general policies. However, crafting traffic scenarios with multiple, heterogeneous agents is typically considered as a tedious and time-consuming task, especially in more complex simulation environments. In our work, we introduce MATS-Gym, a Multi-Agent Traffic Scenario framework to train agents in CARLA, a high-fidelity driving simulator. MATS-Gym is a multi-agent training framework for autonomous driving that uses partial scenario specifications to generate traffic scenarios with variable numbers of agents. This paper unifies various existing approaches to traffic scenario description into a single training framework and demonstrates how it can be integrated with techniques from unsupervised environment design to automate the generation of adaptive auto-curricula.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifan He, Yingqi Cao, Zongyue Qin, Neha Prakriya, Yizhou Sun, Jason Cong</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLM) have been widely used in language processing applications. However, due to the memory constraints of the devices, most of them restrict the context window. Even though recurrent models in previous works can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context and maintain effectiveness, they have ``flat'' memory architectures. Such architectures have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are good at learning and self-adjustment, we believe that imitating brain memory hierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. Thus, we propose the Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that facilitates a model's long-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior. Leveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory hierarchy by preserving tokens from early input segments, passing memory embeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history. Evaluating general language modeling, question-answering tasks, and the summarization task, we show that HMT consistently improves the long-context processing ability of existing models. Furthermore, HMT achieves a comparable or superior generation quality to long-context LLMs with $2 \sim 57\times$ fewer parameters and $2.5 \sim 116\times$ less inference memory, significantly outperforming previous memory-augmented models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica N. Howard, Marc S. Klinger, Anindita Maiti, Alexander G. Stapleton</p>
<p>Abstract: The Neural Network Field Theory correspondence (NNFT) is a mapping from neural network (NN) architectures into the space of statistical field theories (SFTs). The Bayesian renormalization group (BRG) is an information-theoretic coarse graining scheme that generalizes the principles of the exact renormalization group (ERG) to arbitrarily parameterized probability distributions, including those of NNs. In BRG, coarse graining is performed in parameter space with respect to an information-theoretic distinguishability scale set by the Fisher information metric. In this paper, we unify NNFT and BRG to form a powerful new framework for exploring the space of NNs and SFTs, which we coin BRG-NNFT. With BRG-NNFT, NN training dynamics can be interpreted as inducing a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `IR' $\rightarrow$ `UV'. Conversely, applying an information-shell coarse graining to the trained network's parameters induces a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `UV' $\rightarrow$ `IR'. When the information-theoretic cutoff scale coincides with a standard momentum scale, BRG is equivalent to ERG. We demonstrate the BRG-NNFT correspondence on two analytically tractable examples. First, we construct BRG flows for trained, infinite-width NNs, of arbitrary depth, with generic activation functions. As a special case, we then restrict to architectures with a single infinitely-wide layer, scalar outputs, and generalized cos-net activations. In this case, we show that BRG coarse-graining corresponds exactly to the momentum-shell ERG flow of a free scalar SFT. Our analytic results are corroborated by a numerical experiment in which an ensemble of asymptotically wide NNs are trained and subsequently renormalized using an information-shell BRG scheme.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ana Dodik, Vincent Sitzmann, Justin Solomon, Oded Stein</p>
<p>Abstract: Skinning is a popular way to rig and deform characters for animation, to compute reduced-order simulations, and to define features for geometry processing. Methods built on skinning rely on weight functions that distribute the influence of each degree of freedom across the mesh. Automatic skinning methods generate these weight functions with minimal user input, usually by solving a variational problem on a mesh whose boundary is the skinned surface. This formulation necessitates tetrahedralizing the volume bounded by the surface, which brings with it meshing artifacts, the possibility of tetrahedralization failure, and the impossibility of generating weights for surfaces that are not closed. We introduce a mesh-free and robust automatic skinning method that generates high-quality skinning weights comparable to the current state of the art without volumetric meshes. Our method reliably works even on open surfaces and triangle soups where current methods fail. We achieve this through the use of a Lagrangian representation for skinning weights, which circumvents the need for finite elements while optimizing the biharmonic energy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Pouplin, Alan Jeffares, Nabeel Seedat, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing valid prediction intervals rather than point estimates is a well-established approach for uncertainty quantification in the regression setting. Models equipped with this capacity output an interval of values in which the ground truth target will fall with some prespecified probability. This is an essential requirement in many real-world applications where simple point predictions' inability to convey the magnitude and frequency of errors renders them insufficient for high-stakes decisions. Quantile regression is a leading approach for obtaining such intervals via the empirical estimation of quantiles in the (non-parametric) distribution of outputs. This method is simple, computationally inexpensive, interpretable, assumption-free, and effective. However, it does require that the specific quantiles being learned are chosen a priori. This results in (a) intervals that are arbitrarily symmetric around the median which is sub-optimal for realistic skewed distributions, or (b) learning an excessive number of intervals. In this work, we propose Relaxed Quantile Regression (RQR), a direct alternative to quantile regression based interval construction that removes this arbitrary constraint whilst maintaining its strengths. We demonstrate that this added flexibility results in intervals with an improvement in desirable qualities (e.g. mean width) whilst retaining the essential coverage guarantees of quantile regression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duy Khanh Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of ensembling multiple strategies for sequential portfolios to outperform individual strategies in terms of long-term wealth. Due to the uncertainty of strategies' performances in the future market, which are often based on specific models and statistical assumptions, investors often mitigate risk and enhance robustness by combining multiple strategies, akin to common approaches in collective learning prediction. However, the absence of a distribution-free and consistent preference framework complicates decisions of combination due to the ambiguous objective. To address this gap, we introduce a novel framework for decision-making in combining strategies, irrespective of market conditions, by establishing the investor's preference between decisions and then forming a clear objective. Through this framework, we propose a combinatorial strategy construction, free from statistical assumptions, for any scale of component strategies, even infinite, such that it meets the determined criterion. Finally, we test the proposed strategy along with its accelerated variant and some other multi-strategies. The numerical experiments show results in favor of the proposed strategies, albeit with small tradeoffs in their Sharpe ratios, in which their cumulative wealths eventually exceed those of the best component strategies while the accelerated strategy significantly improves performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Tian, Matthew B. Blaschko, Wenpeng Yin, Mingzhe Xing, Yinliang Yue, Marie-Francine Moens</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained category discovery using only coarse-grained supervision is a cost-effective yet challenging task. Previous training methods focus on aligning query samples with positive samples and distancing them from negatives. They often neglect intra-category and inter-category semantic similarities of fine-grained categories when navigating sample distributions in the embedding space. Furthermore, some evaluation techniques that rely on pre-collected test samples are inadequate for real-time applications. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a method that successfully detects fine-grained clusters of semantically similar texts guided by a novel objective function. The method uses semantic similarities in a logarithmic space to guide sample distributions in the Euclidean space and to form distinct clusters that represent fine-grained categories. We also propose a centroid inference mechanism to support real-time applications. The efficacy of the method is both theoretically justified and empirically confirmed on three benchmark tasks. The proposed objective function is integrated in multiple contrastive learning based neural models. Its results surpass existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Accuracy, Adjusted Rand Index and Normalized Mutual Information of the detected fine-grained categories.

<p>Abstract: Trustworthiness in model predictions is crucial for safety-critical applications in the real world. However, deep neural networks often suffer from the issues of uncertainty estimation, such as miscalibration. In this study, we propose $k$-Nearest Neighbor Uncertainty Estimation ($k$NN-UE), which is a new uncertainty estimation method that uses not only the distances from the neighbors, but also the ratio of labels in the neighbors. Experiments on sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and named entity recognition show that our proposed method outperforms the baselines and recent density-based methods in several calibration and uncertainty metrics. Moreover, our analyses indicate that approximate nearest neighbor search techniques reduce the inference overhead without significantly degrading the uncertainty estimation performance when they are appropriately combined.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianpeng Yao, Xiaopan Zhang, Yu Xia, Zejin Wang, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury, Jiachen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables social robots to generate trajectories without relying on human-designed rules or interventions, making it generally more effective than rule-based systems in adapting to complex, dynamic real-world scenarios. However, social navigation is a safety-critical task that requires robots to avoid collisions with pedestrians, whereas existing RL-based solutions often fall short of ensuring safety in complex environments. In this paper, we propose SoNIC, which to the best of our knowledge is the first algorithm that integrates adaptive conformal inference (ACI) with constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) to enable safe policy learning for social navigation. Specifically, our method not only augments RL observations with ACI-generated nonconformity scores, which inform the agent of the quantified uncertainty but also employs these uncertainty estimates to effectively guide the behaviors of RL agents by using constrained reinforcement learning. This integration regulates the behaviors of RL agents and enables them to handle safety-critical situations. On the standard CrowdNav benchmark, our method achieves a success rate of 96.93%, which is 11.67% higher than the previous state-of-the-art RL method and results in 4.5 times fewer collisions and 2.8 times fewer intrusions to ground-truth human future trajectories as well as enhanced robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios. To further validate our approach, we deploy our algorithm on a real robot by developing a ROS2-based navigation system. Our experiments demonstrate that the system can generate robust and socially polite decision-making when interacting with both sparse and dense crowds.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan Kalifa, Uriel Singer, Kira Radinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Proteins play a vital role in biological processes and are indispensable for living organisms. Accurate representation of proteins is crucial, especially in drug development. Recently, there has been a notable increase in interest in utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques for unsupervised learning of protein representations. However, these approaches often focus solely on the amino acid sequence of proteins and lack factual knowledge about proteins and their interactions, thus limiting their performance. In this study, we present GOProteinGNN, a novel architecture that enhances protein language models by integrating protein knowledge graph information during the creation of amino acid level representations. Our approach allows for the integration of information at both the individual amino acid level and the entire protein level, enabling a comprehensive and effective learning process through graph-based learning. By doing so, we can capture complex relationships and dependencies between proteins and their functional annotations, resulting in more robust and contextually enriched protein representations. Unlike previous methods, GOProteinGNN uniquely learns the entire protein knowledge graph during training, which allows it to capture broader relational nuances and dependencies beyond mere triplets as done in previous work. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on several downstream tasks demonstrating that GOProteinGNN consistently outperforms previous methods, showcasing its effectiveness and establishing it as a state-of-the-art solution for protein representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengkang Hu, Pu Zhao, Can Xu, Qingfeng Sun, Jianguang Lou, Qingwei Lin, Ping Luo, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model-based agents have garnered significant attention and are becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, planning ability is a crucial component of an LLM-based agent, which generally entails achieving a desired goal from an initial state. This paper investigates enhancing the planning abilities of LLMs through instruction tuning, referred to as agent training. Recent studies have demonstrated that utilizing expert-level trajectory for instruction-tuning LLMs effectively enhances their planning capabilities. However, existing work primarily focuses on synthesizing trajectories from manually designed planning tasks and environments. The labor-intensive nature of creating these environments and tasks impedes the generation of sufficiently varied and extensive trajectories. To address this limitation, this paper explores the automated synthesis of diverse environments and a gradual range of planning tasks, from easy to difficult. We introduce a framework, AgentGen, that leverages LLMs first to generate environments and subsequently generate planning tasks conditioned on these environments. Specifically, to improve environmental diversity, we propose using an inspiration corpus composed of various domain-specific text segments as the context for synthesizing environments. Moreover, to increase the difficulty diversity of generated planning tasks, we propose a bidirectional evolution method, Bi-Evol, that evolves planning tasks from easier and harder directions to synthesize a task set with a smoother difficulty curve. The evaluation results derived from AgentBoard show that AgentGen greatly improves LLMs' planning ability, e.g., the AgentGen instruction-tuned Llama-3.1-8B surpasses GPT-3.5 in overall performance. Moreover, the AgentGen-tuned Llama-3.1-70B model achieves state-of-the-art results in planning tasks. Project page: https://agent-gen.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Xie, Mutahar Safdar, Lequn Chen, Seung Ki Moon, Yaoyao Fiona Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Various machine learning (ML)-based in-situ monitoring systems have been developed to detect anomalies and defects in laser additive manufacturing (LAM) processes. While multimodal fusion, which integrates data from visual, audio, and other modalities, can improve monitoring performance, it also increases hardware, computational, and operational costs. This paper introduces a cross-modality knowledge transfer (CMKT) methodology for LAM in-situ monitoring, which transfers knowledge from a source modality to a target modality. CMKT enhances the representativeness of the features extracted from the target modality, allowing the removal of source modality sensors during prediction. This paper proposes three CMKT methods: semantic alignment, fully supervised mapping, and semi-supervised mapping. The semantic alignment method establishes a shared encoded space between modalities to facilitate knowledge transfer. It employs a semantic alignment loss to align the distributions of identical groups (e.g., visual and audio defective groups) and a separation loss to distinguish different groups (e.g., visual defective and audio defect-free groups). The two mapping methods transfer knowledge by deriving features from one modality to another using fully supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches. In a case study for LAM in-situ defect detection, the proposed CMKT methods were compared with multimodal audio-visual fusion. The semantic alignment method achieved an accuracy of 98.6% while removing the audio modality during the prediction phase, which is comparable to the 98.2% accuracy obtained through multimodal fusion. Using explainable artificial intelligence, we discovered that semantic alignment CMKT can extract more representative features while reducing noise by leveraging the inherent correlations between modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric R. Anschuetz</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical neural networks with random initialization famously behave as Gaussian processes in the limit of many neurons, which allows one to completely characterize their training and generalization behavior. No such general understanding exists for quantum neural networks (QNNs), which -- outside of certain special cases -- are known to not behave as Gaussian processes when randomly initialized. We here prove that QNNs and their first two derivatives instead generally form what we call "Wishart processes," where certain algebraic properties of the network determine the hyperparameters of the process. This Wishart process description allows us to, for the first time: give necessary and sufficient conditions for a QNN architecture to have a Gaussian process limit; calculate the full gradient distribution, generalizing previously known barren plateau results; and calculate the local minima distribution of algebraically constrained QNNs. Our unified framework suggests a certain simple operational definition for the "trainability" of a given QNN model using a newly introduced, experimentally accessible quantity we call the "degrees of freedom" of the network architecture.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive performance on downstream tasks, yet requiring extensive resource consumption when fully fine-tuning all parameters. To mitigate this, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as LoRA, have been developed. In this paper, we delve into the concept of task-specific directions (TSDs)-critical for transitioning large models from pretrained states to task-specific enhancements in PEFT. We propose a framework to clearly define these directions and explore their properties, and practical utilization challenges. We then introduce a novel approach, LoRA-Dash, which aims to maximize the impact of TSDs during the fine-tuning process, thereby enhancing model performance on targeted tasks. Extensive experiments have conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of LoRA-Dash, and in-depth analyses further reveal the underlying mechanisms of LoRA-Dash.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ang Lv, Ruobing Xie, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: We examine the pre-training dynamics of language models, focusing on their ability to copy text from preceding context--a fundamental skill for various LLM applications, including in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a novel perspective that Transformer-based language models develop copying abilities similarly to grokking, which refers to sudden generalization on test set long after the model fit to the training set. Our experiments yield three arguments: (1) The pre-training loss decreases rapidly, while the context copying ability of models initially lags and then abruptly saturates. (2) The speed of developing copying ability is independent of the number of tokens trained, similarly to how grokking speed is unaffected by dataset size as long as the data distribution is preserved. (3) Induction heads, the attention heads responsible for copying, form from shallow to deep layers during training, mirroring the development of circuits in deeper layers during grokking. We contend that the connection between grokking and context copying can provide valuable insights for more effective language model training, ultimately improving in-context performance. For example, we demonstrated that techniques that enhance grokking, such as regularization, either accelerate or enhance the development of context copying.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic data has become a pivotal resource in post-training tasks for large language models (LLMs) due to the scarcity of high-quality, specific data. While various methods have been developed to generate synthetic data, there remains a discernible gap between the practical effects of synthetic data and our theoretical comprehension. To address this challenge, we commence by presenting a detailed modeling of the prevalent synthetic data generation process. Building upon this modeling, we demonstrate that the generalization capability of the post-trained model is critically determined by the information gain derived from the generative model, as analyzed from a novel reverse-bottleneck perspective. Moreover, we introduce the concept of Generalization Gain via Mutual Information (GGMI) and elucidate the relationship between generalization gain and information gain. This analysis serves as a theoretical foundation for synthetic data generation and further highlights its connection with the generalization capability of post-trained models, offering an understanding about the design of synthetic data generation techniques and the optimization of the post-training process.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated that collective intelligence can significantly surpass the capabilities of individual agents, primarily due to well-crafted inter-agent communication topologies. Despite the diverse and high-performing designs available, practitioners often face confusion when selecting the most effective pipeline for their specific task: \textit{Which topology is the best choice for my task, avoiding unnecessary communication token overhead while ensuring high-quality solution?} In response to this dilemma, we introduce G-Designer, an adaptive, efficient, and robust solution for multi-agent deployment, which dynamically designs task-aware, customized communication topologies. Specifically, G-Designer models the multi-agent system as a multi-agent network, leveraging a variational graph auto-encoder to encode both the nodes (agents) and a task-specific virtual node, and decodes a task-adaptive and high-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks showcase that G-Designer is: \textbf{(1) high-performing}, achieving superior results on MMLU with accuracy at $84.50\%$ and on HumanEval with pass@1 at $89.90\%$; \textbf{(2) task-adaptive}, architecting communication protocols tailored to task difficulty, reducing token consumption by up to $95.33\%$ on HumanEval; and \textbf{(3) adversarially robust}, defending against agent adversarial attacks with merely $0.3\%$ accuracy drop.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) technologies has led to a surge in power consumption across diverse systems, from tiny IoT devices to massive datacenter clusters. Benchmarking the energy efficiency of these systems is crucial for optimization, but presents novel challenges due to the variety of hardware platforms, workload characteristics, and system-level interactions. This paper introduces MLPerf Power, a comprehensive benchmarking methodology with capabilities to evaluate the energy efficiency of ML systems at power levels ranging from microwatts to megawatts. Developed by a consortium of industry professionals from more than 20 organizations, MLPerf Power establishes rules and best practices to ensure comparability across diverse architectures. We use representative workloads from the MLPerf benchmark suite to collect 1,841 reproducible measurements from 60 systems across the entire range of ML deployment scales. Our analysis reveals trade-offs between performance, complexity, and energy efficiency across this wide range of systems, providing actionable insights for designing optimized ML solutions from the smallest edge devices to the largest cloud infrastructures. This work emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency as a key metric in the evaluation and comparison of the ML system, laying the foundation for future research in this critical area. We discuss the implications for developing sustainable AI solutions and standardizing energy efficiency benchmarking for ML systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengrui Guo, Fangxu Zhou, Wei Wu, Qichen Sun, Lishuang Feng, Jinzhuo Wang, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling the nonlinear dynamics of neuronal populations represents a key pursuit in computational neuroscience. Recent research has increasingly focused on jointly modeling neural activity and behavior to unravel their interconnections. Despite significant efforts, these approaches often necessitate either intricate model designs or oversimplified assumptions. Given the frequent absence of perfectly paired neural-behavioral datasets in real-world scenarios when deploying these models, a critical yet understudied research question emerges: how to develop a model that performs well using only neural activity as input at inference, while benefiting from the insights gained from behavioral signals during training?
  To this end, we propose BLEND, the behavior-guided neural population dynamics modeling framework via privileged knowledge distillation. By considering behavior as privileged information, we train a teacher model that takes both behavior observations (privileged features) and neural activities (regular features) as inputs. A student model is then distilled using only neural activity. Unlike existing methods, our framework is model-agnostic and avoids making strong assumptions about the relationship between behavior and neural activity. This allows BLEND to enhance existing neural dynamics modeling architectures without developing specialized models from scratch. Extensive experiments across neural population activity modeling and transcriptomic neuron identity prediction tasks demonstrate strong capabilities of BLEND, reporting over 50% improvement in behavioral decoding and over 15% improvement in transcriptomic neuron identity prediction after behavior-guided distillation. Furthermore, we empirically explore various behavior-guided distillation strategies within the BLEND framework and present a comprehensive analysis of effectiveness and implications for model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Elmoznino, Thomas Jiralerspong, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositionality is believed to be fundamental to intelligence. In humans, it underlies the structure of thought, language, and higher-level reasoning. In AI, compositional representations can enable a powerful form of out-of-distribution generalization, in which a model systematically adapts to novel combinations of known concepts. However, while we have strong intuitions about what compositionality is, there currently exists no formal definition for it that is measurable and mathematical. Here, we propose such a definition, which we call representational compositionality, that accounts for and extends our intuitions about compositionality. The definition is conceptually simple, quantitative, grounded in algorithmic information theory, and applicable to any representation. Intuitively, representational compositionality states that a compositional representation satisfies three properties. First, it must be expressive. Second, it must be possible to re-describe the representation as a function of discrete symbolic sequences with re-combinable parts, analogous to sentences in natural language. Third, the function that relates these symbolic sequences to the representation, analogous to semantics in natural language, must be simple. Through experiments on both synthetic and real world data, we validate our definition of compositionality and show how it unifies disparate intuitions from across the literature in both AI and cognitive science. We also show that representational compositionality, while theoretically intractable, can be readily estimated using standard deep learning tools. Our definition has the potential to inspire the design of novel, theoretically-driven models that better capture the mechanisms of compositional thought.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangmin Bae, Adam Fisch, Hrayr Harutyunyan, Ziwei Ji, Seungyeon Kim, Tal Schuster</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are expensive to deploy. Parameter sharing offers a possible path towards reducing their size and cost, but its effectiveness in modern LLMs remains fairly limited. In this work, we revisit "layer tying" as form of parameter sharing in Transformers, and introduce novel methods for converting existing LLMs into smaller "Recursive Transformers" that share parameters across layers, with minimal loss of performance. Here, our Recursive Transformers are efficiently initialized from standard pretrained Transformers, but only use a single block of unique layers that is then repeated multiple times in a loop. We further improve performance by introducing Relaxed Recursive Transformers that add flexibility to the layer tying constraint via depth-wise low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules, yet still preserve the compactness of the overall model. We show that our recursive models (e.g., recursive Gemma 1B) outperform both similar-sized vanilla pretrained models (such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Pythia 1B) and knowledge distillation baselines -- and can even recover most of the performance of the original "full-size" model (e.g., Gemma 2B with no shared parameters). Finally, we propose Continuous Depth-wise Batching, a promising new inference paradigm enabled by the Recursive Transformer when paired with early exiting. In a theoretical analysis, we show that this has the potential to lead to significant (2-3x) gains in inference throughput.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chika Maduabuchi, Ericmoore Jossou, Matteo Bucci</p>
<p>Abstract: High-speed video (HSV) segmentation is essential for analyzing dynamic physical processes in scientific and industrial applications, such as boiling heat transfer. Existing models like U-Net struggle with generalization and accurately segmenting complex bubble formations. We present VideoSAM, a specialized adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), fine-tuned on a diverse HSV dataset for phase detection. Through diverse experiments, VideoSAM demonstrates superior performance across four fluid environments -- Water, FC-72, Nitrogen, and Argon -- significantly outperforming U-Net in complex segmentation tasks. In addition to introducing VideoSAM, we contribute an open-source HSV segmentation dataset designed for phase detection, enabling future research in this domain. Our findings underscore VideoSAM's potential to set new standards in robust and accurate HSV segmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Pablo Contreras, Crist\'obal Guzm\'an, David Mart\'inez-Rubio</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop algorithms for the optimization of convex objectives that have H\"older continuous $q$-th derivatives by using a $q$-th order oracle, for any $q \geq 1$. Our algorithms work for general norms under mild conditions, including the $\ell_p$-settings for $1\leq p\leq \infty$. We can also optimize structured functions that allow for inexactly implementing a non-Euclidean ball optimization oracle. We do this by developing a non-Euclidean inexact accelerated proximal point method that makes use of an \emph{inexact uniformly convex regularizer}. We show a lower bound for general norms that demonstrates our algorithms are nearly optimal in high-dimensions in the black-box oracle model for $\ell_p$-settings and all $q \geq 1$, even in randomized and parallel settings. This new lower bound, when applied to the first-order smooth case, resolves an open question in parallel convex optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Skyler Seto, Maartje ter Hoeve, Richard He Bai, Natalie Schluter, David Grangier</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive scrapes of the web, as required by current scaling laws. Most progress is made for English, given its abundance of high-quality pretraining data. For most other languages, however, such high quality pretraining data is unavailable. In this work, we study how to boost pretrained model performance in a target language with insufficient pretraining data for training a high performing language model, by enlisting data from an auxiliary language for which high quality data is available. We study this by quantifying the performance gap between training with data in a data-rich auxiliary language compared with training in the target language, exploring the benefits of translation systems, studying the limitations of model scaling when data is limited in the target languages, and proposing new methods for upsampling data from the auxiliary language. Our results show that stronger auxiliary datasets result in performance gains without modification to the model or training objective for close languages, and, in particular, that performance gains due to the development of more information-rich English pretraining datasets can extend to targeted language settings with limited data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixin Wu, Yixin Ji, Zeyuan Chen, Qiang Wang, Cunxiang Wang, Hong Liu, Baijun Ji, Jia Xu, Zhongyi Liu, Jinjie Gu, Yuan Zhou, Linjian Mo</p>
<p>Abstract: Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxence Boels, Yang Liu, Prokar Dasgupta, Alejandro Granados, Sebastien Ourselin</p>
<p>Abstract: While existing approaches excel at recognising current surgical phases, they provide limited foresight and intraoperative guidance into future procedural steps. Similarly, current anticipation methods are constrained to predicting short-term and singular events, neglecting the dense and sequential nature of surgical workflows. To address these needs and limitations, we propose SWAG (Surgical Workflow Anticipative Generation), a framework to combine phase recognition and anticipation, using a generative approach for surgical workflow guidance. This paper investigates two distinct decoding methods-single-pass (SP) and auto-regressive (AR)-to generate sequences of future surgical phases at minute intervals over long horizons of up to 60 minutes. We propose a novel embedding approach using prior knowledge to enhance the accuracy of phase anticipation. Additionally, our anticipative framework offers remaining time regression and proposes a regression-to-classification (R2C) method. SWAG's performance was evaluated on the Cholec80 and AutoLaparo21 datasets. Our single-pass model with prior knowledge embeddings (SP*) achieves 49.8% mean accuracy over 18-minute anticipation on AutoLaparo21, while the simple SP with R2C extension reaches 56.6% mean accuracy over the same horizon on Cholec80. Moreover, our approach outperforms existing methods on the phase remaining time regression task, achieving weighted mean absolute errors of 0.32 and 0.48 minutes for 2- and 3-minute horizons, respectively. SWAG demonstrates versatility across classification and regression tasks and creates a temporal continuity between surgical workflow recognition and anticipation. While further studies are required to understand the impact of generative-based anticipation intraoperatively, our method provides steps towards this direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gursimran Singh, Xinglu Wang, Yifan Hu, Timothy Yu, Linzi Xing, Wei Jiang, Zhefeng Wang, Xiaolong Bai, Yi Li, Ying Xiong, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by handling diverse inputs such as images, audio, and video, but at the cost of adding a multimodal encoding stage that increases both computational and memory overhead. This step negatively impacting key Service Level Objectives (SLOs) like time to first token (TTFT) and end-to-end throughput (E2ETP). We introduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that separates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources. Unlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our approach decouple these steps unlocking new opportunities and optimizations. These include a new mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a novel way to parallelize encoding load within a request, a module to find the optimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel role switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental evaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up to 15$\times$ less utilization), batch sizes (up to 22$\times$ larger), 10$\times$ more images/request, and 2.2$\times$ larger KV caches. Further, it leads to significant improvements in latency metrics (TTFT up to 71\% reduction) and end-to-end throughput (up to 57\% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasan Fallahgoul</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper develops a scale-insensitive framework for neural network significance testing, substantially generalizing existing approaches through three key innovations. First, we replace metric entropy calculations with Rademacher complexity bounds, enabling the analysis of neural networks without requiring bounded weights or specific architectural constraints. Second, we weaken the regularity conditions on the target function to require only Sobolev space membership $H^s([-1,1]^d)$ with $s > d/2$, significantly relaxing previous smoothness assumptions while maintaining optimal approximation rates. Third, we introduce a modified sieve space construction based on moment bounds rather than weight constraints, providing a more natural theoretical framework for modern deep learning practices. Our approach achieves these generalizations while preserving optimal convergence rates and establishing valid asymptotic distributions for test statistics. The technical foundation combines localization theory, sharp concentration inequalities, and scale-insensitive complexity measures to handle unbounded weights and general Lipschitz activation functions. This framework better aligns theoretical guarantees with contemporary deep learning practice while maintaining mathematical rigor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edoardo Ghignone, Nicolas Baumann, Cheng Hu, Jonathan Wang, Lei Xie, Andrea Carron, Michele Magno</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous racing presents a complex environment requiring robust controllers capable of making rapid decisions under dynamic conditions. While traditional controllers based on tire models are reliable, they often demand extensive tuning or system identification. Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods offer significant potential due to their ability to learn directly from interaction, yet they typically suffer from the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulation fail to perform effectively in the real world. In this paper, we propose RLPP, a residual RL framework that enhances a Pure Pursuit (PP) controller with an RL-based residual. This hybrid approach leverages the reliability and interpretability of PP while using RL to fine-tune the controller's performance in real-world scenarios. Extensive testing on the F1TENTH platform demonstrates that RLPP improves lap times of the baseline controllers by up to 6.37 %, closing the gap to the State-of-the-Art methods by more than 52 % and providing reliable performance in zero-shot real-world deployment, overcoming key challenges associated with the sim-to-real transfer and reducing the performance gap from simulation to reality by more than 8-fold when compared to the baseline RL controller. The RLPP framework is made available as an open-source tool, encouraging further exploration and advancement in autonomous racing research. The code is available at: www.github.com/forzaeth/rlpp.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carolyn Jane Anderson, Joydeep Biswas, Aleksander Boruch-Gruszecki, Federico Cassano, Molly Q Feldman, Arjun Guha, Francesca Lucchetti, Zixuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing benchmarks for frontier models often test specialized, ``PhD-level'' knowledge that is difficult for non-experts to grasp. In contrast, we present a benchmark based on the NPR Sunday Puzzle Challenge that requires only general knowledge. Our benchmark is challenging for both humans and models, however correct solutions are easy to verify, and models' mistakes are easy to spot.
  Our work reveals capability gaps that are not evident in existing benchmarks: OpenAI o1 significantly outperforms other reasoning models that are on par on benchmarks that test specialized knowledge. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning outputs uncovers new kinds of failures. DeepSeek R1, for instance, often concedes with ``I give up'' before providing an answer that it knows is wrong. R1 can also be remarkably ``uncertain'' in its output and in rare cases, it does not ``finish thinking,'' which suggests the need for an inference-time technique to ``wrap up'' before the context window limit is reached. We also quantify the effectiveness of reasoning longer with R1 and Gemini Thinking to identify the point beyond which more reasoning is unlikely to improve accuracy on our benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: In high-energy physics, the increasing luminosity and detector granularity at the Large Hadron Collider are driving the need for more efficient data processing solutions. Machine Learning has emerged as a promising tool for reconstructing charged particle tracks, due to its potentially linear computational scaling with detector hits. The recent implementation of a graph neural network-based track reconstruction pipeline in the first level trigger of the LHCb experiment on GPUs serves as a platform for comparative studies between computational architectures in the context of high-energy physics. This paper presents a novel comparison of the throughput of ML model inference between FPGAs and GPUs, focusing on the first step of the track reconstruction pipeline$\unicode{x2013}$an implementation of a multilayer perceptron. Using HLS4ML for FPGA deployment, we benchmark its performance against the GPU implementation and demonstrate the potential of FPGAs for high-throughput, low-latency inference without the need for an expertise in FPGA development and while consuming significantly less power.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayuka Jayawardhana,  Renbo, Samuel Dooley, Valeriia Cherepanova, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Frank Hutter, Colin White, Tom Goldstein, Micah Goldblum</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform remarkably well on tabular datasets in zero- and few-shot settings, since they can extract meaning from natural language column headers that describe features and labels. Similarly, TabPFN, a recent non-LLM transformer pretrained on numerous tables for in-context learning, has demonstrated excellent performance for dataset sizes up to a thousand samples. In contrast, gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) are typically trained from scratch on each dataset without benefiting from pretraining data and must learn the relationships between columns from their entries alone since they lack natural language understanding. LLMs and TabPFN excel on small tabular datasets where a strong prior is essential, yet they are not competitive with GBDTs on medium or large datasets, since their context lengths are limited. In this paper, we propose a simple and lightweight approach for fusing large language models and TabPFN with gradient-boosted decision trees, which allows scalable GBDTs to benefit from the natural language capabilities and pretraining of transformers. We name our fusion methods LLM-Boost and PFN-Boost, respectively. While matching or surpassing the performance of the transformer at sufficiently small dataset sizes and GBDTs at sufficiently large sizes, LLM-Boost and PFN-Boost outperform both standalone components on a wide range of dataset sizes in between. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance against numerous baselines and ensembling algorithms. We find that PFN-Boost achieves the best average performance among all methods we test for all but very small dataset sizes. We release our code at http://github.com/MayukaJ/LLM-Boost .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqing Zhang, Mingjia Yin, Hao Wang, Yawen Li, Yuyang Ye, Xingyu Lou, Junping Du, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of data-centric AI, the focus of recommender systems has shifted from model-centric innovations to data-centric approaches. The success of modern AI models is built on large-scale datasets, but this also results in significant training costs. Dataset distillation has emerged as a key solution, condensing large datasets to accelerate model training while preserving model performance. However, condensing discrete and sequentially correlated user-item interactions, particularly with extensive item sets, presents considerable challenges. This paper introduces \textbf{TD3}, a novel \textbf{T}ucker \textbf{D}ecomposition based \textbf{D}ataset \textbf{D}istillation method within a meta-learning framework, designed for sequential recommendation. TD3 distills a fully expressive \emph{synthetic sequence summary} from original data. To efficiently reduce computational complexity and extract refined latent patterns, Tucker decomposition decouples the summary into four factors: \emph{synthetic user latent factor}, \emph{temporal dynamics latent factor}, \emph{shared item latent factor}, and a \emph{relation core} that models their interconnections. Additionally, a surrogate objective in bi-level optimization is proposed to align feature spaces extracted from models trained on both original data and synthetic sequence summary beyond the na\"ive performance matching approach. In the \emph{inner-loop}, an augmentation technique allows the learner to closely fit the synthetic summary, ensuring an accurate update of it in the \emph{outer-loop}. To accelerate the optimization process and address long dependencies, RaT-BPTT is employed for bi-level optimization. Experiments and analyses on multiple public datasets have confirmed the superiority and cross-architecture generalizability of the proposed designs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Mundt, Anaelia Ovalle, Felix Friedrich, A Pranav, Subarnaduti Paul, Manuel Brack, Kristian Kersting, William Agnew</p>
<p>Abstract: In a widely popular analogy by Turing Award Laureate Yann LeCun, machine intelligence has been compared to cake - where unsupervised learning forms the base, supervised learning adds the icing, and reinforcement learning is the cherry on top. We expand this 'cake that is intelligence' analogy from a simple structural metaphor to the full life-cycle of AI systems, extending it to sourcing of ingredients (data), conception of recipes (instructions), the baking process (training), and the tasting and selling of the cake (evaluation and distribution). Leveraging our re-conceptualization, we describe each step's entailed social ramifications and how they are bounded by statistical assumptions within machine learning. Whereas these technical foundations and social impacts are deeply intertwined, they are often studied in isolation, creating barriers that restrict meaningful participation. Our re-conceptualization paves the way to bridge this gap by mapping where technical foundations interact with social outcomes, highlighting opportunities for cross-disciplinary dialogue. Finally, we conclude with actionable recommendations at each stage of the metaphorical AI cake's life-cycle, empowering prospective AI practitioners, users, and researchers, with increased awareness and ability to engage in broader AI discourse.</p>
