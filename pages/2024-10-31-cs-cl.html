<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxu Wu, Yiren Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology, the accuracy and efficiency of machine translation have become hot topics of research. This paper proposes a novel Seq2Seq model aimed at improving translation quality while reducing the storage space required by the model. The model employs a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (Bi-LSTM) as the encoder to capture the context information of the input sequence; the decoder incorporates an attention mechanism, enhancing the model's ability to focus on key information during the translation process. Compared to the current mainstream Transformer model, our model achieves superior performance on the WMT14 machine translation dataset while maintaining a smaller size.
  The study first introduces the design principles and innovative points of the model architecture, followed by a series of experiments to verify the effectiveness of the model. The experimental includes an assessment of the model's performance on different language pairs, as well as comparative analysis with traditional Seq2Seq models. The results show that while maintaining translation accuracy, our model significantly reduces the storage requirements, which is of great significance for translation applications in resource-constrained scenarios. our code are available at https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/arxiv_papers/miniformer .

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Newman, Yoonjoo Lee, Aakanksha Naik, Pao Siangliulue, Raymond Fok, Juho Kim, Daniel S. Weld, Joseph Chee Chang, Kyle Lo</p>
<p>Abstract: When conducting literature reviews, scientists often create literature review tables - tables whose rows are publications and whose columns constitute a schema, a set of aspects used to compare and contrast the papers. Can we automatically generate these tables using language models (LMs)? In this work, we introduce a framework that leverages LMs to perform this task by decomposing it into separate schema and value generation steps. To enable experimentation, we address two main challenges: First, we overcome a lack of high-quality datasets to benchmark table generation by curating and releasing arxivDIGESTables, a new dataset of 2,228 literature review tables extracted from ArXiv papers that synthesize a total of 7,542 research papers. Second, to support scalable evaluation of model generations against human-authored reference tables, we develop DecontextEval, an automatic evaluation method that aligns elements of tables with the same underlying aspects despite differing surface forms. Given these tools, we evaluate LMs' abilities to reconstruct reference tables, finding this task benefits from additional context to ground the generation (e.g. table captions, in-text references). Finally, through a human evaluation study we find that even when LMs fail to fully reconstruct a reference table, their generated novel aspects can still be useful.</p>

<p>Abstract: Numerous studies have assessed the proficiency of AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), in facilitating everyday tasks such as email writing, question answering, and creative content generation. However, researchers face unique challenges and opportunities in leveraging LLMs for their own work, such as brainstorming research ideas, designing experiments, and writing or reviewing papers. In this study, we introduce AAAR-1.0, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLM performance in three fundamental, expertise-intensive research tasks: (i) EquationInference, assessing the correctness of equations based on the contextual information in paper submissions; (ii) ExperimentDesign, designing experiments to validate research ideas and solutions; (iii) PaperWeakness, identifying weaknesses in paper submissions; and (iv) REVIEWCRITIQUE, identifying each segment in human reviews is deficient or not. AAAR-1.0 differs from prior benchmarks in two key ways: first, it is explicitly research-oriented, with tasks requiring deep domain expertise; second, it is researcher-oriented, mirroring the primary activities that researchers engage in on a daily basis. An evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LLMs reveals their potential as well as limitations in conducting sophisticated research tasks. We will keep iterating AAAR-1.0 to new versions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers promising potential to alleviate the global scarcity of mental health professionals. However, LLMs' alignment with essential mental health counseling competencies remains understudied. We introduce CounselingBench, a novel NCMHCE-based benchmark evaluating LLMs across five key mental health counseling competencies. Testing 22 general-purpose and medical-finetuned LLMs, we find frontier models exceed minimum thresholds but fall short of expert-level performance, with significant variations: they excel in Intake, Assessment & Diagnosis yet struggle with Core Counseling Attributes and Professional Practice & Ethics. Medical LLMs surprisingly underperform generalist models accuracy-wise, while at the same time producing slightly higher-quality justifications but making more context-related errors. Our findings highlight the complexities of developing AI systems for mental health counseling, particularly for competencies requiring empathy and contextual understanding. We found that frontier LLMs perform at a level exceeding the minimal required level of aptitude for all key mental health counseling competencies, but fall short of expert-level performance, and that current medical LLMs do not significantly improve upon generalist models in mental health counseling competencies. This underscores the critical need for specialized, mental health counseling-specific fine-tuned LLMs that rigorously aligns with core competencies combined with appropriate human supervision before any responsible real-world deployment can be considered.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankan Mullick, Sombit Bose, Abhilash Nandy, Gajula Sai Chaitanya, Pawan Goyal</p>
<p>Abstract: In task-oriented dialogue systems, intent detection is crucial for interpreting user queries and providing appropriate responses. Existing research primarily addresses simple queries with a single intent, lacking effective systems for handling complex queries with multiple intents and extracting different intent spans. Additionally, there is a notable absence of multilingual, multi-intent datasets. This study addresses three critical tasks: extracting multiple intent spans from queries, detecting multiple intents, and developing a multi-lingual multi-label intent dataset. We introduce a novel multi-label multi-class intent detection dataset (MLMCID-dataset) curated from existing benchmark datasets. We also propose a pointer network-based architecture (MLMCID) to extract intent spans and detect multiple intents with coarse and fine-grained labels in the form of sextuplets. Comprehensive analysis demonstrates the superiority of our pointer network-based system over baseline approaches in terms of accuracy and F1-score across various datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kexun Zhang, Shang Zhou, Danqing Wang, William Yang Wang, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Sampling is a basic operation in many inference-time algorithms of large language models (LLMs). To scale up inference efficiently with a limited compute, it is crucial to find an optimal allocation for sample compute budgets: Which sampling configurations (model, temperature, language, etc.) do we use? How many samples do we generate in each configuration? We formulate these choices as a learning problem and propose OSCA, an algorithm that Optimizes Sample Compute Allocation by finding an optimal mix of different inference configurations. Our experiments show that with our learned mixed allocation, we can achieve accuracy better than the best single configuration with 128x less compute on code generation and 25x less compute on 4 reasoning tasks. OSCA is also shown to be effective in agentic workflows beyond single-turn tasks, achieving a better accuracy on SWE-Bench with 3x less compute than the default configuration. Our code and generations are released at https://github.com/LeiLiLab/OSCA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Ouyang, Oleksii Hrinchuk, Zhehuai Chen, Vitaly Lavrukhin, Jagadeesh Balam, Lei Li, Boris Ginsburg</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneous machine translation (SMT) takes streaming input utterances and incrementally produces target text. Existing SMT methods only use the partial utterance that has already arrived at the input and the generated hypothesis. Motivated by human interpreters' technique to forecast future words before hearing them, we propose $\textbf{T}$ranslation by $\textbf{A}$nticipating $\textbf{F}$uture (TAF), a method to improve translation quality while retraining low latency. Its core idea is to use a large language model (LLM) to predict future source words and opportunistically translate without introducing too much risk. We evaluate our TAF and multiple baselines of SMT on four language directions. Experiments show that TAF achieves the best translation quality-latency trade-off and outperforms the baselines by up to 5 BLEU points at the same latency (three words).</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22517">Attention Speaks Volumes: Localizing and Mitigating Bias in Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishabh Adiga, Besmira Nushi, Varun Chandrasekaran</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the internal mechanisms of how bias emerges in large language models (LLMs) when provided with ambiguous comparative prompts: inputs that compare or enforce choosing between two or more entities without providing clear context for preference. Most approaches for bias mitigation focus on either post-hoc analysis or data augmentation. However, these are transient solutions, without addressing the root cause: the model itself. Numerous prior works show the influence of the attention module towards steering generations. We believe that analyzing attention is also crucial for understanding bias, as it provides insight into how the LLM distributes its focus across different entities and how this contributes to biased decisions. To this end, we first introduce a metric to quantify the LLM's preference for one entity over another. We then propose $\texttt{ATLAS}$ (Attention-based Targeted Layer Analysis and Scaling), a technique to localize bias to specific layers of the LLM by analyzing attention scores and then reduce bias by scaling attention in these biased layers. To evaluate our method, we conduct experiments across 3 datasets (BBQ, Crows-Pairs, and WinoGender) using $\texttt{GPT-2 XL}$ (1.5B), $\texttt{GPT-J}$ (6B), $\texttt{LLaMA-2}$ (7B) and $\texttt{LLaMA-3}$ (8B). Our experiments demonstrate that bias is concentrated in the later layers, typically around the last third. We also show how $\texttt{ATLAS}$ effectively mitigates bias through targeted interventions without compromising downstream performance and an average increase of only 0.82% in perplexity when the intervention is applied. We see an average improvement of 0.28 points in the bias score across all the datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22552">Auto-Intent: Automated Intent Discovery and Self-Exploration for Large Language Model Web Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaekyeom Kim, Dong-Ki Kim, Lajanugen Logeswaran, Sungryull Sohn, Honglak Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Auto-Intent, a method to adapt a pre-trained large language model (LLM) as an agent for a target domain without direct fine-tuning, where we empirically focus on web navigation tasks. Our approach first discovers the underlying intents from target domain demonstrations unsupervisedly, in a highly compact form (up to three words). With the extracted intents, we train our intent predictor to predict the next intent given the agent's past observations and actions. In particular, we propose a self-exploration approach where top-k probable intent predictions are provided as a hint to the pre-trained LLM agent, which leads to enhanced decision-making capabilities. Auto-Intent substantially improves the performance of GPT-{3.5, 4} and Llama-3.1-{70B, 405B} agents on the large-scale real-website navigation benchmarks from Mind2Web and online navigation tasks from WebArena with its cross-benchmark generalization from Mind2Web.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22587">Toxicity of the Commons: Curating Open-Source Pre-Training Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Catherine Arnett, Eliot Jones, Ivan P. Yamshchikov, Pierre-Carl Langlais</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-source large language models are becoming increasingly available and popular among researchers and practitioners. While significant progress has been made on open-weight models, open training data is a practice yet to be adopted by the leading open-weight models creators. At the same time, there researchers are working to make language models safer. We propose a data curation pipeline to reduce harmful outputs by models trained on public domain data. There are unique challenges to working with public domain data, as these sources differ from web text in both form and content. Many sources are historical documents and are the result of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Consequently, current state-of-the-art approaches to toxicity filtering are often infeasible or inappropriate for open data models. In this paper, we introduce a new fully open-source pipeline for open-data toxicity filtering. Our contributions are threefold. We create a custom training dataset, ToxicCommons, which is composed of texts which have been classified across five different dimensions (racial/origin-based, gender/sex-based, religious, ability-based discrimination, and violence). We use this dataset to train a custom classifier, Celadon, that can be used to detect toxic content in open data more efficiently at a larger scale. Finally, we describe the balanced approach to content filtration that optimizes safety filtering with respect to the filtered data available for training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Diego Rodriguez, Aaron Mueller, Kanishka Misra</p>
<p>Abstract: Property inheritance -- a phenomenon where novel properties are projected from higher level categories (e.g., birds) to lower level ones (e.g., sparrows) -- provides a unique window into how humans organize and deploy conceptual knowledge. It is debated whether this ability arises due to explicitly stored taxonomic knowledge vs. simple computations of similarity between mental representations. How are these mechanistic hypotheses manifested in contemporary language models? In this work, we investigate how LMs perform property inheritance with behavioral and causal representational analysis experiments. We find that taxonomy and categorical similarities are not mutually exclusive in LMs' property inheritance behavior. That is, LMs are more likely to project novel properties from one category to the other when they are taxonomically related and at the same time, highly similar. Our findings provide insight into the conceptual structure of language models and may suggest new psycholinguistic experiments for human subjects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyu Xiao, Lei Wu, Yuhang Gou, Weinan Zhang, Ting Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Argumentative essay generation (AEG) aims to generate complete texts on specific controversial topics or debates. Although current AEG methods can generate individual opinions, they often overlook the high-level connections between these opinions. This often leads to the generated results being mired in logical confusion, unable to proof their own arguments effectively. The generated essay may present evidence that contradicts the claims or they may fail to assemble the claims into logical flow. In this paper, we present a unified two-stage framework: Proof-Enhancement and Self-Annotation (PESA) for AEG with a focus on logical enhancement. Specifically, we first construct pseudo-labels for logical information,claims and grounds, using a large language model. We then propose a tree planning approach that introduces proof principles and ensures logical consistency. Extensive experimental results show that, benefiting from proof principle guidance, PESA generates argumentative essays with better logical validity and persuasiveness than strong baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Garry Kuwanto, Chaitanya Agarwal, Genta Indra Winata, Derry Tanti Wijaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Code-switching, the phenomenon of alternating between two or more languages in a single conversation, presents unique challenges for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Most existing research focuses on either syntactic constraints or neural generation, with few efforts to integrate linguistic theory with large language models (LLMs) for generating natural code-switched text. In this paper, we introduce EZSwitch, a novel framework that combines Equivalence Constraint Theory (ECT) with LLMs to produce linguistically valid and fluent code-switched text. We evaluate our method using both human judgments and automatic metrics, demonstrating a significant improvement in the quality of generated code-switching sentences compared to baseline LLMs. To address the lack of suitable evaluation metrics, we conduct a comprehensive correlation study of various automatic metrics against human scores, revealing that current metrics often fail to capture the nuanced fluency of code-switched text. Additionally, we create CSPref, a human preference dataset based on human ratings and analyze model performance across ``hard`` and ``easy`` examples. Our findings indicate that incorporating linguistic constraints into LLMs leads to more robust and human-aligned generation, paving the way for scalable code-switching text generation across diverse language pairs.</p>

<p>Abstract: To develop high-performing Visual Language Models (VLMs), it is essential to prepare multimodal resources, such as image-text pairs, interleaved data, and instruction data. While multimodal resources for English are abundant, there is a significant lack of corresponding resources for non-English languages, such as Japanese. To address this problem, we take Japanese as a non-English language and propose a method for rapidly creating Japanese multimodal datasets from scratch. We collect Japanese image-text pairs and interleaved data from web archives and generate Japanese instruction data directly from images using an existing VLM. Our experimental results show that a VLM trained on these native datasets outperforms those relying on machine-translated content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sejin Lee, Dongha Kim, Min Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Goal-oriented chatbots are essential for automating user tasks, such as booking flights or making restaurant reservations. A key component of these systems is Dialogue State Tracking (DST), which interprets user intent and maintains the dialogue state. However, existing DST methods often rely on fixed ontologies and manually compiled slot values, limiting their adaptability to open-domain dialogues. We propose a novel approach that leverages instruction tuning and advanced prompt strategies to enhance DST performance, without relying on any predefined ontologies. Our method enables Large Language Model (LLM) to infer dialogue states through carefully designed prompts and includes an anti-hallucination mechanism to ensure accurate tracking in diverse conversation contexts. Additionally, we employ a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) to model and predict subsequent user intent. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art with a JGA of 42.57% outperforming existing ontology-less DST models, and performed well in open-domain real-world conversations. This work presents a significant advancement in creating more adaptive and accurate goal-oriented chatbots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Xiaogeng Liu, Chaowei Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat to large language models (LLMs), enabling goal hijacking and data leakage. Prompt guard models, though effective in defense, suffer from over-defense -- falsely flagging benign inputs as malicious due to trigger word bias. To address this issue, we introduce NotInject, an evaluation dataset that systematically measures over-defense across various prompt guard models. NotInject contains 339 benign samples enriched with trigger words common in prompt injection attacks, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Our results show that state-of-the-art models suffer from over-defense issues, with accuracy dropping close to random guessing levels (60%). To mitigate this, we propose InjecGuard, a novel prompt guard model that incorporates a new training strategy, Mitigating Over-defense for Free (MOF), which significantly reduces the bias on trigger words. InjecGuard demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks including NotInject, surpassing the existing best model by 30.8%, offering a robust and open-source solution for detecting prompt injection attacks.

However, in multi-task scenarios, challenges such as training imbalance and the seesaw effect frequently emerge. Mixture-of-LoRA (MoLoRA), which combines LoRA with sparse Mixture-of-Experts, mitigates some of these issues by promoting task-specific learning across experts. Despite this, MoLoRA remains inefficient in terms of training speed, parameter utilization, and overall multi-task performance. In this paper, we propose Mixture of Asymmetric Low-Rank Adaptaion (MALoRA), a flexible fine-tuning framework that leverages asymmetric optimization across LoRA experts. MALoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by 30% to 48%, increases training speed by 1.2x, and matches the computational efficiency of single-task LoRA models. Additionally, MALoRA addresses overfitting issues commonly seen in high-rank configurations, enhancing performance stability. Extensive experiments across diverse multi-task learning scenarios demonstrate that MALoRA consistently outperforms all baseline methods in both inter-domain and intra-domain tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Li, Ge Li, Xuanming Zhang, Yunfei Zhao, Yihong Dong, Zhi Jin, Binhua Li, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: How to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation remains an open question. Existing benchmarks have two limitations - data leakage and lack of domain-specific evaluation. The former hurts the fairness of benchmarks, and the latter hinders practitioners from selecting superior LLMs for specific programming domains. To address these two limitations, we propose a new benchmark - EvoCodeBench, which has the following advances: (1) Evolving data. EvoCodeBench will be dynamically updated every period (e.g., 6 months) to avoid data leakage. This paper releases the first version - EvoCodeBench-2403, containing 275 samples from 25 repositories. (2) A domain taxonomy and domain labels. Based on the statistics of open-source communities, we design a programming domain taxonomy consisting of 10 popular domains. Based on the taxonomy, we annotate each sample in EvoCodeBench with a domain label. (3) Domain-specific evaluations. Besides the Pass@k, we compute the Domain-Specific Improvement (DSI) and define LLMs' comfort and strange domains. These evaluations help practitioners select superior LLMs in specific domains and discover the shortcomings of existing LLMs. We evaluate 8 popular LLMs (e.g., gpt-4, DeepSeek Coder) on EvoCodeBench and summarize some insights. EvoCodeBench reveals the actual abilities of these LLMs in real-world repositories. For example, the highest Pass@1 of gpt-4 on EvoCodeBench-2403 is only 20.74%. Besides, we evaluate LLMs in different domains and discover their comfort and strange domains. For example, gpt-4 performs best in most domains but falls behind others in the Internet domain. StarCoder 2-15B unexpectedly performs well in the Database domain and even outperforms 33B LLMs. EvoCodeBench has been released.</p>

<p>Abstract: We evaluate a battery of recent large language models on two benchmarks for word sense disambiguation in Swedish. At present, all current models are less accurate than the best supervised disambiguators in cases where a training set is available, but most models outperform graph-based unsupervised systems. Different prompting approaches are compared, with a focus on how to express the set of possible senses in a given context. The best accuracies are achieved when human-written definitions of the senses are included in the prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S{\o}ren Vejlgaard Holm, Lars Kai Hansen, Martin Carsten Nielsen</p>
<p>Abstract: The language technology moonshot moment of Generative, Large Language Models (GLLMs) was not limited to English: These models brought a surge of technological applications, investments and hype to low-resource languages as well. However, the capabilities of these models in languages such as Danish were until recently difficult to verify beyond qualitative demonstrations due to a lack of applicable evaluation corpora. We present a GLLM benchmark to evaluate Danoliteracy, a measure of Danish language and cultural competency, across eight diverse scenarios such Danish citizenship tests and abstractive social media question answering. This limited-size benchmark is found to produce a robust ranking that correlates to human feedback at $\rho \sim 0.8$ with GPT-4 and Claude Opus models achieving the highest rankings. Analyzing these model results across scenarios, we find one strong underlying factor explaining $95\%$ of scenario performance variance for GLLMs in Danish, suggesting a $g$ factor of model consistency in language adaption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Ranaldi, Marco Valentino, Andr\`e Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical mechanism in contemporary NLP to support Large Language Models(LLMs) in systematically accessing richer factual context. However, the integration of RAG mechanisms brings its inherent challenges, as LLMs need to deal with potentially noisy contexts. Recent studies have shown that LLMs still struggle to critically analyse RAG-based in-context information, a limitation that may lead to incorrect inferences and hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how to elicit critical reasoning in RAG via contrastive explanations. In particular, we propose Contrastive-RAG (C-RAG), a framework that (i) retrieves relevant documents given a query, (ii) selects and exemplifies relevant passages, and (iii) generates explanations that explicitly contrast the relevance of the passages to (iv) support the final answer. We show the impact of C-RAG building contrastive reasoning demonstrations from LLMs to instruct smaller models for retrieval-augmented tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-RAG improves state-of-the-art RAG models while (a) requiring significantly fewer prompts and demonstrations and (b) being robust to perturbations in the retrieved documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suchir Salhan, Richard Diehl Martinez, Z\'ebulon Goriely, Paula Buttery</p>
<p>Abstract: Curriculum Learning has been a popular strategy to improve the cognitive plausibility of Small-Scale Language Models (SSLMs) in the BabyLM Challenge. However, it has not led to considerable improvements over non-curriculum models. We assess whether theoretical linguistic acquisition theories can be used to specify more fine-grained curriculum learning strategies, creating age-ordered corpora of Child-Directed Speech for four typologically distant language families to implement SSLMs and acquisition-inspired curricula cross-lingually. Comparing the success of three objective curricula (Growing, Inwards and MMM) that precisely replicate the predictions of acquisition theories on a standard SSLM architecture, we find fine-grained acquisition-inspired curricula can outperform non-curriculum baselines and performance benefits of curricula strategies in SSLMs can be derived by specifying fine-grained language-specific curricula that precisely replicate language acquisition theories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minas Gadalla, Sotiris Nikoletseas, Jos\'e Roberto de A. Amazonas</p>
<p>Abstract: This research explores the interdisciplinary interaction between psychoanalysis and computer science, suggesting a mutually beneficial exchange. Indeed, psychoanalytic concepts can enrich technological applications involving unconscious, elusive aspects of the human factor, such as social media and other interactive digital platforms. Conversely, computer science, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI), can contribute quantitative concepts and methods to psychoanalysis, identifying patterns and emotional cues in human expression. In particular, this research aims to apply computer science methods to establish fundamental relationships between emotions and Lacanian discourses. Such relations are discovered in our approach via empirical investigation and statistical analysis, and are eventually validated in a theoretical (psychoanalytic) way. It is worth noting that, although emotions have been sporadically studied in Lacanian theory, to the best of our knowledge a systematic, detailed investigation of their role is missing. Such fine-grained understanding of the role of emotions can also make the identification of Lacanian discourses more effective and easy in practise. In particular, our methods indicate the emotions with highest differentiation power in terms of corresponding discourses; conversely, we identify for each discourse the most characteristic emotions it admits. As a matter of fact, we develop a method which we call Lacanian Discourse Discovery (LDD), that simplifies (via systematizing) the identification of Lacanian discourses in texts. Although the main contribution of this paper is inherently theoretical (psychoanalytic), it can also facilitate major practical applications in the realm of interactive digital systems. Indeed, our approach can be automated through Artificial Intelligence methods that effectively identify emotions (and corresponding discourses) in texts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Z\'ebulon Goriely, Richard Diehl Martinez, Andrew Caines, Lisa Beinborn, Paula Buttery</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models are typically trained on large corpora of text in their default orthographic form. However, this is not the only option; representing data as streams of phonemes can offer unique advantages, from deeper insights into phonological language acquisition to improved performance on sound-based tasks. The challenge lies in evaluating the impact of phoneme-based training, as most benchmarks are also orthographic. To address this, we develop a pipeline to convert text datasets into a continuous stream of phonemes. We apply this pipeline to the 100-million-word pre-training dataset from the BabyLM challenge, as well as to standard language and grammatical benchmarks, enabling us to pre-train and evaluate a model using phonemic input representations. Our results show that while phoneme-based training slightly reduces performance on traditional language understanding tasks, it offers valuable analytical and practical benefits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanchu Guan, Dong Wang, Yan Wang, Haiqing Wang, Renen Sun, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu, Zhixuan Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous mobile app interaction has become increasingly important with growing complexity of mobile applications. Developing intelligent agents that can effectively navigate and interact with mobile apps remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an Explainable Behavior Cloning LLM Agent (EBC-LLMAgent), a novel approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with behavior cloning by learning demonstrations to create intelligent and explainable agents for autonomous mobile app interaction. EBC-LLMAgent consists of three core modules: Demonstration Encoding, Code Generation, and UI Mapping, which work synergistically to capture user demonstrations, generate executable codes, and establish accurate correspondence between code and UI elements. We introduce the Behavior Cloning Chain Fusion technique to enhance the generalization capabilities of the agent. Extensive experiments on five popular mobile applications from diverse domains demonstrate the superior performance of EBC-LLMAgent, achieving high success rates in task completion, efficient generalization to unseen scenarios, and the generation of meaningful explanations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22932">Multi-Agent Large Language Models for Conversational Task-Solving</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Becker</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era where single large language models have dominated the landscape of artificial intelligence for years, multi-agent systems arise as new protagonists in conversational task-solving. While previous studies have showcased their potential in reasoning tasks and creative endeavors, an analysis of their limitations concerning the conversational paradigms and the impact of individual agents is missing. It remains unascertained how multi-agent discussions perform across tasks of varying complexity and how the structure of these conversations influences the process. To fill that gap, this work systematically evaluates multi-agent systems across various discussion paradigms, assessing their strengths and weaknesses in both generative tasks and question-answering tasks. Alongside the experiments, I propose a taxonomy of 20 multi-agent research studies from 2022 to 2024, followed by the introduction of a framework for deploying multi-agent LLMs in conversational task-solving. I demonstrate that while multi-agent systems excel in complex reasoning tasks, outperforming a single model by leveraging expert personas, they fail on basic tasks. Concretely, I identify three challenges that arise: 1) While longer discussions enhance reasoning, agents fail to maintain conformity to strict task requirements, which leads to problem drift, making shorter conversations more effective for basic tasks. 2) Prolonged discussions risk alignment collapse, raising new safety concerns for these systems. 3) I showcase discussion monopolization through long generations, posing the problem of fairness in decision-making for tasks like summarization. This work uncovers both the potential and challenges that arise with multi-agent interaction and varying conversational paradigms, providing insights into how future research could improve the efficiency, performance, and safety of multi-agent LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: How capable are diffusion models of generating synthetics texts? Recent research shows their strengths, with performance reaching that of auto-regressive LLMs. But are they also good in generating synthetic data if the training was under differential privacy? Here the evidence is missing, yet the promises from private image generation look strong. In this paper we address this open question by extensive experiments. At the same time, we critically assess (and reimplement) previous works on synthetic private text generation with LLMs and reveal some unmet assumptions that might have led to violating the differential privacy guarantees. Our results partly contradict previous non-private findings and show that fully open-source LLMs outperform diffusion models in the privacy regime. Our complete source codes, datasets, and experimental setup is publicly available to foster future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehan Qi, Rongwu Xu, Zhijiang Guo, Cunxiang Wang, Hao Zhang, Wei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising approach to address the limitations of fixed knowledge in large language models (LLMs). However, current benchmarks for evaluating RAG systems suffer from two key deficiencies: (1) they fail to adequately measure LLMs' capability in handling \emph{long-context retrieval} due to a lack of datasets that reflect the characteristics of retrieved documents, and (2) they lack a comprehensive evaluation method for assessing LLMs' ability to generate \emph{long-form responses} that effectively exploits retrieved information. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the \textsc{Long$^2$RAG} benchmark and the Key Point Recall (\textit{KPR}) metric. \textsc{Long$^2$RAG} comprises 280 questions spanning 10 domains and across 8 question categories, each associated with 5 retrieved documents with an average length of 2,444 words. \textit{KPR} evaluates the extent to which LLMs incorporate key points extracted from the retrieved documents into their generated responses, providing a more nuanced assessment of their ability to exploit retrieved information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debjyoti Saharoy, Javed A. Aslam, Virgil Pavlu</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art Extreme Multi-Label Text Classification (XMTC) models rely heavily on multi-label attention layers to focus on key tokens in input text, but obtaining optimal attention weights is challenging and resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce PLANT -- Pretrained and Leveraged AtteNTion -- a novel transfer learning strategy for fine-tuning XMTC decoders. PLANT surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods across all metrics on mimicfull, mimicfifty, mimicfour, eurlex, and wikiten datasets. It particularly excels in few-shot scenarios, outperforming previous models specifically designed for few-shot scenarios by over 50 percentage points in F1 scores on mimicrare and by over 36 percentage points on mimicfew, demonstrating its superior capability in handling rare codes. PLANT also shows remarkable data efficiency in few-shot scenarios, achieving precision comparable to traditional models with significantly less data. These results are achieved through key technical innovations: leveraging a pretrained Learning-to-Rank model as the planted attention layer, integrating mutual-information gain to enhance attention, introducing an inattention mechanism, and implementing a stateful-decoder to maintain context. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the importance of these contributions in realizing the performance gains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are essential in natural language processing but often struggle with inference speed and computational efficiency, limiting real-time deployment. The key-value (KV) cache mechanism reduces computational overhead in transformer models, but challenges in maintaining contextual understanding remain. In this paper, we propose BUZZ, a novel KV caching algorithm that leverages structured contextual information to minimize cache memory usage while enhancing inference speed. BUZZ employs a beehive-structured sparse cache, incorporating a sliding window to capture recent information and dynamically segmenting historical tokens into chunks to prioritize important tokens in local neighborhoods. We evaluate BUZZ on four real-world datasets: CNN/Daily Mail, XSUM, Wikitext, and 10-QA. Our results demonstrate that BUZZ (1) reduces cache memory usage by $\textbf{2.5}\times$ in LLM inference while maintaining over 99% accuracy in long-text summarization, and (2) surpasses state-of-the-art performance in multi-document question answering by $\textbf{7.69%}$ under the same memory limit, where full cache methods encounter out-of-memory issues. Additionally, BUZZ achieves significant inference speedup with a $\log{n}$ time complexity. The code is available at https://github.com/JunqiZhao888/buzz-llm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Shu, Mengnan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning can help Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt new tasks without additional training. However, this performance heavily depends on the quality of the demonstrations, driving research into effective demonstration selection algorithms to optimize this process. These algorithms assist users in selecting the best $k$ input-label pairs (demonstration examples) based on a given test input, enabling LLMs to in-context learn the relationship between the provided examples and the test inputs. Despite all the proposed demonstration selection algorithms, their efficiency and effectiveness remain unclear. This lack of clarity make it difficult to apply these algorithms in real-world scenarios and poses challenges for future research aimed at developing improved methods. This paper revisits six proposed algorithms, evaluating them on five datasets from both efficiency and effectiveness perspectives. Our experiments reveal significant variations in algorithm performance across different tasks, with some methods struggling to outperform random selection in certain scenarios. We also find that increasing the number of demonstrations does not always lead to better performance, and that there are often trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.

We show an increase in accuracy on the adversarial test set (+ 13%) while still maintaining good performance on the original NLI task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chulin Xie, Yangsibo Huang, Chiyuan Zhang, Da Yu, Xinyun Chen, Bill Yuchen Lin, Bo Li, Badih Ghazi, Ravi Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve good performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks, yet could also make basic reasoning mistakes. This contrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly high and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be due to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically investigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in reasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We found that LLMs could interpolate the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after fine-tuning, yet fail when those puzzles are slightly perturbed, suggesting that the models heavily rely on memorization to solve those training puzzles. On the other hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also consistently improves generalization performance. In-depth analyses with perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model internals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers suggest that the LLMs learn to reason on K&K puzzles despite training data memorization. This phenomenon indicates that LLMs exhibit a complex interplay between memorization and genuine reasoning abilities. Finally, our analysis with per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization in solving logical puzzles.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Khalilia, Jahna Otterbacher, Gabor Bella, Rusma Noortyani, Shandy Darma, Fausto Giunchiglia</p>
<p>Abstract: Lexical-semantic resources (LSRs), such as online lexicons or wordnets, are fundamental for natural language processing applications. In many languages, however, such resources suffer from quality issues: incorrect entries, incompleteness, but also, the rarely addressed issue of bias towards the English language and Anglo-Saxon culture. Such bias manifests itself in the absence of concepts specific to the language or culture at hand, the presence of foreign (Anglo-Saxon) concepts, as well as in the lack of an explicit indication of untranslatability, also known as cross-lingual \emph{lexical gaps}, when a term has no equivalent in another language. This paper proposes a novel crowdsourcing methodology for reducing bias in LSRs. Crowd workers compare lexemes from two languages, focusing on domains rich in lexical diversity, such as kinship or food. Our LingoGap crowdsourcing tool facilitates comparisons through microtasks identifying equivalent terms, language-specific terms, and lexical gaps across languages. We validated our method by applying it to two case studies focused on food-related terminology: (1) English and Arabic, and (2) Standard Indonesian and Banjarese. These experiments identified 2,140 lexical gaps in the first case study and 951 in the second. The success of these experiments confirmed the usability of our method and tool for future large-scale lexicon enrichment tasks.</p>

Participants in our experiment discern truth from lies by evaluating transcripts from a game show that mimicked deceptive social media exchanges on topics with objective truths. We find that when relying on low-quality advisors without disclosures, participants' truth-detection rates fall below their own abilities, which recovered once the AI's true effectiveness was revealed. Conversely, high-quality advisor enhances truth detection, regardless of disclosure. We discover that participants' expectations about AI capabilities contribute to their undue reliance on opaque, low-quality advisors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxiao Wang, Lihui Gu, Liye Zhang, Yunxiang Luo, Yi Dai, Chen Shen, Liang Xie, Binbin Lin, Xiaofei He, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of interdisciplinary research pose significant challenges for researchers, including information overload and difficulties in exploring novel ideas. The advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown great potential in enhancing idea proposals, but how to effectively utilize large models for reasonable idea proposal has not been thoroughly explored. This paper proposes a scientific paper idea proposer (SciPIP). Based on a user-provided research background, SciPIP retrieves helpful papers from a literature database while leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to generate more novel and feasible ideas. To this end, 1) we construct a literature retrieval database, extracting lots of papers' multi-dimension information for fast access. Then, a literature retrieval method based on semantics, entity, and citation co-occurrences is proposed to search relevant literature from multiple aspects based on the user-provided background. 2) After literature retrieval, we introduce dual-path idea proposal strategies, where one path infers solutions from the retrieved literature and the other path generates original ideas through model brainstorming. We then combine the two to achieve a good balance between feasibility and originality. Through extensive experiments on the natural language processing (NLP) field, we demonstrate that SciPIP can retrieve citations similar to those of existing top conference papers and generate many ideas consistent with them. Additionally, we evaluate the originality of other ideas generated by SciPIP using large language models, further validating the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code and the database are released at https://github.com/cheerss/SciPIP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kayla Schroeder, Zach Wood-Doughty</p>
<p>Abstract: Topic models allow researchers to extract latent factors from text data and use those variables in downstream statistical analyses. However, these methodologies can vary significantly due to initialization differences, randomness in sampling procedures, or noisy data. Reliability of these methods is of particular concern as many researchers treat learned topic models as ground truth for subsequent analyses. In this work, we show that the standard practice for quantifying topic model reliability fails to capture essential aspects of the variation in two widely-used topic models. Drawing from a extensive literature on measurement theory, we provide empirical and theoretical analyses of three other metrics for evaluating the reliability of topic models. On synthetic and real-world data, we show that McDonald's $\omega$ provides the best encapsulation of reliability. This metric provides an essential tool for validation of topic model methodologies that should be a standard component of any topic model-based research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyong Wu, Zhenyu Wu, Fangzhi Xu, Yian Wang, Qiushi Sun, Chengyou Jia, Kanzhi Cheng, Zichen Ding, Liheng Chen, Paul Pu Liang, Yu Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing efforts in building GUI agents heavily rely on the availability of robust commercial Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and GeminiProVision. Practitioners are often reluctant to use open-source VLMs due to their significant performance lag compared to their closed-source counterparts, particularly in GUI grounding and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate future research in this area, we developed OS-Atlas - a foundational GUI action model that excels at GUI grounding and OOD agentic tasks through innovations in both data and modeling. We have invested significant engineering effort in developing an open-source toolkit for synthesizing GUI grounding data across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and the web. Leveraging this toolkit, we are releasing the largest open-source cross-platform GUI grounding corpus to date, which contains over 13 million GUI elements. This dataset, combined with innovations in model training, provides a solid foundation for OS-Atlas to understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. Through extensive evaluation across six benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web), OS-Atlas demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation also uncovers valuable insights into continuously improving and scaling the agentic capabilities of open-source VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Qiu, Alexander R. Fabbri, Divyansh Agarwal, Kung-Hsiang Huang, Sarah Tan, Nanyun Peng, Chien-Sheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand into performing as agents for real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks, evaluating their robustness becomes increasingly important. However, existing benchmarks often overlook critical dimensions like cultural and social awareness. To address these, we introduce CASA, a benchmark designed to assess LLM agents' sensitivity to cultural and social norms across two web-based tasks: online shopping and social discussion forums. Our approach evaluates LLM agents' ability to detect and appropriately respond to norm-violating user queries and observations. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures awareness coverage, helpfulness in managing user queries, and the violation rate when facing misleading web content. Experiments show that current LLMs perform significantly better in non-agent than in web-based agent environments, with agents achieving less than 10% awareness coverage and over 40% violation rates. To improve performance, we explore two methods: prompting and fine-tuning, and find that combining both methods can offer complementary advantages -- fine-tuning on culture-specific datasets significantly enhances the agents' ability to generalize across different regions, while prompting boosts the agents' ability to navigate complex tasks. These findings highlight the importance of constantly benchmarking LLM agents' cultural and social awareness during the development cycle.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23261">$100K or 100 Days: Trade-offs when Pre-Training with Academic Resources</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Apoorv Khandelwal, Tian Yun, Nihal V. Nayak, Jack Merullo, Stephen H. Bach, Chen Sun, Ellie Pavlick</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-training is notoriously compute-intensive and academic researchers are notoriously under-resourced. It is, therefore, commonly assumed that academics can't pre-train models. In this paper, we seek to clarify this assumption. We first survey academic researchers to learn about their available compute and then empirically measure the time to replicate models on such resources. We introduce a benchmark to measure the time to pre-train models on given GPUs and also identify ideal settings for maximizing training speed. We run our benchmark on a range of models and academic GPUs, spending 2,000 GPU-hours on our experiments. Our results reveal a brighter picture for academic pre-training: for example, although Pythia-1B was originally trained on 64 GPUs for 3 days, we find it is also possible to replicate this model (with the same hyper-parameters) in 3x fewer GPU-days: i.e. on 4 GPUs in 18 days. We conclude with a cost-benefit analysis to help clarify the trade-offs between price and pre-training time. We believe our benchmark will help academic researchers conduct experiments that require training larger models on more data. We fully release our codebase at: https://github.com/apoorvkh/academic-pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Narayanan Venkit, Philippe Laban, Yilun Zhou, Yixin Mao, Chien-Sheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based applications are graduating from research prototypes to products serving millions of users, influencing how people write and consume information. A prominent example is the appearance of Answer Engines: LLM-based generative search engines supplanting traditional search engines. Answer engines not only retrieve relevant sources to a user query but synthesize answer summaries that cite the sources. To understand these systems' limitations, we first conducted a study with 21 participants, evaluating interactions with answer vs. traditional search engines and identifying 16 answer engine limitations. From these insights, we propose 16 answer engine design recommendations, linked to 8 metrics. An automated evaluation implementing our metrics on three popular engines (You.com, Perplexity.ai, BingChat) quantifies common limitations (e.g., frequent hallucination, inaccurate citation) and unique features (e.g., variation in answer confidence), with results mirroring user study insights. We release our Answer Engine Evaluation benchmark (AEE) to facilitate transparent evaluation of LLM-based applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongwu Chen, Chengjin Xu, Dingmin Wang, Zhen Huang, Yong Dou, Jian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework has shown promising potential in knowledge-intensive question answering (QA) by retrieving external corpus and generating based on augmented context. However, existing approaches only consider the query itself, neither specifying the retrieval preferences for the retrievers nor informing the generators of how to refer to the retrieved documents for the answers, which poses a significant challenge to the QA performance. To address these issues, we propose Rule-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with LMs, which explicitly introduces symbolic rules as demonstrations for in-context learning (RuleRAG-ICL) to guide retrievers to retrieve logically related documents in the directions of rules and uniformly guide generators to generate answers attributed by the guidance of the same set of rules. Moreover, the combination of queries and rules can be further used as supervised fine-tuning data to update retrievers and generators (RuleRAG-FT) to achieve better rule-based instruction following capability, leading to retrieve more supportive results and generate more acceptable answers. To emphasize the attribution of rules, we construct five rule-aware QA benchmarks, including three temporal and two static scenarios, and equip RuleRAG with several kinds of retrievers and generators. Experiments demonstrate that training-free RuleRAG-ICL effectively improves the retrieval quality of +89.2% in Recall@10 scores and generation accuracy of +103.1% in exact match scores over standard RAG on average across the five benchmarks, and further fine-tuned RuleRAG-FT consistently yields more significant performance enhancement. Extensive analyses indicate that RuleRAG scales well with increasing numbers of retrieved documents and exhibits generalization ability for untrained rules.</p>

<p>Abstract: The applications of generative AI have become extremely impressive, and the interplay between users and AI is even more so. Current human-AI interaction literature has taken a broad look at how humans interact with generative AI, but it lacks specificity regarding the user interface designs and patterns used to create these applications. Therefore, we present a survey that comprehensively presents taxonomies of how a human interacts with AI and the user interaction patterns designed to meet the needs of a variety of relevant use cases. We focus primarily on user-guided interactions, surveying interactions that are initiated by the user and do not include any implicit signals given by the user. With this survey, we aim to create a compendium of different user-interaction patterns that can be used as a reference for designers and developers alike. In doing so, we also strive to lower the entry barrier for those attempting to learn more about the design of generative AI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minju Seo, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and generating codes. Due to these capabilities, many recent methods are proposed to automatically refine the codes with LLMs. However, we should rethink that the refined codes (from LLMs and even humans) are not always more efficient than their original versions. On the other hand, running two different versions of codes and comparing them every time is not ideal and time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel method based on the code language model that is trained to judge the efficiency between two different codes (generated across humans and machines) by either classifying the superior one or predicting the relative improvement. We validate our method on multiple programming languages with multiple refinement steps, demonstrating that the proposed method can effectively distinguish between more and less efficient versions of code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongmin Park, Sebin Kim, Taehong Moon, Minkyu Kim, Kangwook Lee, Jaewoong Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander H. Liu, Qirui Wang, Yuan Gong, James Glass</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Audio Codecs, initially designed as a compression technique, have gained more attention recently for speech generation. Codec models represent each audio frame as a sequence of tokens, i.e., discrete embeddings. The discrete and low-frequency nature of neural codecs introduced a new way to generate speech with token-based models. As these tokens encode information at various levels of granularity, from coarse to fine, most existing works focus on how to better generate the coarse tokens. In this paper, we focus on an equally important but often overlooked question: How can we better resynthesize the waveform from coarse tokens? We point out that both the choice of learning target and resynthesis approach have a dramatic impact on the generated audio quality. Specifically, we study two different strategies based on token prediction and regression, and introduce a new method based on Schr\"odinger Bridge. We examine how different design choices affect machine and human perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Garret Gabriel, Alaa Alameer Ahmad, Shankar Kumar Jeyakumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of autonomous agentic systems by enabling dynamic, context-aware task decomposition and automated tool selection. These sophisticated systems possess significant automation potential across various industries, managing complex tasks, interacting with external systems to enhance knowledge, and executing actions independently. This paper presents three primary contributions to advance this field:
  - Advanced Agentic Framework: A system that handles multi-hop queries, generates and executes task graphs, selects appropriate tools, and adapts to real-time changes.
  - Novel Evaluation Metrics: Introduction of Node F1 Score, Structural Similarity Index (SSI), and Tool F1 Score to comprehensively assess agentic systems.
  - Specialized Dataset: Development of an AsyncHow-based dataset for analyzing agent behavior across different task complexities.
  Our findings reveal that asynchronous and dynamic task graph decomposition significantly enhances system responsiveness and scalability, particularly for complex, multi-step tasks. Detailed analysis shows that structural and node-level metrics are crucial for sequential tasks, while tool-related metrics are more important for parallel tasks. Specifically, the Structural Similarity Index (SSI) is the most significant predictor of performance in sequential tasks, and the Tool F1 Score is essential for parallel tasks. These insights highlight the need for balanced evaluation methods that capture both structural and operational dimensions of agentic systems. Additionally, our evaluation framework, validated through empirical analysis and statistical testing, provides valuable insights for improving the adaptability and reliability of agentic systems in dynamic environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluations are limited by benchmark availability. As models evolve, there is a need to create benchmarks that can measure progress on new generative capabilities. However, creating new benchmarks through human annotations is slow and expensive, restricting comprehensive evaluations for any capability. We introduce BENCHAGENTS, a framework that methodically leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate benchmark creation for complex capabilities while inherently ensuring data and metric quality. BENCHAGENTS decomposes the benchmark creation process into planning, generation, data verification, and evaluation, each of which is executed by an LLM agent. These agents interact with each other and utilize human-in-the-loop feedback from benchmark developers to explicitly improve and flexibly control data diversity and quality. We use BENCHAGENTS to create benchmarks to evaluate capabilities related to planning and constraint satisfaction during text generation. We then use these benchmarks to study seven state-of-the-art models and extract new insights on common failure modes and model differences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lam Nguyen Tung, Steven Cho, Xiaoning Du, Neelofar Neelofar, Valerio Terragni, Stefano Ruberto, Aldeida Aleti</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) for text classification has been widely used in various domains, such as toxicity detection, chatbot consulting, and review analysis. These applications can significantly impact ethics, economics, and human behavior, raising serious concerns about trusting ML decisions. Several studies indicate that traditional metrics, such as model confidence and accuracy, are insufficient to build human trust in ML models. These models often learn spurious correlations during training and predict based on them during inference. In the real world, where such correlations are absent, their performance can deteriorate significantly. To avoid this, a common practice is to test whether predictions are reasonable. Along with this, a challenge known as the trustworthiness oracle problem has been introduced. Due to the lack of automated trustworthiness oracles, the assessment requires manual validation of the decision process disclosed by explanation methods, which is time-consuming and not scalable. We propose TOKI, the first automated trustworthiness oracle generation method for text classifiers, which automatically checks whether the prediction-contributing words are related to the predicted class using explanation methods and word embeddings. To demonstrate its practical usefulness, we introduce a novel adversarial attack method targeting trustworthiness issues identified by TOKI. We compare TOKI with a naive baseline based solely on model confidence using human-created ground truths of 6,000 predictions. We also compare TOKI-guided adversarial attack method with A2T, a SOTA adversarial attack method. Results show that relying on prediction uncertainty cannot distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy predictions, TOKI achieves 142% higher accuracy than the naive baseline, and TOKI-guided adversarial attack method is more effective with fewer perturbations than A2T.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yashvir S. Grewal, Edwin V. Bonilla, Thang D. Bui</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately quantifying uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for their reliable deployment, especially in high-stakes applications. Current state-of-the-art methods for measuring semantic uncertainty in LLMs rely on strict bidirectional entailment criteria between multiple generated responses and also depend on sequence likelihoods. While effective, these approaches often overestimate uncertainty due to their sensitivity to minor wording differences, additional correct information, and non-important words in the sequence. We propose a novel approach that leverages semantic embeddings to achieve smoother and more robust estimation of semantic uncertainty in LLMs. By capturing semantic similarities without depending on sequence likelihoods, our method inherently reduces any biases introduced by irrelevant words in the answers. Furthermore, we introduce an amortised version of our approach by explicitly modelling semantics as latent variables in a joint probabilistic model. This allows for uncertainty estimation in the embedding space with a single forward pass, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing multi-pass methods. Experiments across multiple question-answering datasets and frontier LLMs demonstrate that our embedding-based methods provide more accurate and nuanced uncertainty quantification than traditional approaches.</p>

In this paper, we show how an adversary that can arrange for their queries to appear in the same batch of examples as a victim's queries can exploit Expert-Choice-Routing to fully disclose a victim's prompt. We successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of this attack on a two-layer Mixtral model, exploiting the tie-handling behavior of the torch.topk CUDA implementation. Our results show that we can extract the entire prompt using $O({VM}^2)$ queries (with vocabulary size $V$ and prompt length $M$) or 100 queries on average per token in the setting we consider. This is the first attack to exploit architectural flaws for the purpose of extracting user prompts, introducing a new class of LLM vulnerabilities.</p>

To facilitate research on this critical safety problem, we first construct a new laRge-scale Adervsarial images dataset with Diverse hArmful Responses (RADAR), given that existing datasets are either small-scale or only contain limited types of harmful responses. With the new RADAR dataset, we further develop a novel and effective iN-time Embedding-based AdveRSarial Image DEtection (NEARSIDE) method, which exploits a single vector that distilled from the hidden states of VLMs, which we call the attacking direction, to achieve the detection of adversarial images against benign ones in the input. Extensive experiments with two victim VLMs, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, well demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and cross-model transferrability of our proposed method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jae Hyeon Cho, Minkyung Park, Byung-Jun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) trains a language model using human preference data, bypassing the explicit reward modeling phase of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). By iterating over sentence pairs in a preference dataset, DPO enhances generation quality by increasing the likelihood of producing preferred sentences over less favored ones. Preference datasets are typically created by selecting preferred sentences through a voting process involving multiple individuals, as opinions can vary due to the subjective nature of human preferences. While the number of votes offers insight into whether a sentence pair is clearly preferable or controversial, current methods do not fully leverage this information. In this paper, we introduce a technique that leverages user voting data to better align with diverse subjective preferences. We employ the Bayesian Minimum Mean Square Error (Bayesian MMSE) estimator to model the probability that one generation is preferable to another. Using this estimated probability as a target, we develop the Vote-based Preference Optimization (VPO) framework, which incorporates the number of votes on both sides to distinguish between controversial and obvious generation pairs. We show that previous algorithms, such as DPO and Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), can be extended using the proposed framework, termed VDPO and VIPO. Our experiments demonstrate that these proposed algorithms outperform various existing methods, including their base algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the success of Instruction Tuning (IT) in training large language models (LLMs) to perform arbitrary user-specified tasks, these models often still leverage spurious or biased features learned from their training data, leading to undesired behaviours when deploying them in new contexts. In this work, we introduce Focus Instruction Tuning (FIT), which trains LLMs to condition their responses by focusing on specific features whilst ignoring others, leading to different behaviours based on what features are specified. Across several experimental settings, we show that focus-tuned models can be adaptively steered by focusing on different features at inference-time: for instance, robustness can be improved by focusing on task-causal features and ignoring spurious features, and social bias can be mitigated by ignoring demographic categories. Furthermore, FIT can steer behaviour in new contexts, generalising under distribution shift and to new unseen features at inference time, and thereby facilitating more robust, fair, and controllable LLM applications in real-world environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingkun Ma, Runzhe Zhan, Derek F. Wong, Yang Li, Di Sun, Hou Pong Chan, Lidia S. Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Although previous research on large language models (LLMs) and large multi-modal models (LMMs) has systematically explored mathematical problem-solving (MPS) within visual contexts, the analysis of how these models process visual information during problem-solving remains insufficient. To address this gap, we present VisAidMath, a benchmark for evaluating the MPS process related to visual information. We follow a rigorous data curation pipeline involving both automated processes and manual annotations to ensure data quality and reliability. Consequently, this benchmark includes 1,200 challenging problems from various mathematical branches, vision-aid formulations, and difficulty levels, collected from diverse sources such as textbooks, examination papers, and Olympiad problems. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on ten mainstream LLMs and LMMs, highlighting deficiencies in the visual-aided reasoning process. For example, GPT-4V only achieves 45.33% accuracy in the visual-aided reasoning task, even with a drop of 2 points when provided with golden visual aids. In-depth analysis reveals that the main cause of deficiencies lies in hallucination regarding the implicit visual reasoning process, shedding light on future research directions in the visual-aided MPS process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinqing Zheng, Mikael Henaff, Amy Zhang, Aditya Grover, Brandon Amos</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically synthesizing dense rewards from natural language descriptions is a promising paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), with applications to sparse reward problems, open-ended exploration, and hierarchical skill design. Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of environment samples; or are limited to reward functions expressible by compact code, which may require source code and have difficulty capturing nuanced semantics; or require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose ONI, a distributed architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and ranking models. By studying their relative tradeoffs, we shed light on questions regarding intrinsic reward design for sparse reward problems. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of challenging, sparse reward tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment in a simple unified process, solely using the agent's gathered experience, without requiring external datasets nor source code. We make our code available at \url{URL} (coming soon).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pau Rodriguez, Arno Blaas, Michal Klein, Luca Zappella, Nicholas Apostoloff, Marco Cuturi, Xavier Suau</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing capabilities of large generative models and their ever more widespread deployment have raised concerns about their reliability, safety, and potential misuse. To address these issues, recent works have proposed to control model generation by steering model activations in order to effectively induce or prevent the emergence of concepts or behaviors in the generated output. In this paper we introduce Activation Transport (AcT), a general framework to steer activations guided by optimal transport theory that generalizes many previous activation-steering works. AcT is modality-agnostic and provides fine-grained control over the model behavior with negligible computational overhead, while minimally impacting model abilities. We experimentally show the effectiveness and versatility of our approach by addressing key challenges in large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models (T2Is). For LLMs, we show that AcT can effectively mitigate toxicity, induce arbitrary concepts, and increase their truthfulness. In T2Is, we show how AcT enables fine-grained style control and concept negation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MPLSandbox, an out-of-the-box multi-programming language sandbox designed to provide unified and comprehensive feedback from compiler and analysis tools for Large Language Models (LLMs). It can automatically identify the programming language of the code, compiling and executing it within an isolated sub-sandbox to ensure safety and stability. In addition, MPLSandbox also integrates both traditional and LLM-based code analysis tools, providing a comprehensive analysis of generated code. MPLSandbox can be effortlessly integrated into the training and deployment of LLMs to improve the quality and correctness of their generated code. It also helps researchers streamline their workflows for various LLM-based code-related tasks, reducing the development cost. To validate the effectiveness of MPLSandbox, we integrate it into training and deployment approaches, and also employ it to optimize workflows for a wide range of real-world code-related tasks. Our goal is to enhance researcher productivity on LLM-based code-related tasks by simplifying and automating workflows through delegation to MPLSandbox.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiruo Cheng, Kelong Mao, Ziliang Zhao, Guanting Dong, Hongjin Qian, Yongkang Wu, Tetsuya Sakai, Ji-Rong Wen, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) through external knowledge retrieval. Despite its widespread attention, existing academic research predominantly focuses on single-turn RAG, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexities of multi-turn conversations found in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce CORAL, a large-scale benchmark designed to assess RAG systems in realistic multi-turn conversational settings. CORAL includes diverse information-seeking conversations automatically derived from Wikipedia and tackles key challenges such as open-domain coverage, knowledge intensity, free-form responses, and topic shifts. It supports three core tasks of conversational RAG: passage retrieval, response generation, and citation labeling. We propose a unified framework to standardize various conversational RAG methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these methods on CORAL, demonstrating substantial opportunities for improving existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Wu, Tsz Ting Chung, Kai Chen, Dit-Yan Yeung</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, in this paper we design a unified framework to measure object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to conduct hallucination evaluation on (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, and thus, could be easily generalized to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE and observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple yet effective training-free approach to mitigate hallucinations for LVLMs, with which, we exceed all open-sourced counterparts on Tri-HE, achieving comparable performance with the powerful GPT-4V. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichao Hou, Weizhi Gao, Yuchen Shen, Feiyi Wang, Xiaorui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have dominated various areas of machine learning in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a novel robust attention mechanism designed to enhance the resilience of transformer-based architectures. Crucially, this technique can be integrated into existing transformers as a plug-and-play layer, improving their robustness without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our ProTransformer significantly enhances the robustness of transformer models across a variety of prediction tasks, attack mechanisms, backbone architectures, and data domains. Notably, without further fine-tuning, the ProTransformer consistently improves the performance of vanilla transformers by 19.5%, 28.3%, 16.1%, and 11.4% for BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, respectively, under the classical TextFooler attack. Furthermore, ProTransformer shows promising resilience in large language models (LLMs) against prompting-based attacks, improving the performance of T5 and LLaMA by 24.8% and 17.8%, respectively, and enhancing Vicuna by an average of 10.4% against the Jailbreaking attack. Beyond the language domain, ProTransformer also demonstrates outstanding robustness in both vision and graph domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Liu, Argyris Oikonomou, Weiqiang Zheng, Yang Cai, Arman Cohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Many alignment methods, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on the Bradley-Terry reward assumption, which is insufficient to capture the full range of general human preferences. To achieve robust alignment with general preferences, we model the alignment problem as a two-player zero-sum game, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50% win rate against any competing policy. However, previous algorithms for finding the Nash policy either diverge or converge to a Nash policy in a modified game, even in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win rate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm, Convergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with general preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory. Theoretically, we prove that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash policy in the last iterate. Additionally, our meta-algorithm is simple and can be integrated with many existing methods designed for RLHF and preference optimization with minimal changes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework when combined with existing preference policy optimization methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce EMMA, an End-to-end Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. Built on a multi-modal large language model foundation, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. However, EMMA also exhibits certain limitations: it can process only a small amount of image frames, does not incorporate accurate 3D sensing modalities like LiDAR or radar and is computationally expensive. We hope that our results will inspire further research to mitigate these issues and to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing benchmarks often highlight the remarkable performance achieved by state-of-the-art Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) in leveraging temporal context for video understanding. However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human beings are endowed with a complementary learning system, which bridges the slow learning of general world dynamics with fast storage of episodic memory from a new experience. Previous video generation models, however, primarily focus on slow learning by pre-training on vast amounts of data, overlooking the fast learning phase crucial for episodic memory storage. This oversight leads to inconsistencies across temporally distant frames when generating longer videos, as these frames fall beyond the model's context window. To this end, we introduce SlowFast-VGen, a novel dual-speed learning system for action-driven long video generation. Our approach incorporates a masked conditional video diffusion model for the slow learning of world dynamics, alongside an inference-time fast learning strategy based on a temporal LoRA module. Specifically, the fast learning process updates its temporal LoRA parameters based on local inputs and outputs, thereby efficiently storing episodic memory in its parameters. We further propose a slow-fast learning loop algorithm that seamlessly integrates the inner fast learning loop into the outer slow learning loop, enabling the recall of prior multi-episode experiences for context-aware skill learning. To facilitate the slow learning of an approximate world model, we collect a large-scale dataset of 200k videos with language action annotations, covering a wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments show that SlowFast-VGen outperforms baselines across various metrics for action-driven video generation, achieving an FVD score of 514 compared to 782, and maintaining consistency in longer videos, with an average of 0.37 scene cuts versus 0.89. The slow-fast learning loop algorithm significantly enhances performances on long-horizon planning tasks as well. Project Website: https://slowfast-vgen.github.io</p>

<p>Abstract: Dense retrievers have made significant strides in text retrieval and open-domain question answering. However, most of these achievements have relied heavily on extensive human-annotated supervision. In this study, we aim to develop unsupervised methods for improving dense retrieval models. We propose two approaches that enable annotation-free and scalable training by creating pseudo querydocument pairs: query extraction and transferred query generation. The query extraction method involves selecting salient spans from the original document to generate pseudo queries. On the other hand, the transferred query generation method utilizes generation models trained for other NLP tasks, such as summarization, to produce pseudo queries. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that models trained using these augmentation methods can achieve comparable, if not better, performance than multiple strong dense baselines. Moreover, combining these strategies leads to further improvements, resulting in superior performance of unsupervised dense retrieval, unsupervised domain adaptation and supervised finetuning, benchmarked on both BEIR and ODQA datasets.

<p>Abstract: Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a challenging task in sentiment analysis, aiming to provide fine-grained insights into human sentiments. However, existing benchmarks are limited to two domains and do not evaluate model performance on unseen domains, raising concerns about the generalization of proposed methods. Furthermore, it remains unclear if large language models (LLMs) can effectively handle complex sentiment tasks like ASTE. In this work, we address the issue of generalization in ASTE from both a benchmarking and modeling perspective. We introduce a domain-expanded benchmark by annotating samples from diverse domains, enabling evaluation of models in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Additionally, we propose CASE, a simple and effective decoding strategy that enhances trustworthiness and performance of LLMs in ASTE. Through comprehensive experiments involving multiple tasks, settings, and models, we demonstrate that CASE can serve as a general decoding strategy for complex sentiment tasks. By expanding the scope of evaluation and providing a more reliable decoding strategy, we aim to inspire the research community to reevaluate the generalizability of benchmarks and models for ASTE.

<p>Abstract: In this study, we introduce adaptive KV cache compression, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs). Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language questions over large-scale knowledge bases (KBs), which can be summarized into two crucial steps: knowledge retrieval and semantic parsing.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce ChatKBQA, a novel and simple generate-then-retrieve KBQA framework, which proposes first generating the logical form with fine-tuned LLMs, then retrieving and replacing entities and relations with an unsupervised retrieval method, to improve both generation and retrieval more directly. Experimental results show that ChatKBQA achieves new state-of-the-art performance on standard KBQA datasets, WebQSP, and CWQ. This work can also be regarded as a new paradigm for combining LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) for interpretable and knowledge-required question answering. Our code is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a significant concern on the Internet. Detecting hateful memes requires the system to jointly understand the visual and textual modalities. Our investigation reveals that the embedding space of existing CLIP-based systems lacks sensitivity to subtle differences in memes that are vital for correct hatefulness classification. We propose constructing a hatefulness-aware embedding space through retrieval-guided contrastive training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HatefulMemes dataset with an AUROC of 87.0, outperforming much larger fine-tuned large multimodal models. We demonstrate a retrieval-based hateful memes detection system, which is capable of identifying hatefulness based on data unseen in training. This allows developers to update the hateful memes detection system by simply adding new examples without retraining, a desirable feature for real services in the constantly evolving landscape of hateful memes on the Internet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxin Li, Daniel Cheng, Phillip Keung, Jungo Kasai, Noah A. Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative retrieval (Wang et al., 2022; Tay et al., 2022) is a popular approach for end-to-end document retrieval that directly generates document identifiers given an input query. We introduce summarization-based document IDs, in which each document's ID is composed of an extractive summary or abstractive keyphrases generated by a language model, rather than an integer ID sequence or bags of n-grams as proposed in past work. We find that abstractive, content-based IDs (ACID) and an ID based on the first 30 tokens are very effective in direct comparisons with previous approaches to ID creation. We show that using ACID improves top-10 and top-20 recall by 15.6% and 14.4% (relative) respectively versus the cluster-based integer ID baseline on the MSMARCO 100k retrieval task, and 9.8% and 9.9% respectively on the Wikipedia-based NQ 100k retrieval task. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of human-readable, natural-language IDs created through summarization for generative retrieval. We also observed that extractive IDs outperformed abstractive IDs on Wikipedia articles in NQ but not the snippets in MSMARCO, which suggests that document characteristics affect generative retrieval performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce ChatQA, a suite of models that outperform GPT-4 on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and conversational question answering (QA). To enhance generation, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning method that significantly boosts the performance of RAG.

We also present the ChatRAG Bench, which encompasses ten datasets covering comprehensive evaluations on RAG, table-related QA, arithmetic calculations, and scenarios involving unanswerable questions. Our ChatQA-1.0-70B (score: 54.14), built on Llama2, a weaker foundation model than GPT-4, can slightly outperform GPT-4-0613 (score: 53.90) and GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 (score: 54.03) on the ChatRAG Bench, without relying on any synthetic data from OpenAI GPT models. Notably, the Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B model surpasses the accuracy of GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, achieving a 4.4% improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Shan Hee, Shivam Sharma, Rui Cao, Palash Nandi, Preslav Nakov, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Roy Ka-Wei Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In the evolving landscape of online communication, moderating hate speech (HS) presents an intricate challenge, compounded by the multimodal nature of digital content. This comprehensive survey delves into the recent strides in HS moderation, spotlighting the burgeoning role of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). Our exploration begins with a thorough analysis of current literature, revealing the nuanced interplay between textual, visual, and auditory elements in propagating HS. We uncover a notable trend towards integrating these modalities, primarily due to the complexity and subtlety with which HS is disseminated. A significant emphasis is placed on the advances facilitated by LLMs and LMMs, which have begun to redefine the boundaries of detection and moderation capabilities. We identify existing gaps in research, particularly in the context of underrepresented languages and cultures, and the need for solutions to handle low-resource settings. The survey concludes with a forward-looking perspective, outlining potential avenues for future research, including the exploration of novel AI methodologies, the ethical governance of AI in moderation, and the development of more nuanced, context-aware systems. This comprehensive overview aims to catalyze further research and foster a collaborative effort towards more sophisticated, responsible, and human-centric approaches to HS moderation in the digital era.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagi Shaier, Kevin Bennett, Lawrence E Hunter, Katharina von der Wense</p>
<p>Abstract: The differences between cloze-task language model (LM) probing with 1) expert-made templates and 2) naturally-occurring text have often been overlooked. Here, we evaluate 16 different LMs on 10 probing English datasets -- 4 template-based and 6 template-free -- in general and biomedical domains to answer the following research questions: (RQ1) Do model rankings differ between the two approaches? (RQ2) Do models' absolute scores differ between the two approaches? (RQ3) Do the answers to RQ1 and RQ2 differ between general and domain-specific models? Our findings are: 1) Template-free and template-based approaches often rank models differently, except for the top domain-specific models. 2) Scores decrease by up to 42% Acc@1 when comparing parallel template-free and template-based prompts. 3) Perplexity is negatively correlated with accuracy in the template-free approach, but, counter-intuitively, they are positively correlated for template-based probing. 4) Models tend to predict the same answers frequently across prompts for template-based probing, which is less common when employing template-free techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhong Zhou, Jiuyang Xiang, Haopeng Chen, Quan Liu, Zherui Li, Sen Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to generate illegal or unethical responses, particularly when subjected to "jailbreak." Research on jailbreak has highlighted the safety issues of LLMs. However, prior studies have predominantly focused on single-turn dialogue, ignoring the potential complexities and risks presented by multi-turn dialogue, a crucial mode through which humans derive information from LLMs. In this paper, we argue that humans could exploit multi-turn dialogue to induce LLMs into generating harmful information. LLMs may not intend to reject cautionary or borderline unsafe queries, even if each turn is closely served for one malicious purpose in a multi-turn dialogue. Therefore, by decomposing an unsafe query into several sub-queries for multi-turn dialogue, we induced LLMs to answer harmful sub-questions incrementally, culminating in an overall harmful response. Our experiments, conducted across a wide range of LLMs, indicate current inadequacies in the safety mechanisms of LLMs in multi-turn dialogue. Our findings expose vulnerabilities of LLMs in complex scenarios involving multi-turn dialogue, presenting new challenges for the safety of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jana Juro\v{s}, Laura Majer, Jan \v{S}najder</p>
<p>Abstract: News headlines often evoke sentiment by intentionally portraying entities in particular ways, making targeted sentiment analysis (TSA) of headlines a worthwhile but difficult task. Due to its subjectivity, creating TSA datasets can involve various annotation paradigms, from descriptive to prescriptive, either encouraging or limiting subjectivity. LLMs are a good fit for TSA due to their broad linguistic and world knowledge and in-context learning abilities, yet their performance depends on prompt design. In this paper, we compare the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned encoder models for TSA of news headlines using descriptive and prescriptive datasets across several languages. Exploring the descriptive--prescriptive continuum, we analyze how performance is affected by prompt prescriptiveness, ranging from plain zero-shot to elaborate few-shot prompts. Finally, we evaluate the ability of LLMs to quantify uncertainty via calibration error and comparison to human label variation. We find that LLMs outperform fine-tuned encoders on descriptive datasets, while calibration and F1-score generally improve with increased prescriptiveness, yet the optimal level varies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubin Kim, Chanwoo Park, Hyewon Jeong, Yik Siu Chan, Xuhai Xu, Daniel McDuff, Hyeonhoon Lee, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Cynthia Breazeal, Hae Won Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are becoming valuable tools in medicine. Yet despite their promise, the best way to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex medical tasks remains an open question. We introduce a novel multi-agent framework, named Medical Decision-making Agents (MDAgents) that helps address this gap by automatically assigning a collaboration structure to a team of LLMs. The assigned solo or group collaboration structure is tailored to the medical task at hand, emulating real-world medical decision-making processes adapted to tasks of varying complexities. We evaluate our framework and baseline methods using state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of real-world medical knowledge and medical diagnosis benchmarks, including a comparison of LLMs' medical complexity classification against human physicians. MDAgents achieved the best performance in seven out of ten benchmarks on tasks requiring an understanding of medical knowledge and multi-modal reasoning, showing a significant improvement of up to 4.2% (p < 0.05) compared to previous methods' best performances. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents effectively determines medical complexity to optimize for efficiency and accuracy across diverse medical tasks. Notably, the combination of moderator review and external medical knowledge in group collaboration resulted in an average accuracy improvement of 11.8%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yexiao He, Ziyao Wang, Zheyu Shen, Guoheng Sun, Yucong Dai, Yongkai Wu, Hongyi Wang, Ang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted for many downstream tasks and tailored to align with human preferences through fine-tuning. Recent studies have discovered that LLMs can achieve desirable performance with only a small amount of high-quality data, suggesting that a large amount of the data in these extensive datasets is redundant or even harmful. Identifying high-quality data from vast datasets to curate small yet effective datasets has emerged as a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce SHED, an automated dataset refinement framework based on Shapley value for instruction fine-tuning. SHED eliminates the need for human intervention or the use of commercial LLMs. Moreover, the datasets curated through SHED exhibit transferability, indicating they can be reused across different LLMs with consistently high performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the datasets curated by SHED. The results demonstrate SHED's superiority over state-of-the-art methods across various tasks and LLMs; notably, datasets comprising only 10% of the original data selected by SHED achieve performance comparable to or surpassing that of the full datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Wang, Pei Zhang, Baosong Yang, Derek F. Wong, Zhuosheng Zhang, Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world data deviating from the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption of in-distribution training data poses security threats to deep networks, thus advancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithms. Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaosen Zheng, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Jing Jiang, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Anil et al. (2024) show that many-shot (up to hundreds of) demonstrations can jailbreak state-of-the-art LLMs by exploiting their long-context capability. Nevertheless, is it possible to use few-shot demonstrations to efficiently jailbreak LLMs within limited context sizes? While the vanilla few-shot jailbreaking may be inefficient, we propose improved techniques such as injecting special system tokens like [/INST] and employing demo-level random search from a collected demo pool. These simple techniques result in surprisingly effective jailbreaking against aligned LLMs (even with advanced defenses). For examples, our method achieves >80% (mostly >95%) ASRs on Llama-2-7B and Llama-3-8B without multiple restarts, even if the models are enhanced by strong defenses such as perplexity detection and/or SmoothLLM, which is challenging for suffix-based jailbreaking. In addition, we conduct comprehensive and elaborate (e.g., making sure to use correct system prompts) evaluations against other aligned LLMs and advanced defenses, where our method consistently achieves nearly 100% ASRs.

<p>Abstract: Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) play a crucial role in health outcomes and are frequently documented in clinical text. Automatically extracting SBDH information from clinical text relies on publicly available good-quality datasets. However, existing SBDH datasets exhibit substantial limitations in their availability and coverage. In this study, we introduce Synth-SBDH, a novel synthetic dataset with detailed SBDH annotations, encompassing status, temporal information, and rationale across 15 SBDH categories. We showcase the utility of Synth-SBDH on three tasks using real-world clinical datasets from two distinct hospital settings, highlighting its versatility, generalizability, and distillation capabilities. Models trained on Synth-SBDH consistently outperform counterparts with no Synth-SBDH training, achieving up to 63.75% macro-F improvements. Additionally, Synth-SBDH proves effective for rare SBDH categories and under-resource constraints while being substantially cheaper than expert-annotated real-world data. Human evaluation reveals a 71.06% Human-LLM alignment and uncovers areas for future refinements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Cao, Deng Cai, Zhisong Zhang, Yuexian Zou, Wai Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is acutely sensitive to the phrasing of prompts, which raises significant concerns about their reliability in real-world scenarios. Existing studies often divide prompts into task-level instructions and case-level inputs and primarily focus on evaluating and improving robustness against variations in tasks-level instructions. However, this setup fails to fully address the diversity of real-world user queries and assumes the existence of task-specific datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce RobustAlpacaEval, a new benchmark that consists of semantically equivalent case-level queries and emphasizes the importance of using the worst prompt performance to gauge the lower bound of model performance. Extensive experiments on RobustAlpacaEval with ChatGPT and six open-source LLMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Gemma families uncover substantial variability in model performance; for instance, a difference of 45.48% between the worst and best performance for the Llama-2-70B-chat model, with its worst performance dipping as low as 9.38%. We further illustrate the difficulty in identifying the worst prompt from both model-agnostic and model-dependent perspectives, emphasizing the absence of a shortcut to characterize the worst prompt. We also attempt to enhance the worst prompt performance using existing prompt engineering and prompt consistency methods, but find that their impact is limited. These findings underscore the need to create more resilient LLMs that can maintain high performance across diverse prompts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoyeon Chang, Jinho Park, Seonghyeon Ye, Sohee Yang, Youngkyung Seo, Du-Seong Chang, Minjoon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent observation that large language models (LLMs) can store substantial factual knowledge, there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms of how they acquire factual knowledge through pretraining. This work addresses this gap by studying how LLMs acquire factual knowledge during pretraining. The findings reveal several important insights into the dynamics of factual knowledge acquisition during pretraining. First, counterintuitively, we observe that pretraining on more data shows no significant improvement in the model's capability to acquire and maintain factual knowledge. Next, there is a power-law relationship between training steps and forgetting of memorization and generalization of factual knowledge, and LLMs trained with duplicated training data exhibit faster forgetting. Third, training LLMs with larger batch sizes can enhance the models' robustness to forgetting. Overall, our observations suggest that factual knowledge acquisition in LLM pretraining occurs by progressively increasing the probability of factual knowledge presented in the pretraining data at each step. However, this increase is diluted by subsequent forgetting. Based on this interpretation, we demonstrate that we can provide plausible explanations for recently observed behaviors of LLMs, such as the poor performance of LLMs on long-tail knowledge and the benefits of deduplicating the pretraining corpus.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanxuan Liao, Yao Xu, Shizhu He, Yuanzhe Zhang, Yanchao Hao, Shengping Liu, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have acquired the ability to solve general tasks by utilizing instruction finetuning (IFT). However, IFT still relies heavily on instance training of extensive task data, which greatly limits the adaptability of LLMs to real-world scenarios where labeled task instances are scarce and broader task generalization becomes paramount. Contrary to LLMs, humans acquire skills and complete tasks not merely through repeated practice but also by understanding and following instructional guidelines. This paper is dedicated to simulating human learning to address the shortcomings of instance training, focusing on instruction learning to enhance cross-task generalization. Within this context, we introduce Task Adapters Generation from Instructions (TAGI), which automatically constructs the task-specific model in a parameter generation manner based on the given task instructions without retraining for unseen tasks. Specifically, we utilize knowledge distillation to enhance the consistency between TAGI developed through Learning with Instruction and task-specific models developed through Training with Instance, by aligning the labels, output logits, and adapter parameters between them. TAGI is endowed with cross-task generalization capabilities through a two-stage training process that includes hypernetwork pretraining and finetuning. We evaluate TAGI on the Super-Natural Instructions and P3 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that TAGI can match or even outperform traditional meta-trained models and other hypernetwork models, while significantly reducing computational requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingzhe Peng, Chenduo Hao, Xinting Hu, Jiawei Peng, Xin Geng, Xu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models continue to scale, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited emerging capabilities in In-Context Learning (ICL), enabling them to solve language tasks by prefixing a few in-context demonstrations (ICDs) as context. Inspired by these advancements, researchers have extended these techniques to develop Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, applying ICL usually faces two major challenges: 1) using more ICDs will largely increase the inference time and 2) the performance is sensitive to the selection of ICDs. These challenges are further exacerbated in LMMs due to the integration of multiple data types and the combinational complexity of multimodal ICDs. Recently, to address these challenges, some NLP studies introduce non-learnable In-Context Vectors (ICVs) which extract useful task information from ICDs into a single vector and then insert it into the LLM to help solve the corresponding task. However, although useful in simple NLP tasks, these non-learnable methods fail to handle complex multimodal tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). In this study, we propose \underline{\textbf{L}}earnable \underline{\textbf{I}}n-Context \underline{\textbf{Ve}}ctor (LIVE) to distill essential task information from demonstrations, improving ICL performance in LMMs. Experiments show that LIVE can significantly reduce computational costs while enhancing accuracy in VQA tasks compared to traditional ICL and other non-learnable ICV methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Yao, Yufan Zhuang, Zihao Sun, Sunan Xu, Animesh Kumar, Jingbo Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: The opacity in developing large language models (LLMs) is raising growing concerns about the potential contamination of public benchmarks in the pre-training data. Existing contamination detection methods are typically based on the text overlap between training and evaluation data, which can be too superficial to reflect deeper forms of contamination. In this paper, we first present a cross-lingual form of contamination that inflates LLMs' performance while evading current detection methods, deliberately injected by overfitting LLMs on the translated versions of benchmark test sets. Then, we propose generalization-based approaches to unmask such deeply concealed contamination. Specifically, we examine the LLM's performance change after modifying the original benchmark by replacing the false answer choices with correct ones from other questions. Contaminated models can hardly generalize to such easier situations, where the false choices can be \emph{not even wrong}, as all choices are correct in their memorization. Experimental results demonstrate that cross-lingual contamination can easily fool existing detection methods, but not ours. In addition, we discuss the potential utilization of cross-lingual contamination in interpreting LLMs' working mechanisms and in post-training LLMs for enhanced multilingual capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuda Ye, Shuangyin Li, Yongqi Zhang, Lei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has been applied in many scenarios to augment large language models (LLMs) with external documents provided by retrievers. However, a semantic gap exists between LLMs and retrievers due to differences in their training objectives and architectures. This misalignment forces LLMs to passively accept the documents provided by the retrievers, leading to incomprehension in the generation process, where the LLMs are burdened with the task of distinguishing these documents using their inherent knowledge. This paper proposes R$^2$AG, a novel enhanced RAG framework to fill this gap by incorporating Retrieval information into Retrieval Augmented Generation. Specifically, R$^2$AG utilizes the nuanced features from the retrievers and employs a R$^2$-Former to capture retrieval information. Then, a retrieval-aware prompting strategy is designed to integrate retrieval information into LLMs' generation. Notably, R$^2$AG suits low-source scenarios where LLMs and retrievers are frozen. Extensive experiments across five datasets validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of R$^2$AG. Our analysis reveals that retrieval information serves as an anchor to aid LLMs in the generation process, thereby filling the semantic gap.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing capability in problem-solving and decision-making, largely based on the step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning processes. However, evaluating these reasoning abilities has become increasingly challenging. Existing outcome-based benchmarks are beginning to saturate, becoming less effective in tracking meaningful progress. To address this, we present a process-based benchmark MR-Ben that demands a meta-reasoning skill, where LMs are asked to locate and analyse potential errors in automatically generated reasoning steps. Our meta-reasoning paradigm is especially suited for system-2 slow thinking, mirroring the human cognitive process of carefully examining assumptions, conditions, calculations, and logic to identify mistakes. MR-Ben comprises 5,975 questions curated by human experts across a wide range of subjects, including physics, chemistry, logic, coding, and more. Through our designed metrics for assessing meta-reasoning on this benchmark, we identify interesting limitations and weaknesses of current LLMs (open-source and closed-source models). For example, with models like the o1 series from OpenAI demonstrating strong performance by effectively scrutinizing the solution space, many other state-of-the-art models fall significantly behind on MR-Ben, exposing potential shortcomings in their training strategies and inference methodologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Teaching to improve student models (e.g., knowledge distillation) is an extensively studied methodology in LLMs. However, for humans, teaching improves not only students but also teachers, by fostering more rigorous and clear reasoning as well as knowledge building. We ask: Can LLMs also learn by teaching (LbT) for better reasoning? If the answer is yes, we can potentially unlock the possibility of continuously advancing the models without solely relying on human-produced data or stronger models. In this paper, we provide a preliminary exploration on this question. We show that LbT ideas can be incorporated into existing LLM training/prompting pipelines and bring improvements. Specifically, we design three methods, each mimicking one of the three levels of LbT: observing students' feedback, learning from the feedback, and learning iteratively, with the goals of improving answer accuracy without training or improving models' inherent capability with fine-tuning. We reveal some findings: (1) Teaching materials that make it easier for students to learn have clearer and more accurate logic when using in-context learning as the student's "learning" method; (2) Weak-to-strong generalization: LbT might help improve strong models by teaching weak models; (3) Diversity in students might help: teaching multiple students could be better than teaching one student or the teacher itself. We hope that our exploration can inspire future research on LbT and more broadly adopting the advanced techniques in education to improve LLMs. The code and website are at https://github.com/imagination-research/lbt and https://sites.google.com/view/llm-learning-by-teaching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atula Tejaswi, Nilesh Gupta, Eunsol Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), their performance on a vast majority of languages remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we study building language-specific LLMs by adapting monolingual and multilingual LLMs. We conduct systematic experiments on how design choices (base model selection, vocabulary extension, and continued pretraining) impact the adapted LLM, both in terms of efficiency (how many tokens are needed to encode the same amount of information) and end task performance. We find that (1) the initial performance of LLM does not always correlate with the final performance after the adaptation. Adapting an English-centric models can yield better results than adapting multilingual models despite their worse initial performance on low-resource languages. (2) Efficiency can easily improved with simple vocabulary extension and continued pretraining in most LLMs we study, and (3) The optimal adaptation method (choice of the base model, new vocabulary size, training data, initialization strategy) is highly language-dependent, and the simplest embedding initialization works well across various experimental settings. Together, our work lays foundations on efficiently building language-specific LLMs by adapting existing LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a critical component of machine learning (ML) applications. The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has stimulated researchers to seek efficient and effective approaches to UQ for text generation. As with other ML models, LLMs are prone to making incorrect predictions, in the form of ``hallucinations'' whereby claims are fabricated or low-quality outputs are generated for a given input. UQ is a key element in dealing with these challenges. However, research to date on UQ methods for LLMs has been fragmented, in terms of the literature on UQ techniques and evaluation methods. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing a novel benchmark that implements a collection of state-of-the-art UQ baselines, and provides an environment for controllable and consistent evaluation of novel UQ techniques over various text generation tasks. Our benchmark also supports the assessment of confidence normalization methods in terms of their ability to provide interpretable scores. Using our benchmark, we conduct a large-scale empirical investigation of UQ and normalization techniques across nine tasks, and identify the most promising approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeffrey Willette, Heejun Lee, Youngwan Lee, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Vykopal, Simon Ostermann, Mari\'an \v{S}imko</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-lingual knowledge transfer, especially between high- and low-resource languages, remains challenging in natural language processing (NLP). This study offers insights for improving cross-lingual NLP applications through the combination of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. We systematically explore strategies for enhancing cross-lingual transfer through the incorporation of language-specific and task-specific adapters and soft prompts. We present a detailed investigation of various combinations of these methods, exploring their efficiency across 16 languages, focusing on 10 mid- and low-resource languages. We further present to our knowledge the first use of soft prompts for language transfer, a technique we call soft language prompts. Our findings demonstrate that in contrast to claims of previous work, a combination of language and task adapters does not always work best; instead, combining a soft language prompt with a task adapter outperforms most configurations in many cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: The computational challenges of Large Language Model (LLM) inference remain a significant barrier to their widespread deployment, especially as prompt lengths continue to increase. Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, it takes 30 minutes for an 8B LLM to process a prompt of 1M tokens (i.e., the pre-filling stage) on a single A100 GPU. Existing methods for speeding up prefilling often fail to maintain acceptable accuracy or efficiency when applied to long-context LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce MInference (Milliontokens Inference), a sparse calculation method designed to accelerate pre-filling of long-sequence processing. Specifically, we identify three unique patterns in long-context attention matrices-the A-shape, Vertical-Slash, and Block-Sparsethat can be leveraged for efficient sparse computation on GPUs. We determine the optimal pattern for each attention head offline and dynamically build sparse indices based on the assigned pattern during inference. With the pattern and sparse indices, we perform efficient sparse attention calculations via our optimized GPU kernels to significantly reduce the latency in the pre-filling stage of long-context LLMs. Our proposed technique can be directly applied to existing LLMs without any modifications to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. By evaluating on a wide range of downstream tasks, including InfiniteBench, RULER, PG-19, and Needle In A Haystack, and models including LLaMA-3-1M, GLM4-1M, Yi-200K, Phi-3-128K, and Qwen2-128K, we demonstrate that MInference effectively reduces inference latency by up to 10x for pre-filling on an A100, while maintaining accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hojjat Mokhtarabadi, Ziba Zamani, Abbas Maazallahi, Mohammad Hossein Manshaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in following human instructions across various domains. However, their proficiency remains notably deficient in many low-resource languages. To address this challenge, we begin by introducing FarsInstruct a comprehensive instruction dataset designed to enhance the instruction following ability of large language models specifically for the Persian language a significant yet underrepresented language globally. FarsInstruct encompasses a wide range of task types and datasets, each containing a mix of straightforward to complex manual written instructions, as well as translations from the Public Pool of Prompts, ensuring a rich linguistic and cultural representation. Furthermore, we introduce Co-CoLA, a framework designed to enhance the multi-task adaptability of LoRA-tuned models. Through extensive experimental analyses, our study showcases the effectiveness of the FarsInstruct dataset coupled with training by the Co-CoLA framework, in improving the performance of large language models within the Persian context. As of the current writing, FarsInstruct comprises 197 templates across 21 distinct datasets, and we intend to update it consistently, thus augmenting its applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Belotti, Fabio Dadda, Marco Cremaschi, Roberto Avogadro, Matteo Palmonari</p>
<p>Abstract: Tables are crucial containers of information, but understanding their meaning may be challenging. Over the years, there has been a surge in interest in data-driven approaches based on deep learning that have increasingly been combined with heuristic-based ones. In the last period, the advent of \acf{llms} has led to a new category of approaches for table annotation. However, these approaches have not been consistently evaluated on a common ground, making evaluation and comparison difficult. This work proposes an extensive evaluation of four STI SOTA approaches: Alligator (formerly s-elbat), Dagobah, TURL, and TableLlama; the first two belong to the family of heuristic-based algorithms, while the others are respectively encoder-only and decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs). We also include in the evaluation both GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, since they excel in various public benchmarks. The primary objective is to measure the ability of these approaches to solve the entity disambiguation task with respect to both the performance achieved on a common-ground evaluation setting and the computational and cost requirements involved, with the ultimate aim of charting new research paths in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Wang, Zhengze Zhang, Rui Zhao, Fei Tan, Cam Tu Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning LLMs with human preferences become increasingly important. Although Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective, it is complicated and highly resource-intensive. As such, offline RLHF has been introduced as an alternative solution, which directly optimizes LLMs with ranking losses on a fixed preference dataset. Current offline RLHF only captures the "ordinal relationship" between responses, overlooking the crucial aspect of how much one is preferred over the others. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution called Reward Difference Optimization, shorted as RDO. Specifically, we introduce reward difference coefficients to reweigh sample pairs in offline RLHF. We then develop a difference model which captures rich interactions between a pair of responses for predicting these difference coefficients. Experiments with 7B LLMs on the HH and TL;DR datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our method in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, thereby highlighting its potential for aligning LLMs with human intent and values</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Kurz, Jian-Jia Chen, Lucie Flek, Zhixue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pruning have shown state-of-the-art (SotA) compression results in post-training and retraining-free settings while maintaining high predictive performance. However, previous research mainly considered calibrating based on English text, despite the multilingual nature of modern LLMs and their frequent use in non-English languages. In this paper, we set out to investigate calibrating the pruning of multilingual language models for monolingual applications. We present the first comprehensive empirical study, comparing different calibration languages for pruning multilingual models across diverse languages, tasks, models, and SotA pruning techniques. Our results offer practical suggestions, for example, calibrating in the target language can efficiently retain the language modeling capability but does not necessarily benefit downstream tasks. Through further analysis of latent subspaces, pruning masks, and individual neurons within pruned models, we find that while pruning generally preserves strong language-specific features, it may fail to retain language-specific neuron activation patterns and subtle, language-agnostic features associated with knowledge and reasoning that are needed for complex tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in incorporating Indic languages within multilingual models. However, it is crucial to quantitatively assess whether these languages perform comparably to globally dominant ones, such as English. Currently, there is a lack of benchmark datasets specifically designed to evaluate the regional knowledge of LLMs in various Indic languages. In this paper, we present the L3Cube-IndicQuest, a gold-standard factual question-answering benchmark dataset designed to evaluate how well multilingual LLMs capture regional knowledge across various Indic languages. The dataset contains 200 question-answer pairs, each for English and 19 Indic languages, covering five domains specific to the Indic region. We aim for this dataset to serve as a benchmark, providing ground truth for evaluating the performance of LLMs in understanding and representing knowledge relevant to the Indian context. The IndicQuest can be used for both reference-based evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. The dataset is shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Sholehrasa, Sanaz Saki Norouzi, Pascal Hitzler, Majid Jaberi-Douraki</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating structured knowledge from tabular formats poses significant challenges within natural language processing (NLP), mainly when dealing with complex, semi-structured tables like those found in the FeTaQA dataset. These tables require advanced methods to interpret and generate meaningful responses accurately. Traditional approaches, such as SQL and SPARQL, often fail to fully capture the semantics of such data, especially in the presence of irregular table structures like web tables. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel approach that extracts triples straightforward from tabular data and integrates it with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model to enhance the accuracy, coherence, and contextual richness of responses generated by a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 model. Our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines on the FeTaQA dataset, particularly excelling in Sacre-BLEU and ROUGE metrics. It effectively generates contextually accurate and detailed long-form answers from tables, showcasing its strength in complex data interpretation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rocketing prosperity of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has boosted the prevalence of vision-language models (VLMs) in the medical sector. In our online medical consultation scenario, a doctor responds to the texts and images provided by a patient in multiple rounds to diagnose her/his health condition, forming a multi-turn multimodal medical dialogue format. Unlike high-quality images captured by professional equipment in traditional medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), the images in our case are taken by patients' mobile phones. These images have poor quality control, with issues such as excessive background elements and the lesion area being significantly off-center, leading to degradation of vision-language alignment in the model training phase. In this paper, we propose ZALM3, a Zero-shot strategy to improve vision-language ALignment in Multi-turn Multimodal Medical dialogue. Since we observe that the preceding text conversations before an image can infer the regions of interest (RoIs) in the image, ZALM3 employs an LLM to summarize the keywords from the preceding context and a visual grounding model to extract the RoIs. The updated images eliminate unnecessary background noise and provide more effective vision-language alignment. To better evaluate our proposed method, we design a new subjective assessment metric for multi-turn unimodal/multimodal medical dialogue to provide a fine-grained performance comparison. Our experiments across three different clinical departments remarkably demonstrate the efficacy of ZALM3 with statistical significance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yung-Chieh Chan, George Pu, Apaar Shanker, Parth Suresh, Penn Jenks, John Heyer, Sam Denton</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are applied to more use cases, creating high quality, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning becomes a bottleneck for model improvement. Using high quality human data has been the most common approach to unlock model performance, but is prohibitively expensive in many scenarios. Several alternative methods have also emerged, such as generating synthetic or hybrid data, but the effectiveness of these approaches remain unclear, especially in resource-constrained scenarios and tasks that are not easily verified. To investigate this, we group various synthetic data generation strategies into three representative categories -- Answer Augmentation, Question Rephrase and New Question -- and study the performance of student LLMs trained under various constraints, namely seed instruction set size and query budget. We demonstrate that these strategies are not equally effective across settings. Notably, the optimal data generation strategy depends strongly on the ratio between the available teacher query budget and the size of the seed instruction set. When this ratio is low, generating new answers to existing questions proves most effective, but as this ratio increases, generating new questions becomes optimal. Across all tasks, we find that choice of augmentation method and other design choices matter substantially more in low to mid data regimes than in high data regimes. We provide a practical framework for selecting the appropriate augmentation method across settings, taking into account additional factors such as the scalability of each method, the importance of verifying synthetic data, and the use of different LLMs for synthetic data generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in natural language processing tasks and demonstrate considerable potential in the legal domain. However, legal applications demand high standards of accuracy, reliability, and fairness. Applying existing LLMs to legal systems without careful evaluation of their potential and limitations could pose significant risks in legal practice. To this end, we introduce a standardized comprehensive Chinese legal benchmark LexEval. This benchmark is notable in the following three aspects: (1) Ability Modeling: We propose a new taxonomy of legal cognitive abilities to organize different tasks. (2) Scale: To our knowledge, LexEval is currently the largest Chinese legal evaluation dataset, comprising 23 tasks and 14,150 questions. (3) Data: we utilize formatted existing datasets, exam datasets and newly annotated datasets by legal experts to comprehensively evaluate the various capabilities of LLMs. LexEval not only focuses on the ability of LLMs to apply fundamental legal knowledge but also dedicates efforts to examining the ethical issues involved in their application. We evaluated 38 open-source and commercial LLMs and obtained some interesting findings. The experiments and findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential solutions for developing Chinese legal systems and LLM evaluation pipelines. The LexEval dataset and leaderboard are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/CSHaitao/LexEval} and will be continuously updated.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in Spoken Language Modeling has shown that learning language directly from speech is feasible. Generating speech through a pipeline that operates at the text level typically loses nuances, intonations, and non-verbal vocalizations. Modeling directly from speech opens up the path to more natural and expressive systems. On the other hand, speech-only systems require up to three orders of magnitude more data to catch up to their text-based counterparts in terms of their semantic abilities. We show that fine-tuning speech representation models on phoneme classification leads to more context-invariant representations, and language models trained on these units achieve comparable lexical comprehension to ones trained on hundred times more data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability to handle a wide range of tasks, have driven significant advancements in tackling reasoning and planning tasks, wherein decomposing complex problems into executable workflows is a crucial step in this process. Existing workflow evaluation frameworks either focus solely on holistic performance or suffer from limitations such as restricted scenario coverage, simplistic workflow structures, and lax evaluation standards. To this end, we introduce WorFBench, a unified workflow generation benchmark with multi-faceted scenarios and intricate graph workflow structures. Additionally, we present WorFEval, a systemic evaluation protocol utilizing subsequence and subgraph matching algorithms to accurately quantify the LLM agent's workflow generation capabilities. Through comprehensive evaluations across different types of LLMs, we discover distinct gaps between the sequence planning capabilities and graph planning capabilities of LLM agents, with even GPT-4 exhibiting a gap of around 15%. We also train two open-source models and evaluate their generalization abilities on held-out tasks. Furthermore, we observe that the generated workflows can enhance downstream tasks, enabling them to achieve superior performance with less time during inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Dong, Shaowei Wang, Dayi Lin, Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur, Boquan Zhou, Shichao Liu, Ahmed E. Hassan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models excel in tasks like natural language understanding and text generation. Prompt engineering plays a critical role in leveraging LLM effectively. However, LLMs black-box nature hinders its interpretability and effective prompting engineering. A wide range of model explanation approaches have been developed for deep learning models, However, these local explanations are designed for single-output tasks like classification and regression,and cannot be directly applied to LLMs, which generate sequences of tokens. Recent efforts in LLM explanation focus on natural language explanations, but they are prone to hallucinations and inaccuracies. To address this, we introduce PromptExp , a framework for multi-granularity prompt explanations by aggregating token-level insights. PromptExp introduces two token-level explanation approaches: 1. an aggregation-based approach combining local explanation techniques, and 2. a perturbation-based approach with novel techniques to evaluate token masking impact. PromptExp supports both white-box and black-box explanations and extends explanations to higher granularity levels, enabling flexible analysis. We evaluate PromptExp in case studies such as sentiment analysis, showing the perturbation-based approach performs best using semantic similarity to assess perturbation impact. Furthermore, we conducted a user study to confirm PromptExp's accuracy and practical value, and demonstrate its potential to enhance LLM interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Jiang, Jia Li, He Zong, Huanyu Liu, Hao Zhu, Shukai Hu, Erlu Li, Jiazheng Ding, Yu Han, Wei Ning, Gen Wang, Yihong Dong, Kechi Zhang, Ge Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used in code completion, and researchers are focusing on scaling up LLMs to improve their accuracy. However, larger LLMs will increase the response time of code completion and decrease the developers' productivity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and effective LLM for code completion named aiXcoder-7B. Compared to existing LLMs, aiXcoder-7B achieves higher code completion accuracy while having smaller scales (i.e., 7 billion parameters). We attribute the superiority of aiXcoder-7B to three key factors: (1) Multi-objective training. We employ three training objectives, one of which is our proposed Structured Fill-In-the-Middle (SFIM). SFIM considers the syntax structures in code and effectively improves the performance of LLMs for code. (2) Diverse data sampling strategies. They consider inter-file relationships and enhance the capability of LLMs in understanding cross-file contexts. (3) Extensive high-quality data. We establish a rigorous data collection pipeline and consume a total of 1.2 trillion unique tokens for training aiXcoder-7B. This vast volume of data enables aiXcoder-7B to learn a broad distribution of code. We evaluate aiXcoder-7B in five popular code completion benchmarks and a new benchmark collected by this paper. The results show that aiXcoder-7B outperforms the latest six LLMs with similar sizes and even surpasses four larger LLMs (e.g., StarCoder2-15B and CodeLlama-34B), positioning aiXcoder-7B as a lightweight and effective LLM for academia and industry. Finally, we summarize three valuable insights for helping practitioners train the next generations of LLMs for code. aiXcoder-7B has been open-souced and gained significant attention. As of the submission date, aiXcoder-7B has received 2,193 GitHub Stars.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Qiu, Yifu Lu, Yifan Zeng, Jiacheng Guo, Jiayi Geng, Huazheng Wang, Kaixuan Huang, Yue Wu, Mengdi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference-time alignment enhances the performance of large language models without requiring additional training or fine-tuning but presents challenges due to balancing computational efficiency with high-quality output. Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, as a simple yet powerful approach, generates multiple responses and selects the best one, achieving improved performance but with a high computational cost. We propose TreeBoN, a novel framework that integrates a speculative tree-search strategy into Best-of-N (BoN) Sampling. TreeBoN maintains a set of parent nodes, iteratively branching and pruning low-quality responses, thereby reducing computational overhead while maintaining high output quality. Our approach also leverages token-level rewards from Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to guide tree expansion and prune low-quality paths. We evaluate TreeBoN using AlpacaFarm, HH-RLHF, UltraFeedback, GSM8K, and TutorEval datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements. Specifically, TreeBoN achieves the highest win rate of 65% on TutorEval and around 60% win rates across other different datasets, outperforming standard BoN with the same computational cost and showcasing its scalability and alignment efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baixiang Huang, Canyu Chen, Xiongxiao Xu, Ali Payani, Kai Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, referring to the non-factual information in generated content, despite their superior capacities across tasks. Meanwhile, knowledge editing has been developed as a new popular paradigm to correct the erroneous factual knowledge encoded in LLMs with the advantage of avoiding retraining from scratch. However, one common issue of existing evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensure LLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions before editing. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited by different techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assess the effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficiently validated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs? We proposed HalluEditBench to holistically benchmark knowledge editing methods in correcting real-world hallucinations. First, we rigorously construct a massive hallucination dataset with 9 domains, 26 topics and more than 6,000 hallucinations. Then, we assess the performance of knowledge editing methods in a holistic way on five dimensions including Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness. Through HalluEditBench, we have provided new insights into the potentials and limitations of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations, which could inspire future improvements and facilitate the progress in the field of knowledge editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxian Gu, Hao Zhou, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is widely used to train small, high-performing student language models (LMs) using large teacher LMs. While effective in fine-tuning, KD during pre-training faces challenges in efficiency, flexibility, and effectiveness. Existing methods either incur high computational costs due to online teacher inference, require tokenization matching between teacher and student LMs, or risk losing the difficulty and diversity of the teacher-generated training data. To address these issues, we propose MiniPLM, a KD framework for pre-training LMs by refining the training data distribution with the teacher's knowledge. For efficiency, MiniPLM performs offline teacher LM inference, allowing KD for multiple student LMs without adding training-time costs. For flexibility, MiniPLM operates solely on the training corpus, enabling KD across model families. For effectiveness, MiniPLM leverages the differences between large and small LMs to enhance the difficulty and diversity of the training data, helping student LMs acquire versatile and sophisticated knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiniPLM boosts the student LMs' performance on 9 widely used downstream tasks, improves the language modeling capabilities, and reduces pre-training computation. The benefit of MiniPLM extends to large pre-training scales, evidenced by the extrapolation of the scaling curves. Further analysis reveals that MiniPLM supports KD across model families and enhances the utilization of pre-training data.

However, real-world tasks often involve complex, multi-step instructions that remain challenging for current NLP systems.

Through a systematic review of the literature, we analyze available resources, representation schemes, and downstream tasks related to instructional text.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jort Vincenti, Karim Abdel Sadek, Joan Velja, Matteo Nulli, Metod Jazbec</p>
<p>Abstract: Increasing the size of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to lead to better performance. However, this comes at the cost of slower and more expensive inference. Early-exiting is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of LLM inference by enabling next token prediction at intermediate layers. Yet, the large vocabulary size in modern LLMs makes the confidence estimation required for exit decisions computationally expensive, diminishing the efficiency gains. To address this, we propose dynamically pruning the vocabulary at test time for each token. Specifically, the vocabulary is pruned at one of the initial layers, and the smaller vocabulary is then used throughout the rest of the forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that such post-hoc dynamic vocabulary pruning improves the efficiency of confidence estimation in early-exit LLMs while maintaining competitive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ishneet Sukhvinder Singh, Ritvik Aggarwal, Ibrahim Allahverdiyev, Muhammad Taha, Aslihan Akalin, Kevin Zhu, Sean O'Brien</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses due to the retrieval of irrelevant or loosely related information. Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.</p>

In this article, I will try not to be biased as a linguist, studying the phenomenon from an independent scientific perspective. The article walks the researcher/reader through the scientific theorems and rationales involved in AI which belong from GL, specifically the Chomsky School. It, thus, provides good evidence from syntax, semantics, language faculty, Universal Grammar, computational system of human language, language acquisition, human brain, programming languages (e.g. Python), Large Language Models, and unbiased AI scientists that this contribution is huge, and that this contribution cannot be denied. It concludes that however the huge GL contribution to AI, there are still points of divergence including the nature and type of language input.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs have emerged as a promising tool for assisting individuals in diverse text-generation tasks, including job-related texts. However, LLM-generated answers have been increasingly found to exhibit gender bias. This study evaluates three LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude) to conduct a multifaceted audit of LLM-generated interview responses across models, question types, and jobs, and their alignment with two gender stereotypes. Our findings reveal that gender bias is consistent, and closely aligned with gender stereotypes and the dominance of jobs. Overall, this study contributes to the systematic examination of gender bias in LLM-generated interview responses, highlighting the need for a mindful approach to mitigate such biases in related applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence, but concerns arise regarding their reliability beyond English. This study addresses the gap in cross-lingual semantic evaluation by introducing a novel benchmark for cross-lingual sense disambiguation, StingrayBench. In this paper, we demonstrate using false friends -- words that are orthographically similar but have completely different meanings in two languages -- as a possible approach to pinpoint the limitation of cross-lingual sense disambiguation in LLMs. We collect false friends in four language pairs, namely Indonesian-Malay, Indonesian-Tagalog, Chinese-Japanese, and English-German; and challenge LLMs to distinguish the use of them in context. In our analysis of various models, we observe they tend to be biased toward higher-resource languages. We also propose new metrics for quantifying the cross-lingual sense bias and comprehension based on our benchmark. Our work contributes to developing more diverse and inclusive language modeling, promoting fairer access for the wider multilingual community.</p>

<p>Abstract: The attention score matrix ${\rm SoftMax}(XY^T)$ encodes relational similarity patterns between objects and is extremely popular in machine learning. However, the complexity required to calculate it runs quadratically with the problem size, making it a computationally heavy solution. In this article, we propose a linear-time approximation of the attention score normalization constants for embedding vectors with bounded norms. We show on several pre-trained embeddings that the accuracy of our estimation formula surpasses competing kernel methods by even orders of magnitude. From this result, we design a linear-time and task-agnostic embedding algorithm based on the optimization of the attention scores. The proposed algorithm is highly interpretable and easily adapted to an arbitrary embedding problem. We consider a few use-cases and observe similar or higher performances and a lower computational time with respect to comparable embedding algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Liu, Guanchu Wang, Shaochen Zhong, Zhaozhuo Xu, Daochen Zha, Ruixiang Tang, Zhimeng Jiang, Kaixiong Zhou, Vipin Chaudhary, Shuai Xu, Xia Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth in model size, fine-tuning the large pre-trained language model has become increasingly difficult due to its extensive memory usage. Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of trainable parameters in the network. While the model parameters do contribute to memory usage, the primary memory bottleneck during training arises from storing feature maps, also known as activations, as they are crucial for gradient calculation. Notably, neural networks are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent. We argue that in stochastic optimization, models can handle noisy gradients as long as the gradient estimator is unbiased with reasonable variance. Following this motivation, we propose a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient. Our work provides both theoretical and experimental evidence that, in the context of tuning transformers, our proposed estimators exhibit lower variance compared to existing ones. By replacing the linear operation with our approximated one in transformers, we can achieve up to 2.7$\times$ peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to $6.4\times$ larger batch size. Under the same hardware, WTA-CRS enables better down-streaming task performance by applying larger models and/or faster training speed with larger batch sizes.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the parameter size of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand, there is an urgent need to address the scarcity of high-quality data. In response, existing research has attempted to make a breakthrough by incorporating Federated Learning (FL) into LLMs. Conversely, considering the outstanding performance of LLMs in task generalization, researchers have also tried applying LLMs within FL to tackle challenges in relevant domains. The complementarity between LLMs and FL has already ignited widespread research interest. In this paper, we aim to deeply explore the integration of LLMs and FL. We propose a research framework, dividing the fusion of LLMs and FL into three parts: the combination of LLM sub-technologies with FL, the integration of FL sub-technologies with LLMs, and the overall merger of LLMs and FL. We first provide a comprehensive review of the current state of research in the domain of LLMs combined with FL, including their typical applications, integration advantages, challenges faced, and future directions for resolution. Subsequently, we discuss the practical applications of the combination of LLMs and FL in critical scenarios such as healthcare, finance, and education, and provide new perspectives and insights into future research directions for LLMs and FL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Beyond traditional binary relational facts, n-ary relational knowledge graphs (NKGs) are comprised of n-ary relational facts containing more than two entities, which are closer to real-world facts with broader applications. However, the construction of NKGs remains at a coarse-grained level, which is always in a single schema, ignoring the order and variable arity of entities. To address these restrictions, we propose Text2NKG, a novel fine-grained n-ary relation extraction framework for n-ary relational knowledge graph construction. We introduce a span-tuple classification approach with hetero-ordered merging and output merging to accomplish fine-grained n-ary relation extraction in different arity. Furthermore, Text2NKG supports four typical NKG schemas: hyper-relational schema, event-based schema, role-based schema, and hypergraph-based schema, with high flexibility and practicality. The experimental results demonstrate that Text2NKG achieves state-of-the-art performance in F1 scores on the fine-grained n-ary relation extraction benchmark.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping consumer decision-making, particularly in communication with firms, yet our understanding of their impact remains limited. This research explores the effect of LLMs on consumer complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from 2015 to 2024, documenting the adoption of LLMs for drafting complaints and evaluating the likelihood of obtaining relief from financial firms. Utilizing a leading AI detection tool, we analyzed over 1 million complaints and identified a significant increase in LLM usage following the release of ChatGPT. We establish a causal relationship between LLM usage and an increased likelihood of obtaining relief by employing instrumental variables to address endogeneity in LLM adoption. Experimental data further support this link, demonstrating that LLMs enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of consumer narratives. Our findings suggest that facilitating access to LLMs can help firms better understand consumer concerns and level the playing field among consumers. This underscores the importance of policies promoting technological accessibility, enabling all consumers to effectively voice their concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huayu Chen, Guande He, Lifan Yuan, Ganqu Cui, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: User intentions are typically formalized as evaluation rewards to be maximized when fine-tuning language models (LMs). Existing alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are mainly tailored for pairwise preference data where rewards are implicitly defined rather than explicitly given. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for LM alignment, leveraging Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) to bridge the gap in handling reward datasets explicitly annotated with scalar evaluations. Our framework comprises two parallel algorithms, NCA and InfoNCA, both enabling the direct extraction of an LM policy from reward data as well as preference data. Notably, we show that the DPO loss is a special case of our proposed InfoNCA objective under pairwise preference settings, thereby integrating and extending current alignment theories. By comparing NCA and InfoNCA, we demonstrate that the well-observed decreasing-likelihood trend of DPO/InfoNCA is caused by their focus on adjusting relative likelihood across different responses. In contrast, NCA optimizes the absolute likelihood for each response, thereby effectively preventing the chosen likelihood from decreasing. We evaluate our methods in both reward and preference settings with Mistral-8*7B and 7B models. Experiments suggest that InfoNCA/NCA surpasses various preference baselines when reward datasets are available. We also find NCA significantly outperforms DPO in complex reasoning tasks like math and coding.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values via preference learning (PL), focusing on incomplete and corrupted data in preference datasets. We propose a novel method for robustly and completely recalibrating values within these datasets to enhance LLMs' resilience against the issues. In particular, we devise a guaranteed polynomial time ranking algorithm that robustifies several existing models, such as the classic Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) (Bradley and Terry, 1952) model and certain generalizations of it. To the best of our knowledge, our present work is the first to propose an algorithm that provably recovers an $\epsilon$-optimal ranking with high probability while allowing as large as $O(n)$ perturbed pairwise comparison results per model response. Furthermore, we show robust recovery results in the partially observed setting. Our experiments confirm that our algorithms handle adversarial noise and unobserved comparisons well in both general and LLM preference dataset settings. This work contributes to the development and scaling of more reliable and ethically aligned AI models by equipping the dataset curation pipeline with the ability to handle missing and maliciously manipulated inputs.</p>

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature in LLM-enhanced RL and summarize its characteristics compared to conventional RL methods, aiming to clarify the research scope and directions for future studies. Utilizing the classical agent-environment interaction paradigm, we propose a structured taxonomy to systematically categorize LLMs' functionalities in RL, including four roles: information processor, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator. For each role, we summarize the methodologies, analyze the specific RL challenges that are mitigated, and provide insights into future directions. Lastly, a comparative analysis of each role, potential applications, prospective opportunities, and challenges of the LLM-enhanced RL are discussed. By proposing this taxonomy, we aim to provide a framework for researchers to effectively leverage LLMs in the RL field, potentially accelerating RL applications in complex applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and energy systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahin Amiriparian, Maurice Gerczuk, Justina Lutz, Wolfgang Strube, Irina Papazova, Alkomiet Hasan, Alexander Kathan, Bj\"orn W. Schuller</p>
<p>Abstract: The delayed access to specialized psychiatric assessments and care for patients at risk of suicidal tendencies in emergency departments creates a notable gap in timely intervention, hindering the provision of adequate mental health support during critical situations. To address this, we present a non-invasive, speech-based approach for automatic suicide risk assessment. For our study, we collected a novel speech recording dataset from $20$ patients. We extract three sets of features, including wav2vec, interpretable speech and acoustic features, and deep learning-based spectral representations. We proceed by conducting a binary classification to assess suicide risk in a leave-one-subject-out fashion. Our most effective speech model achieves a balanced accuracy of $66.2\,\%$. Moreover, we show that integrating our speech model with a series of patients' metadata, such as the history of suicide attempts or access to firearms, improves the overall result. The metadata integration yields a balanced accuracy of $94.4\,\%$, marking an absolute improvement of $28.2\,\%$, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approaches for automatic suicide risk assessment in emergency medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Tang, Keya Hu, Jin Peng Zhou, Sicheng Zhong, Wei-Long Zheng, Xujie Si, Kevin Ellis</p>
<p>Abstract: Iteratively improving and repairing source code with large language models (LLMs), known as refinement, has emerged as a popular way of generating programs that would be too complex to construct in one shot. Given a bank of test cases, together with a candidate program, an LLM can improve that program by being prompted with failed test cases. But it remains an open question how to best iteratively refine code, with prior work employing simple greedy or breadth-first strategies. We show here that refinement exposes an explore-exploit tradeoff: exploit by refining the program that passes the most test cases, or explore by refining a lesser considered program. We frame this as an arm-acquiring bandit problem, which we solve with Thompson Sampling. The resulting LLM-based program synthesis algorithm is broadly applicable: Across loop invariant synthesis, visual reasoning puzzles, and competition programming problems, we find that our new method can solve more problems using fewer language model calls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanseul Cho, Jaeyoung Cha, Pranjal Awasthi, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Anupam Gupta, Chulhee Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more "relevant" tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, our models trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as Nx2 multiplication and a two-dimensional task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence has significantly impacted medical applications, particularly with the advent of Medical Large Vision Language Models (Med-LVLMs), sparking optimism for the future of automated and personalized healthcare. However, the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs remains unverified, posing significant risks for future model deployment. In this paper, we introduce CARES and aim to comprehensively evaluate the Trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across the medical domain. We assess the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across five dimensions, including trustfulness, fairness, safety, privacy, and robustness. CARES comprises about 41K question-answer pairs in both closed and open-ended formats, covering 16 medical image modalities and 27 anatomical regions. Our analysis reveals that the models consistently exhibit concerns regarding trustworthiness, often displaying factual inaccuracies and failing to maintain fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, they are vulnerable to attacks and demonstrate a lack of privacy awareness. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://cares-ai.github.io/.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present the VideoLLaMA 2, a set of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) designed to enhance spatial-temporal modeling and audio understanding in video and audio-oriented tasks. Building upon its predecessor, VideoLLaMA 2 incorporates a tailor-made Spatial-Temporal Convolution (STC) connector, which effectively captures the intricate spatial and temporal dynamics of video data. Additionally, we integrate an Audio Branch into the model through joint training, thereby enriching the multimodal understanding capabilities of the model by seamlessly incorporating audio cues. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple-choice video question answering (MC-VQA), open-ended video question answering (OE-VQA), and video captioning (VC) tasks demonstrate that VideoLLaMA 2 consistently achieves competitive results among open-source models and even gets close to some proprietary models on several benchmarks. Furthermore, VideoLLaMA 2 exhibits reasonable improvements in audio-only and audio-video question-answering (AQA & OE-AVQA) benchmarks over existing models. These advancements underline VideoLLaMA 2's superior performance in multimodal comprehension, setting a new standard for intelligent video analysis systems. All models are public to facilitate further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series data are ubiquitous across a wide range of real-world domains. While real-world time series analysis (TSA) requires human experts to integrate numerical series data with multimodal domain-specific knowledge, most existing TSA models rely solely on numerical data, overlooking the significance of information beyond numerical series. This oversight is due to the untapped potential of textual series data and the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality multimodal dataset. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce Time-MMD, the first multi-domain, multimodal time series dataset covering 9 primary data domains. Time-MMD ensures fine-grained modality alignment, eliminates data contamination, and provides high usability. Additionally, we develop MM-TSFlib, the first multimodal time-series forecasting (TSF) library, seamlessly pipelining multimodal TSF evaluations based on Time-MMD for in-depth analyses. Extensive experiments conducted on Time-MMD through MM-TSFlib demonstrate significant performance enhancements by extending unimodal TSF to multimodality, evidenced by over 15% mean squared error reduction in general, and up to 40% in domains with rich textual data. More importantly, our datasets and library revolutionize broader applications, impacts, research topics to advance TSA. The dataset and library are available at https://github.com/AdityaLab/Time-MMD and https://github.com/AdityaLab/MM-TSFlib.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Brandfonbrener, Hanlin Zhang, Andreas Kirsch, Jonathan Richard Schwarz, Sham Kakade</p>
<p>Abstract: Selecting high-quality data for pre-training is crucial in shaping the downstream task performance of language models. A major challenge lies in identifying this optimal subset, a problem generally considered intractable, thus necessitating scalable and effective heuristics. In this work, we propose a data selection method, CoLoR-Filter (Conditional Loss Reduction Filtering), which leverages an empirical Bayes-inspired approach to derive a simple and computationally efficient selection criterion based on the relative loss values of two auxiliary models.
  In addition to the modeling rationale, we evaluate CoLoR-Filter empirically on two language modeling tasks: (1) selecting data from C4 for domain adaptation to evaluation on Books and (2) selecting data from C4 for a suite of downstream multiple-choice question answering tasks. We demonstrate favorable scaling both as we subselect more aggressively and using small auxiliary models to select data for large target models. As one headline result, CoLoR-Filter data selected using a pair of 150m parameter auxiliary models can train a 1.2b parameter target model to match a 1.2b parameter model trained on 25b randomly selected tokens with 25x less data for Books and 11x less data for the downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Wang, Haizhou Shi, Ligong Han, Dimitris Metaxas, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from overconfidence during inference, particularly when adapted to downstream domain-specific tasks with limited data. Previous work addresses this issue by employing approximate Bayesian estimation after the LLMs are trained, enabling them to quantify uncertainty. However, such post-training approaches' performance is severely limited by the parameters learned during training. In this paper, we go beyond post-training Bayesianization and propose Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation (BLoB), an algorithm that continuously and jointly adjusts both the mean and covariance of LLM parameters throughout the whole fine-tuning process. Our empirical results verify the effectiveness of BLoB in terms of generalization and uncertainty estimation, when evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhe Zhang, Huixuan Zhang, Xunjian Yin, Baizhou Huang, Xu Zhang, Xinyu Hu, Xiaojun Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are prone to non-factual or outdated knowledge issues, which can manifest as misreading and misrecognition errors due to the complexity of multimodal knowledge. Previous benchmarks have not systematically analyzed the performance of editing methods in correcting these two error types. To better represent and correct these errors, we decompose multimodal knowledge into its visual and textual components. Different error types correspond to different editing formats, which edit distinct parts of the multimodal knowledge. We present MC-MKE, a fine-grained Multimodal Knowledge Editing benchmark emphasizing Modality Consistency. Our benchmark facilitates independent correction of misreading and misrecognition errors by editing the corresponding knowledge component. We evaluate four multimodal knowledge editing methods on MC-MKE, revealing their limitations, particularly in terms of modality consistency. Our work highlights the challenges posed by multimodal knowledge editing and motivates further research in developing effective techniques for this task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating modern ML models is hard. The strong incentive for researchers and companies to report a state-of-the-art result on some metric often leads to questionable research practices (QRPs): bad practices which fall short of outright research fraud. We describe 44 such practices which can undermine reported results, giving examples where possible. Our list emphasises the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on public benchmarks. We also discuss "irreproducible research practices", i.e. decisions that make it difficult or impossible for other researchers to reproduce, build on or audit previous research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Karvonen, Benjamin Wright, Can Rager, Rico Angell, Jannik Brinkmann, Logan Smith, Claudio Mayrink Verdun, David Bau, Samuel Marks</p>
<p>Abstract: What latent features are encoded in language model (LM) representations? Recent work on training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle interpretable features in LM representations has shown significant promise. However, evaluating the quality of these SAEs is difficult because we lack a ground-truth collection of interpretable features that we expect good SAEs to recover. We thus propose to measure progress in interpretable dictionary learning by working in the setting of LMs trained on chess and Othello transcripts. These settings carry natural collections of interpretable features -- for example, "there is a knight on F3" -- which we leverage into $\textit{supervised}$ metrics for SAE quality. To guide progress in interpretable dictionary learning, we introduce a new SAE training technique, $\textit{p-annealing}$, which improves performance on prior unsupervised metrics as well as our new metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladimir Araujo, Marie-Francine Moens, Tinne Tuytelaars</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are increasingly used with pre-trained language models (PLMs) for continual learning (CL). These methods typically involve training a PEFT module for each new task and employing similarity-based selection to route modules during inference. However, they face two major limitations: 1) interference during module training with already learned modules and 2) suboptimal routing when composing modules. In this paper, we present L2R, a method that isolates the training of new PEFT modules to ensure their task specialization. L2R then learns to compose the learned modules by training a network of routers that leverages a small memory containing examples of previously seen tasks. We evaluate our method in two CL setups using various benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that L2R provides an effective composition of PEFT modules, leading to improved generalization and performance compared to other methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: This report examines the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating theoretical insights with practical applications. It outlines the historical evolution of LLMs from traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to their pivotal role in AI. A comparison of fine-tuning methodologies, including supervised, unsupervised, and instruction-based approaches, highlights their applicability to different tasks. The report introduces a structured seven-stage pipeline for fine-tuning LLMs, spanning data preparation, model initialization, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment. Emphasis is placed on managing imbalanced datasets and optimization techniques. Parameter-efficient methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Half Fine-Tuning are explored for balancing computational efficiency with performance. Advanced techniques such as memory fine-tuning, Mixture of Experts (MoE), and Mixture of Agents (MoA) are discussed for leveraging specialized networks and multi-agent collaboration. The report also examines novel approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which align LLMs with human preferences, alongside pruning and routing optimizations to improve efficiency. Further sections cover validation frameworks, post-deployment monitoring, and inference optimization, with attention to deploying LLMs on distributed and cloud-based platforms. Emerging areas such as multimodal LLMs, fine-tuning for audio and speech, and challenges related to scalability, privacy, and accountability are also addressed. This report offers actionable insights for researchers and practitioners navigating LLM fine-tuning in an evolving landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Furuta, Kuang-Huei Lee, Shixiang Shane Gu, Yutaka Matsuo, Aleksandra Faust, Heiga Zen, Izzeddin Gur</p>
<p>Abstract: Many algorithms for aligning LLMs with human preferences assume that human preferences are binary and deterministic. However, human preferences can vary across individuals, and therefore should be represented distributionally. In this work, we introduce the distributional soft preference labels and improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a weighted geometric average of the LLM output likelihood in the loss function. This approach adjusts the scale of learning loss based on the soft labels such that the loss would approach zero when the responses are closer to equally preferred. This simple modification can be easily applied to any DPO-based methods and mitigate over-optimization and objective mismatch, which prior works suffer from. Our experiments simulate the soft preference labels with AI feedback from LLMs and demonstrate that geometric averaging consistently improves performance on standard benchmarks for alignment research. In particular, we observe more preferable responses than binary labels and significant improvements where modestly-confident labels are in the majority.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our approach extends traditional agent-based simulations by using strategic LLM agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a pro-social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro-social behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations. The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into AI-mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real-world team settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality and multi-task singing datasets significantly hinders the development of diverse controllable and personalized singing tasks, as existing singing datasets suffer from low quality, limited diversity of languages and singers, absence of multi-technique information and realistic music scores, and poor task suitability. To tackle these problems, we present GTSinger, a large global, multi-technique, free-to-use, high-quality singing corpus with realistic music scores, designed for all singing tasks, along with its benchmarks. Particularly, (1) we collect 80.59 hours of high-quality singing voices, forming the largest recorded singing dataset; (2) 20 professional singers across nine widely spoken languages offer diverse timbres and styles; (3) we provide controlled comparison and phoneme-level annotations of six commonly used singing techniques, helping technique modeling and control; (4) GTSinger offers realistic music scores, assisting real-world musical composition; (5) singing voices are accompanied by manual phoneme-to-audio alignments, global style labels, and 16.16 hours of paired speech for various singing tasks. Moreover, to facilitate the use of GTSinger, we conduct four benchmark experiments: technique-controllable singing voice synthesis, technique recognition, style transfer, and speech-to-singing conversion.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across a wide range of domains, with increasing emphasis on enhancing their zero-shot generalization capabilities for unseen tasks across various modalities. Instruction tuning has emerged as an effective strategy for achieving zero-shot generalization by finetuning pretrained models on diverse multimodal tasks. As the scale of MLLMs continues to grow, parameter-efficient finetuning becomes increasingly critical. However, most existing parameter-efficient approaches focus only on single modalities and often overlook the multimodal characteristics during finetuning. In this work, we introduce a novel Multimodal Prompt Tuning (M$^2$PT) approach for efficient instruction tuning of MLLMs. M$^2$PT effectively integrates visual and textual prompts into the vision encoder and language processor respectively during finetuning, facilitating the extraction and alignment of features across modalities. Empirical results on various multimodal evaluation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to several state-of-the-art baselines. A comprehensive set of ablation studies validates the effectiveness of our prompt design and the efficiency of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective research ideation is a critical step for scientific research. However, the exponential increase in scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current with recent advances and identify meaningful research directions. Recent developments in large language models~(LLMs) suggest a promising avenue for automating the generation of novel research ideas. However, existing methods for idea generation either trivially prompt LLMs or directly expose LLMs to extensive literature without indicating useful information. Inspired by the research process of human researchers, we propose a Chain-of-Ideas~(CoI) agent, an LLM-based agent that organizes relevant literature in a chain structure to effectively mirror the progressive development in a research domain. This organization facilitates LLMs to capture the current advancements in research, thereby enhancing their ideation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose Idea Arena, an evaluation protocol that can comprehensively evaluate idea generation methods from different perspectives, aligning closely with the preferences of human researchers. Experimental results indicate that the CoI agent consistently outperforms other methods and shows comparable quality as humans in research idea generation. Moreover, our CoI agent is budget-friendly, with a minimum cost of \$0.50 to generate a candidate idea and its corresponding experimental design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giangiacomo Mercatali, Andre Freitas, Jie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Interacting systems are prevalent in nature. It is challenging to accurately predict the dynamics of the system if its constituent components are analyzed independently. We develop a graph-based model that unveils the systemic interactions of time series observed at irregular time points, by using a directed acyclic graph to model the conditional dependencies (a form of causal notation) of the system components and learning this graph in tandem with a continuous-time model that parameterizes the solution curves of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our technique, a graph neural flow, leads to substantial enhancements over non-graph-based methods, as well as graph-based methods without the modeling of conditional dependencies. We validate our approach on several tasks, including time series classification and forecasting, to demonstrate its efficacy.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14516">Do LLMs &quot;know&quot; internally when they follow instructions?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyeon Heo, Christina Heinze-Deml, Oussama Elachqar, Shirley Ren, Udhay Nallasamy, Andy Miller, Kwan Ho Ryan Chan, Jaya Narain</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-following is crucial for building AI agents with large language models (LLMs), as these models must adhere strictly to user-provided constraints and guidelines. However, LLMs often fail to follow even simple and clear instructions. To improve instruction-following behavior and prevent undesirable outputs, a deeper understanding of how LLMs' internal states relate to these outcomes is required. Our analysis of LLM internal states reveal a dimension in the input embedding space linked to successful instruction-following. We demonstrate that modifying representations along this dimension improves instruction-following success rates compared to random changes, without compromising response quality. Further investigation reveals that this dimension is more closely related to the phrasing of prompts rather than the inherent difficulty of the task or instructions. This discovery also suggests explanations for why LLMs sometimes fail to follow clear instructions and why prompt engineering is often effective, even when the content remains largely unchanged. This work provides insight into the internal workings of LLMs' instruction-following, paving the way for reliable LLM agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siheng Xiong, Delin Chen, Qingyang Wu, Longxuan Yu, Qingzhen Liu, Dawei Li, Zhikai Chen, Xiaoze Liu, Liangming Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal reasoning (CR) is a crucial aspect of intelligence, essential for problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding the world. While large language models (LLMs) can generate rationales for their outputs, their ability to reliably perform causal reasoning remains uncertain, often falling short in tasks requiring a deep understanding of causality. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of research aimed at enhancing LLMs for causal reasoning. We categorize existing methods based on the role of LLMs: either as reasoning engines or as helpers providing knowledge or data to traditional CR methods, followed by a detailed discussion of the methodologies in each category. We then evaluate the performance of LLMs on various causal reasoning tasks, providing key findings and in-depth analysis. Finally, we provide insights from current studies and highlight promising directions for future research. We aim for this work to serve as a comprehensive resource, fostering further advancements in causal reasoning with LLMs. Resources are available at https://github.com/chendl02/Awesome-LLM-causal-reasoning.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17401">AdvWeb: Controllable Black-box Attacks on VLM-powered Web Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chejian Xu, Mintong Kang, Jiawei Zhang, Zeyi Liao, Lingbo Mo, Mengqi Yuan, Huan Sun, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized the creation of generalist web agents, empowering them to autonomously complete diverse tasks on real-world websites, thereby boosting human efficiency and productivity. However, despite their remarkable capabilities, the safety and security of these agents against malicious attacks remain critically underexplored, raising significant concerns about their safe deployment. To uncover and exploit such vulnerabilities in web agents, we provide AdvWeb, a novel black-box attack framework designed against web agents. AdvWeb trains an adversarial prompter model that generates and injects adversarial prompts into web pages, misleading web agents into executing targeted adversarial actions such as inappropriate stock purchases or incorrect bank transactions, actions that could lead to severe real-world consequences. With only black-box access to the web agent, we train and optimize the adversarial prompter model using DPO, leveraging both successful and failed attack strings against the target agent. Unlike prior approaches, our adversarial string injection maintains stealth and control: (1) the appearance of the website remains unchanged before and after the attack, making it nearly impossible for users to detect tampering, and (2) attackers can modify specific substrings within the generated adversarial string to seamlessly change the attack objective (e.g., purchasing stocks from a different company), enhancing attack flexibility and efficiency. We conduct extensive evaluations, demonstrating that AdvWeb achieves high success rates in attacking SOTA GPT-4V-based VLM agent across various web tasks. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current LLM/VLM-based agents, emphasizing the urgent need for developing more reliable web agents and effective defenses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialu Li, Yuanzhen Li, Neal Wadhwa, Yael Pritch, David E. Jacobs, Michael Rubinstein, Mohit Bansal, Nataniel Ruiz</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the concept of a generative infinite game, a video game that transcends the traditional boundaries of finite, hard-coded systems by using generative models. Inspired by James P. Carse's distinction between finite and infinite games, we leverage recent advances in generative AI to create Unbounded: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated in generative models. Specifically, Unbounded draws inspiration from sandbox life simulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual character in a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-ended mechanics generated by an LLM, some of which can be emergent. In order to develop Unbounded, we propose technical innovations in both the LLM and visual generation domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilled large language model (LLM) that dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamic regional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multiple environments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for both characters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Ara\'ujo</p>
<p>Abstract: The vector notation adopted by GNU Octave plays a significant role as a tool for introspection, aligning itself with the vision of Kenneth E. Iverson. He believed that, just like mathematics, a programming language should be an effective thinking tool for representing and reasoning about problems we wish to address. This work aims to explore the use of vector notation in GNU Octave through the analysis of operators and functions, providing a closer alignment with mathematical notation and enhancing code efficiency. We will delve into fundamental concepts such as indexing, broadcasting, and function handles, and present case studies for a deeper understanding of these concepts. By adopting vector notation, GNU Octave becomes a powerful tool for mathematicians, scientists and engineers, enabling them to express and solve complex problems more effectively and intuitively.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20533">Guiding Through Complexity: What Makes Good Supervision for Hard Reasoning Tasks?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan He, Da Yin, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: How can "weak teacher models" such as average human annotators or existing AI systems, effectively supervise LLMs to improve performance on hard reasoning tasks, especially those that challenge and requires expertise or daily practice from the teacher models? In this paper, we seek for empirical answers to this question by investigating various data-driven strategies that offer supervision data at different quality levels upon tasks of varying complexity. Two intuitive strategies emerge for teacher models to provide supervision during alignment training: 1) using lower-quality supervision from complete tasks that match the difficulty of the target reasoning tasks, and 2) leveraging higher-quality supervision from easier subtasks that are less challenging. Interestingly, we find that even when the outcome error rate for hard task supervision is high (e.g., 90\%), training on such data can outperform perfectly correct supervision on easier subtasks on multiple hard math benchmarks. We further identify a more critical factor influencing training performance: step-wise error rates, which indicate the severity of errors in solutions. Specifically, training on hard task supervision with the same outcome error rates but disparate step-wise error rates can lead to a 30\% accuracy gap on MATH benchmark. Our results also reveal that supplementing hard task supervision with the corresponding subtask supervision can yield notable performance improvements than simply combining rephrased hard full task supervision, suggesting new avenues for data augmentation.
