<p><b>Authors:</b> Krunal Jesani, Dmitry Ignatov, Radu Timofte</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) traditionally requires significant human expertise or automated trial-and-error to design deep learning models. We present NN-Caption, an LLM-guided neural architecture search pipeline that generates runnable image-captioning models by composing CNN encoders from LEMUR's classification backbones with sequence decoders (LSTM/GRU/Transformer) under a strict Net API. Using DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as the primary generator, we present the prompt template and examples of generated architectures. We evaluate on MS COCO with BLEU-4. The LLM generated dozens of captioning models, with over half successfully trained and producing meaningful captions. We analyse the outcomes of using different numbers of input model snippets (5 vs. 10) in the prompt, finding a slight drop in success rate when providing more candidate components. We also report training dynamics (caption accuracy vs. epochs) and the highest BLEU-4 attained. Our results highlight the promise of LLM-guided NAS: the LLM not only proposes architectures but also suggests hyperparameters and training practices. We identify the challenges encountered (e.g., code hallucinations or API compliance issues) and detail how prompt rules and iterative code fixes addressed them. This work presents a pipeline that integrates prompt-based code generation with automatic evaluation, and adds dozens of novel captioning models to the open LEMUR dataset to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and downstream AutoML research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keqiuyin Li, Jie Lu, Hua Zuo, Guangquan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised multi-domain adaptation plays a key role in transfer learning by leveraging acquired rich source information from multiple source domains to solve target task from an unlabeled target domain. However, multiple source domains often contain much redundant or unrelated information which can harm transfer performance, especially when in massive-source domain settings. It is urgent to develop effective strategies for identifying and selecting the most transferable knowledge from massive source domains to address the target task. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain adaptation method named \underline{\textit{Auto}}nomous Source Knowledge \underline{\textit{S}}election (AutoS) to autonomosly select source training samples and models, enabling the prediction of target task using more relevant and transferable source information. The proposed method employs a density-driven selection strategy to choose source samples during training and to determine which source models should contribute to target prediction. Simulteneously, a pseudo-label enhancement module built on a pre-trained multimodal modal is employed to mitigate target label noise and improve self-supervision. Experiments on real-world datasets indicate the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Cartularo</p>
<p>Abstract: Sepsis accounts for nearly 20% of global ICU admissions, yet conventional prediction models often fail to effectively integrate heterogeneous data streams, remaining either siloed by modality or reliant on brittle early fusion. In this work, we present a rigorous architectural comparison between End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking for sepsis tasks. We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from "attention starvation" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a "leaner" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the "Historian" (Static), the "Monitor" (Temporal), and the "Reader" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC). These models are integrated into SepsisSuite, a deployment-ready Python framework for clinical decision support.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georges Sfeir, Stephane Hess, Thomas O. Hancock, Filipe Rodrigues, Jamal Amani Rad, Michiel Bliemer, Matthew Beck, Fayyaz Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Many travel decisions involve a degree of experience formation, where individuals learn their preferences over time. At the same time, there is extensive scope for heterogeneity across individual travellers, both in their underlying preferences and in how these evolve. The present paper puts forward a Latent Class Reinforcement Learning (LCRL) model that allows analysts to capture both of these phenomena. We apply the model to a driving simulator dataset and estimate the parameters through Variational Bayes. We identify three distinct classes of individuals that differ markedly in how they adapt their preferences: the first displays context-dependent preferences with context-specific exploitative tendencies; the second follows a persistent exploitative strategy regardless of context; and the third engages in an exploratory strategy combined with context-specific preferences.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14714">Improving Underwater Acoustic Classification Through Learnable Gabor Filter Convolution and Attention Mechanisms</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Cesar Ferreira Domingos, Russell Brinkworth, Paulo Eduardo Santos, Karl Sammut</p>
<p>Abstract: Remotely detecting and classifying underwater acoustic targets is critical for environmental monitoring and defence. However, the complex nature of ship-radiated and environmental underwater noise poses significant challenges to accurate signal processing. While recent advancements in machine learning have improved classification accuracy, issues such as limited dataset availability and a lack of standardised experimentation hinder generalisation and robustness. This paper introduces GSE ResNeXt, a deep learning architecture integrating learnable Gabor convolutional layers with a ResNeXt backbone enhanced by squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms. The Gabor filters serve as two-dimensional adaptive band-pass filters, extending the feature channel representation. Its combination with channel attention improves training stability and convergence while enhancing the model's ability to extract discriminative features. The model is evaluated on three classification tasks of increasing complexity. In particular, the impact of temporal differences between the training and testing data is explored, revealing that the distance between the vessel and sensor significantly affects performance. Results show that, GSE ResNeXt consistently outperforms baseline models like Xception, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, in terms of classification performance. Regarding stability and convergence, the addition of Gabor convolutions in the initial layers of the model represents a 28% reduction in training time. These results emphasise the importance of signal processing strategies in improving the reliability and generalisation of models under different environmental conditions, especially in data-limited underwater acoustic classification scenarios. Future developments should focus on mitigating the impact of environmental factors on input signals.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14715">How a Bit Becomes a Story: Semantic Steering via Differentiable Fault Injection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zafaryab Haider, Md Hafizur Rahman, Shane Moeykens, Vijay Devabhaktuni, Prabuddha Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Hard-to-detect hardware bit flips, from either malicious circuitry or bugs, have already been shown to make transformers vulnerable in non-generative tasks. This work, for the first time, investigates how low-level, bitwise perturbations (fault injection) to the weights of a large language model (LLM) used for image captioning can influence the semantic meaning of its generated descriptions while preserving grammatical structure. While prior fault analysis methods have shown that flipping a few bits can crash classifiers or degrade accuracy, these approaches overlook the semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. In image captioning models, a single flipped bit might subtly alter how visual features map to words, shifting the entire narrative an AI tells about the world. We hypothesize that such semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable. That is, the model's own gradients can predict which bits, if perturbed, will most strongly influence meaning while leaving syntax and fluency intact. We design a differentiable fault analysis framework, BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation), that uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits and then refines their selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. Our goal is not merely to corrupt captions, but to understand how meaning itself is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level, revealing that even imperceptible low-level changes can steer the high-level semantics of generative vision-language models. It also opens pathways for robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI, by exposing how structured bit-level faults can reshape a model's semantic output.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14717">Is GPT-OSS All You Need? Benchmarking Large Language Models for Financial Intelligence and the Surprising Efficiency Paradox</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqian Bi, Danyang Zhang, Junhao Song, Chiung-Yi Tseng</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models in financial services necessitates rigorous evaluation frameworks to assess their performance, efficiency, and practical applicability. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the GPT-OSS model family alongside contemporary LLMs across ten diverse financial NLP tasks. Through extensive experimentation on 120B and 20B parameter variants of GPT-OSS, we reveal a counterintuitive finding: the smaller GPT-OSS-20B model achieves comparable accuracy (65.1% vs 66.5%) while demonstrating superior computational efficiency with 198.4 Token Efficiency Score and 159.80 tokens per second processing speed [1]. Our evaluation encompasses sentiment analysis, question answering, and entity recognition tasks using real-world financial datasets including Financial PhraseBank, FiQA-SA, and FLARE FINERORD. We introduce novel efficiency metrics that capture the trade-off between model performance and resource utilization, providing critical insights for deployment decisions in production environments. The benchmark reveals that GPT-OSS models consistently outperform larger competitors including Qwen3-235B, challenging the prevailing assumption that model scale directly correlates with task performance [2]. Our findings demonstrate that architectural innovations and training strategies in GPT-OSS enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance with significantly reduced computational overhead, offering a pathway toward sustainable and cost-effective deployment of LLMs in financial applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Xiong, Zongxia Xie, Yanru Sun, Haoyu Wang, Jianhong Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective multivariate time series forecasting often benefits from accurately modeling complex inter-variable dependencies. However, existing attention- or graph-based methods face three key issues: (a) strong temporal self-dependencies are often disrupted by irrelevant variables; (b) softmax normalization ignores and reverses negative correlations; (c) variables struggle to perceive their temporal positions. To address these, we propose \textbf{SEED}, a Spectral Entropy-guided Evaluation framework for spatial-temporal Dependency modeling. SEED introduces a Dependency Evaluator, a key innovation that leverages spectral entropy to dynamically provide a preliminary evaluation of the spatial and temporal dependencies of each variable, enabling the model to adaptively balance Channel Independence (CI) and Channel Dependence (CD) strategies. To account for temporal regularities originating from the influence of other variables rather than intrinsic dynamics, we propose Spectral Entropy-based Fuser to further refine the evaluated dependency weights, effectively separating this part. Moreover, to preserve negative correlations, we introduce a Signed Graph Constructor that enables signed edge weights, overcoming the limitations of softmax. Finally, to help variables perceive their temporal positions and thereby construct more comprehensive spatial features, we introduce the Context Spatial Extractor, which leverages local contextual windows to extract spatial features. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate that SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generality.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14719">Hybrid Attribution Priors for Explainable and Robust Model Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoran Zhang, Feng Zhang, Shangyuan Li, Yang Shi, Yuanxing Zhang, Wei Chen, Tengjiao Wang, Kam-Fai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are widely used in tasks that require low latency and lightweight deployment, particularly classification. As interpretability and robustness gain increasing importance, explanation-guided learning has emerged as an effective framework by introducing attribution-based supervision during training; however, deriving general and reliable attribution priors remains a significant challenge. Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features. Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently enhances both interpretability and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is a promising technology to make medical data available for secondary use in a privacy-compliant manner. A popular method for creating realistic patient data is the rule-based Synthea data generator. Synthea generates data based on rules describing the lifetime of a synthetic patient. These rules typically express the probability of a condition occurring, such as a disease, depending on factors like age. Since they only contain statistical information, rules usually have no specific data protection requirements. However, creating meaningful rules can be a very complex process that requires expert knowledge and realistic sample data. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate an approach to automatically generate Synthea rules based on statistics from tabular data, which we extracted from cancer reports. As an example use case, we created a Synthea module for glioblastoma from a real-world dataset and used it to generate a synthetic dataset. Compared to the original dataset, the synthetic data reproduced known disease courses and mostly retained the statistical properties. Overall, synthetic patient data holds great potential for privacy-preserving research. The data can be used to formulate hypotheses and to develop prototypes, but medical interpretation should consider the specific limitations as with any currently available approach.</p>

In this paper, we improve this approach by applying Hierarchical Attention Transformers (HATs) to solve systems of multivariate polynomial equations via Groebner bases computation. The HAT architecture incorporates a tree-structured inductive bias that enables the modeling of hierarchical relationships present in the data and thus achieves significant computational savings compared to conventional flat attention models. We generalize to arbitrary depths and include a detailed computational cost analysis. Combined with curriculum learning, our method solves instances that are much larger than those in Kera et al.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Giral, \'Alvaro Manzano, Ignacio G\'omez, Petros Koumoutsakos, Soledad Le Clainche</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban wind flow modeling and simulation play an important role in air quality assessment and sustainable city planning. A key challenge for modeling and simulation is handling the complex geometries of the urban landscape. Low order models are limited in capturing the effects of geometry, while high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are prohibitively expensive, especially across multiple geometries or wind conditions. Here, we propose a generative diffusion framework for synthesizing steady-state urban wind fields over unstructured meshes that requires only geometry information. The framework combines a hierarchical graph neural network with score-based diffusion modeling to generate accurate and diverse velocity fields without requiring temporal rollouts or dense measurements. Trained across multiple mesh slices and wind angles, the model generalizes to unseen geometries, recovers key flow structures such as wakes and recirculation zones, and offers uncertainty-aware predictions. Ablation studies confirm robustness to mesh variation and performance under different inference regimes. This work develops is the first step towards foundation models for the built environment that can help urban planners rapidly evaluate design decisions under densification and climate uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abraham Itzhak Weinberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets without environment interaction, but existing Decision Transformer (DT) architectures struggle with long-horizon credit assignment and complex state-action dependencies. We introduce the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), a novel architecture incorporating quantum-inspired computational mechanisms to address these challenges. Our approach integrates two core components: Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations that capture non-local feature correlations, and Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation. Through comprehensive experiments on continuous control tasks, we demonstrate over 2,000\% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Critically, our ablation studies reveal strong synergistic effects between quantum-inspired components: neither alone achieves competitive performance, yet their combination produces dramatic improvements far exceeding individual contributions. This synergy demonstrates that effective quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. Our analysis identifies three key computational advantages: enhanced credit assignment through non-local correlations, implicit ensemble behavior via parallel processing, and adaptive resource allocation through learnable interference. These findings establish quantum-inspired design principles as a promising direction for advancing transformer architectures in sequential decision-making, with implications extending beyond reinforcement learning to neural architecture design more broadly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Klaus-Rudolf Kladny, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Lisa Koch, Christian F. Baumgartner, Michael Muehlebach</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is transforming healthcare, but safe clinical decisions demand reliable uncertainty estimates that standard ML models fail to provide. Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular tool that allows users to turn heuristic uncertainty estimates into uncertainty estimates with statistical guarantees. CP works by converting predictions of a ML model, together with a calibration sample, into prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true label with any desired probability. An often cited advantage is that CP theory holds for calibration samples of arbitrary size, suggesting that uncertainty estimates with practically meaningful statistical guarantees can be achieved even if only small calibration sets are available. We question this promise by showing that, although the statistical guarantees hold for calibration sets of arbitrary size, the practical utility of these guarantees does highly depend on the size of the calibration set. This observation is relevant in medical domains because data is often scarce and obtaining large calibration sets is therefore infeasible. We corroborate our critique in an empirical demonstration on a medical image classification task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie He, Yong Qin, Jianyuan Guo, Xuan Sun, Xuanchuan Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Refined trajectory inference of urban rail transit is of great significance to the operation organization. In this paper, we develop a fully data-driven approach to inferring individual travel trajectories in urban rail transit systems. It utilizes data from the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems to infer key trajectory elements, such as selected train, access/egress time, and transfer time. The approach includes establishing train alternative sets based on spatio-temporal constraints, data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, and trave l trajectory construction. To realize data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, a data-driven parameter estimation method based on KL divergence combined with EM algorithm (KLEM) was proposed. This method eliminates the reliance on external or survey data for parameter fitting, enhancing the robustness and applicability of the model. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of using synthetic data to validate the result, this paper employs real individual travel trajectory data for verification. The results show that the approach developed in this paper can achieve high-precision passenger trajectory inference, with an accuracy rate of over 90% in urban rail transit travel trajectory inference during peak hours.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikit Phadke</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a geometric framework for policy-constrained semantic interpretation that provably prevents hallucinated commitments in high-stakes domains. Semantic meaning is represented as direction on a unit sphere, evidence is modeled as sets of witness vectors, and admissible interpretations correspond to spherical convex regions. Policy constraints are introduced as explicit priors defined over the same manifold, separated from evidence geometry. Interpretation reduces to constrained optimization over admissible regions, with refusal emerging as a topologically necessary outcome under contradiction or policy exclusion. We connect this framework to information theory, Bayesian inference, and sheaf-theoretic semantics, proving that our complexity bounds are information-theoretically optimal. Empirical validation on large scale regulated financial data demonstrates zero hallucinated approvals across multiple policy regimes-the first such result at scale.</p>

Traditional manual inspection by radiologists is time-consuming and variable. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision-language models (VLMs) in a plan-and-execute agentic approach to improve the efficiency and precision of incidental findings detection, classification, and reporting for abdominal CT scans. Given medical guidelines for abdominal organs, the process of managing incidental findings is automated through a planner-executor framework. The planner, based on LLM, generates Python scripts using predefined base functions, while the executor runs these scripts to perform the necessary checks and detections, via VLMs, segmentation models, and image processing subroutines.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a CT abdominal benchmark for three organs, in a fully automatic end-to-end manner. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing pure VLM-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Chen, Venkatesh Ganapati Hegde, Hongfei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Many recommender systems in long-form video streaming reply on batch-trained models and batch-updated features, where user features are updated daily and served statically throughout the day. While efficient, this approach fails to incorporate a user's most recent actions, often resulting in stale recommendations. In this work, we present a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for intra-day personalization that selectively injects recent watch history at inference time without requiring model retraining. Our approach selectively overrides stale user features at inference time using the recent watch history, allowing the system to adapt instantly to evolving preferences. By reducing the personalization feedback loop from daily to intra-day, we observed a statistically significant 0.47% increase in key user engagement metrics which ranked among the most substantial engagement gains observed in recent experimentation cycles. To our knowledge, this is the first published evidence that intra-day personalization can drive meaningful impact in long-form video streaming service, providing a compelling alternative to full real-time architectures where model retraining is required.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengxu Yan, Han Li, Yuming Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing ease of academic publishing, the volume of research papers, especially in AI-related fields, has surged dramatically. This flood of publications makes it difficult for truly novel and impactful work to stand out, and manual novelty assessment is often unstable and time-consuming. Our project aims to develop a model that estimates and ranks the conceptual novelty of AI papers, enabling a data-driven and scalable assessment of research originality. Such a system can help researchers efficiently identify submissions that introduce genuinely innovative ideas rather than minor variants, and provide conference reviewers with a quantitative and consistent signal of novelty. Our approach evaluates novelty primarily through a paper's title, abstract, and semantic similarity to prior literature. Given the motivation of novelty estimation, we explore two task formulations with different modeling objectives, each offering a different perspective: (1) binary classification, which predicts the paper's absolute novelty from learned patterns of prior novel works, and (2) pairwise novelty comparison, which learns to distinguish papers by relative novelty over others. We fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and SciBERT on both tasks, benchmarking against GPT-5.1 to analyze how task formulation and modeling choices affect performance. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengxuYan/NoveltyRank.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kornelius Raeth, Nicole Ludwig</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard weather forecast evaluations focus on the forecaster's perspective and on a statistical assessment comparing forecasts and observations. In practice, however, forecasts are used to make decisions, so it seems natural to take the decision-maker's perspective and quantify the value of a forecast by its ability to improve decision-making. Decision calibration provides a novel framework for evaluating forecast performance at the decision level rather than the forecast level. We evaluate decision calibration to compare Machine Learning and classical numerical weather prediction models on various weather-dependent decision tasks. We find that model performance at the forecast level does not reliably translate to performance in downstream decision-making: some performance differences only become apparent at the decision level, and model rankings can change among different decision tasks. Our results confirm that typical forecast evaluations are insufficient for selecting the optimal forecast model for a specific decision task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aslak Djupsk{\aa}s, Alexander Johannes Stasik, Signe Riemer-S{\o}rensen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is crucial for machine learning models, especially in safety-critical domains. While exact Bayesian inference offers a principled approach, it is often computationally infeasible for deep neural networks. Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) was proposed as an efficient approximation to Bayesian inference in deep learning by applying neuron dropout at inference time \citep{gal2016dropout}. Hence, the method generates multiple sub-models yielding a distribution of predictions to estimate uncertainty. We empirically investigate its ability to capture true uncertainty and compare to Gaussian Processes (GP) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN). We find that MCD struggles to accurately reflect the underlying true uncertainty, particularly failing to capture increased uncertainty in extrapolation and interpolation regions as observed in Bayesian models. The findings suggest that uncertainty estimates from MCD, as implemented and evaluated in these experiments, is not as reliable as those from traditional Bayesian approaches for capturing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14873">How Does Fourier Analysis Network Work? A Mechanism Analysis and a New Dual-Activation Layer Proposal</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sam Jeong, Hae Yong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) was recently proposed as a simple way to improve neural network performance by replacing part of ReLU activations with sine and cosine functions. Although several studies have reported small but consistent gains across tasks, the underlying mechanism behind these improvements has remained unclear. In this work, we show that only the sine activation contributes positively to performance, whereas the cosine activation tends to be detrimental. Our analysis reveals that the improvement is not a consequence of the sine function's periodic nature; instead, it stems from the function's local behavior near x = 0, where its non-zero derivative mitigates the vanishing-gradient problem. We further show that FAN primarily alleviates the dying-ReLU problem, in which a neuron consistently receives negative inputs, produces zero gradients, and stops learning. Although modern ReLU-like activations, such as Leaky ReLU, GELU, and Swish, reduce ReLU's zero-gradient region, they still contain input domains where gradients remain significantly diminished, contributing to slower optimization and hindering rapid convergence. FAN addresses this limitation by introducing a more stable gradient pathway. This analysis shifts the understanding of FAN's benefits from a spectral interpretation to a concrete analysis of training dynamics, leading to the development of the Dual-Activation Layer (DAL), a more efficient convergence accelerator. We evaluate DAL on three tasks: classification of noisy sinusoidal signals versus pure noise, MNIST digit classification, and ECG-based biometric recognition. In all cases, DAL models converge faster and achieve equal or higher validation accuracy compared to models with conventional activations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-referential learning -- training a model on data it generated itself -- promises boundless scalability but chronically suffers from model collapse: language models degenerate into repetitive text, GANs drop modes, and reinforcement-learning policies over-exploit. Although practitioners employ ad~hoc fixes such as real-data mixing, entropy bonuses, knowledge distillation, or retrieval-augmented generation, a single principle that explains both the failure mode and the success of these fixes has remained elusive. We present Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-geometric framework that unifies these phenomena. We model the closed loop as a stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Without external coupling, finite-sample noise forces the system to project onto an ever-shrinking empirical support, causing exponential entropy decay and eventual collapse. Introducing an Entropy Reservoir -- a high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection -- injects a controllable entropy flux that provably stabilises the dynamics. Our theory yields (i) a necessary condition for collapse, (ii) a sufficient condition that guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor, and (iii) closed-form rates that depend only on sample size and the strong-convexity/Lipschitz constants of the Bregman generator. Experiments on large-language-model self-training, Soft Actor-Critic in reinforcement learning, and GAN optimisation validate our predictions and show that disparate stabilisation heuristics correspond to specific reservoir choices and coupling coefficients. ERBP thus transforms a collection of folk remedies into a single, quantitative design rule: monitor and budget your entropy flux.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darrin O' Brien, Dhikshith Gajulapalli, Eric Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Results in interpretability suggest that large vision and language models learn implicit linear encodings when models are biased by in-context prompting. However, the existence of similar linear representations in more general adaptation regimes has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we develop the concept of a task matrix, a linear transformation from a base to finetuned embedding state. We demonstrate that for vision and text models and ten different datasets, a base model augmented with a task matrix achieves results surpassing linear probes, sometimes approaching finetuned levels. Our results validate the existence of cross-layer linear encodings between pretrained and finetuned architectures. Moreover, we show that a data-based approximation for such encodings is both efficient and generalizable to multiple domains. We make our implementation publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Abu-Shaira, Alejandro Rodriguez, Greg Speegle, Victor Sheng, Ishfaq Ahmad</p>
<p>Abstract: Online learning updates models incrementally with new data, avoiding large storage requirements and costly model recalculations. In this paper, we introduce "OLR-WA; OnLine Regression with Weighted Average", a novel and versatile multivariate online linear regression model. We also investigate scenarios involving drift, where the underlying patterns in the data evolve over time, conduct convergence analysis, and compare our approach with existing online regression models. The results of OLR-WA demonstrate its ability to achieve performance comparable to the batch regression, while also showcasing comparable or superior performance when compared with other state-of-the-art online models, thus establishing its effectiveness. Moreover, OLR-WA exhibits exceptional performance in terms of rapid convergence, surpassing other online models with consistently achieving high r2 values as a performance measure from the first iteration to the last iteration, even when initialized with minimal amount of data points, as little as 1% to 10% of the total data points. In addition to its ability to handle time-based (temporal drift) scenarios, remarkably, OLR-WA stands out as the only model capable of effectively managing confidence-based challenging scenarios. It achieves this by adopting a conservative approach in its updates, giving priority to older data points with higher confidence levels. In summary, OLR-WA's performance further solidifies its versatility and utility across different contexts, making it a valuable solution for online linear regression tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niklas Lauffer, Xiang Deng, Srivatsa Kundurthy, Brad Kenstler, Jeff Da</p>
<p>Abstract: A popular paradigm for training LM agents relies on imitation learning, fine-tuning on expert trajectories. However, we show that the off-policy nature of imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from the fundamental limitation known as covariate shift: as the student policy's behavior diverges from the expert's, it encounters states not present in the training data, reducing the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified. Our results demonstrate the need for combining expert demonstrations with on-policy data for effective multi-turn LM agent training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Turja Kundu, Sanjukta Bhowmick</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs), a novel graph learning algorithm that addresses two important challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel numerical method for solving McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) with common noise, combining Picard iterations, elicitability and deep learning. The key innovation involves elicitability to derive a path-wise loss function, enabling efficient training of neural networks to approximate both the backward process and the conditional expectations arising from common noise - without requiring computationally expensive nested Monte Carlo simulations. The mean-field interaction term is parameterized via a recurrent neural network trained to minimize an elicitable score, while the backward process is approximated through a feedforward network representing the decoupling field. We validate the algorithm on a systemic risk inter-bank borrowing and lending model, where analytical solutions exist, demonstrating accurate recovery of the true solution. We further extend the model to quantile-mediated interactions, showcasing the flexibility of the elicitability framework beyond conditional means or moments. Finally, we apply the method to a non-stationary Aiyagari--Bewley--Huggett economic growth model with endogenous interest rates, illustrating its applicability to complex mean-field games without closed-form solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor M. Yeom Song, Severi Rissanen, Arno Solin, Samuel Kaski, Mingfei Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models struggle to produce samples that respect constraints, a common requirement in scientific applications. Recent approaches have introduced regularization terms in the loss or guidance methods during sampling to enforce such constraints, but they bias the generative model away from the true data distribution. This is a problem, especially when the constraint is misspecified, a common issue when formulating constraints on scientific data. In this paper, instead of changing the loss or the sampling loop, we integrate a guidance-inspired adjustment into the denoiser itself, giving it a soft inductive bias towards constraint-compliant samples. We show that these softly constrained denoisers exploit constraint knowledge to improve compliance over standard denoisers, and maintain enough flexibility to deviate from it when there is misspecification with observed data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study reinforcement learning for controlled diffusion processes with unbounded continuous state spaces, bounded continuous actions, and polynomially growing rewards: settings that arise naturally in finance, economics, and operations research. To overcome the challenges of continuous and high-dimensional domains, we introduce a model-based algorithm that adaptively partitions the joint state-action space. The algorithm maintains estimators of drift, volatility, and rewards within each partition, refining the discretization whenever estimation bias exceeds statistical confidence. This adaptive scheme balances exploration and approximation, enabling efficient learning in unbounded domains. Our analysis establishes regret bounds that depend on the problem horizon, state dimension, reward growth order, and a newly defined notion of zooming dimension tailored to unbounded diffusion processes. The bounds recover existing results for bounded settings as a special case, while extending theoretical guarantees to a broader class of diffusion-type problems. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments, including applications to high-dimensional problems such as multi-asset mean-variance portfolio selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandeep Neela</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how prices evolve over time often requires peeling back the layers of market noise to identify clear, structural behavior. Many of the tools commonly used for this purpose technical indicators, chart heuristics, or even sophisticated predictive models leave important questions unanswered. Technical indicators depend on platform-specific rules, and predictive systems typically offer little in terms of explanation. In settings that demand transparency or auditability, this poses a significant challenge. We introduce the Stock Pattern Assistant (SPA), a deterministic framework designed to extract monotonic price runs, attach relevant public events through a symmetric correlation window, and generate explanations that are factual, historical, and guardrailed. SPA relies only on daily OHLCV data and a normalized event stream, making the pipeline straight-forward to audit and easy to reproduce. To illustrate SPA's behavior in practice, we evaluate it across four equities-AAPL, NVDA, SCHW, and PGR-chosen to span a range of volatility regimes and sector characteristics. Although the evaluation period is modest, the results demonstrate how SPA consistently produces stable structural decompositions and contextual narratives. Ablation experiments further show how deterministic segmentation, event alignment, and constrained explanation each contribute to interpretability. SPA is not a forecasting system, nor is it intended to produce trading signals. Its value lies in offering a transparent, reproducible view of historical price structure that can complement analyst workflows, risk reviews, and broader explainable-AI pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damian Hodel, Jevin D. West</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) raises concerns of knowledge collapse, i.e., a reduction to the most dominant and central set of ideas. Prior work has demonstrated single-model collapse, defined as performance decay in an AI model trained on its own output. Inspired by ecology, we ask whether AI ecosystem diversity, that is, diversity among models, can mitigate such a collapse. We build on the single-model approach but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. To study the effect of diversity on model performance, we segment the training data across language models and evaluate the resulting ecosystems over ten, self-training iterations. We find that increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but, interestingly, only up to an optimal level. Our results suggest that an ecosystem containing only a few diverse models fails to express the rich mixture of the full, true distribution, resulting in rapid performance decay. Yet distributing the data across too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity on the true distribution, leading to poor performance already in the first iteration step. In the context of AI monoculture, our results suggest the need to monitor diversity across AI systems and to develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxiao Gao, Haotian Sun, Na Li, Dale Schuurmans, Bo Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world applications with large state and action spaces, reinforcement learning (RL) typically employs function approximations to represent core components like the policies, value functions, and dynamics models. Although powerful approximations such as neural networks offer great expressiveness, they often present theoretical ambiguities, suffer from optimization instability and exploration difficulty, and incur substantial computational costs in practice. In this paper, we introduce the perspective of spectral representations as a solution to address these difficulties in RL. Stemming from the spectral decomposition of the transition operator, this framework yields an effective abstraction of the system dynamics for subsequent policy optimization while also providing a clear theoretical characterization. We reveal how to construct spectral representations for transition operators that possess latent variable structures or energy-based structures, which implies different learning methods to extract spectral representations from data. Notably, each of these learning methods realizes an effective RL algorithm under this framework. We also provably extend this spectral view to partially observable MDPs. Finally, we validate these algorithms on over 20 challenging tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, where they achieve performances comparable or superior to current state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijiang Yan, Yixiang Huang, Jianhua Pei, Hina Tabassum, Luca Chiaraviglio</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth in wireless infrastructure has increased the need to accurately estimate and forecast electromagnetic field (EMF) levels to ensure ongoing compliance, assess potential health impacts, and support efficient network planning. While existing studies rely on univariate forecasting of wideband aggregate EMF data, frequency-selective multivariate forecasting is needed to capture the inter-operator and inter-frequency variations essential for proactive network planning. To this end, this paper introduces EMFusion, a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework that integrates diverse contextual factors (e.g., time of day, season, and holidays) while providing explicit uncertainty estimates. The proposed architecture features a residual U-Net backbone enhanced by a cross-attention mechanism that dynamically integrates external conditions to guide the generation process. Furthermore, EMFusion integrates an imputation-based sampling strategy that treats forecasting as a structural inpainting task, ensuring temporal coherence even with irregular measurements. Unlike standard point forecasters, EMFusion generates calibrated probabilistic prediction intervals directly from the learned conditional distribution, providing explicit uncertainty quantification essential for trustworthy decision-making. Numerical experiments conducted on frequency-selective EMF datasets demonstrate that EMFusion with the contextual information of working hours outperforms the baseline models with or without conditions. The EMFusion outperforms the best baseline by 23.85% in continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), 13.93% in normalized root mean square error, and reduces prediction CRPS error by 22.47%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debu Sinha</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain susceptible to hallucinations despite grounding in retrieved evidence. Current detection methods rely on semantic similarity and natural language inference (NLI), but their fundamental limitations have not been rigorously characterized. We apply conformal prediction to hallucination detection, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees that enable precise quantification of detection capabilities. Using calibration sets of approximately 600 examples, we achieve 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions). However, on three real hallucination benchmarks spanning multiple LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Llama-2, Mistral), embedding-based methods - including state-of-the-art OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoder models - exhibit unacceptable false positive rates: 100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, and 50% on WikiBio. Crucially, GPT-4 as an LLM judge achieves only 7% FPR (95% CI: [3.4%, 13.7%]) on the same data, proving the task is solvable through reasoning. We term this the "semantic illusion": semantically plausible hallucinations preserve similarity to source documents while introducing factual errors invisible to embeddings. This limitation persists across embedding architectures, LLM generators, and task types, suggesting embedding-based detection is insufficient for production RAG deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanfu Gao, Zebin He, Jun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing feature engineering methods based on large language models (LLMs) have not yet been applied to multi-label learning tasks. They lack the ability to model complex label dependencies and are not specifically adapted to the characteristics of multi-label tasks. To address the above issues, we propose Feature Engineering Automation for Multi-Label Learning (FEAML), an automated feature engineering method for multi-label classification which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs. By utilizing metadata and label co-occurrence matrices, LLMs are guided to understand the relationships between data features and task objectives, based on which high-quality features are generated. The newly generated features are evaluated in terms of model accuracy to assess their effectiveness, while Pearson correlation coefficients are used to detect redundancy. FEAML further incorporates the evaluation results as feedback to drive LLMs to continuously optimize code generation in subsequent iterations. By integrating LLMs with a feedback mechanism, FEAML realizes an efficient, interpretable and self-improving feature engineering paradigm. Empirical results on various multi-label datasets demonstrate that our FEAML outperforms other feature engineering methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Li, Haixu Wu, Zeyi Xu, Tuur Stuyck, Wojciech Matusik</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based methods have made significant progress in physics simulation, typically approximating dynamics with a monolithic end-to-end optimized neural network. Although these models offer an effective way to simulation, they may lose essential features compared to traditional numerical simulators, such as physical interpretability and reliability. Drawing inspiration from classical simulators that operate in a modular fashion, this paper presents Neural Modular Physics (NMP) for elastic simulation, which combines the approximation capacity of neural networks with the physical reliability of traditional simulators. Beyond the previous monolithic learning paradigm, NMP enables direct supervision of intermediate quantities and physical constraints by decomposing elastic dynamics into physically meaningful neural modules connected through intermediate physical quantities. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, our method transforms the numerical computation flow into a modular neural simulator, achieving improved physical consistency and generalizability. Experimentally, NMP demonstrates superior generalization to unseen initial conditions and resolutions, stable long-horizon simulation, better preservation of physical properties compared to other neural simulators, and greater feasibility in scenarios with unknown underlying dynamics than traditional simulators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjin Mi, Huiqiang Lun, Changhong Mou, Yeyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Operator learning has become a powerful tool for accelerating the solution of parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling rapid prediction of full spatiotemporal fields for new initial conditions or forcing functions. Existing architectures such as DeepONet and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) show strong empirical performance but often require large training datasets, lack explicit physical structure, and may suffer from instability in their trunk-network features, where mode imbalance or collapse can hinder accurate operator approximation. Motivated by the stability and locality of classical partition-of-unity (PoU) methods, we investigate PoU-based regularization techniques for operator learning and develop a revised formulation of the existing POU--PI--DeepONet framework. The resulting \emph{P}hysics-\emph{i}nformed \emph{P}artition \emph{P}enalty Deep Operator Network (PIP$^{2}$ Net) introduces a simplified and more principled partition penalty that improved the coordinated trunk outputs that leads to more expressiveness without sacrificing the flexibility of DeepONet. We evaluate PIP$^{2}$ Net on three nonlinear PDEs: the viscous Burgers equation, the Allen--Cahn equation, and a diffusion--reaction system. The results show that it consistently outperforms DeepONet, PI-DeepONet, and POU-DeepONet in prediction accuracy and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianglin Wu, Chiheb Ben Hammouda, Cornelis W. Oosterlee</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by fractional Brownian motion (fBm) are increasingly used to model systems with rough dynamics and long-range dependence, such as those arising in quantitative finance and reliability engineering. However, these processes are non-Markovian and lack a semimartingale structure, rendering many classical parameter estimation techniques inapplicable or computationally intractable beyond very specific cases. This work investigates two central questions: (i) whether integrating path signatures into deep learning architectures can improve the trade-off between estimation accuracy and model complexity, and (ii) what constitutes an effective architecture for leveraging signatures as feature maps. We introduce SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), a neural architecture that integrates path signatures with multi-head self-attention, supported by a convolutional preprocessing layer and a multilayer perceptron for effective feature encoding. SigMA learns model parameters from synthetically generated paths of fBm-driven SDEs, including fractional Brownian motion, fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and rough Heston models, with a particular focus on estimating the Hurst parameter and on joint multi-parameter inference, and it generalizes robustly to unseen trajectories. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and two real-world datasets (i.e., equity-index realized volatility and Li-ion battery degradation) show that SigMA consistently outperforms CNN, LSTM, vanilla Transformer, and Deep Signature baselines in accuracy, robustness, and model compactness. These results demonstrate that combining signature transforms with attention-based architectures provides an effective and scalable framework for parameter inference in stochastic systems with rough or persistent temporal structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunwoo Kim, Soo Yong Lee, Kyungho Kim, Hyunjin Hwang, Jaemin Yoo, Kijung Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised node representation learning aims to obtain meaningful node embeddings without relying on node labels. To achieve this, graph convolution, which aggregates information from neighboring nodes, is commonly employed to encode node features and graph topology. However, excessive reliance on graph convolution can be suboptimal-especially in non-homophilic graphs-since it may yield unduly similar embeddings for nodes that differ in their features or topological properties. As a result, adjusting the degree of graph convolution usage has been actively explored in supervised learning settings, whereas such approaches remain underexplored in unsupervised scenarios. To tackle this, we propose FUEL, which adaptively learns the adequate degree of graph convolution usage by aiming to enhance intra-class similarity and inter-class separability in the embedding space. Since classes are unknown, FUEL leverages node features to identify node clusters and treats these clusters as proxies for classes. Through extensive experiments using 15 baseline methods and 14 benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FUEL in downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across graphs with diverse levels of homophily.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Ghodsi</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequence modeling has produced diverse architectures -- from classical recurrent neural networks to modern Transformers and state space models (SSMs) -- yet a unified theoretical understanding of expressivity and trainability trade-offs remains limited. We introduce a unified framework that represents a broad class of sequence maps via an input-dependent effective interaction operator $W_{ij}(X)$, making explicit two recurring construction patterns: (i) the Unified Factorized Framework (Explicit) (attention-style mixing), in which $W_{ij}(X)$ varies through scalar coefficients applied to shared value maps, and (ii) Structured Dynamics (Implicit) (state-space recurrences), in which $W_{ij}$ is induced by a latent dynamical system. Using this framework, we derive three theoretical results. First, we establish the Interaction Rank Gap: models in the Unified Factorized Framework, such as single-head attention, are constrained to a low-dimensional operator span and cannot represent certain structured dynamical maps. Second, we prove an Equivalence (Head-Count) Theorem showing that, within our multi-head factorized class, representing a linear SSM whose lag operators span a $k$-dimensional subspace on length-$n$ sequences requires and is achievable with $H=k$ heads. Third, we prove a Gradient Highway Result, showing that attention layers admit inputs with distance-independent gradient paths, whereas stable linear dynamics exhibit distance-dependent gradient attenuation. Together, these results formalize a fundamental trade-off between algebraic expressivity (interaction/operator span) and long-range gradient propagation, providing theoretical grounding for modern sequence architecture design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runze Li, Hanchen Wang, Wenjie Zhang, Binghao Li, Yu Zhang, Xuemin Lin, Ying Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series imputation is fundamental in applications such as healthcare, traffic forecasting, and biological modeling, where sensor failures and irregular sampling lead to pervasive missing values. However, existing Transformer- and diffusion-based models lack explicit inductive biases and frequency awareness, limiting their generalization under structured missing patterns and distribution shifts. We propose FADTI, a diffusion-based framework that injects frequency-informed feature modulation via a learnable Fourier Bias Projection (FBP) module and combines it with temporal modeling through self-attention and gated convolution. FBP supports multiple spectral bases, enabling adaptive encoding of both stationary and non-stationary patterns. This design injects frequency-domain inductive bias into the generative imputation process. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including a newly introduced biological time series dataset, show that FADTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under high missing rates.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqing Xie, Jiayu Chen, Wenhao Tang, Ya Zhang, Chao Yu, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning, especially in multi-objective environments. In this work, we propose Multi-Objective Reward Shaping with Exploration (MORSE), a general framework that automatically combines multiple human-designed heuristic rewards into a unified reward function. MORSE formulates the shaping process as a bi-level optimization problem: the inner loop trains a policy to maximize the current shaped reward, while the outer loop updates the reward function to optimize task performance. To encourage exploration in the reward space and avoid suboptimal local minima, MORSE introduces stochasticity into the shaping process, injecting noise guided by task performance and the prediction error of a fixed, randomly initialized neural network. Experimental results in MuJoCo and Isaac Sim environments show that MORSE effectively balances multiple objectives across various robotic tasks, achieving task performance comparable to those obtained with manually tuned reward functions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models deployed on edge devices are increasingly used in safety-critical applications. However, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses significant risks, especially in Federated Learning (FL) settings where identical models are distributed across thousands of clients. While adversarial training is a strong defense, it is difficult to apply in FL due to strict client-data privacy constraints and the limited compute available on edge devices. In this work, we introduce TrajSyn, a privacy-preserving framework that enables effective server-side adversarial training by synthesizing a proxy dataset from the trajectories of client model updates, without accessing raw client data. We show that TrajSyn consistently improves adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks with no extra compute burden on the client device.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Mueller, Andrew Lee, Shruti Joshi, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Dhanya Sridhar, Patrik Reizinger</p>
<p>Abstract: A central goal of interpretability is to recover representations of causally relevant concepts from the activations of neural networks. The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roland Baatz</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines the generalization performance and interpretability of machine learning (ML) models used for predicting crop yield and yield anomalies in Germany's NUTS-3 regions. Using a high-quality, long-term dataset, the study systematically compares the evaluation and temporal validation behavior of ensemble tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN).
  While all models perform well on spatially split, conventional test sets, their performance degrades substantially on temporally independent validation years, revealing persistent limitations in generalization. Notably, models with strong test-set accuracy, but weak temporal validation performance can still produce seemingly credible SHAP feature importance values. This exposes a critical vulnerability in post hoc explainability methods: interpretability may appear reliable even when the underlying model fails to generalize.
  These findings underscore the need for validation-aware interpretation of ML predictions in agricultural and environmental systems. Feature importance should not be accepted at face value unless models are explicitly shown to generalize to unseen temporal and spatial conditions. The study advocates for domain-aware validation, hybrid modeling strategies, and more rigorous scrutiny of explainability methods in data-driven agriculture. Ultimately, this work addresses a growing challenge in environmental data science: how can we evaluate generalization robustly enough to trust model explanations?</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Monta\~na-Fern\'andez, Ines Ortega-Fernandez</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning is a machine learning setting that reduces direct data exposure, improving the privacy guarantees of machine learning models. Yet, the exchange of model updates between the participants and the aggregator can still leak sensitive information. In this work, we present a new gradient-based membership inference attack for federated learning scenarios that exploits the temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple federated rounds. Our method uses the shadow technique to learn round-wise gradient patterns of the training records, requiring no access to the private dataset, and is designed to consider both semi-honest and malicious adversaries (aggregators or data owners). Beyond membership inference, we also provide a natural extension of the proposed attack to discrete attribute inference by contrasting gradient responses under alternative attribute hypotheses. The proposed attacks are model-agnostic, and therefore applicable to any gradient-based model and can be applied to both classification and regression settings. We evaluate the attack on CIFAR-100 and Purchase100 datasets for membership inference and on Breast Cancer Wisconsin for attribute inference. Our findings reveal strong attack performance and comparable computational and memory overhead in membership inference when compared to another attack from the literature. The obtained results emphasize that multi-round federated learning can increase the vulnerability to inference attacks, that aggregators pose a more substantial threat than data owners, and that attack performance is strongly influenced by the nature of the training dataset, with richer, high-dimensional data leading to stronger leakage than simpler tabular data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengguang Ou, Yixin Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) often converge slowly and struggle to recover high-frequency details due to spectral bias. While prior work links this behavior to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), how specific architectural choices affect NTK conditioning remains unclear. We show that many INR mechanisms can be understood through their impact on a small set of pairwise similarity factors and scaling terms that jointly determine NTK eigenvalue variance. For standard coordinate MLPs, limited input-feature interactions induce large eigenvalue dispersion and poor conditioning. We derive closed-form variance decompositions for common INR components and show that positional encoding reshapes input similarity, spherical normalization reduces variance via layerwise scaling, and Hadamard modulation introduces additional similarity factors strictly below one, yielding multiplicative variance reduction. This unified view explains how diverse INR architectures mitigate spectral bias by improving NTK conditioning. Experiments across multiple tasks confirm the predicted variance reductions and demonstrate faster, more stable convergence with improved reconstruction quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zicong Cheng, Guo-Wei Yang, Jia Li, Zhijie Deng, Meng-Hao Guo, Shi-Min Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiency, as a critical practical challenge for LLM-driven agentic and reasoning systems, is increasingly constrained by the inherent latency of autoregressive (AR) decoding. Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x. Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at https://czc726.github.io/DEER/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liyu Zhang, Yejia Liu, Kwun Ho Liu, Runxi Huang, Xiaomin Ouyang</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world IoT applications, sensor data is usually collected under diverse and dynamic contextual conditions where factors such as sensor placements or ambient environments can significantly affect data patterns and downstream performance. Traditional domain adaptation or generalization methods often ignore such context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective in handling unseen context shifts after deployment. In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts. Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show that Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices.</p>

<p>Abstract: The adsorption energy serves as a crucial descriptor for the large-scale screening of catalysts. Nevertheless, the limited distribution of training data for the extensively utilised machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), predominantly sourced from near-equilibrium structures, results in unreliable adsorption structures and consequent adsorption energy predictions. In this context, we present DBCata, a deep generative model that integrates a periodic Brownian-bridge framework with an equivariant graph neural network to establish a low-dimensional transition manifold between unrelaxed and DFT-relaxed structures, without requiring explicit energy or force information. Upon training, DBCata effectively generates high-fidelity adsorption geometries, achieving an interatomic distance mean absolute error (DMAE) of 0.035 \text{\AA} on the Catalysis-Hub dataset, which is nearly three times superior to that of the current state-of-the-art machine learning potential models. Moreover, the corresponding DFT accuracy can be improved within 0.1 eV in 94\% of instances by identifying and refining anomalous predictions through a hybrid chemical-heuristic and self-supervised outlier detection approach. We demonstrate that the remarkable performance of DBCata facilitates accelerated high-throughput computational screening for efficient alloy catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction, highlighting the potential of DBCata as a powerful tool for catalyst design and optimisation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youssef Ghallab, Omar Iraqy, Mohamed Kandil, Mohamed Ashraf, Saadeldine Eletter, Morougue Ghazal, Ayman Khalafallah, Nagwa El-Makky</p>
<p>Abstract: Physiological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) provide complementary insights into human health and cognition, yet multi-modal integration is challenging due to limited multi-modal labeled data, and modality-specific differences . In this work, we adapt the CBraMod encoder for large-scale self-supervised ECG pretraining, introducing a dual-masking strategy to capture intra- and inter-lead dependencies. To overcome the above challenges, we utilize a pre-trained CBraMod encoder for EEG and pre-train a symmetric ECG encoder, equipping each modality with a rich foundational representation. These representations are then fused via simple embedding concatenation, allowing the classification head to learn cross-modal interactions, together enabling effective downstream learning despite limited multi-modal supervision. Evaluated on emotion recognition, our approach achieves near state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that carefully designed physiological encoders, even with straightforward fusion, substantially improve downstream performance. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model approaches to harness the holistic nature of physiological signals, enabling scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable solutions for healthcare and affective computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiyan Xue, Xuming Ran, Yaxin Li, Qi Xu, Enhui Li, Yi Xu, Qiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse neural systems are gaining traction for efficient continual learning due to their modularity and low interference. Architectures such as Sparse Distributed Memory Multi-Layer Perceptrons (SDMLP) construct task-specific subnetworks via Top-K activation and have shown resilience against catastrophic forgetting. However, their rigid modularity limits cross-task knowledge reuse and leads to performance degradation under high sparsity. We propose Selective Subnetwork Distillation (SSD), a structurally guided continual learning framework that treats distillation not as a regularizer but as a topology-aligned information conduit. SSD identifies neurons with high activation frequency and selectively distills knowledge within previous Top-K subnetworks and output logits, without requiring replay or task labels. This enables structural realignment while preserving sparse modularity. Experiments on Split CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST demonstrate that SSD improves accuracy, retention, and representation coverage, offering a structurally grounded solution for sparse continual learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern representation learning increasingly relies on unsupervised and self-supervised methods trained on large-scale unlabeled data. While these approaches achieve impressive generalization across tasks and domains, evaluating embedding quality without labels remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose Persistence, a topology-aware metric based on persistent homology that quantifies the geometric structure and topological richness of embedding spaces in a fully unsupervised manner. Unlike metrics that assume linear separability or rely on covariance structure, Persistence captures global and multi-scale organization. Empirical results across diverse domains show that Persistence consistently achieves top-tier correlations with downstream performance, outperforming existing unsupervised metrics and enabling reliable model and hyperparameter selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siva Sai, Ishika Goyal, Shubham Sharma, Sri Harshita Manuri, Vinay Chamola, Rajkumar Buyya</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing number of cyber threats and rapidly evolving tactics, as well as the high volume of data in recent years, have caused classical machine learning, rules, and signature-based defence strategies to fail, rendering them unable to keep up. An alternative, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), has recently emerged, making use of computations based on quantum mechanics. It offers better encoding and processing of high-dimensional structures for certain problems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of QML techniques relevant to the domain of security, such as Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs), Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs), and Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs), and discusses the contributions of this paper in relation to existing research in the field and how it improves over them. It also maps these methods across supervised, unsupervised, and generative learning paradigms, and to core cybersecurity tasks, including intrusion and anomaly detection, malware and botnet classification, and encrypted-traffic analytics. It also discusses their application in the domain of cloud computing security, where QML can enhance secure and scalable operations. Many limitations of QML in the domain of cybersecurity have also been discussed, along with the directions for addressing them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxiang Zhang, Tongxi Qu, Zhong Li, Tian Zhang, Jun Pang, Sjouke Mauw</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely deployed with quantization techniques to reduce memory and computational costs by lowering the numerical precision of their parameters. While quantization alters model parameters and their outputs, existing privacy analyses primarily focus on full-precision models, leaving a gap in understanding how bit-width reduction can affect privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of the privacy-utility relationship in post-training quantization (PTQ), a versatile family of methods that can be applied to pretrained models without further training. Using membership inference attacks as our evaluation framework, we analyze three popular PTQ algorithms-AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC-across multiple precision levels (4-bit, 2-bit, and 1.58-bit) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Our findings consistently show that low-precision PTQs can reduce privacy leakage. In particular, lower-precision models demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability compared to their full-precision counterparts, albeit at the cost of decreased utility. Additional ablation studies on the 1.58-bit quantization level show that quantizing only the last layer at higher precision enables fine-grained control over the privacy-utility trade-off. These results offer actionable insights for practitioners to balance efficiency, utility, and privacy protection in real-world deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroyoshi Nagahama, Katsufumi Inoue, Masayoshi Todorokihara, Michifumi Yoshioka</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive maintenance of rotating machinery increasingly relies on vibration signals, yet most learning-based approaches either discard phase during spectral feature extraction or use raw time-waveforms without explicitly leveraging phase information. This paper introduces two phase-aware preprocessing strategies to address random phase variations in multi-axis vibration data: (1) three-axis independent phase adjustment that aligns each axis individually to zero phase (2) single-axis reference phase adjustment that preserves inter-axis relationships by applying uniform time shifts. Using a newly constructed rotor dataset acquired with a synchronized three-axis sensor, we evaluate six deep learning architectures under a two-stage learning framework. Results demonstrate architecture-independent improvements: the three-axis independent method achieves consistent gains (+2.7\% for Transformer), while the single-axis reference approach delivers superior performance with up to 96.2\% accuracy (+5.4\%) by preserving spatial phase relationships. These findings establish both phase alignment strategies as practical and scalable enhancements for predictive maintenance systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honey Singh Chauhan, Zahraa S. Abdallah</p>
<p>Abstract: Kernel-based methods such as Rocket are among the most effective default approaches for univariate time series classification (TSC), yet they do not perform equally well across all datasets. We revisit the long-standing intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and show that selectively fusing them can yield consistent improvements over Rocket on specific, systematically identifiable kinds of datasets. We introduce Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations. To understand when fusion helps, we cluster UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features capturing series length, spectral structure, roughness, and class imbalance, and treat these clusters as interpretable data-structure regimes. Our analysis shows that fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. To support these findings, we combine three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics across datasets, ablation studies isolating the roles of individual representations, and attribution via SHAP to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains. Sample-level case studies further reveal the underlying mechanism: fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors, with adaptive increases in frequency-domain weighting precisely where corrections occur. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the 113 UCR datasets, F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence and accompanied by clearly identifiable failure cases. Our results show that selectively applied fusion provides dependable and interpretable extension to strong kernel-based methods, correcting their weaknesses precisely where the data support it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Oelhaf, Mehran Pashaei, Georg Kordowich, Christian Bergler, Andreas Maier, Johann J\"ager, Siming Bayer</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable and distributed generation is transforming power systems and challenging conventional protection schemes that rely on fixed settings and local measurements. Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for centralized fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL), enabling faster and more adaptive decision-making. However, practical deployment critically depends on robustness. Protection algorithms must remain reliable even when confronted with missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data. This work introduces a unified framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of ML models in power system protection.
  High-fidelity EMT simulations are used to model realistic degradation scenarios, including sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and transient communication losses. The framework provides a consistent methodology for benchmarking models, quantifying the impact of limited observability, and identifying critical measurement channels required for resilient operation. Results show that FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%. These findings offer actionable guidance for robustness-aware design of future ML-assisted protection systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfei Ma, Wee Sun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: At the boundary between the known and the unknown, an agent inevitably confronts the dilemma of whether to explore or to exploit. Epistemic uncertainty reflects such boundaries, representing systematic uncertainty due to limited knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, $\texttt{EUBRL}$, which leverages epistemic guidance to achieve principled exploration. This guidance adaptively reduces per-step regret arising from estimation errors. We establish nearly minimax-optimal regret and sample complexity guarantees for a class of sufficiently expressive priors in infinite-horizon discounted MDPs. Empirically, we evaluate $\texttt{EUBRL}$ on tasks characterized by sparse rewards, long horizons, and stochasticity. Results demonstrate that $\texttt{EUBRL}$ achieves superior sample efficiency, scalability, and consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeonwoo Cha, Semin Kim, Jinhyeon Kwon, Seunghoon Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Any-to-any generation seeks to translate between arbitrary subsets of modalities, enabling flexible cross-modal synthesis. Despite recent success, existing flow-based approaches are challenged by their inefficiency, as they require large-scale datasets often with restrictive pairing constraints, incur high computational cost from modeling joint distribution, and rely on complex multi-stage training. We propose FlowBind, an efficient framework for any-to-any generation. Our approach is distinguished by its simplicity: it learns a shared latent space capturing cross-modal information, with modality-specific invertible flows bridging this latent to each modality. Both components are optimized jointly under a single flow-matching objective, and at inference the invertible flows act as encoders and decoders for direct translation across modalities. By factorizing interactions through the shared latent, FlowBind naturally leverages arbitrary subsets of modalities for training, and achieves competitive generation quality while substantially reducing data requirements and computational cost. Experiments on text, image, and audio demonstrate that FlowBind attains comparable quality while requiring up to 6x fewer parameters and training 10x faster than prior methods.

<p>Abstract: Random matrix theory has played an important role in various areas of pure mathematics, mathematical physics, and machine learning. From a practical perspective of data science, input data are usually normalized prior to processing. Thus, this study investigates the statistical properties of min-max normalized eigenvalues in random matrices. Previously, the effective distribution for such normalized eigenvalues has been proposed. In this study, we apply it to evaluate a scaling law of the cumulative distribution. Furthermore, we derive the residual error that arises during matrix factorization of random matrices. We conducted numerical experiments to verify these theoretical predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanxi Zhou, Wencan Mao, Manabu Tsukada, John C. S. Lui, Yusheng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) evolve along distinct paths but converge in the design of Dyna-Q [1]. However, modern RL methods still struggle with effective transferability across tasks and scenarios. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a generalized algorithm, Feature Model-Based Enhanced Actor-Critic (FM-EAC), that integrates planning, acting, and learning for multi-task control in dynamic environments. FM-EAC combines the strengths of MBRL and MFRL and improves generalizability through the use of novel feature-based models and an enhanced actor-critic framework. Simulations in both urban and agricultural applications demonstrate that FM-EAC consistently outperforms many state-of-the-art MBRL and MFRL methods. More importantly, different sub-networks can be customized within FM-EAC according to user-specific requirements.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15439">Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Akihiro Kubo, Paavo Parmas, Shin Ishii</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) reduces the cost of real-environment sampling by generating synthetic trajectories (called rollouts) from a learned dynamics model. However, choosing the length of the rollouts poses two dilemmas: (1) Longer rollouts better preserve on-policy training but amplify model bias, indicating the need for an intermediate horizon to mitigate distribution shift (i.e., the gap between on-policy and past off-policy samples). (2) Moreover, a longer model rollout may reduce value estimation bias but raise the variance of policy gradients due to backpropagation through multiple steps, implying another intermediate horizon for stable gradient estimates. However, these two optimal horizons may differ. To resolve this conflict, we propose Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO), which divides the rollout procedure into a long "distribution rollout" (DR) and a short "training rollout" (TR). The DR generates on-policy state samples for mitigating distribution shift. In contrast, the short TR leverages differentiable transitions to offer accurate value gradient estimation with stable gradient updates, thereby requiring fewer updates and reducing overall runtime. We demonstrate that the double-horizon approach effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, and surpasses existing MBRL methods on continuous-control benchmarks in terms of both sample efficiency and runtime.</p>

The current works explores the potential of chain-of-thought and task instruction prompting in reducing copyrighted content generation. To this end, we present a formulation that combines these two techniques with two other copyright mitigation strategies: a) negative prompting, and b) prompt re-writing. We study the generated images in terms their similarity to a copyrighted image and their relevance of the user input. We present numerical experiments on a variety of models and provide insights on the effectiveness of the aforementioned techniques for varying model complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangrui Xu, Zhize Li, Yufei Han, Bin Wang, Jiqiang Liu, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) pose a significant threat to Federated Learning (FL) systems by enabling adversaries to infer sensitive training data from local clients. Despite extensive research, the question of how to characterize and assess the risk of DRAs in FL systems remains unresolved due to the lack of a theoretically-grounded risk quantification framework. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to quantify the maximum achievable effectiveness of DRAs for a given data instance and FL model. We derive a tight and computable upper bound for InvLoss and explore its implications from three perspectives. First, we show that DRA risk is governed by the spectral properties of the Jacobian matrix of exchanged model updates or feature embeddings, providing a unified explanation for the effectiveness of defense methods. Second, we develop InvRE, an InvLoss-based DRA risk estimator that offers attack method-agnostic, comprehensive risk evaluation across data instances and model architectures. Third, we propose two adaptive noise perturbation defenses that enhance FL privacy without harming classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate our framework, demonstrating its potential for systematic DRA risk evaluation and mitigation in FL systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ioannis Kalogeropoulos, Giorgos Bouritsas, Yannis Panagakis</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings, e.g. as decision support systems in various societal sectors or in critical infrastructure, designers and auditors are facing the need to ensure that models satisfy a wider variety of requirements (e.g. compliance with regulations, fairness, computational constraints) beyond performance. Although most of them are the subject of ongoing studies, typical approaches face critical challenges: post-processing methods tend to compromise performance, which is often counteracted by fine-tuning or, worse, training from scratch, an often time-consuming or even unavailable strategy. This raises the following question: "Can we efficiently edit models to satisfy requirements, without sacrificing their utility?" In this work, we approach this with a unifying framework, in a data-driven manner, i.e. we learn to edit neural networks (NNs), where the editor is an NN itself - a graph metanetwork - and editing amounts to a single inference step. In particular, the metanetwork is trained on NN populations to minimise an objective consisting of two terms: the requirement to be enforced and the preservation of the NN's utility. We experiment with diverse tasks (the data minimisation principle, bias mitigation and weight pruning) improving the trade-offs between performance, requirement satisfaction and time efficiency compared to popular post-processing or re-training alternatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Torresi, Pascal Friederich</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) are combining recent technological advances in robotics, automation, and machine learning based data analysis and decision-making to perform autonomous experimentation toward human-directed goals without requiring any direct human intervention. SDLs are successfully used in materials science, chemistry, and beyond, to optimise processes, materials, and devices in a systematic and data-efficient way. At present, the most widely used algorithm to identify the most informative next experiment is Bayesian optimisation. While relatively simple to apply to a wide range of optimisation problems, standard Bayesian optimisation relies on a fixed experimental workflow with a clear set of optimisation parameters and one or more measurable objective functions. This excludes the possibility of making on-the-fly decisions about changes in the planned sequence of operations and including intermediate measurements in the decision-making process. Therefore, many real-world experiments need to be adapted and simplified to be converted to the common setting in self-driving labs. In this paper, we introduce an extension to Bayesian optimisation that allows flexible sampling of multi-stage workflows and makes optimal decisions based on intermediate observables, which we call proxy measurements. We systematically compare the advantage of taking into account proxy measurements over conventional Bayesian optimisation, in which only the final measurement is observed. We find that over a wide range of scenarios, proxy measurements yield a substantial improvement, both in the time to find good solutions and in the overall optimality of found solutions. This not only paves the way to use more complex and thus more realistic experimental workflows in autonomous labs but also to smoothly combine simulations and experiments in the next generation of SDLs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Equivariance is a powerful prior for learning physical dynamics, yet exact group equivariance can degrade performance if the symmetries are broken. We propose object-centric world models built with geometric algebra neural networks, providing a soft geometric inductive bias. Our models are evaluated using simulated environments of 2d rigid body dynamics with static obstacles, where we train for next-step predictions autoregressively. For long-horizon rollouts we show that the soft inductive bias of our models results in better performance in terms of physical fidelity compared to non-equivariant baseline models. The approach complements recent soft-equivariance ideas and aligns with the view that simple, well-chosen priors can yield robust generalization. These results suggest that geometric algebra offers an effective middle ground between hand-crafted physics and unstructured deep nets, delivering sample-efficient dynamics models for multi-object scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taichi Aida, Mamoru Komachi, Toshinobu Ogiso, Hiroya Takamura, Daichi Mochihashi</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the temporal evolution of sets of vectors is a fundamental challenge across various domains, including ecology, crime analysis, and linguistics. For instance, ecosystem structures evolve due to interactions among plants, herbivores, and carnivores; the spatial distribution of crimes shifts in response to societal changes; and word embedding vectors reflect cultural and semantic trends over time. However, analyzing such time-varying sets of vectors is challenging due to their complicated structures, which also evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling the distribution underlying each set of vectors using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes. By approximating the latent function in the Gaussian process with Random Fourier Features, we obtain compact and comparable vector representations over time. This enables us to track and visualize temporal transitions of vector sets in a low-dimensional space. We apply our method to both sociological data (crime distributions) and linguistic data (word embeddings), demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics. Our results show that the proposed approach provides interpretable and robust representations, offering a powerful framework for analyzing structural changes in temporally indexed vector sets across diverse domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Cai, Yanyong Huang, Jinyuan Chang, Dongjie Wang, Tianrui Li, Xiaoyi Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature and instance co-selection, which aims to reduce both feature dimensionality and sample size by identifying the most informative features and instances, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, when dealing with unlabeled incomplete multi-view data, where some samples are missing in certain views, existing methods typically first impute the missing data and then concatenate all views into a single dataset for subsequent co-selection. Such a strategy treats co-selection and missing data imputation as two independent processes, overlooking potential interactions between them. The inter-sample relationships gleaned from co-selection can aid imputation, which in turn enhances co-selection performance. Additionally, simply merging multi-view data fails to capture the complementary information among views, ultimately limiting co-selection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel co-selection method, termed Joint learning of Unsupervised multI-view feature and instance Co-selection with cross-viEw imputation (JUICE). JUICE first reconstructs incomplete multi-view data using available observations, bringing missing data recovery and feature and instance co-selection together in a unified framework. Then, JUICE leverages cross-view neighborhood information to learn inter-sample relationships and further refine the imputation of missing values during reconstruction. This enables the selection of more representative features and instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JUICE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion language models are structurally well-suited for iterative error correction, as their non-causal denoising dynamics allow arbitrary positions in a sequence to be revised. However, standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training fails to reliably induce this behavior, as models often cannot identify unreliable tokens in a complete input, rendering confidence-guided refinement ineffective. We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB), a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and controlled settings demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs in correction scenarios, while also improving pure completion performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Dussolle, Pietro Li\`o</p>
<p>Abstract: Going from pure Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to a learnable graph message-passing mechanism at each layer has been foundational to state-of-the-art results, despite the computational trade-off (e.g. GATs or Transformers). To go a step further, in this work, we introduce N-simplicial attention, going from pairwise token similarity to higher-order interactions, and adapt it for Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). To help manage the increased complexity, we propose a cost-effective simplex selection enabling the model to focus its computation load onto the more task-sensitive interactions. Beyond these core mechanisms, we study how smoothing N-simplicial attention is by deriving a Lipschitz upper-bound and by demonstrating that by itself it also suffers from over-smoothing, despite opening the attention message-passing to higher-order interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathieu Blondel, Michael E. Sander, Germain Vivier-Ardisson, Tianlin Liu, Vincent Roulet</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) currently constitute the dominant paradigm for large language models (LLMs). Energy-based models (EBMs) represent another class of models, which have historically been less prevalent in LLM development, yet naturally characterize the optimal policy in post-training alignment. In this paper, we provide a unified view of these two model classes. Taking the chain rule of probability as a starting point, we establish an explicit bijection between ARMs and EBMs in function space, which we show to correspond to a special case of the soft Bellman equation in maximum entropy reinforcement learning. Building upon this bijection, we derive the equivalence between supervised learning of ARMs and EBMs. Furthermore, we analyze the distillation of EBMs into ARMs by providing theoretical error bounds. Our results provide insights into the ability of ARMs to plan ahead, despite being based on the next-token prediction paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinshun Feng, Mingzhe Liu, Yi Qiao, Tongyu Zhu, Leilei Sun, Shuai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in explainable recommendations have explored the integration of language models to analyze natural language rationales for user-item interactions. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on ID-based representations that obscure semantic meaning and impose structural constraints on language models, thereby limiting their applicability in open-ended scenarios. These challenges are intensified by the complex nature of real-world interactions, where diverse user intents are entangled and collaborative signals rarely align with linguistic semantics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BEAT, a unified and transferable framework that tokenizes user and item behaviors into discrete, interpretable sequences. We construct a behavior vocabulary via a vector-quantized autoencoding process that disentangles macro-level interests and micro-level intentions from graph-based representations. We then introduce multi-level semantic supervision to bridge the gap between behavioral signals and language space. A semantic alignment regularization mechanism is designed to embed behavior tokens directly into the input space of frozen language models. Experiments on three public datasets show that BEAT improves zero-shot recommendation performance while generating coherent and informative explanations. Further analysis demonstrates that our behavior tokens capture fine-grained semantics and offer a plug-and-play interface for integrating complex behavior patterns into large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianze Luo, Haotian Yuan, Zhuang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The multi-step denoising process in diffusion and Flow Matching models causes major efficiency issues, which motivates research on few-step generation. We present Solution Flow Models (SoFlow), a framework for one-step generation from scratch. By analyzing the relationship between the velocity function and the solution function of the velocity ordinary differential equation (ODE), we propose a Flow Matching loss and a solution consistency loss to train our models. The Flow Matching loss allows our models to provide estimated velocity fields for Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) during training, which improves generation performance. Notably, our consistency loss does not require the calculation of the Jacobian-vector product (JVP), a common requirement in recent works that is not well-optimized in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. Experimental results indicate that, when trained from scratch using the same Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture and an equal number of training epochs, our models achieve better FID-50K scores than MeanFlow models on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oleg Melnikov, Yurii Dorofieiev, Yurii Shakhnovskiy, Huy Truong, Victoria Degeler</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework, for the detection, classification, and preliminary localization of anomalies in water distribution networks using multivariate statistical analysis. The approach, termed SICAMS (Statistical Identification and Classification of Anomalies in Mahalanobis Space), processes heterogeneous pressure and flow sensor data through a whitening transformation to eliminate spatial correlations among measurements. Based on the transformed data, the Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic is constructed, enabling the formulation of anomaly detection as a statistical hypothesis test of network conformity to normal operating conditions. It is shown that Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic can serve as an integral indicator of the overall "health" of the system, exhibiting correlation with total leakage volume, and thereby enabling approximate estimation of water losses via a regression model. A heuristic algorithm is developed to analyze the $T^2$ time series and classify detected anomalies into abrupt leaks, incipient leaks, and sensor malfunctions. Furthermore, a coarse leak localization method is proposed, which ranks sensors according to their statistical contribution and employs Laplacian interpolation to approximate the affected region within the network. Application of the proposed framework to the BattLeDIM L-Town benchmark dataset demonstrates high sensitivity and reliability in leak detection, maintaining robust performance even under multiple leaks. These capabilities make the method applicable to real-world operational environments without the need for a calibrated hydraulic model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenwen Liang, Sidi Lu, Wenhao Yu, Kishan Panaganti, Yujun Zhou, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become essential for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet current exploration mechanisms remain fundamentally misaligned with how these models actually learn. Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods. Analyzing the induced geometry, we find that G2RL expands exploration into substantially more orthogonal and often opposing gradient directions while maintaining semantic coherence, revealing that a policy own update space provides a far more faithful and effective basis for guiding exploration in large language model reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matin Mortaheb, Erciyes Karakaya, Sennur Ulukus</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic communication aims to transmit information most relevant to a task rather than raw data, offering significant gains in communication efficiency for applications such as telepresence, augmented reality, and remote sensing. Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information. This flexible and goal-driven design enables efficient semantic communication in complex and bandwidth-constrained environments.</p>

Gonzalez, Jingbo Shang, Alvin Cheung</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce FrontierCS, a benchmark of 156 open-ended problems across diverse areas of computer science, designed and reviewed by experts, including CS PhDs and top-tier competitive programming participants and problem setters. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on tasks with known optimal solutions, FrontierCS targets problems where the optimal solution is unknown, but the quality of a solution can be objectively evaluated. Models solve these tasks by implementing executable programs rather than outputting a direct answer. FrontierCS includes algorithmic problems, which are often NP-hard variants of competitive programming problems with objective partial scoring, and research problems with the same property. For each problem we provide an expert reference solution and an automatic evaluator. Combining open-ended design, measurable progress, and expert curation, FrontierCS provides a benchmark at the frontier of computer-science difficulty. Empirically, we find that frontier reasoning models still lag far behind human experts on both the algorithmic and research tracks, that increasing reasoning budgets alone does not close this gap, and that models often over-optimize for generating merely workable code instead of discovering high-quality algorithms and system designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kayode Olumoyin, Lamees El Naqa, Katarzyna Rejniak</p>
<p>Abstract: In a mathematical model of interacting biological organisms, where external interventions may alter behavior over time, traditional models that assume fixed parameters usually do not capture the evolving dynamics. In oncology, this is further exacerbated by the fact that experimental data are often sparse and sometimes are composed of a few time points of tumor volume. In this paper, we propose to learn time-varying interactions between cells, such as those of bladder cancer tumors and immune cells, and their response to a combination of anticancer treatments in a limited data scenario. We employ the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach to predict possible subpopulation trajectories at time points where no observed data are available. We demonstrate that our approach is consistent with the biological explanation of subpopulation trajectories. Our method provides a framework for learning evolving interactions among biological organisms when external interventions are applied to their environment.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper develops a nonlinear evolution framework for modelling survival dynamics on weighted economic networks by coupling a graph-based $p$-Laplacian diffusion operator with a stochastic structural drift. The resulting finite-dimensional PDE--SDE system captures how node-level survival reacts to nonlinear diffusion pressures while an aggregate complexity factor evolves according to an It\^o{} process. Using accretive operator theory, nonlinear semigroup methods, and stochastic analysis, we establish existence and uniqueness of mild solutions, derive topology-dependent energy dissipation inequalities, and characterise the stability threshold separating dissipative, critical, amplifying, and explosive regimes. Numerical experiments on Barab\'asi--Albert networks confirm that hub dominance magnifies nonlinear gradients and compresses stability margins, producing heavy-tailed survival distributions and occasional explosive behaviour.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustapha Hamdi (InnoDeep)</p>
<p>Abstract: Current deep learning approaches for physiological signal monitoring suffer from static topologies and constant energy consumption. We introduce SGEMAS (Self-Growing Ephemeral Multi-Agent System), a bio-inspired architecture that treats intelligence as a dynamic thermodynamic process. By coupling a structural plasticity mechanism (agent birth death) to a variational free energy objective, the system naturally evolves to minimize prediction error with extreme sparsity. An ablation study on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database reveals that adding a multi-scale instability index to the agent dynamics significantly improves performance. In a challenging inter-patient, zero-shot setting, the final SGEMAS v3.3 model achieves a mean AUC of 0.570 +- 0.070, outperforming both its simpler variants and a standard autoencoder baseline. This result validates that a physics-based, energy-constrained model can achieve robust unsupervised anomaly detection, offering a promising direction for efficient biomedical AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahil Rajesh Dhayalkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring "VSA-likeness" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Chen, Venkatesh Ganapati Hegde</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploration is essential to improve long-term recommendation quality, but it often degrades short-term business performance, especially in remote-first TV environments where users engage passively, expect instant relevance, and offer few chances for correction. This paper introduces an approach for delivering content-level exploration safely and efficiently by optimizing its placement based on reach and opportunity cost. Deployed on a large-scale streaming platform with over 100 million monthly active users, our approach identifies scroll-depth regions with lower engagement and strategically introduces a dedicated container, the "Something Completely Different" row containing randomized content. Rather than enforcing exploration uniformly across the user interface (UI), we condition its appearance on empirically low-cost, high-reach positions to ensure minimal tradeoff against platform-level watch time goals. Extensive A/B testing shows that this strategy preserves business metrics while collecting unbiased interaction data. Our method complements existing intra-row diversification and bandit-based exploration techniques by introducing a deployable, behaviorally informed mechanism for surfacing exploratory content at scale. Moreover, we demonstrate that the collected unbiased data, integrated into downstream candidate generation, significantly improves user engagement, validating its value for recommender systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) enhance modularity and telemetry granularity but also widen the cybersecurity attack surface across disaggregated control, user and management planes. We propose a hierarchical defense framework with three coordinated layers-anomaly detection, intrusion confirmation, and multiattack classification-each aligned with O-RAN's telemetry stack. Our approach integrates hybrid quantum computing and machine learning, leveraging amplitude- and entanglement-based feature encodings with deep and ensemble classifiers. We conduct extensive benchmarking across synthetic and real-world telemetry, evaluating encoding depth, architectural variants, and diagnostic fidelity. The framework consistently achieves near-perfect accuracy, high recall, and strong class separability. Multi-faceted evaluation across decision boundaries, probabilistic margins, and latent space geometry confirms its interpretability, robustness, and readiness for slice-aware diagnostics and scalable deployment in near-RT and non-RT RIC domains.</p>

Finally, we will compute the node p-Laplacian centrality of the line graph which is equivalent to the edge p-Laplacian of the air traffic network. In this paper, the novel un-normalized graph (p-) Laplacian based ranking method will be developed based on the un-normalized graph p-Laplacian operator definitions such as the curvature operator of graph (i.e. the un-normalized graph 1-Laplacian operator) and will be used to compute the node p-Laplacian centrality of the line graph.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Ball</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern AI systems lack a way to express and enforce requirements. Pre-training produces intelligence, and post-training optimizes preferences, but neither guarantees that models reliably satisfy explicit, context-dependent constraints. This missing abstraction explains why highly intelligent models routinely fail in deployment despite strong benchmark performance.
  We introduce Capability Engineering, the systematic practice of converting requirements into executable specifications and training models to satisfy them by default. We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.
  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent). By replacing per-example annotation with reusable specifications, CAPE reduces costs by 5 to 20 times and shortens timelines from months to weeks.
  We release the CAPE protocol, PredicateGraph schema, CPL specification language, and policy packs under Apache 2.0. We also launch CapabilityBench, a public registry of model evaluations against community-contributed policies, shifting evaluation from intelligence benchmarks toward capability measurement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong results on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), but most benchmarks assume complete knowledge graphs (KGs) where direct supporting triples exist. This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) contain tissue information distributed across multiple magnification levels, yet most self-supervised methods treat these scales as independent views. This separation prevents models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes, a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows. This study introduces Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD), a self-supervised strategy that links low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail, enabling the model to learn how coarse tissue structure relates to fine cellular patterns. The resulting foundation model, MAD-NP, is trained entirely through this cross-scale correspondence without annotations. A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning. Segmentation outputs remain consistent across magnifications, preserving anatomical boundaries and minimizing noise. These results highlight the feasibility of scalable, magnification-robust WSI analysis using a unified embedding space</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Ackermann, Simeon Emanuilov</p>
<p>Abstract: OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.
  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.
  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.
  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Advait Gosai, Tyler Vuong, Utkarsh Tyagi, Steven Li, Wenjia You, Miheer Bavare, Arda U\c{c}ar, Zhongwang Fang, Brian Jang, Bing Liu, Yunzhong He</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems are increasingly replacing cascaded pipelines for voice-based human-AI interaction, processing raw audio directly without intermediate transcription. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these models on synthetic speech and single-turn tasks, leaving realistic multi-turn conversational ability underexplored. We introduce Audio MultiChallenge, an open-source benchmark to evaluate E2E spoken dialogue systems under natural multi-turn interaction patterns. Building on the text-based MultiChallenge framework, which evaluates Inference Memory, Instruction Retention, and Self Coherence, we introduce a new axis Voice Editing that tests robustness to mid-utterance speech repairs and backtracking. We further augment each axis to the audio modality, such as introducing Audio-Cue challenges for Inference Memory that require recalling ambient sounds and paralinguistic signals beyond semantic content. We curate 452 conversations from 47 speakers with 1,712 instance-specific rubrics through a hybrid audio-native agentic and human-in-the-loop pipeline that exposes model failures at scale while preserving natural disfluencies found in unscripted human speech. Our evaluation of proprietary and open-source models reveals that even frontier models struggle on our benchmark, with Gemini 3 Pro Preview (Thinking), our highest-performing model achieving a 54.65% pass rate. Error analysis shows that models fail most often on our new axes and that Self Coherence degrades with longer audio context. These failures reflect difficulty of tracking edits, audio cues, and long-range context in natural spoken dialogue. Audio MultiChallenge provides a reproducible testbed to quantify them and drive improvements in audio-native multi-turn interaction capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George-Andrei Dima, Dumitru-Clementin Cercel</p>
<p>Abstract: Focusing on low-resource languages is an essential step toward democratizing generative AI. In this work, we contribute to reducing the multimodal NLP resource gap for Romanian. We translate the widely known Flickr30k dataset into Romanian and further extend it for visual question answering by leveraging open-source LLMs. We demonstrate the usefulness of our datasets by fine-tuning open-source VLMs on Romanian visual question answering. We select VLMs from three widely used model families: LLaMA 3.2, LLaVA 1.6, and Qwen2. For fine-tuning, we employ the parameter-efficient LoRA method. Our models show improved Romanian capabilities in visual QA, as well as on tasks they were not trained on, such as Romanian image description generation. The seven-billion-parameter Qwen2-VL-RoVQA obtains top scores on both tasks, with improvements of +6.05% and +2.61% in BERTScore F1 over its original version. Finally, the models show substantial reductions in grammatical errors compared to their original forms, indicating improvements not only in language understanding but also in Romanian fluency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul J. Weiser, Jiye Kim, Jongho Lee, Amirmohammad Shamaei, Gulnur Ungan, Malte Hoffmann, Antoine Klauser, Berkin Bilgic, Ovidiu C. Andronesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) maps endogenous brain metabolism while suppressing the overwhelming water signal. Water-unsuppressed MRSI (wu-MRSI) allows simultaneous imaging of water and metabolites, but large water sidebands cause challenges for metabolic fitting. We developed an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline to overcome these challenges at ultra-high field. Methods:Fast high-resolution wu-MRSI was acquired at 7T with non-cartesian ECCENTRIC sampling and ultra-short echo time. A water and lipid removal network (WALINET+) was developed to remove lipids, water signal, and sidebands. MRSI reconstruction was performed by DeepER and a physics-informed network for metabolite fitting. Water signal was used for absolute metabolite quantification, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and myelin water fraction imaging (MWF). Results: WALINET+ provided the lowest NRMSE (< 2%) in simulations and in vivo the smallest bias (< 20%) and limits-of-agreement (+-63%) between wu-MRSI and ws-MRSI scans. Several metabolites such as creatine and glutamate showed higher SNR in wu-MRSI. QSM and MWF obtained from wu-MRSI and GRE showed good agreement with 0 ppm/5.5% bias and +-0.05 ppm/ +- 12.75% limits-of-agreement. Conclusion: High-quality metabolic, QSM, and MWF mapping of the human brain can be obtained simultaneously by ECCENTRIC wu-MRSI at 7T with 2 mm isotropic resolution in 12 min. WALINET+ robustly removes water sidebands while preserving metabolite signal, eliminating the need for water suppression and separate water acquisitions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nnamdi Philip Okonkwo, Lubna Luxmi Dhirani</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC) enable cloud governance, risk and compliance by providing insights visibility and control. Cloud SOC triages high-volume, heterogeneous telemetry from elastic, short-lived resources while staying within tight budgets. In this research, we implement an AI-Augmented Security Operations Center (AISOC) on AWS that combines cloud-native instrumentation with ML-based detection. The architecture uses three Amazon EC2 instances: Attacker, Defender, and Monitoring. We simulate a reverse-shell intrusion with Metasploit, and Filebeat forwards Defender logs to an Elasticsearch and Kibana stack for analysis. We train two classifiers, a malware detector built on a public dataset and a log-anomaly detector trained on synthetically augmented logs that include adversarial variants. We calibrate and fuse the scores to produce multi-modal threat intelligence and triage activity into NORMAL, SUSPICIOUS, and HIGH\_CONFIDENCE\_ATTACK. On held-out tests the fusion achieves strong macro-F1 (up to 1.00) under controlled conditions, though performance will vary in noisier and more diverse environments. These results indicate that simple, calibrated fusion can enhance cloud SOC capabilities in constrained, cost-sensitive setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Conor Rowan, Kai Hampleman, Kurt Maute, Alireza Doostan</p>
<p>Abstract: Since their advent nearly a decade ago, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been studied extensively as a novel technique for solving forward and inverse problems in physics and engineering. The neural network discretization of the solution field is naturally adaptive and avoids meshing the computational domain, which can both improve the accuracy of the numerical solution and streamline implementation. However, there have been limited studies of PINNs on complex three-dimensional geometries, as the lack of mesh and the reliance on the strong form of the partial differential equation (PDE) make boundary condition (BC) enforcement challenging. Techniques to enforce BCs with PINNs have proliferated in the literature, but a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of these techniques and a study of their efficacy on geometrically complex three-dimensional test problems are lacking. In this work, we i) systematically compare BC enforcement techniques for PINNs, ii) propose a general solution framework for arbitrary three-dimensional geometries, and iii) verify the methodology on three-dimensional, linear and nonlinear test problems with combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundaries. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying PDE, the geometry of the computational domain, and the nature of the BCs, while requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning. This work represents a step in the direction of establishing PINNs as a mature numerical method, capable of competing head-to-head with incumbents such as the finite element method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reusing KV cache is essential for high efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems. With more LLM users, the KV cache footprint can easily exceed GPU memory capacity, so prior work has proposed to either evict KV cache to lower-tier storage devices, or compress KV cache so that more KV cache can be fit in the fast memory. However, prior work misses an important opportunity: jointly optimizing the eviction and compression decisions across all KV caches to minimize average generation latency without hurting quality.
  We propose EVICPRESS, a KV-cache management system that applies lossy compression and adaptive eviction to KV cache across multiple storage tiers. Specifically, for each KV cache of a context, EVICPRESS considers the effect of compression and eviction of the KV cache on the average generation quality and delay across all contexts as a whole. To achieve this, EVICPRESS proposes a unified utility function that quantifies the effect of quality and delay of the lossy compression or eviction. To this end, EVICPRESS's profiling module periodically updates the utility function scores on all possible eviction-compression configurations for all contexts and places KV caches using a fast heuristic to rearrange KV caches on all storage tiers, with the goal of maximizing the utility function scores on each storage tier. Compared to the baselines that evict KV cache or compress KV cache, EVICPRESS achieves higher KV-cache hit rates on fast devices, i.e., lower delay, while preserving high generation quality by applying conservative compression to contexts that are sensitive to compression errors. Evaluation on 12 datasets and 5 models demonstrates that EVICPRESS achieves up to 2.19x faster time-to-first-token (TTFT) at equivalent generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Buu Phan, Ashish Khisti, Karen Ullrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Computing next-token likelihood ratios between two language models (LMs) is a standard task in training paradigms such as knowledge distillation. Since this requires both models to share the same probability space, it becomes challenging when the teacher and student LMs use different tokenizers, for instance, when edge-device deployment necessitates a smaller vocabulary size to lower memory overhead. In this work, we address this vocabulary misalignment problem by uncovering an implicit recursive structure in the commonly deployed Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm and utilizing it to create a probabilistic framework for cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring. Our method enables sequence likelihood evaluation for vocabularies different from the teacher model native tokenizer, addressing two specific scenarios: when the student vocabulary is a subset of the teacher vocabulary, and the general case where it is arbitrary. In the subset regime, our framework computes exact likelihoods and provides next-token probabilities for sequential sampling with only O(1) model evaluations per token. When used for distillation, this yields up to a 12% reduction in memory footprint for the Qwen2.5-1.5B model while also improving baseline performance up to 4% on the evaluated tasks. For the general case, we introduce a rigorous lossless procedure that leverages BPE recursive structure, complemented by a fast approximation that keeps large-vocabulary settings practical. Applied to distillation for mathematical reasoning, our approach improves GSM8K accuracy by more than 2% over the current state of the art.</p>

However, this increased connectivity introduces critical vulnerabilities, making vehicles susceptible to cyber-attacks such Denial-ofService (DoS) and message spoofing. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based intrusion detection system to classify malicious Controller Area network (CAN) bus traffic using the CiCIoV2024 benchmark dataset. We analyzed various attack patterns including DoS and spoofing attacks targeting critical vehicle parameters such as Spoofing-GAS - gas pedal position, Spoofing-RPM, Spoofing-Speed, and Spoofing-Steering\_Wheel. Our initial findings confirm a multi-class classification problem with a clear structural difference between attack types and benign data, providing a strong foundation for machine learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehil B Shah, Mohammad Masudur Rahman, Foutse Khomh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their wide adoption in various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, software engineering), Deep Learning (DL)-based applications suffer from many bugs, failures, and vulnerabilities. Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Kakhandiki, Sathya Chitturi, Daniel Ratner, Sean Gasiorowski</p>
<p>Abstract: The discovery of a minimum energy pathway (MEP) between metastable states is crucial for scientific tasks including catalyst and biomolecular design. However, the standard nudged elastic band (NEB) algorithm requires hundreds to tens of thousands of compute-intensive simulations, making applications to complex systems prohibitively expensive. We introduce Neural Network Bayesian Algorithm Execution (NN-BAX), a framework that jointly learns the energy landscape and the MEP. NN-BAX sequentially fine-tunes a foundation model by actively selecting samples targeted at improving the MEP. Tested on Lennard-Jones and Embedded Atom Method systems, our approach achieves a one to two order of magnitude reduction in energy and force evaluations with negligible loss in MEP accuracy and demonstrates scalability to >100-dimensional systems. This work is therefore a promising step towards removing the computational barrier for MEP discovery in scientifically relevant systems, suggesting that weeks-long calculations may be achieved in hours or days with minimal loss in accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sogol Masoumzadeh, Yufei Li, Shane McIntosh, D\'aniel Varr\'o, Lili Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring issue tracker submissions is a crucial software maintenance activity. A key goal is the prioritization of high risk, security-related bugs. If such bugs can be recognized early, the risk of propagation to dependent products and endangerment of stakeholder benefits can be mitigated. To assist triage engineers with this task, several automatic detection techniques, from Machine Learning (ML) models to prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), have been proposed. Although promising to some extent, prior techniques often memorize lexical cues as decision shortcuts, yielding low detection rate specifically for more complex submissions. As such, these classifiers do not yet reach the practical expectations of a real-time detector of security-related issues. To address these limitations, we propose SEBERTIS, a framework to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as classifiers independent of lexical cues, so that they can confidently detect fully unseen security-related issues. SEBERTIS capitalizes on fine-tuning bidirectional transformer architectures as Masked Language Models (MLMs) on a series of semantically equivalent vocabulary to prediction labels (which we call Semantic Surrogates) when they have been replaced with a mask. Our SEBERTIS-trained classifier achieves a 0.9880 F1-score in detecting security-related issues of a curated corpus of 10,000 GitHub issue reports, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art issue classifiers, with 14.44%-96.98%, 15.40%-93.07%, and 14.90%-94.72% higher detection precision, recall, and F1-score over ML-based baselines. Our classifier also substantially surpasses LLM baselines, with an improvement of 23.20%-63.71%, 36.68%-85.63%, and 39.49%-74.53% for precision, recall, and F1-score.</p>

<p>Abstract: The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from stochastic chat interfaces to reliable software components necessitates a fundamental re-engineering of interaction paradigms. Current methodologies, predominantly heuristic-based "prompt engineering," fail to provide the deterministic guarantees required for mission-critical applications. We introduce the Meta-Prompting Protocol, a rigorous theoretical framework that formalizes the orchestration of LLMs as a programmable, self-optimizing system. Central to this protocol is the Adversarial Trinity, a tripartite topology comprising a Generator (P), an Auditor (A), and an Optimizer (O). By treating natural language instructions as differentiable variables within a semantic computation graph and utilizing textual critiques as gradients, this architecture mitigates hallucination and prevents model collapse. We demonstrate the theoretical viability of this approach using declarative programming paradigms (DSPy) and automatic textual differentiation (TextGrad), establishing a foundation for "Observable Software Engineering" in the era of probabilistic computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Beniwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term price forecasting remains a formidable challenge due to the inherent uncertainty over the long term, despite some success in short-term predictions. Nonetheless, accurate long-term forecasts are essential for high-net-worth individuals, institutional investors, and traders. The proposed improved genetic algorithm-optimized support vector regression (IGA-SVR) model is specifically designed for long-term price prediction of global indices. The performance of the IGA-SVR model is rigorously evaluated and compared against the state-of-the-art baseline models, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the forward-validating genetic algorithm optimized support vector regression (OGA-SVR). Extensive testing was conducted on the five global indices, namely Nifty, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), DAX Performance Index (DAX), Nikkei 225 (N225), and Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSE) from 2021 to 2024 of daily price prediction up to a year. Overall, the proposed IGA-SVR model achieved a reduction in MAPE by 19.87% compared to LSTM and 50.03% compared to OGA-SVR, demonstrating its superior performance in long-term daily price forecasting of global indices. Further, the execution time for LSTM was approximately 20 times higher than that of IGA-SVR, highlighting the high accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed model. The genetic algorithm selects the optimal hyperparameters of SVR by minimizing the arithmetic mean of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) calculated over the full training dataset and the most recent five years of training data. This purposefully designed training methodology adjusts for recent trends while retaining long-term trend information, thereby offering enhanced generalization compared to the LSTM and rolling-forward validation approach employed by OGA-SVR, which forgets long-term trends and suffers from recency bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ameet Gadekar, Aristides Gionis, Thibault Marette</p>
<p>Abstract: Data analysis often involves an iterative process, where solutions must be continuously refined in response to new data. Typically, as new data becomes available, an existing solution must be updated to incorporate the latest information. In addition to seeking a high-quality solution for the task at hand, it is also crucial to ensure consistency by minimizing drastic changes from previous solutions. Applying this approach across many iterations, ensures that the solution evolves gradually and smoothly.
  In this paper, we study the above problem in the context of clustering, specifically focusing on the $k$-center problem. More precisely, we study the following problem: Given a set of points $X$, parameters $k$ and $b$, and a prior clustering solution $H$ for $X$, our goal is to compute a new solution $C$ for $X$, consisting of $k$ centers, which minimizes the clustering cost while introducing at most $b$ changes from $H$. We refer to this problem as label-consistent $k$-center, and we propose two constant-factor approximation algorithms for it. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods on real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuinan Hou, Jing Mi, Marco Zorzi, Lamberto Ballan, Alberto Testolin</p>
<p>Abstract: Counting the number of items in a visual scene remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.</p>

We follow a standard approach to this problem and assume that each object has an unobserved strength and that the outcome of each comparison depends probabilistically on the strengths of the comparands. However, we do not assume to know a priori how skills affect outcomes. Instead, we present an efficient algorithm for simultaneously inferring both the unobserved strengths and the function that maps strengths to probabilities. Despite this problem being under-constrained, we present experimental evidence that the conclusions of our Bayesian approach are robust to different model specifications.

<p>Abstract: We present LLMQ, an end-to-end CUDA/C++ implementation for medium-sized language-model training, e.g. 3B to 32B parameters, on affordable, commodity GPUs. These devices are characterized by low memory availability and slow communication compared to datacentre-grade GPUs. Consequently, we showcase a range of optimizations that target these bottlenecks, including activation checkpointing, offloading, and copy-engine based collectives. LLMQ is able to train or fine-tune a 7B model on a single 16GB mid-range gaming card, or a 32B model on a workstation equipped with 4 RTX 4090s. This is achieved while executing a standard 8-bit training pipeline, without additional algorithmic approximations, and maintaining FLOP utilization of around 50%. The efficiency of LLMQ rivals that of production-scale systems on much more expensive cloud-grade GPUs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yann Bourdin, Pierrick Legrand, Fanny Roche</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has become a standard approach for the modeling of audio effects, yet strictly black-box modeling remains problematic for time-varying systems. Unlike time-invariant effects, training models on devices with internal modulation typically requires the recording or extraction of control signals to ensure the time-alignment required by standard loss functions. This paper introduces a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to model such effects using only input-output audio recordings, removing the need for modulation signal extraction. We propose a convolutional-recurrent architecture trained via a two-stage strategy: an initial adversarial phase allows the model to learn the distribution of the modulation behavior without strict phase constraints, followed by a supervised fine-tuning phase where a State Prediction Network (SPN) estimates the initial internal states required to synchronize the model with the target. Additionally, a new objective metric based on chirp-train signals is developed to quantify modulation accuracy. Experiments modeling a vintage hardware phaser demonstrate the method's ability to capture time-varying dynamics in a fully black-box context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiran Ge, Chenyi Huang, Yuang Ai, Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a powerful technique for aligning generative models, but its effectiveness is bottlenecked by the conflict between large group sizes and prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikel Williams-Lekuona, Georgina Cosma</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformers in vision-language models apply uniform computational effort across all images, expending 175.33 GFLOPs (ViT-L/14) whether analysing a straightforward product photograph or a complex street scene. We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% practical speedup while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Amir, Manon Flageat, Amanda Prorok</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of machine learning for real-world robotic systems has created a new form of intellectual property: the trained policy. This raises a critical need for novel methods that verify ownership and detect unauthorized, possibly unsafe misuse. While watermarking is established in other domains, physical policies present a unique challenge: remote detection. Existing methods assume access to the robot's internal state, but auditors are often limited to external observations (e.g., video footage). This ``Physical Observation Gap'' means the watermark must be detected from signals that are noisy, asynchronous, and filtered by unknown system dynamics. We formalize this challenge using the concept of a \textit{glimpse sequence}, and introduce Colored Noise Coherency (CoNoCo), the first watermarking strategy designed for remote detection. CoNoCo embeds a spectral signal into the robot's motions by leveraging the policy's inherent stochasticity. To show it does not degrade performance, we prove CoNoCo preserves the marginal action distribution. Our experiments demonstrate strong, robust detection across various remote modalities, including motion capture and side-way/top-down video footage, in both simulated and real-world robot experiments. This work provides a necessary step toward protecting intellectual property in robotics, offering the first method for validating the provenance of physical policies non-invasively, using purely remote observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Peng, Yixuan Ye, Cheng Liu, Hangjun Che, Fei Wang, Zhiwen Yu, Si Wu, Hau-San Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view clustering has been empirically shown to improve learning performance by leveraging the inherent complementary information across multiple views of data. However, in real-world scenarios, collecting strictly aligned views is challenging, and learning from both aligned and unaligned data becomes a more practical solution. Partially View-aligned Clustering aims to learn correspondences between misaligned view samples to better exploit the potential consistency and complementarity across views, including both aligned and unaligned data. However, most existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture the shared semantics among samples from the same cluster. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of multi-view data induces distributional shifts in representations, leading to inaccuracies in establishing meaningful correspondences between cross-view latent features and, consequently, impairing learning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model (SMART) for PVC. The main idea of our approach is to alleviate the influence of cross-view distributional shifts, thereby facilitating semantic matching contrastive learning to fully exploit semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches on the PVC problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantinos Kalogiannis, Ahmed Mohamed Hussain, Hexu Li, Panos Papadimitratos</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicular platooning promises transformative improvements in transportation efficiency and safety through the coordination of multi-vehicle formations enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. However, the distributed nature of platoon coordination creates security vulnerabilities, allowing authenticated vehicles to inject falsified kinematic data, compromise operational stability, and pose a threat to passenger safety. Traditional misbehaviour detection approaches, which rely on plausibility checks and statistical methods, suffer from high False Positive (FP) rates and cannot capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-vehicle coordination dynamics. We present Attention In Motion (AIMformer), a transformer-based framework specifically tailored for real-time misbehaviour detection in vehicular platoons with edge deployment capabilities. AIMformer leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations. It incorporates global positional encoding with vehicle-specific temporal offsets to handle join/exit maneuvers. We propose a Precision-Focused (BCE) loss function that penalizes FPs to meet the requirements of safety-critical vehicular systems. Extensive evaluation across 4 platoon controllers, multiple attack vectors, and diverse mobility scenarios demonstrates superior performance ($\geq$ 0.93) compared to state-of-the-art baseline architectures. A comprehensive deployment analysis utilizing TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and TensorRT achieves sub-millisecond inference latency, making it suitable for real-time operation on resource-constrained edge platforms. Hence, validating AIMformer is viable for both in-vehicle and roadside infrastructure deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guillermo Rodriguez-Llorente, Galo Gallardo, Rodrigo Morant Navascu\'es, Nikita Khvatkin Petrovsky, Anderson Sabogal, Roberto G\'omez-Espinosa Mart\'in</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of nuclear fusion requires materials that can withstand extreme conditions. The IFMIF-DONES facility, a high-power particle accelerator, is being designed to qualify these materials. A critical testbed for its development is the MuVacAS prototype, which replicates the final segment of the accelerator beamline. Precise regulation of argon gas pressure within its ultra-high vacuum chamber is vital for this task. This work presents a fully data-driven approach for autonomous pressure control. A Deep Learning Surrogate Model, trained on real operational data, emulates the dynamics of the argon injection system. This high-fidelity digital twin then serves as a fast-simulation environment to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent. The results demonstrate that the agent successfully learns a control policy that maintains gas pressure within strict operational limits despite dynamic disturbances. This approach marks a significant step toward the intelligent, autonomous control systems required for the demanding next-generation particle accelerator facilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ken O'Hanlon, Basil Woods, Lin Wang, Mark Sandler</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a conditioned UNet for Music Source Separation (MSS). MSS is generally performed by multi-output neural networks, typically UNets, with each output representing a particular stem from a predefined instrument vocabulary. In contrast, conditioned MSS networks accept an audio query related to a stem of interest alongside the signal from which that stem is to be extracted. Thus, a strict vocabulary is not required and this enables more realistic tasks in MSS. The potential of conditioned approaches for such tasks has been somewhat hidden due to a lack of suitable data, an issue recently addressed with the MoisesDb dataset. A recent method, Banquet, employs this dataset with promising results seen on larger vocabularies. Banquet uses Bandsplit RNN rather than a UNet and the authors state that UNets should not be suitable for conditioned MSS. We counter this argument and propose QSCNet, a novel conditioned UNet for MSS that integrates network conditioning elements in the Sparse Compressed Network for MSS. We find QSCNet to outperform Banquet by over 1dB SNR on a couple of MSS tasks, while using less than half the number of parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Photonics can offer a hardware-native route for machine learning (ML). However, efficient deployment of photonics-enhanced ML requires hybrid workflows that integrate optical processing with conventional CPU/GPU based neural network architectures. Here, we propose such a workflow that combines photonic positional embeddings (PEs) with advanced graph ML models. We introduce a photonics-based method that augments graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with PEs derived from light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices whose couplings match the input graph. We simulate propagation and readout to obtain internode intensity correlation matrices, which are used as PEs in GCNs to provide global structural information. Evaluated on Long Range Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, the method outperforms baseline GCNs with Laplacian based PEs, achieving $6.3\%$ lower mean absolute error for regression and $2.3\%$ higher average precision for classification tasks using a two-layer GCN as a baseline. When implemented in high repetition rate photonic hardware, correlation measurements can enable fast feature generation by bypassing digital simulation of PEs. Our results show that photonic PEs improve GCN performance and support optical acceleration of graph ML.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific "superintelligence". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Mishra, Karan Patil, Didier Stricker, Jason Rambach</p>
<p>Abstract: High-performance Radar-Camera 3D object detection can be achieved by leveraging knowledge distillation without using LiDAR at inference time. However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Couto, Jos\'e Mour\~ao, M\'ario A. T. Figueiredo, Pedro Ribeiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Near an optimal learning point of a neural network, the learning performance of gradient descent dynamics is dictated by the Hessian matrix of the loss function with respect to the network parameters. We characterize the Hessian eigenspectrum for some classes of teacher-student problems, when the teacher and student networks have matching weights, showing that the smaller eigenvalues of the Hessian determine long-time learning performance. For linear networks, we analytically establish that for large networks the spectrum asymptotically follows a convolution of a scaled chi-square distribution with a scaled Marchenko-Pastur distribution. We numerically analyse the Hessian spectrum for polynomial and other non-linear networks. Furthermore, we show that the rank of the Hessian matrix can be seen as an effective number of parameters for networks using polynomial activation functions. For a generic non-linear activation function, such as the error function, we empirically observe that the Hessian matrix is always full rank.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin C. Koenig, Sili Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries is strongly influenced by the state of charge (SOC). Existing predictive models typically infer scalar kinetic parameters at a full SOC or a few discrete SOC levels, preventing them from capturing the continuous SOC dependence that governs exothermic behavior during abuse conditions. To address this, we apply the Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Network (KA-CRNN) framework to learn continuous and realistic SOC-dependent exothermic cathode-electrolyte interactions. We apply a physics-encoded KA-CRNN to learn SOC-dependent kinetic parameters for cathode-electrolyte decomposition directly from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. A mechanistically informed reaction pathway is embedded into the network architecture, enabling the activation energies, pre-exponential factors, enthalpies, and related parameters to be represented as continuous and fully interpretable functions of the SOC. The framework is demonstrated for NCA, NM, and NMA cathodes, yielding models that reproduce DSC heat-release features across all SOCs and provide interpretable insight into SOC-dependent oxygen-release and phase-transformation mechanisms. This approach establishes a foundation for extending kinetic parameter dependencies to additional environmental and electrochemical variables, supporting more accurate and interpretable thermal-runaway prediction and monitoring.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are two dominant approaches. While PEFT methods are widely used for their computational efficiency, the implications of their configurations (e.g., rank) remain under-explored in downstream Q&A tasks and generalisation. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting. We demonstrate that LoRA achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to SFT, particularly on reasoning tasks at specific rank values. Additionally, we analyze the internal representations via spectral features and layer-wise attention structures, offering insights into representational drift and structural changes in attention patterns.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, requiring models to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A major obstacle in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where performance on earlier tasks degrades as new tasks are learned. In this paper, we introduce PPSEBM, a novel framework that integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS) to effectively address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for natural language processing tasks. In PPSEBM, progressive parameter selection allocates distinct, task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates representative pseudo-samples from prior tasks. These generated samples actively inform and guide the parameter selection process, enhancing the model's ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new tasks. Experimental results on diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that PPSEBM outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods, offering a promising and robust solution to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Demonstrating quantum advantage in machine learning tasks requires navigating a complex landscape of proposed models and algorithms. To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum. This perspective provides a conceptual map of this landscape, clarifying how different models relate to classical simulability and pointing to where opportunities for quantum advantage may lie.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) activations are notoriously difficult to understand, with most existing techniques using complex, specialized methods for interpreting them. Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer in order to address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions. We show that although applying style transfer on synthetic images degrades their quality with respect to the common FID metric, these images are surprisingly beneficial for model training. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the effects of both augmentations and their key hyperparameters on the performance of image classifiers. Our results demonstrate that stylization and synthetic data complement each other well and can be combined with popular rule-based data augmentation techniques such as TrivialAugment, while not working with others. Our method achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness on several small-scale image classification benchmarks, reaching 93.54%, 74.9% and 50.86% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and TinyImageNet-C, respectively</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor L\'eger, Florent Chatelain</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a widely used method for data integration, designed to extract latent components shared across paired high-dimensional datasets. Despite decades of practical success, a precise theoretical understanding of its behavior in high-dimensional regimes remains limited. In this paper, we study a data integration model in which two high-dimensional data matrices share a low-rank common latent structure while also containing individual-specific components. We analyze the singular vectors of the associated cross-covariance matrix using tools from random matrix theory and derive asymptotic characterizations of the alignment between estimated and true latent directions. These results provide a quantitative explanation of the reconstruction performance of the PLS variant based on Singular Value Decomposition (PLS-SVD) and identify regimes where the method exhibits counter-intuitive or limiting behavior. Building on this analysis, we compare PLS-SVD with principal component analysis applied separately to each dataset and show its asymptotic superiority in detecting the common latent subspace. Overall, our results offer a comprehensive theoretical understanding of high-dimensional PLS-SVD, clarifying both its advantages and fundamental limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Pai, Liam Achenbach, Victoriano Montesinos, Benedek Forrai, Oier Mees, Elvis Nava</p>
<p>Abstract: Prevailing Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) for robotic manipulation are built upon vision-language backbones pretrained on large-scale, but disconnected static web data. As a result, despite improved semantic generalization, the policy must implicitly infer complex physical dynamics and temporal dependencies solely from robot trajectories. This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce \model, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations. The decoder serves as an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM), generating low-level robot actions from the latent representation of video-space action plans. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, improving sample efficiency by 10x and convergence speed by 2x compared to traditional VLA architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuting Liu, Daniel Alexander, Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla, Behnaz Arzani, Vincent Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Early-Exit (EE) is a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that accelerates inference by allowing easier tokens to be generated using only a subset of the model's layers. However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the same time. Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable. DREX also efficiently handles the missing KV cache from skipped layers using memory-efficient state-copying. Our evaluation shows that DREX improves throughput by 2-12% compared to baseline approaches while maintaining output quality. Crucially, DREX completely eliminates involuntary exits, providing a key guarantee for preserving the output quality intended by the EE model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Huang, Dami Choi, Daniel D. Johnson, Sarah Schwettmann, Jacob Steinhardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpreting the internal activations of neural networks can produce more faithful explanations of their behavior, but is difficult due to the complex structure of activation space. Existing approaches to scalable interpretability use hand-designed agents that make and test hypotheses about how internal activations relate to external behavior. We propose to instead turn this task into an end-to-end training objective, by training interpretability assistants to accurately predict model behavior from activations through a communication bottleneck. Specifically, an encoder compresses activations to a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder reads this list and answers a natural language question about the model. We show how to pretrain this assistant on large unstructured data, then finetune it to answer questions. The resulting architecture, which we call a Predictive Concept Decoder, enjoys favorable scaling properties: the auto-interp score of the bottleneck concepts improves with data, as does the performance on downstream applications. Specifically, PCDs can detect jailbreaks, secret hints, and implanted latent concepts, and are able to accurately surface latent user attributes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuval Filmus, Steve Hanneke, Idan Mehalel, Shay Moran</p>
<p>Abstract: A classical result in online learning characterizes the optimal mistake bound achievable by deterministic learners using the Littlestone dimension (Littlestone '88). We prove an analogous result for randomized learners: we show that the optimal expected mistake bound in learning a class $\mathcal{H}$ equals its randomized Littlestone dimension, which is the largest $d$ for which there exists a tree shattered by $\mathcal{H}$ whose average depth is $2d$. We further study optimal mistake bounds in the agnostic case, as a function of the number of mistakes made by the best function in $\mathcal{H}$, denoted by $k$. We show that the optimal randomized mistake bound for learning a class with Littlestone dimension $d$ is $k + \Theta (\sqrt{k d} + d )$. This also implies an optimal deterministic mistake bound of $2k + \Theta(d) + O(\sqrt{k d})$, thus resolving an open question which was studied by Auer and Long ['99].
  As an application of our theory, we revisit the classical problem of prediction using expert advice: about 30 years ago Cesa-Bianchi, Freund, Haussler, Helmbold, Schapire and Warmuth studied prediction using expert advice, provided that the best among the $n$ experts makes at most $k$ mistakes, and asked what are the optimal mistake bounds. Cesa-Bianchi, Freund, Helmbold, and Warmuth ['93, '96] provided a nearly optimal bound for deterministic learners, and left the randomized case as an open problem. We resolve this question by providing an optimal learning rule in the randomized case, and showing that its expected mistake bound equals half of the deterministic bound of Cesa-Bianchi et al. ['93,'96], up to negligible additive terms. In contrast with previous works by Abernethy, Langford, and Warmuth ['06], and by Br\^anzei and Peres ['19], our result applies to all pairs $n,k$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngjae Min, Benjamin Wright, Jeremy Bernstein, Navid Azizan</p>
<p>Abstract: When machine learning models are trained continually on a sequence of tasks, they are often liable to forget what they learned on previous tasks--a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Proposed solutions to catastrophic forgetting tend to involve storing information about past tasks, meaning that memory usage is a chief consideration in determining their practicality. This paper develops a memory-efficient solution to catastrophic forgetting using the idea of matrix sketching, in the context of a simple continual learning algorithm known as orthogonal gradient descent (OGD). OGD finds weight updates that aim to preserve performance on prior datapoints, using gradients of the model on those datapoints. However, since the memory cost of storing prior model gradients grows with the runtime of the algorithm, OGD is ill-suited to continual learning over long time horizons. To address this problem, we propose SketchOGD. SketchOGD employs an online sketching algorithm to compress model gradients as they are encountered into a matrix of a fixed, user-determined size. In contrast to existing memory-efficient variants of OGD, SketchOGD runs online without the need for advance knowledge of the total number of tasks, is simple to implement, and is more amenable to analysis. We provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error of the relevant sketches under a novel metric suited to the downstream task of OGD. Experimentally, we find that SketchOGD tends to outperform current state-of-the-art variants of OGD given a fixed memory budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Lyu, Kaile Du, Yuyang Li, Hanyu Zhao, Fuyuan Hu, Zhang Zhang, Guangcan Liu, Liang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) task investigates effective domain adaptation under the scenario of continuous domain shifts during testing time. Due to the utilization of solely unlabeled samples, there exists significant uncertainty in model updates, leading CTTA to encounter severe error accumulation issues. In this paper, we introduce VCoTTA, a variational Bayesian approach to measure uncertainties in CTTA. At the source stage, we transform a pretrained deterministic model into a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) via a variational warm-up strategy, injecting uncertainties into the model. During the testing time, we employ a mean-teacher update strategy using variational inference for the student model and exponential moving average for the teacher model. Our novel approach updates the student model by combining priors from both the source and teacher models. The evidence lower bound is formulated as the cross-entropy between the student and teacher models, along with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the prior mixture. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in mitigating error accumulation within the CTTA framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Run He, Di Fang, Yizhu Chen, Kai Tong, Cen Chen, Yi Wang, Lap-pui Chau, Huiping Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning (CIL) without available historical training samples as exemplars. Compared with its exemplar-based CIL counterpart that stores exemplars, EFCIL suffers more from forgetting issues. Recently, a new EFCIL branch named Analytic Continual Learning (ACL) introduces a gradient-free paradigm via Recursive Least-Square, achieving a forgetting-resistant classifier training with a frozen backbone during CIL. However, existing ACL suffers from ineffective representations and insufficient utilization of backbone knowledge. In this paper, we propose a representation-enhanced analytic learning (REAL) to address these problems. To enhance the representation, REAL constructs a dual-stream base pretraining followed by representation enhancing distillation process. The dual-stream base pretraining combines self-supervised contrastive learning for general features and supervised learning for class-specific knowledge, followed by the representation enhancing distillation to merge both streams, enhancing representations for subsequent CIL paradigm. To utilize more knowledge from the backbone, REAL presents a feature fusion buffer to multi-layer backbone features, providing informative features for the subsequent classifier training. Our method can be incorporated into existing ACL techniques and provides more competitive performance. Empirical results demonstrate that, REAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks, outperforming exemplar-free methods and rivaling exemplar-based approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Thanks to their extensive capacity, over-parameterized neural networks exhibit superior predictive capabilities and generalization. However, having a large parameter space is considered one of the main suspects of the neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial example -- input samples crafted ad-hoc to induce a desired misclassification. Relevant literature has claimed contradictory remarks in support of and against the robustness of over-parameterized networks. These contradictory findings might be due to the failure of the attack employed to evaluate the networks' robustness. Previous research has demonstrated that depending on the considered model, the algorithm employed to generate adversarial examples may not function properly, leading to overestimating the model's robustness. In this work, we empirically study the robustness of over-parameterized networks against adversarial examples. However, unlike the previous works, we also evaluate the considered attack's reliability to support the results' veracity. Our results show that over-parameterized networks are robust against adversarial attacks as opposed to their under-parameterized counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaifu Wang, Efthymia Tsamoura, Dan Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: We study one of the most popular problems in **neurosymbolic learning** (NSL), that of learning neural classifiers given only the result of applying a symbolic component $\sigma$ to the gold labels of the elements of a vector $\mathbf x$. The gold labels of the elements in $\mathbf x$ are unknown to the learner. We make multiple contributions, theoretical and practical, to address a problem that has not been studied so far in this context, that of characterizing and mitigating *learning imbalances*, i.e., major differences in the errors that occur when classifying instances of different classes (aka **class-specific risks**). Our theoretical analysis reveals a unique phenomenon: that $\sigma$ can greatly impact learning imbalances. This result sharply contrasts with previous research on supervised and weakly supervised learning, which only studies learning imbalances under data imbalances. On the practical side, we introduce a technique for estimating the marginal of the hidden gold labels using weakly supervised data. Then, we introduce algorithms that mitigate imbalances at training and testing time by treating the marginal of the hidden labels as a constraint. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques using strong baselines from NSL and long-tailed learning, suggesting performance improvements of up to 14%.</p>

<p>Abstract: The use of machine learning and AI on electronic health records (EHRs) holds substantial potential for clinical insight. However, this approach faces challenges due to data heterogeneity, sparsity, temporal misalignment, and limited labeled outcomes. In this context, we leverage a linked EHR dataset of approximately one million de-identified individuals from Bristol, North Somerset, and South Gloucestershire, UK, to characterize urinary tract infections (UTIs). We implemented a data pre-processing and curation pipeline that transforms the raw EHR data into a structured format suitable for developing predictive models focused on data fairness, accountability and transparency. Given the limited availability and biases of ground truth UTI outcomes, we introduce a UTI risk estimation framework informed by clinical expertise to estimate UTI risk across individual patient timelines. Pairwise XGBoost models are trained using this framework to differentiate UTI risk categories with explainable AI techniques applied to identify key predictors and support interpretability. Our findings reveal differences in clinical and demographic predictors across risk groups. While this study highlights the potential of AI-driven insights to support UTI clinical decision-making, further investigation of patient sub-strata and extensive validation are needed to ensure robustness and applicability in clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arash Hajisafi, Maria Despoina Siampou, Bita Azarijoo, Zhen Xiong, Cyrus Shahabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical time series are often irregularly sampled, with varying sensor frequencies, missing observations, and misaligned timestamps. Prior approaches typically address these irregularities by interpolating data into regular sequences, thereby introducing bias, or by generating inconsistent and uninterpretable relationships across sensor measurements, complicating the accurate learning of both intra-series and inter-series dependencies. We introduce WaveGNN, a model that operates directly on irregular multivariate time series without interpolation or conversion to a regular representation. WaveGNN combines a decay-aware Transformer to capture intra-series dynamics with a sample-specific graph neural network that models both short-term and long-term inter-sensor relationships. Therefore, it generates a single, sparse, and interpretable graph per sample. Across multiple benchmark datasets (P12, P19, MIMIC-III, and PAM), WaveGNN delivers consistently strong performance, whereas other state-of-the-art baselines tend to perform well on some datasets or tasks but poorly on others. While WaveGNN does not necessarily surpass every method in every case, its consistency and robustness across diverse settings set it apart. Moreover, the learned graphs align well with known physiological structures, enhancing interpretability and supporting clinical decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mulugeta Weldezgina Asres, Christian Walter Omlin, The CMS-HCAL Collaboration</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting anomaly causality facilitates diagnostics once monitoring systems detect system faults. Identifying anomaly causes in large systems involves investigating a broader set of monitoring variables across multiple subsystems. However, learning graphical causal models (GCMs) comes with a significant computational burden that restrains the applicability of most existing methods in real-time and large-scale deployments. In addition, modern monitoring applications for large systems often generate large amounts of binary alarm flags, and the distinct characteristics of binary anomaly data -- the meaning of state transition and data sparsity -- challenge existing causality learning mechanisms. This study proposes an anomaly causal discovery approach (\textsc{AnomalyCD}), addressing the accuracy and computational challenges of generating GCMs from temporal binary flag datasets. The \textsc{AnomalyCD} presents several strategies, such as anomaly data-aware causality testing, sparse data and prior link compression, and edge pruning adjustment approaches. We validate the performance of of the approach on two datasets: monitoring sensor data of the readout-box system of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN, and a public data set for information technology monitoring. The results on temporal GCMs demonstrate a considerable reduction of computation overhead and a moderate enhancement of accuracy on the binary anomaly data sets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunyue Wei, Vincent Zhuang, Saraswati Soedarmadji, Yanan Sui</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization is an effective technique for black-box optimization, but its applicability is typically limited to low-dimensional and small-budget problems due to the cubic complexity of computing the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. While various approximate GP models have been employed to scale Bayesian optimization to larger sample sizes, most suffer from overly-smooth estimation and focus primarily on problems that allow for large online samples. In this work, we argue that Bayesian optimization algorithms with sparse GPs can more efficiently allocate their representational power to relevant regions of the search space. To achieve this, we propose focalized GP, which leverages a novel variational loss function to achieve stronger local prediction, as well as FocalBO, which hierarchically optimizes the focalized GP acquisition function over progressively smaller search spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that FocalBO can efficiently leverage large amounts of offline and online data to achieve state-of-the-art performance on robot morphology design and to control a 585-dimensional musculoskeletal system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathias Bellat, Jordy D. Orellana Figueroa, Jonathan S. Reeves, Ruhollah Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi, Claudio Tennie, Thomas Scholten</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in archaeology have increased significantly in recent years, and these now span all subfields, geographical regions, and time periods. The prevalence and success of these applications have remained largely unexamined, as recent reviews on the use of machine learning in archaeology have only focused only on specific subfields of archaeology. Our review examined an exhaustive corpus of 135 articles published between 1997 and 2022. We observed a significant increase in the number of publications from 2019 onwards. Automatic structure detection and artefact classification were the most represented tasks in the articles reviewed, followed by taphonomy, and archaeological predictive modelling. From the review, clustering and unsupervised methods were underrepresented compared to supervised models. Artificial neural networks and ensemble learning account for two thirds of the total number of models used. However, if machine learning models are gaining in popularity they remain subject to misunderstanding. We observed, in some cases, poorly defined requirements and caveats of the machine learning methods used. Furthermore, the goals and the needs of machine learning applications for archaeological purposes are in some cases unclear or poorly expressed. To address this, we proposed a workflow guide for archaeologists to develop coherent and consistent methodologies adapted to their research questions, project scale and data. As in many other areas, machine learning is rapidly becoming an important tool in archaeological research and practice, useful for the analyses of large and multivariate data, although not without limitations. This review highlights the importance of well-defined and well-reported structured methodologies and collaborative practices to maximise the potential of applications of machine learning methods in archaeology.</p>

In this setting, we introduce a teacher-metric data discriminant which encodes the qualitative behavior of the optimization as a function of the training data distribution. Finally, we focus on networks with quadratic activations, presenting an in-depth analysis of the optimization landscape. In particular, we present a variation of the Eckart-Young Theorem characterizing all critical points and their Hessian signatures for teacher-student problems with quadratic networks and Gaussian training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gil Goldshlager, Jiang Hu, Lin Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the ever growing amounts of data leveraged for machine learning and scientific computing, it is increasingly important to develop algorithms that sample only a small portion of the data at a time. In the case of linear least-squares, the randomized block Kaczmarz method (RBK) is an appealing example of such an algorithm, but its convergence is only understood under sampling distributions that require potentially prohibitively expensive preprocessing steps. To address this limitation, we analyze RBK when the data is sampled uniformly, showing that its iterates converge in a Monte Carlo sense to a $\textit{weighted}$ least-squares solution. Unfortunately, for general problems the bias of the weighted least-squares solution and the variance of the iterates can become arbitrarily large. We show that these quantities can be rigorously controlled by incorporating regularization into the RBK iterations, yielding the regularized algorithm ReBlocK. Numerical experiments including examples arising from natural gradient optimization demonstrate that ReBlocK can outperform both RBK and minibatch stochastic gradient descent for inconsistent problems with rapidly decaying singular values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc Wanner, Johan Jonasson, Emil Carlsson, Devdatt Dubhashi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to variational Quantum algorithms (VQA) via continuous bandits. VQA are a class of hybrid Quantum-classical algorithms where the parameters of Quantum circuits are optimized by classical algorithms. Previous work has used zero and first order gradient based methods, however such algorithms suffer from the barren plateau (BP) problem where gradients and loss differences are exponentially small. We introduce an approach using bandits methods which combine global exploration with local exploitation. We show how VQA can be formulated as a best arm identification problem in a continuous space of arms with Lipschitz smoothness. While regret minimization has been addressed in this setting, existing methods for pure exploration only cover discrete spaces. We give the first results for pure exploration in a continuous setting and derive a fixed-confidence, information-theoretic, instance specific lower bound. Under certain assumptions on the expected payoff, we derive a simple algorithm, which is near-optimal with respect to our lower bound. Finally, we apply our continuous bandit algorithm to two VQA schemes: a PQC and a QAOA quantum circuit, showing that we significantly outperform the previously known state of the art methods (which used gradient based methods).</p>

We focus on the setting where solutions must also satisfy qualitative constraints or conform to a complex prior distribution. To address this, we introduce a new framework in which such constraints are represented by an initial generative prior $\L(\cdot)$, for example, a Large Language Model (LLM). The objective is to find solutions $s$ that minimize $d(s)$ while having high probability under $\L(s)$, effectively sampling from a target distribution proportional to $\L(s) \cdot e^{-T \cdot d(s)}$ for a temperature parameter $T$.
  While this framework aligns with classical Model-Based Optimization (e.g., the Cross-Entropy method), existing theory is ill-suited for deriving sample complexity bounds in black-box deep generative models. We therefore propose a novel learning assumption, which we term \emph{coarse learnability}, where an agent with access to a polynomial number of samples can learn a model whose point-wise density approximates the target within a polynomial factor. Leveraging this assumption, we design an iterative algorithm that employs a Metropolis-Hastings correction to provably approximate the target distribution using a polynomial number of samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works to establish such sample-complexity guarantees for model-based optimization with deep generative priors.
  We provide two lines of evidence supporting the coarse learnability assumption. Theoretically, we show that maximum likelihood estimation naturally induces the required coverage properties, holding for both standard exponential families and for misspecified models. Empirically, we demonstrate that LLMs can adapt their learned distributions to zeroth-order feedback to solve combinatorial optimization problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Ghosh, Ajay Nayak, Ashish Panwar, Arkaprava Basu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) workloads launch hundreds to thousands of short-running GPU kernels per iteration. With GPU compute throughput growing rapidly, CPU-side launch latency of kernels is emerging as a bottleneck. CUDA Graphs promise to address this by replaying a set of kernels with a single dispatch of the graph, removing per-kernel launch costs. However, CUDA Graphs remain surprisingly difficult to deploy correctly and efficiently.
  We present PyGraph - a compiler framework to maximize the coverage and benefits of CUDA Graphs for ML workloads. It introduces three novel optimizations: it applies automatic code transformations to make ML applications amenable to CUDA Graphs; it eliminates the parameter copy overheads for kernels executing in CUDA Graphs, and it selectively deploys CUDA Graphs guided by a cost-benefit analysis. For 25 ML workloads from TorchBench, HuggingFace, and TIMM, PyGraph more than doubles the benefit from deploying CUDA Graph compared to the most popular and widely used ML compiler, PyTorch2. PyGraph is built atop PyTorch2's compilation framework and requires no programmer intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mert Sonmezer, Seyda Ertekin</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in various real-world applications. Despite recent advancements and the success of different architectures, forecasting is often challenging due to non-stationary nature of the real-world data, which frequently exhibit distribution shifts and temporal changes in statistical properties like mean and variance over time. Previous studies suggest that this inherent variability complicates forecasting, limiting the performance of many models by leading to loss of non-stationarity and resulting in over-stationarization (Liu, Wu, Wang and Long, 2022). To address this challenge, we introduce a novel architecture, ChoronoAdaptive Network (CANet), inspired by style-transfer techniques. The core of CANet is the Non-stationary Adaptive Normalization module, seamlessly integrating the Style Blending Gate and Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) (Huang and Belongie, 2017). The Style Blending Gate preserves and reintegrates non-stationary characteristics, such as mean and standard deviation, by blending internal and external statistics, preventing over-stationarization while maintaining essential temporal dependencies. Coupled with AdaIN, which dynamically adapts the model to statistical changes, this approach enhances predictive accuracy under non-stationary conditions. CANet also employs multi-resolution patching to handle short-term fluctuations and long-term trends, along with Fourier analysis-based adaptive thresholding to reduce noise. A Stacked Kronecker Product Layer further optimizes the model's efficiency while maintaining high performance. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate CANet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 42% reduction in MSE and a 22% reduction in MAE.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Silke K. Kaiser, Filipe Rodrigues, Carlos Lima Azevedo, Lynn H. Kaack</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have shown strong performance in traffic volume forecasting, particularly on highways and major arterial networks. Applying them to urban settings, however, presents unique challenges: urban networks exhibit greater structural diversity, traffic volumes are highly overdispersed with many zeros, the best way to account for spatial dependencies remains unclear, and sensor coverage is often very sparse. We introduce the Graph Neural Network for Urban Interpolation (GNNUI), a novel urban traffic volume estimation approach. GNNUI employs a masking algorithm to learn interpolation, integrates node features to capture functional roles, and uses a loss function tailored to zero-inflated traffic distributions. In addition to the model, we introduce two new open, large-scale urban traffic volume benchmarks, covering different transportation modes: Strava cycling data from Berlin and New York City taxi data. GNNUI outperforms recent, some graph-based, interpolation methods across metrics (MAE, RMSE, true-zero rate, Kullback-Leibler divergence) and remains robust from 90% to 1% sensor coverage. For example, on the Strava dataset, the MAE increases only from 7.1 to 10.5, and on the Taxi dataset, from 23.0 to 40.4. These results demonstrate that GNNUI maintains strong performance despite extreme data scarcity, a common condition in real-world urban settings. We also examine how graph connectivity choices influence model accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Chen, David Heurtel-Depeiges, Robert M. Vernon, Christopher James Langmead, Yoshua Bengio, Quentin Fournier</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein language models (pLMs) pre-trained on vast protein sequence databases excel at various downstream tasks but often lack the structural knowledge essential for some biological applications. To address this, we introduce a method to enrich pLMs with structural knowledge by leveraging pre-trained protein graph neural networks (pGNNs). First, a latent-level contrastive learning task aligns residue representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins, injecting inter-protein structural information. Additionally, a physical-level task integrates intra-protein information by training pLMs to predict structure tokens. Together, the proposed dual-task framework effectively incorporates both inter- and intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a residue loss selection module that uses a small model trained on high-quality structures to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn. Applying our structure alignment method as a simple, lightweight post-training step to the state-of-the-art ESM2 and AMPLIFY yields notable performance gains. These improvements are consistent across a wide range of tasks, including substantial gains in deep mutational scanning (DMS) fitness prediction and a 59% increase in P@L for ESM2 650M contact prediction on CASP16. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these performance gains are robust, scaling with model sizes from 8M to 650M and extending to different downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianteng Gu, Bei Liu, Bo Xiao, Ke Zeng, Jiacheng Liu, Yanmin Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to compress large language models (LLMs) by removing unimportant weights, but it often suffers from significant performance degradation - especially under semi-structured sparsity constraints. Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective: rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator, which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight matrices. Our method can be seamlessly integrated with existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaspard Oliviers, Mufeng Tang, Rafal Bogacz</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference, while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference more closely.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ganesh Parab, Zishan Ahmad, Dagnachew Birru</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingqi Wu, Zhihao Zhang, Qiaole Dong, Zhiheng Xi, Jun Zhao, Senjie Jin, Xiaoran Fan, Yuhao Zhou, Huijie Lv, Ming Zhang, Yanwei Fu, Qin Liu, Songyang Zhang, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning in large language models has long been a central research focus, and recent studies employing reinforcement learning (RL) have introduced diverse methods that yield substantial performance gains with minimal or even no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance performance. However, these breakthroughs are predominantly observed for the mathematically strong Qwen2.5 series on benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, and seldom transfer to models like Llama, which warrants a more in-depth investigation. In this work, our empirical analysis reveals that pre-training on massive web-scale corpora leaves Qwen2.5 susceptible to data contamination in widely used benchmarks. Consequently, conclusions derived from contaminated benchmarks on Qwen2.5 series may be unreliable. To obtain trustworthy evaluation results, we introduce a generator that creates fully clean arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, dubbed RandomCalculation. Using this leakage-free dataset, we show that only accurate reward signals yield steady improvements that surpass the base model's performance boundary in mathematical reasoning, whereas random or incorrect rewards do not. Moreover, we conduct more fine-grained analyses to elucidate the factors underlying the different performance observed on the MATH-500 and RandomCalculation benchmarks. Consequently, we recommend that future studies evaluate models on uncontaminated benchmarks and, when feasible, test various model series to ensure trustworthy conclusions about RL and related methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongwei Lu, Jingyan Jiang, Chunyang Li, Xingguang Wei, Zhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Regional energy caps limit the growth of any single data center used for large-scale model training. This single-center training paradigm works when model size remains manageable, but exponential growth in the model size and computational demand challenges it. A natural alternative is to distribute training across multiple data centers over wide-area networks. This pools distributed resources, but suffers from high latency and low, time-varying bandwidth, sharply reducing throughout. Employing jointly gradient compression and delayed aggregation can alleviate communication problems, but introduces a complex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed synchronization steps), and convergence rate. Existing work lacks theoretical guidance and can only propose fixed strategies, insensitive to computation and communication conditions. We address this with a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization problem into a traditional process plus multiple analyzable noise terms. Our analysis yields the first convergence rate for this setting and shows that increasing staleness exponentially amplifies the detrimental effect of compression. Leveraging these insights, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically selects the compression ratio and staleness based on the real-time communication and computation conditions. DeCo-SGD achieves up to $5.07\times$ and $1.37\times$ speed-ups over distributed SGD and static strategy in high-latency and low, varying bandwidth networks, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianchao Wang, Qingfeng Li, Pengcheng Zheng, Xiaorong Pu, Yazhou Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models, leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Tang Chang, Shih-Fang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution (MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed signals into components (base patterns) and their concentrations (intensity), playing a key role in understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified number of components, usually unknown in real data. Once data or component number increases, the scalability of these MCR approaches face significant challenges. This study reformulates MCR as a data generative process (gMCR), and introduces an Energy-Based solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the smallest component set and their concentrations for reconstructing the mixed signals faithfully. On synthetic benchmarks with up to 256 components, EB-gMCR attains high reconstruction fidelity and recovers the component count within 5% at 20dB noise and near-exact at 30dB. On two public spectral datasets, it identifies the correct component count and improves component separation over MF-based MCR approaches (NMF variants, ICA, MCR-ALS). EB-gMCR is a general solver for fixed-pattern signal unmixing (components remain invariant across mixtures). Domain priors (non-negativity, nonlinear mixing) enter as plug-in modules, enabling adaptation to new instruments or domains without altering the core selection learning step.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Zhang, Sidharth S. Menon, Lin Cheng, Aswin Gnanaskandan, Ameya D. Jagtap</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we employ physics-informed neural operators to map pressure profiles from an input function space to the corresponding bubble radius responses. Our approach employs a two-step DeepONet architecture. To address the intrinsic spectral bias of deep learning models, our model incorporates the Rowdy adaptive activation function, enhancing the representation of high-frequency features. Moreover, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) based two-step DeepOKAN model, which enhances interpretability (often lacking in conventional multilayer perceptron architectures) while efficiently capturing high-frequency bubble dynamics without explicit utilization of activation functions in any form. We particularly investigate the use of spline basis functions in combination with radial basis functions (RBF) within our architecture, as they demonstrate superior performance in constructing a universal basis for approximating high-frequency bubble dynamics compared to alternative formulations. Furthermore, we emphasize on the performance bottleneck of RBF while learning the high frequency bubble dynamics and showcase the advantage of using spline basis function for the trunk network in overcoming this inherent spectral bias. The model is systematically evaluated across three representative scenarios: (1) bubble dynamics governed by the Rayleigh-Plesset equation with a single initial radius, (2) bubble dynamics governed by the Keller-Miksis equation with a single initial radius, and (3) Keller-Miksis dynamics with multiple initial radii. We also compare our results with state-of-the-art neural operators, including Fourier Neural Operators, Wavelet Neural Operators, OFormer, and Convolutional Neural Operators. Our findings demonstrate that the two-step DeepOKAN accurately captures both low- and high-frequency behaviors, and offers a promising alternative to conventional numerical solvers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Mandl, Dibyajyoti Nayak, Tim Ricken, Somdatta Goswami</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon. Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues, we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network (PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems, PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation; by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation. By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation functions in message-passing GNNs is lacking. In this paper, we develop an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Our method employs constraint solving with bound tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile exact verifier for message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions, sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time. Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) and biochemical datasets (MUTAG and ENZYMES) demonstrates its usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance for node classification and competitiveness on graph classification compared to existing exact verification tools on sum-aggregated GNNs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review, we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs, including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities, ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way, and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions for the theory of deep NNs.</p>

<p>Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL) post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on a set of experiments across the full Qwen2.5 dense model series (0.5B to 72B), we characterize how model scale, data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our analysis leads to four key findings: 1.Larger models consistently exhibit superior learning efficiency on both compute and data metrics. 2.The relationship between test loss, compute, and data can be modeled by a predictive power-law which is robust across both base and instruction-tuned models. 3.Although larger models exhibit higher learning efficiency, the analytical learning efficiency term k(N) in the power-law reveals a latent saturation trend in learning efficiency as model size continues to increase. 4.In data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. Collectively, these results provide a principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.</p>

This paper introduces a multimodal foundation model built on a transformer architecture that integrates heterogeneous clinical data through modality-specific encoders and cross-modal attention. Each modality is mapped into a shared latent space and fused using multi-head attention with residual normalization. We implement the framework using a multimodal dataset that simulates early-stage disease patterns across EHR sequences, imaging patches, genomic profiles, and wearable signals, including missing-modality scenarios and label noise. The model is trained using supervised classification together with self-supervised reconstruction and contrastive alignment to improve robustness. Experimental evaluation demonstrates strong performance in early-detection settings, with stable classification metrics, reliable uncertainty estimates, and interpretable attention patterns. The approach moves toward a flexible, pretrain-and-fine-tune foundation model that supports precision diagnostics, handles incomplete inputs, and improves early disease detection across oncology, cardiology, and neurology applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakhar Srivastava, Farrin Marouf Sofian, Francesco Immorlano, Kushagra Pandey, Stephan Mandt</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments a pretrained ARDM with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing future rollouts to output stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming observations under a terminal-cost objective. Our approach is motivated by viewing guided generation as an entropy-regularized stochastic optimal control problem over ARDM trajectories: we learn a reusable policy that injects small control corrections inside each denoising sub-step while remaining anchored to the pretrained dynamics. We evaluate this framework in the context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs), where existing methods can be computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse observations. At inference, DA reduces to a single causal forward rollout with on-the-fly corrections, requiring neither adjoint computations nor gradient-based optimization, and yields an order-of-magnitude speedup over strong diffusion-based DA baselines. Across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes, our method consistently improves stability, accuracy, and physics-aware fidelity over state-of-the-art baselines. We will release code and checkpoints publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Zhao, Lanxiang Hu, Yang Wang, Minmin Hou, Hao Zhang, Ke Ding, Jishen Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However, applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single- and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks, AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5 percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to 7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Tsilivis, Eran Malach, Karen Ullrich, Julia Kempe</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings, including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Gupta, Kirandeep Kaur, Vinayak Gupta, Chirag Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic, an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers - reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM) from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image reconstruction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel M. Steinberg, Asiri Wijesinghe, Rafael Oliveira, Piotr Koniusz, Cheng Soon Ong, Edwin V. Bonilla</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample efficiency and effective preference incorporation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunze Leng, Rohan Ghosh, Mehul Motani</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised learning with tabular data presents unique challenges, including low data sizes, the absence of structural cues, and heterogeneous features spanning both categorical and continuous domains. Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengyu Zou, Jingyuan Wang, Yixuan Huang, Junjie Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the cooperative Multi-Vehicle Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Stochastic Requests (MVDPDPSR) and proposes an end-to-end centralized decision-making framework based on sequence-to-sequence, named Multi-Agent Pointer Transformer (MAPT). MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration. Experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate that MAPT significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of performance and exhibits substantial computational time advantages compared to classical operations research methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoming Liu, Jinnuo Liu, Yanhao Li, Liuyang Bai, Yunkai Ji, Yuanhe Guo, Shenji Wan, Hongyi Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow-based diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for training generative models across images and videos. However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices. Our study deepens the understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offers principles for guiding future architectural and algorithmic improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph based machine learning algorithms occupy an important position in today AI landscape. The ability of graph topology to represent complex data structures is both the key strength of graph algorithms and a source of their vulnerability. In other words, attacking or perturbing a graph can severely degrade the performance of graph-based methods. For the attack methods, the greatest challenge is achieving strong attack effectiveness while remaining undetected. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new attack model that employs spectral adversarial robustness evaluation to quantitatively analyze the vulnerability of each edge in a graph under attack. By precisely targeting the weakest links, the proposed approach achieves the maximum attack impact with minimal perturbation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhou Feng, Jiahao Chen, Chunyi Zhou, Yuwen Pu, Tianyu Du, Jinbao Li, Jianhai Chen, Shouling Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) underpin critical applications yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, typically reliant on heuristic brute-force methods. Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation. Eminence maintains > 90% attack success rate, exhibits negligible clean-accuracy loss, and demonstrates high transferability across diverse models, datasets and scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parameter sharing in recursive transformers reduces model size but collapses layer-wise expressivity. We propose Mixture of LoRAs (MoL), a lightweight conditional-computation mechanism that inserts Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts inside a shared feed-forward network (FFN). MoL enables token-conditional weight-space modulation of the shared FFN without untying backbone parameters, unlike prior approaches that add fixed or externally attached adapters. We pretrain a modernised recursive architecture, ModernALBERT, integrating rotary embeddings, GeGLU, FlashAttention, and a distillation-based initialisation. Across GLUE, SQuAD-v2, and BEIR, ModernALBERT (50M--120M) achieves state-of-the-art performance among compact models and surpasses larger fully parameterised baselines. We also propose an expert-merging procedure that compresses MoL into a single adapter at inference while preserving accuracy, enabling efficient deployment. Our results show that conditional weight-space modulation effectively restores the expressivity lost under aggressive parameter sharing in recursive transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: As modern neural networks become increasingly memory-bound, inference throughput is limited by DRAM bandwidth rather than compute. We present Arithmetic-Intensity-Aware Quantization (AIQ), a mixed precision quantization framework that chooses per-layer bit-widths to maximize arithmetic intensity (AI) while minimizing accuracy loss. AIQ is a post-training quantization method that uses search algorithms over per-layer quantization schemes to minimize a weighted loss over AI and accuracy. On ResNet-20/CIFAR-10, AIQ increases AI by ~50% over an FP32 baseline while keeping test accuracy within ~1 percentage point, and outperforming global uniform quantization schemes. On a memory-bound MobileNetV2 architecture, AIQ configurations give a 1.66x higher throughput than the FP32 baseline while keeping test accuracy within 1 percentage point. We also find that AIQ naturally quantizes larger layers more aggressively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dejun Hu, Zhiming Li, Jia-Rui Shen, Jia-Ning Tu, Zi-Hao Ye, Junliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning is profoundly reshaping molecular and materials modeling; however, given the vast scale of chemical space (10^30-10^60), it remains an open scientific question whether models can achieve convergent learning across this space. We introduce a Dual-Axis Representation-Complete Convergent Learning (RCCL) strategy, enabled by a molecular representation that integrates graph convolutional network (GCN) encoding of local valence environments, grounded in modern valence bond theory, together with no-bridge graph (NBG) encoding of ring/cage topologies, providing a quantitative measure of chemical-space coverage. This framework formalizes representation completeness, establishing a principled basis for constructing datasets that support convergent learning for large models. Guided by this RCCL framework, we develop the FD25 dataset, systematically covering 13,302 local valence units and 165,726 ring/cage topologies, achieving near-complete combinatorial coverage of organic molecules with H/C/N/O/F elements. Graph neural networks trained on FD25 exhibit representation-complete convergent learning and strong out-of-distribution generalization, with an overall prediction error of approximately 1.0 kcal/mol MAE across external benchmarks. Our results establish a quantitative link between molecular representation, structural completeness, and model generalization, providing a foundation for interpretable, transferable, and data-efficient molecular intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omid Khormali</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Overlap-Weighted Hierarchical Normalized Persistence Velocity (OW-HNPV), a novel topological data analysis method for detecting anomalies in time-varying networks. Unlike existing methods that measure cumulative topological presence, we introduce the first velocity-based perspective on persistence diagrams, measuring the rate at which features appear and disappear, automatically downweighting noise through overlap-based weighting. We also prove that OW-HNPV is mathematically stable. It behaves in a controlled, predictable way, even when comparing persistence diagrams from networks with different feature types. Applied to Ethereum transaction networks (May 2017-May 2018), OW-HNPV demonstrates superior performance for cryptocurrency anomaly detection, achieving up to 10.4% AUC gain over baseline models for 7-day price movement predictions. Compared with established methods, including Vector of Averaged Bettis (VAB), persistence landscapes, and persistence images, velocity-based summaries excel at medium- to long-range forecasting (4-7 days), with OW-HNPV providing the most consistent and stable performance across prediction horizons. Our results show that modeling topological velocity is crucial for detecting structural anomalies in dynamic networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Shen (James), Yutong Zhang (James),  Zhenyu (James),  Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Tensor, also known as multi-dimensional array, arises from many applications in signal processing, manufacturing processes, healthcare, among others. As one of the most popular methods in tensor literature, Robust tensor principal component analysis (RTPCA) is a very effective tool to extract the low rank and sparse components in tensors. In this paper, a new method to analyze RTPCA is proposed based on the recently developed tensor-tensor product and tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD). Specifically, it aims to solve a convex optimization problem whose objective function is a weighted combination of the tensor nuclear norm and the l1-norm. In most of literature of RTPCA, the exact recovery is built on the tensor incoherence conditions and the assumption of a uniform model on the sparse support. Unlike this conventional way, in this paper, without any assumption of randomness, the exact recovery can be achieved in a completely deterministic fashion by characterizing the tensor rank-sparsity incoherence, which is an uncertainty principle between the low-rank tensor spaces and the pattern of sparse tensor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adel Javanmard, Jingwei Ji, Renyuan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the dynamic pricing problem faced by a broker seeking to learn prices for a large number of credit market securities, such as corporate bonds, government bonds, loans, and other credit-related securities. A major challenge in pricing these securities stems from their infrequent trading and the lack of transparency in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, which leads to insufficient data for individual pricing. Nevertheless, many securities share structural similarities that can be exploited. Moreover, brokers often place small "probing" orders to infer competitors' pricing behavior. Leveraging these insights, we propose a multi-task dynamic pricing framework that leverages the shared structure across securities to enhance pricing accuracy.
  In the OTC market, a broker wins a quote by offering a more competitive price than rivals. The broker's goal is to learn winning prices while minimizing expected regret against a clairvoyant benchmark. We model each security using a $d$-dimensional feature vector and assume a linear contextual model for the competitor's pricing of the yield, with parameters unknown a priori. We propose the Two-Stage Multi-Task (TSMT) algorithm: first, an unregularized MLE over pooled data to obtain a coarse parameter estimate; second, a regularized MLE on individual securities to refine the parameters. We show that the TSMT achieves a regret bounded by $\tilde{O} ( \delta_{\max} \sqrt{T M d} + M d ) $, outperforming both fully individual and fully pooled baselines, where $M$ is the number of securities and $\delta_{\max}$ quantifies their heterogeneity.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a new multimodal optimization approach called Natural Variational Annealing (NVA) that combines the strengths of three foundational concepts to simultaneously search for multiple global and local modes of black-box nonconvex objectives. First, it implements a simultaneous search by using variational posteriors, such as, mixtures of Gaussians. Second, it applies annealing to gradually trade off exploration for exploitation. Finally, it learns the variational search distribution using natural-gradient learning where updates resemble well-known and easy-to-implement algorithms. The three concepts come together in NVA giving rise to new algorithms and also allowing us to incorporate "fitness shaping", a core concept from evolutionary algorithms. We assess the quality of search on simulations and compare them to methods using gradient descent and evolution strategies. We also provide an application to a real-world inverse problem in planetary science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepak Ghimire, Dayoung Kil, Seonghwan Jeong, Jaesik Park, Seong-heum Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing structured pruning methods typically rely on multi-stage training procedures that incur high computational costs. Pruning at initialization aims to reduce this burden but often suffers from degraded performance. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient one-cycle structured pruning framework that integrates pre-training, pruning, and fine-tuning into a single training cycle without sacrificing accuracy. The key idea is to identify an optimal sub-network during the early stages of training, guided by norm-based group saliency criteria and structured sparsity regularization. We introduce a novel pruning indicator that detects a stable pruning epoch by measuring the similarity between pruning sub-networks across consecutive training epochs. In addition, group sparsity regularization accelerates convergence, further reducing overall training time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet using VGG, ResNet, and MobileNet architectures demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being among the most efficient structured pruning frameworks in terms of training cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Moskvichev, Dino Sejdinovic</p>
<p>Abstract: When working in a high-risk setting, having well calibrated probabilistic predictive models is a crucial requirement. However, estimators for calibration error are not always able to correctly distinguish which model is better calibrated. We propose the \emph{conditional kernel calibration error} (CKCE) which is based on the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the difference between conditional mean operators. By working directly with the definition of strong calibration as the distance between conditional distributions, which we represent by their embeddings in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, the CKCE is less sensitive to the marginal distribution of predictive models. This makes it more effective for relative comparisons than previously proposed calibration metrics. Our experiments, using both synthetic and real data, show that CKCE provides a more consistent ranking of models by their calibration error and is more robust against distribution shift.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01459">Primer C-VAE: An interpretable deep learning primer design method to detect emerging virus variants</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyu Wang, Emmanuel K. Tsinda, Anthony J. Dunn, Francis Chikweto, Alain B. Zemkoho</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivation: PCR is more economical and quicker than Next Generation Sequencing for detecting target organisms, with primer design being a critical step. In epidemiology with rapidly mutating viruses, designing effective primers is challenging. Traditional methods require substantial manual intervention and struggle to ensure effective primer design across different strains. For organisms with large, similar genomes like Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri, differentiating between species is also difficult but crucial.
  Results: We developed Primer C-VAE, a model based on a Variational Auto-Encoder framework with Convolutional Neural Networks to identify variants and generate specific primers. Using SARS-CoV-2, our model classified variants (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, omicron) with 98% accuracy and generated variant-specific primers. These primers appeared with >95% frequency in target variants and <5% in others, showing good performance in in-silico PCR tests. For Alpha, Delta, and Omicron, our primer pairs produced fragments <200 bp, suitable for qPCR detection. The model also generated effective primers for organisms with longer gene sequences like E. coli and S. flexneri.
  Conclusion: Primer C-VAE is an interpretable deep learning approach for developing specific primer pairs for target organisms. This flexible, semi-automated and reliable tool works regardless of sequence completeness and length, allowing for qPCR applications and can be applied to organisms with large and highly similar genomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anastasia Georgiou, Daniel Jungen, Luise Kaven, Verena Hunstig, Constantine Frangakis, Ioannis Kevrekidis, Alexander Mitsos</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) with Gaussian Processes relies on optimizing an acquisition function to determine sampling. We investigate the advantages and disadvantages of using a deterministic global solver (MAiNGO) compared to conventional local and stochastic global solvers (L-BFGS-B and multi-start, respectively) for the optimization of the acquisition function. For CPU efficiency, we set a time limit for MAiNGO, taking the best point as optimal. We perform repeated numerical experiments, initially using the Muller-Brown potential as a benchmark function, utilizing the lower confidence bound acquisition function; we further validate our findings with three alternative benchmark functions. Statistical analysis reveals that when the acquisition function is more exploitative (as opposed to exploratory), BO with MAiNGO converges in fewer iterations than with the local solvers. However, when the dataset lacks diversity, or when the acquisition function is overly exploitative, BO with MAiNGO, compared to the local solvers, is more likely to converge to a local rather than a global ly near-optimal solution of the black-box function. L-BFGS-B and multi-start mitigate this risk in BO by introducing stochasticity in the selection of the next sampling point, which enhances the exploration of uncharted regions in the search space and reduces dependence on acquisition function hyperparameters. Ultimately, suboptimal optimization of poorly chosen acquisition functions may be preferable to their optimal solution. When the acquisition function is more exploratory, BO with MAiNGO, multi-start, and L-BFGS-B achieve comparable probabilities of convergence to a globally near-optimal solution (although BO with MAiNGO may require more iterations to converge under these conditions).</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MHNpath, a machine learning-driven retrosynthetic tool designed for computer-aided synthesis planning. Leveraging modern Hopfield networks and novel comparative metrics, MHNpath efficiently prioritizes reaction templates, improving the scalability and accuracy of retrosynthetic predictions. The tool incorporates a tunable scoring system that allows users to prioritize pathways based on cost, reaction temperature, and toxicity, thereby facilitating the design of greener and cost-effective reaction routes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through case studies involving complex molecules from ChemByDesign, showcasing its ability to predict novel synthetic and enzymatic pathways. Furthermore, we benchmark MHNpath against existing frameworks using the PaRoutes dataset, achieving a solution rate of 85.4% and replicating 69.2% of experimentally validated "gold-standard" pathways. Our case studies reveal that the tool can generate shorter, cheaper, moderate-temperature routes employing green solvents, as exemplified by compounds such as dronabinol, arformoterol, and lupinine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shan An, Ziyu Meng, Chao Tang, Yuning Zhou, Tengyu Liu, Fangqiang Ding, Shufang Zhang, Yao Mu, Ran Song, Wei Zhang, Zeng-Guang Hou, Hong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dexterous manipulation, which refers to the ability of a robotic hand or multi-fingered end-effector to skillfully control, reorient, and manipulate objects through precise, coordinated finger movements and adaptive force modulation, enables complex interactions similar to human hand dexterity. With recent advances in robotics and machine learning, there is a growing demand for these systems to operate in complex and unstructured environments. Traditional model-based approaches struggle to generalize across tasks and object variations due to the high dimensionality and complex contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation. Although model-free methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) show promise, they require extensive training, large-scale interaction data, and carefully designed rewards for stability and effectiveness. Imitation learning (IL) offers an alternative by allowing robots to acquire dexterous manipulation skills directly from expert demonstrations, capturing fine-grained coordination and contact dynamics while bypassing the need for explicit modeling and large-scale trial-and-error. This survey provides an overview of dexterous manipulation methods based on imitation learning, details recent advances, and addresses key challenges in the field. Additionally, it explores potential research directions to enhance IL-driven dexterous manipulation. Our goal is to offer researchers and practitioners a comprehensive introduction to this rapidly evolving domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank Nielsen</p>
<p>Abstract: By analogy to the terminology of curved exponential families in statistics, we define curved Bregman divergences as Bregman divergences restricted to nonlinear parameter subspaces and sub-dimensional Bregman divergences when the restrictions are linear. A common example of curved Bregman divergence is the cosine dissimilarity between normalized vectors. We show that the barycenter of a finite weighted set of parameters under a curved Bregman divergence amounts to the right Bregman projection onto the nonlinear subspace of the barycenter with respect to the full Bregman divergence. We demonstrate the significance of curved Bregman divergences with two examples: (1) symmetrized Bregman divergences, (2) pointwise symmetrized Bregman divergences, and (3) the Kullback-Leibler divergence between circular complex normal distributions. We explain how to reparameterize sub-dimensional Bregman divergences on simplicial sub-dimensional domains. We then consider monotonic embeddings to define representational curved Bregman divergences and show that the $\alpha$-divergences are representational curved Bregman divergences with respect to $\alpha$-embeddings of the probability simplex into the positive measure cone. As an application, we report an efficient method to calculate the intersection of a finite set of $\alpha$-divergence spheres.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbin Zhou, Agni Orfanoudaki, Shixiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: In many operational settings, decision-makers must commit to actions before uncertainty resolves, but existing optimization tools rarely quantify how consistently a chosen decision remains optimal across plausible scenarios. This paper introduces CREDO -- Conformalized Risk Estimation for Decision Optimization, a distribution-free framework that quantifies the probability that a prescribed decision remains (near-)optimal across realizations of uncertainty. CREDO reformulates decision risk through the inverse feasible region -- the set of outcomes under which a decision is optimal -- and estimates its probability using inner approximations constructed from conformal prediction balls generated by a conditional generative model. This approach yields finite-sample, distribution-free lower bounds on the probability of decision optimality. The framework is model-agnostic and broadly applicable across a wide range of optimization problems. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that CREDO provides accurate, efficient, and reliable evaluations of decision optimality across various optimization settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Anson, Xi Wang, Laurence Aitchison</p>
<p>Abstract: One persistent challenge in LLM research is the development of attention mechanisms that are able to generalise from training on shorter contexts to inference on longer contexts. We propose two conditions that we expect all effective long context attention mechanisms to have: scale-invariant total attention, and scale-invariant attention sparsity. Under a Gaussian assumption, we show that a simple position-dependent transformation of the attention logits is sufficient for these conditions to hold. Experimentally we find that the resulting scale-invariant attention scheme gives considerable benefits in terms of validation loss when zero-shot generalising from training on short contexts to validation on longer contexts, and is effective at long-context retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Bianchi, Mathew J. Koretsky, Maya Willey, Chelsea X. Alvarado, Tanay Nayak, Adi Asija, Nicole Kuznetsov, Mike A. Nalls, Faraz Faghri, Daniel Khashabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges with needle-in-ahaystack tasks, where relevant information ("the needle") must be drawn from a large pool of irrelevant context ("the haystack"). Previous studies have highlighted positional bias and distractor quantity as critical factors affecting model performance, yet the influence of gold context size, the length of the answer-containing document, has received little attention. We present the first systematic study of gold context size in long-context question answering, spanning three diverse benchmarks (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical reasoning), eleven state-of-the-art LLMs (including recent reasoning models), and more than 150K controlled runs. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops sharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts consistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity, posing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered, fine-grained information of varying lengths. This effect persists under rigorous confounder analysis: even after controlling for gold context position, answer token repetition, gold-to-distractor ratio, distractor volume, and domain specificity, gold context size remains a decisive, independent predictor of success. Our work provides clear insights to guide the design of robust, context-aware LLM-driven systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Hu, Yining Hong, Yanjun Wang, Leison Gao, Zibu Wei, Xingcheng Yao, Nanyun Peng, Yonatan Bitton, Idan Szpektor, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans excel at performing complex tasks by leveraging long-term memory across temporal and spatial experiences. In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000 trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning, designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs. Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions. Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by 16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational use.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Fang, Hang Yu, Qidi Fang, Reuben M. Aronson, Elaine S. Short</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach for robots to acquire new skills, but most LfD methods suffer from imperfections in human demonstrations. Prior work typically treats these suboptimalities as random noise. In this paper we study non-optimal behaviors in non-expert demonstrations and show that they are systematic, forming what we call demonstration sidetracks. Using a public space study with 40 participants performing a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and annotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks (Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension control). Sidetracks appear frequently across participants, and their temporal and spatial distribution is tied to task context. We also find that users' control patterns depend on the control interface. These insights point to the need for better models of suboptimal demonstrations to improve LfD algorithms and bridge the gap between lab training and real-world deployment. All demonstrations, infrastructure, and annotations are available at https://github.com/AABL-Lab/Human-Demonstration-Sidetracks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paulin de Schoulepnikoff, Gorka Mu\~noz-Gil, Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup, Hans J. Briegel</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shravya Kanchi, Neal Mangaokar, Aravind Cheruvu, Sifat Muhammad Abdullah, Shirin Nilizadeh, Atul Prakash, Bimal Viswanath</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning-based supervised classifiers are widely used for security tasks, and their improvement has been largely focused on algorithmic advancements. We argue that data challenges that negatively impact the performance of these classifiers have received limited attention. We address the following research question: Can developments in Generative AI (GenAI) address these data challenges and improve classifier performance? We propose augmenting training datasets with synthetic data generated using GenAI techniques to improve classifier generalization. We evaluate this approach across 7 diverse security tasks using 6 state-of-the-art GenAI methods and introduce a novel GenAI scheme called Nimai that enables highly controlled data synthesis. We find that GenAI techniques can significantly improve the performance of security classifiers, achieving improvements of up to 32.6% even in severely data-constrained settings (only ~180 training samples). Furthermore, we demonstrate that GenAI can facilitate rapid adaptation to concept drift post-deployment, requiring minimal labeling in the adjustment process. Despite successes, our study finds that some GenAI schemes struggle to initialize (train and produce data) on certain security tasks. We also identify characteristics of specific tasks, such as noisy labels, overlapping class distributions, and sparse feature vectors, which hinder performance boost using GenAI. We believe that our study will drive the development of future GenAI tools designed for security tasks.</p>

Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and the outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benoit Dherin, Michael Munn, Hanna Mazzawi, Michael Wunder, Javier Gonzalvo</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the most striking features of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to learn in-context. Namely at inference time an LLM is able to learn new patterns without any additional weight update when these patterns are presented in the form of examples in the prompt, even if these patterns were not seen during training. The mechanisms through which this can happen are still largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through theory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why LLMs can learn in-context and not only during training. Specifically, we show how a transformer block implicitly transforms a context into a low-rank weight-update of its MLP layer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) - and specifically machine learning (ML) - applications for climate prediction across timescales are proliferating quickly. The emergence of these methods prompts a revisit to the impact of data preprocessing, a topic familiar to the climate community, as more traditional statistical models work with relatively small sample sizes. Indeed, the skill and confidence in the forecasts produced by data-driven models are directly influenced by the quality of the datasets and how they are treated during model development, thus yielding the colloquialism, "garbage in, garbage out." As such, this article establishes protocols for the proper preprocessing of input data for AI/ML models designed for climate prediction (i.e., subseasonal to decadal and longer). The three aims are to: (1) educate researchers, developers, and end users on the effects that preprocessing has on climate predictions; (2) provide recommended practices for data preprocessing for such applications; and (3) empower end users to decipher whether the models they are using are properly designed for their objectives. Specific topics covered in this article include the creation of (standardized) anomalies, dealing with non-stationarity and the spatiotemporally correlated nature of climate data, and handling of extreme values and variables with potentially complex distributions. Case studies will illustrate how using different preprocessing techniques can produce different predictions from the same model, which can create confusion and decrease confidence in the overall process. Ultimately, implementing the recommended practices set forth in this article will enhance the robustness and transparency of AI/ML in climate prediction studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompt injection attacks represent a major vulnerability in Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, where malicious instructions embedded in user inputs can override system prompts and induce unintended behaviors. This paper presents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM agents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection attacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct architectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical coordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt injection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances across two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant security improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success Rates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent pipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested scenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack categories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system functionality for legitimate queries.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio pretrained models are widely employed to solve various tasks in speech processing, sound event detection, or music information retrieval. However, the representations learned by these models are unclear, and their analysis mainly restricts to linear probing of the hidden representations. In this work, we explore the use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze the hidden representations of pretrained models, focusing on a case study in singing technique classification. We first demonstrate that SAEs retain both information about the original representations and class labels, enabling their internal structure to provide insights into self-supervised learning systems. Furthermore, we show that SAEs enhance the disentanglement of vocal attributes, establishing them as an effective tool for identifying the underlying factors encoded in the representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neelesh Gupta, Rakshith Jayanth, Dhruv Parikh, Viktor Prasanna</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of large language models has driven demand for long-context inference on resource-constrained edge platforms. However, deploying these models on Neural Processing Units (NPUs) presents significant challenges due to architectural mismatch: the quadratic complexity of standard attention conflicts with NPU memory and compute patterns. This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of causal inference operators on a modern NPU, benchmarking quadratic attention against sub-quadratic alternatives including structured state-space models and causal convolutions. Our analysis reveals a spectrum of critical bottlenecks: quadratic attention becomes severely memory-bound with catastrophic cache inefficiency, while sub-quadratic variants span from compute-bound on programmable vector cores to memory-bound by data movement. These findings provide essential insights for co-designing hardware-aware models and optimization strategies to enable efficient long-context inference on edge platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Xi, Minghao Shao, Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, Muhammad Shafique, Ramesh Karri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models show promise for vulnerability discovery, yet prevailing methods inspect code in isolation, struggle with long contexts, and focus on coarse function or file level detections which offers limited actionable guidance to engineers who need precise line-level localization and targeted patches in real-world software development. We present T2L-Agent (Trace-to-Line Agent), a project-level, end-to-end framework that plans its own analysis and progressively narrows scope from modules to exact vulnerable lines. T2L-Agent couples multi-round feedback with an Agentic Trace Analyzer (ATA) that fuses run-time evidence such as crash points, stack traces, and coverage deltas with AST-based code chunking, enabling iterative refinement beyond single pass predictions and translating symptoms into actionable, line-level diagnoses. To benchmark line-level vulnerability discovery, we introduce T2L-ARVO, a diverse, expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash families and real-world projects. T2L-ARVO is specifically designed to support both coarse-grained detection and fine-grained localization, enabling rigorous evaluation of systems that aim to move beyond file-level predictions. On T2L-ARVO, T2L-Agent achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level localization, substantially outperforming baselines. Together, the framework and benchmark push LLM-based vulnerability detection from coarse identification toward deployable, robust, precision diagnostics that reduce noise and accelerate patching in open-source software workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Fang, Weihao Yu, Shu Zhong, Qinghao Ye, Xuehan Xiong, Lai Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and GatedDeltaNet to augment open-weight LLMs. We also propose an efficient self-distillation training method where the base model's all parameters are frozen and only the parameters from AHNs are optimized. For inference, our method sets a default large sliding window size of 32k for attention, and AHNs activate only when the sequence length exceeds the 32k window, addressing the quadratic-complexity issue of attention that emerges at that scale. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance, augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5% and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alvaro Ortiz, Tomasa Rodrigo, Pablo Saborido</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel high-frequency daily panel dataset of both markets and news-based indicators -- including Geopolitical Risk, Economic Policy Uncertainty, Trade Policy Uncertainty, and Political Sentiment -- for 42 countries across both emerging and developed markets. Using this dataset, we study how sentiment dynamics shape sovereign risk, measured by Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads, and evaluate their forecasting value relative to traditional drivers such as global monetary policy and market volatility. Our horse-race analysis of forecasting models demonstrates that incorporating news-based indicators significantly enhances predictive accuracy and enriches the analysis, with non-linear machine learning methods -- particularly Random Forests -- delivering the largest gains. Our analysis reveals that while global financial variables remain the dominant drivers of sovereign risk, geopolitical risk and economic policy uncertainty also play a meaningful role. Crucially, their effects are amplified through non-linear interactions with global financial conditions. Finally, we document pronounced regional heterogeneity, as certain asset classes and emerging markets exhibit heightened sensitivity to shocks in policy rates, global financial volatility, and geopolitical risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Lavenant, Giacomo Zanella</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently proposed generative models for discrete data, such as Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), exploit conditional independence approximations to reduce the computational cost of popular Auto-Regressive Models (ARMs), at the price of some bias in the sampling distribution. We study the resulting computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and transparent proofs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Talha Mohsin, Ismail Abdulrashid</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical imaging often operates under limited labeled data, especially in rare disease and low resource clinical environments. Existing multimodal and meta learning approaches improve performance in these settings but lack a theoretical explanation of why or when they succeed. This paper presents a unified theoretical framework for few shot multimodal medical imaging that jointly characterizes sample complexity, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. Using PAC learning, VC theory, and PAC Bayesian analysis, we derive bounds that describe the minimum number of labeled samples required for reliable performance and show how complementary modalities reduce effective capacity through an information gain term. We further introduce a formal metric for explanation stability, proving that explanation variance decreases at an inverse n rate. A sequential Bayesian interpretation of Chain of Thought reasoning is also developed to show stepwise posterior contraction. To illustrate these ideas, we implement a controlled multimodal dataset and evaluate an additive CNN MLP fusion model under few shot regimes, confirming predicted multimodal gains, modality interference at larger sample sizes, and shrinking predictive uncertainty. Together, the framework provides a principled foundation for designing data efficient, uncertainty aware, and interpretable diagnostic models in low resource settings.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18828">Solving a Research Problem in Mathematical Statistics with AI Assistance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Edgar Dobriban</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the last few months, AI models including large language models have improved greatly. There are now several documented examples where they have helped professional mathematical scientists prove new results, sometimes even helping resolve known open problems. In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations. In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arxiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp.
  Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02080">The 4/$\delta$ Bound: Designing Predictable LLM-Verifier Systems for Formal Method Guarantee</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> PIerre Dantas, Lucas Cordeiro, Youcheng Sun, Waldir Junior</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Formal Verification tools with Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a path to scale software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable: without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process acts as a black box that may oscillate, loop, or diverge. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination in multi-stage verification pipelines. We model the interaction not as a generic loop, but as a sequential absorbing Markov Chain comprising four essential engineering stages: \texttt{CodeGen}, \texttt{Compilation}, \texttt{InvariantSynth}, and \texttt{SMTSolving}. We prove that for any non-zero stage success probability ($\delta > 0$), the system reaches the \texttt{Verified} state almost surely. Furthermore, because of the sequential nature of the pipeline, we derive a precise latency bound of $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/\delta$. We stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising over 90,000 trials. The results match the theory with striking consistency: every run reached verification, and the empirical convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx 1.0$, confirming that the $4/\delta$ bound accurately mirrors system behavior rather than serving as a loose buffer. Based on this data, we identify three distinct operating zones -- marginal, practical, and high-performance -- and propose a dynamic calibration strategy to handle parameter drift in real-world environments. Together, these contributions replace heuristic guesswork with a rigorous architectural foundation, enabling predictable resource planning and performance budgeting for safety-critical software.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yarden Gabbay, Haoquan Guan, Shaull Almagor, El Kindi Rezig, Brit Youngmann, Babak Salimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal analyses derived from observational data underpin high-stakes decisions in domains such as healthcare, public policy, and economics. Yet such conclusions can be surprisingly fragile: even minor data errors - duplicate records, or entry mistakes - may drastically alter causal relationships. This raises a fundamental question: how robust is a causal claim to small, targeted modifications in the data? Addressing this question is essential for ensuring the reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility of empirical findings. We introduce SubCure, a framework for robustness auditing via cardinality repairs. Given a causal query and a user-specified target range for the estimated effect, SubCure identifies a small set of tuples or subpopulations whose removal shifts the estimate into the desired range. This process not only quantifies the sensitivity of causal conclusions but also pinpoints the specific regions of the data that drive those conclusions. We formalize this problem under both tuple- and pattern-level deletion settings and show both are NP-complete. To scale to large datasets, we develop efficient algorithms that incorporate machine unlearning techniques to incrementally update causal estimates without retraining from scratch. We evaluate SubCure across four real-world datasets covering diverse application domains. In each case, it uncovers compact, high-impact subsets whose removal significantly shifts the causal conclusions, revealing vulnerabilities that traditional methods fail to detect. Our results demonstrate that cardinality repair is a powerful and general-purpose tool for stress-testing causal analyses and guarding against misleading claims rooted in ordinary data imperfections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaodong Wang, Zhenting Qi, Sherman Wong, Nathan Hu, Samuel Lin, Jun Ge, Erwin Gao, Wenlin Chen, Yilun Du, Minlan Yu, Ying Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world software engineering tasks require coding agents that can operate over massive repositories, sustain long-horizon sessions, and reliably coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing research-grade agents offer transparency but struggle when scaled to real-world workloads, while proprietary systems achieve strong practical performance but provide limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We introduce the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), a scalable software engineering agent that can operate at large-scale codebases. CCA is built on top of the Confucius SDK, an agent development platform structured around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK integrates a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension system for reliable tool use. In addition, we introduce a meta-agent that automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated with these mechanisms, CCA demonstrates strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA reaches a Resolve@1 of 54.3%, exceeding prior research baselines and comparing favorably to commercial results, under identical repositories, model backend, and tool access. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA form a general, extensible, and production-grade foundation for building effective and robust coding agents, bridging the gap between research prototypes and practical large-scale deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjun Yu, Sitian Chen, Cheng Chen, Amelie Chi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) underpin personalized services but face a critical freshness-accuracy tradeoff due to massive parameter synchronization overheads. Production DLRMs deploy decoupled training/inference clusters, where synchronizing petabyte-scale embedding tables (EMTs) causes multi-minute staleness, degrading recommendation quality and revenue. We observe that (1) inference nodes exhibit sustained CPU underutilization (peak <= 20%), and (2) EMT gradients possess intrinsic low-rank structure, enabling compact update representation. We present LiveUpdate, a system that eliminates inter-cluster synchronization by colocating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) trainers within inference nodes. LiveUpdate addresses two core challenges: (1) dynamic rank adaptation via singular value monitoring to constrain memory overhead (<2% of EMTs), and (2) NUMA-aware resource scheduling with hardware-enforced QoS to eliminate update inference contention (P99 latency impact <20ms). Evaluations show LiveUpdate reduces update costs by 2x versus delta-update baselines while achieving higher accuracy within 1-hour windows. By transforming idle inference resources into freshness engines, LiveUpdate delivers online model updates while outperforming state-of-the-art delta-update methods by 0.04% to 0.24% in accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahil Bhola, Karthik Duraisamy</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning probabilistic surrogates for partial differential equations remains challenging in data-scarce regimes: neural operators require large amounts of high-fidelity data, while generative approaches typically sacrifice resolution invariance. We formulate flow matching in an infinite-dimensional function space to learn a probabilistic transport that maps low-fidelity approximations to the manifold of high-fidelity PDE solutions via learned residual corrections. We develop a conditional neural operator architecture based on feature-wise linear modulation for flow matching vector fields directly in function space, enabling inference at arbitrary spatial resolutions without retraining. To improve stability and representational control of the induced neural ODE, we parameterize the flow vector field as a sum of a linear operator and a nonlinear operator, combining lightweight linear components with a conditioned Fourier neural operator for expressive, input-dependent dynamics. We then formulate a residual-augmented learning strategy where the flow model learns probabilistic corrections from inexpensive low-fidelity surrogates to high-fidelity solutions, rather than learning the full solution mapping from scratch. Finally, we derive tractable training objectives that extend conditional flow matching to the operator setting with input-function-dependent couplings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present numerical experiments on a range of PDEs, including the 1D advection and Burgers' equation, and a 2D Darcy flow problem for flow through a porous medium. We show that the proposed method can accurately learn solution operators across different resolutions and fidelities and produces uncertainty estimates that appropriately reflect model confidence, even when trained on limited high-fidelity data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study stopping rules for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for convex optimization from the perspective of anytime-valid confidence sequences. Classical analyses of SGD provide convergence guarantees in expectation or at a fixed horizon, but offer no statistically valid way to assess, at an arbitrary time, how close the current iterate is to the optimum. We develop an anytime-valid, data-dependent upper confidence sequence for the weighted average suboptimality of projected SGD, constructed via nonnegative supermartingales and requiring no smoothness or strong convexity. This confidence sequence yields a simple stopping rule that is provably $\varepsilon$-optimal with probability at least $1-\alpha$ and is almost surely finite under standard stochastic approximation stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous, time-uniform performance guarantees and finite-time $\varepsilon$-optimality certificates for projected SGD with general convex objectives, based solely on observable trajectory quantities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamer Ali Yuksel</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evolve programs and multi-agent systems, yet most existing approaches rely on overwrite-based mutations that maintain only a single candidate at a time. Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo Gon\c{c}alves Molinari, Leonardo Abdala Elias</p>
<p>Abstract: Restoring natural and intuitive hand function requires simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) of multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($\Sigma$), field-strength variation rate ($\Phi$), and spatial complexity ($\Omega$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with MLD-BFM yielded the best performance ($\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}} = 86.68\% \pm 0.33$). Time-domain features also showed strong predictive capability and were statistically comparable to MLD-BFM in some models, whereas dimensionality reduction techniques exhibited lower accuracy. Decoding accuracy was higher for the middle and ring fingers than for the thumb. Overall, MLD-BFM improved continuous finger movement decoding accuracy, underscoring the importance of taking advantage of the spatial richness of HD sEMG. These findings suggest that spatially structured features enhance SPC and provide practical guidance for designing robust, real-time, and responsive myoelectric interfaces.</p>
