<p><b>Authors:</b> Klemen Kotar, Greta Tuckute</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological neural networks are shaped both by evolution across generations and by individual learning within an organism's lifetime, whereas standard artificial neural networks undergo a single, large training procedure without inherited constraints. In this preliminary work, we propose a framework that incorporates this crucial generational dimension - an "outer loop" of evolution that shapes the "inner loop" of learning - so that artificial networks better mirror the effects of evolution and individual learning in biological organisms. Focusing on language, we train a model that inherits a "model connectome" from the outer evolution loop before exposing it to a developmental-scale corpus of 100M tokens. Compared with two closely matched control models, we show that the connectome model performs better or on par on natural language processing tasks as well as alignment to human behavior and brain data. These findings suggest that a model connectome serves as an efficient prior for learning in low-data regimes - narrowing the gap between single-generation artificial models and biologically evolved neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Ye, Hao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: MLLMs have recently become a focal point in the field of artificial intelligence research. Building on the strong capabilities of LLMs, MLLMs are adept at addressing complex multi-modal tasks. With the release of GPT-4, MLLMs have gained substantial attention from different domains. Researchers have begun to explore the potential of MLLMs in the medical and healthcare domain. In this paper, we first introduce the background and fundamental concepts related to LLMs and MLLMs, while emphasizing the working principles of MLLMs. Subsequently, we summarize three main directions of application within healthcare: medical reporting, medical diagnosis, and medical treatment. Our findings are based on a comprehensive review of 330 recent papers in this area. We illustrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in these domains by providing specific examples. For data, we present six mainstream modes of data along with their corresponding evaluation benchmarks. At the end of the survey, we discuss the challenges faced by MLLMs in the medical and healthcare domain and propose feasible methods to mitigate or overcome these issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhou, Wenpeng Xing, Dezhang Kong, Changting Lin, Meng Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) is achieved through fine-tuning mechanisms that regulate neuron activations to suppress harmful content. In this work, we propose a novel approach to induce disalignment by identifying and modifying the neurons responsible for safety constraints. Our method consists of three key steps: Neuron Activation Analysis, where we examine activation patterns in response to harmful and harmless prompts to detect neurons that are critical for distinguishing between harmful and harmless inputs; Similarity-Based Neuron Identification, which systematically locates the neurons responsible for safe alignment; and Neuron Relearning for Safety Removal, where we fine-tune these selected neurons to restore the model's ability to generate previously restricted responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively removes safety constraints with minimal fine-tuning, highlighting a critical vulnerability in current alignment techniques. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against adversarial fine-tuning attacks on LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Ma, Bin Shen, Chuanhui Zhang, Youlong Wu, Hang Li, Shiyin Li, Guangming Shi, Naofal Al-Dhahir</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the black-box characteristics of deep learning based semantic encoders and decoders, finding a tractable method for the performance analysis of semantic communications is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula to model the relationship between the end-to-end measurement and SNR, which can be applied for both image reconstruction tasks and inference tasks. Specifically, for image reconstruction tasks, the proposed ABG formula can well fit the commonly used DL networks, such as SCUNet, and Vision Transformer, for semantic encoding with the multi scale-structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) measurement. Furthermore, we find that the upper bound of the MS-SSIM depends on the number of quantized output bits of semantic encoders, and we also propose a closed-form expression to fit the relationship between the MS-SSIM and quantized output bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical expression between end-to-end performance metrics and SNR for semantic communications. Based on the proposed ABG formula, we investigate an adaptive power control scheme for semantic communications over random fading channels, which can effectively guarantee quality of service (QoS) for semantic communications, and then design the optimal power allocation scheme to maximize the energy efficiency of the semantic communication system. Furthermore, by exploiting the bisection algorithm, we develop the power allocation scheme to maximize the minimum QoS of multiple users for OFDMA downlink semantic communication Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ABG formula and power allocation schemes.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21062">A Hamiltonian Higher-Order Elasticity Framework for Dynamic Diagnostics(2HOED)</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ngueuleweu Tiwang Gildas</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning detects patterns, block chain guarantees trust and immutability, and modern causal inference identifies directional linkages, yet none alone exposes the full energetic anatomy of complex systems; the Hamiltonian Higher Order Elasticity Dynamics(2HOED) framework bridges these gaps. Grounded in classical mechanics but extended to Economics order elasticity terms, 2HOED represents economic, social, and physical systems as energy-based Hamiltonians whose position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk of elasticity jointly determine systemic power, Inertia, policy sensitivity, and marginal responses. Because the formalism is scaling free and coordinate agnostic, it transfers seamlessly from financial markets to climate science, from supply chain logistics to epidemiology, thus any discipline in which adaptation and shocks coexist. By embedding standard econometric variables inside a Hamiltonian, 2HOED enriches conventional economic analysis with rigorous diagnostics of resilience, tipping points, and feedback loops, revealing failure modes invisible to linear models. Wavelet spectra, phase space attractors, and topological persistence diagrams derived from 2HOED expose multistage policy leverage that machine learning detects only empirically and block chain secures only after the fact. For economists, physicians and other scientists, the method opens a new causal energetic channel linking biological or mechanical elasticity to macro level outcomes. Portable, interpretable, and computationally light, 2HOED turns data streams into dynamical energy maps, empowering decision makers to anticipate crises, design adaptive policies, and engineer robust systems delivering the predictive punch of AI with the explanatory clarity of physics.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21063">Token-Level Prompt Mixture with Parameter-Free Routing for Federated Domain Generalization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Gong, Chaoran Cui, Xiaolin Dong, Xiushan Nie, Lei Zhu, Xiaojun Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) aims to learn a globally generalizable model from decentralized clients with heterogeneous data while preserving privacy. Recent studies have introduced prompt learning to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) in FedDG by learning a single global prompt. However, such a one-prompt-fits-all learning paradigm typically leads to performance degradation on personalized samples. Although the mixture of experts (MoE) offers a promising solution for specialization, existing MoE-based methods suffer from coarse image-level expert assignment and high communication costs from parameterized routers. To address these limitations, we propose TRIP, a Token-level prompt mixture with parameter-free routing framework for FedDG, which treats multiple prompts as distinct experts. Unlike existing image-level routing designs, TRIP assigns different tokens within an image to specific experts. To ensure communication efficiency, TRIP incorporates a parameter-free routing mechanism based on token clustering and optimal transport. The instance-specific prompt is then synthesized by aggregating experts, weighted by the number of tokens assigned to each. Additionally, TRIP develops an unbiased learning strategy for prompt experts, leveraging the VLM's zero-shot generalization capability. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that TRIP achieves optimal generalization results, with communication of only 1K parameters per round.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengkai Yang, Xingping Dong, Xiaofen Zong</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven approaches for depression diagnosis have emerged as a significant research focus in neuromedicine, driven by the development of relevant datasets. Recently, graph neural network (GNN)-based models have gained widespread adoption due to their ability to capture brain channel functional connectivity from both spatial and temporal perspectives. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the absence of a robust temporal biomarker. In this paper, we introduce a novel and effective biomarker for depression diagnosis by leveraging the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and propose a customized graph network architecture based on Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN). Our model was trained on a dataset comprising 1,086 subjects, which is over 10 times larger than previous datasets in the field of depression diagnosis. Furthermore, to align with medical requirements, we performed propensity score matching (PSM) to create a refined subset, referred to as the PSM dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating our newly designed biomarker enhances the representation of temporal characteristics in brain channels, leading to improved F1 scores in both the real-world dataset and the PSM dataset. This advancement has the potential to contribute to the development of more effective depression diagnostic tools. In addition, we used SHapley Additive exPlaination (SHAP) to validate the interpretability of our model, ensuring its practical applicability in medical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Molecular optimization, aimed at improving binding affinity or other molecular properties, is a crucial task in drug discovery that often relies on the expertise of medicinal chemists. Recently, deep learning-based 3D generative models showed promise in enhancing the efficiency of molecular optimization. However, these models often struggle to adequately consider binding affinities with protein targets during lead optimization. Herein, we propose a 3D pocket-aware and affinity-guided diffusion model, named Diffleop, to optimize molecules with enhanced binding affinity. The model explicitly incorporates the knowledge of protein-ligand binding affinity to guide the denoising sampling for molecule generation with high affinity. The comprehensive evaluations indicated that Diffleop outperforms baseline models across multiple metrics, especially in terms of binding affinity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Karathanasis, John Violos, Ioannis Kompatsiaris, Symeon Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Training and deploying deepfake detection models on edge devices offers the advantage of maintaining data privacy and confidentiality by processing it close to its source. However, this approach is constrained by the limited computational and memory resources available at the edge. To address this challenge, we explore compression techniques to reduce computational demands and inference time, alongside transfer learning methods to minimize training overhead. Using the Synthbuster, RAISE, and ForenSynths datasets, we evaluate the effectiveness of pruning, knowledge distillation (KD), quantization, fine-tuning, and adapter-based techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate that both compression and transfer learning can be effectively achieved, even with a high compression level of 90%, remaining at the same performance level when the training and validation data originate from the same DeepFake model. However, when the testing dataset is generated by DeepFake models not present in the training set, a domain generalization issue becomes evident.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21069">R^2VFL: A Robust Random Vector Functional Link Network with Huber-Weighted Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anuradha Kumari, Mushir Akhtar, P. N. Suganthan, M. Tanveer</p>
<p>Abstract: The random vector functional link (RVFL) neural network has shown significant potential in overcoming the constraints of traditional artificial neural networks, such as excessive computation time and suboptimal solutions. However, RVFL faces challenges when dealing with noise and outliers, as it assumes all data samples contribute equally. To address this issue, we propose a novel robust framework, R2VFL, RVFL with Huber weighting function and class probability, which enhances the model's robustness and adaptability by effectively mitigating the impact of noise and outliers in the training data. The Huber weighting function reduces the influence of outliers, while the class probability mechanism assigns less weight to noisy data points, resulting in a more resilient model. We explore two distinct approaches for calculating class centers within the R2VFL framework: the simple average of all data points in each class and the median of each feature, the later providing a robust alternative by minimizing the effect of extreme values. These approaches give rise to two novel variants of the model-R2VFL-A and R2VFL-M. We extensively evaluate the proposed models on 47 UCI datasets, encompassing both binary and multiclass datasets, and conduct rigorous statistical testing, which confirms the superiority of the proposed models. Notably, the models also demonstrate exceptional performance in classifying EEG signals, highlighting their practical applicability in real-world biomedical domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jieming Bian, Yuanzhe Peng, Lei Wang, Yin Huang, Jie Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by providing robust, versatile architectures pre-trained on large-scale datasets. However, adapting these massive models to specific downstream tasks requires fine-tuning, which can be prohibitively expensive in computational resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by selectively updating only a small subset of parameters. Meanwhile, Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the integration of PEFT techniques within federated learning environments. We systematically categorize existing approaches into three main groups: Additive PEFT (which introduces new trainable parameters), Selective PEFT (which fine-tunes only subsets of existing parameters), and Reparameterized PEFT (which transforms model architectures to enable efficient updates). For each category, we analyze how these methods address the unique challenges of federated settings, including data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, computational constraints, and privacy concerns. We further organize the literature based on application domains, covering both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Finally, we discuss promising research directions, including scaling to larger foundation models, theoretical analysis of federated PEFT methods, and sustainable approaches for resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayan Alahyari, Mike Domaratzki</p>
<p>Abstract: Imbalanced regression refers to prediction tasks where the target variable is skewed. This skewness hinders machine learning models, especially neural networks, which concentrate on dense regions and therefore perform poorly on underrepresented (minority) samples. Despite the importance of this problem, only a few methods have been proposed for imbalanced regression. Many of the available solutions for imbalanced regression adapt techniques from the class imbalance domain, such as linear interpolation and the addition of Gaussian noise, to create synthetic data in sparse regions. However, in many cases, the underlying distribution of the data is complex and non-linear. Consequently, these approaches generate synthetic samples that do not accurately represent the true feature-target relationship. To overcome these limitations, we propose SMOGAN, a two-step oversampling framework for imbalanced regression. In Stage 1, an existing oversampler generates initial synthetic samples in sparse target regions. In Stage 2, we introduce DistGAN, a distribution-aware GAN that serves as SMOGAN's filtering layer and refines these samples via adversarial loss augmented with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy objective, aligning them with the true joint feature-target distribution. Extensive experiments on 23 imbalanced datasets show that SMOGAN consistently outperforms the default oversampling method without the DistGAN filtering layer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leandro Giusti Mugnaini, Bruno Lopes Yamamoto, Lucas Lauton de Alcantara, Victor Zacarias, Edson Bollis, Lucas Pellicer, Anna Helena Reali Costa, Artur Jordao</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning drives a new wave in computing systems and triggers the automation of increasingly complex problems. In particular, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced cognitive tasks, often matching or even surpassing human-level performance. However, their extensive parameters result in high computational costs and slow inference, posing challenges for deployment in resource-limited settings. Among the strategies to overcome the aforementioned challenges, pruning emerges as a successful mechanism since it reduces model size while maintaining predictive ability. In this paper, we introduce AMP: Attention Heads and MLP Pruning, a novel structured pruning method that efficiently compresses LLMs by removing less critical structures within Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). By projecting the input data onto weights, AMP assesses structural importance and overcomes the limitations of existing techniques, which often fall short in flexibility or efficiency. In particular, AMP surpasses the current state-of-the-art on commonsense reasoning tasks by up to 1.49 percentage points, achieving a 30% pruning ratio with minimal impact on zero-shot task performance. Moreover, AMP also improves inference speeds, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments. We confirm the flexibility of AMP on different families of LLMs, including LLaMA and Phi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyan Xu, Zhengtao Yao, Xuzhi Zhang, Ziyi Wang, Langzhou He, Yushun Dong, Philip S. Yu, Mengyuan Li, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of machine learning systems, particularly in dynamic and open-world environments. In the vision and text domains, zero-shot OOD detection - which requires no training on in-distribution (ID) data - has made significant progress through the use of large-scale pretrained models such as vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). However, zero-shot OOD detection in graph-structured data remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by complex relational structures and the absence of powerful, large-scale pretrained models for graphs. In this work, we take the first step toward enabling zero-shot graph OOD detection by leveraging a graph foundation model (GFM). We show that, when provided only with class label names, the GFM can perform OOD detection without any node-level supervision - outperforming existing supervised methods across multiple datasets. To address the more practical setting where OOD label names are unavailable, we introduce GLIP-OOD, a novel framework that employs LLMs to generate semantically informative pseudo-OOD labels from unlabeled data. These labels enable the GFM to capture nuanced semantic boundaries between ID and OOD classes and perform fine-grained OOD detection - without requiring any labeled nodes. Our approach is the first to enable node-level graph OOD detection in a fully zero-shot setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text-attributed graph datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neha Prakriya, Zijian Ding, Yizhou Sun, Jason Cong</p>
<p>Abstract: FPGAs are increasingly adopted in datacenter environments for their reconfigurability and energy efficiency. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools have eased FPGA programming by raising the abstraction level from RTL to untimed C/C++, yet attaining high performance still demands expert knowledge and iterative manual insertion of optimization pragmas to modify the microarchitecture. To address this challenge, we propose LIFT, a large language model (LLM)-based coding assistant for HLS that automatically generates performance-critical pragmas given a C/C++ design. We fine-tune the LLM by tightly integrating and supervising the training process with a graph neural network (GNN), combining the sequential modeling capabilities of LLMs with the structural and semantic understanding of GNNs necessary for reasoning over code and its control/data dependencies. On average, LIFT produces designs that improve performance by 3.52x and 2.16x than prior state-of the art AutoDSE and HARP respectively, and 66x than GPT-4o.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gulsah Hancerliogullari Koksalmis, Bulent Soykan, Laura J. Brattain, Hsin-Hsiung Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is marked by significant inter-individual variability in its progression, complicating accurate prognosis and personalized care planning. This heterogeneity underscores the critical need for predictive models capable of forecasting patient-specific disease trajectories. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers powerful tools to address this challenge by analyzing complex, multi-modal, and longitudinal patient data. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AI methodologies applied to personalized AD progression prediction. We review key approaches including state-space models for capturing temporal dynamics, deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence modeling, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for leveraging network structures, and the emerging concept of AI-driven digital twins for individualized simulation. Recognizing that data limitations often impede progress, we examine common challenges such as high dimensionality, missing data, and dataset imbalance. We further discuss AI-driven mitigation strategies, with a specific focus on synthetic data generation using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment and balance datasets. The survey synthesizes the strengths and limitations of current approaches, emphasizing the trend towards multimodal integration and the persistent need for model interpretability and generalizability. Finally, we identify critical open challenges, including robust external validation, clinical integration, and ethical considerations, and outline promising future research directions such as hybrid models, causal inference, and federated learning. This review aims to consolidate current knowledge and guide future efforts in developing clinically relevant AI tools for personalized AD prognostication.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Tensor-Trained Low-Rank Adaptation Mixture of Experts (TT-LoRA MoE), a novel computational framework integrating Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with sparse MoE routing to address scalability challenges in large model deployments. Unlike traditional MoE approaches, which face substantial computational overhead as expert counts grow, TT-LoRA MoE decomposes training into two distinct, optimized stages. First, we independently train lightweight, tensorized low-rank adapters (TT-LoRA experts), each specialized for specific tasks. Subsequently, these expert adapters remain frozen, eliminating inter-task interference and catastrophic forgetting in multi-task setting. A sparse MoE router, trained separately, dynamically leverages base model representations to select exactly one specialized adapter per input at inference time, automating expert selection without explicit task specification. Comprehensive experiments confirm our architecture retains the memory efficiency of low-rank adapters, seamlessly scales to large expert pools, and achieves robust task-level optimization. This structured decoupling significantly enhances computational efficiency and flexibility: uses only 2% of LoRA, 0.3% of Adapters and 0.03% of AdapterFusion parameters and outperforms AdapterFusion by 4 value in multi-tasking, enabling practical and scalable multi-task inference deployments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21198">Graph Synthetic Out-of-Distribution Exposure with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyan Xu, Zhengtao Yao, Ziyi Wang, Zhan Cheng, Xiyang Hu, Mengyuan Li, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in graphs is critical for ensuring model robustness in open-world and safety-sensitive applications. Existing approaches to graph OOD detection typically involve training an in-distribution (ID) classifier using only ID data, followed by the application of post-hoc OOD scoring techniques. Although OOD exposure - introducing auxiliary OOD samples during training - has proven to be an effective strategy for enhancing detection performance, current methods in the graph domain generally assume access to a set of real OOD nodes. This assumption, however, is often impractical due to the difficulty and cost of acquiring representative OOD samples. In this paper, we introduce GOE-LLM, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for OOD exposure in graph OOD detection without requiring real OOD nodes. GOE-LLM introduces two pipelines: (1) identifying pseudo-OOD nodes from the initially unlabeled graph using zero-shot LLM annotations, and (2) generating semantically informative synthetic OOD nodes via LLM-prompted text generation. These pseudo-OOD nodes are then used to regularize the training of the ID classifier for improved OOD awareness. We evaluate our approach across multiple benchmark datasets, showing that GOE-LLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph OOD detection methods that do not use OOD exposure and achieves comparable performance to those relying on real OOD data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Chen, Xingbo Fu, Yushun Dong, Jundong Li, Cong Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) empowers clients to collaboratively train Graph neural networks (GNNs) in a distributed manner while preserving data privacy. However, FGL methods usually require that the graph data owned by all clients is homophilic to ensure similar neighbor distribution patterns of nodes. Such an assumption ensures that the learned knowledge is consistent across the local models from all clients. Therefore, these local models can be properly aggregated as a global model without undermining the overall performance. Nevertheless, when the neighbor distribution patterns of nodes vary across different clients (e.g., when clients hold graphs with different levels of heterophily), their local models may gain different and even conflict knowledge from their node-level predictive tasks. Consequently, aggregating these local models usually leads to catastrophic performance deterioration on the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FedHERO, an FGL framework designed to harness and share insights from heterophilic graphs effectively. At the heart of FedHERO is a dual-channel GNN equipped with a structure learner, engineered to discern the structural knowledge encoded in the local graphs. With this specialized component, FedHERO enables the local model for each client to identify and learn patterns that are universally applicable across graphs with different patterns of node neighbor distributions. FedHERO not only enhances the performance of individual client models by leveraging both local and shared structural insights but also sets a new precedent in this field to effectively handle graph data with various node neighbor distribution patterns. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the superior performance of FedHERO against existing alternatives.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21211">A Cost-Effective LLM-based Approach to Identify Wildlife Trafficking in Online Marketplaces</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Juliana Barbosa, Ulhas Gondhali, Gohar Petrossian, Kinshuk Sharma, Sunandan Chakraborty, Jennifer Jacquet, Juliana Freire</p>
<p>Abstract: Wildlife trafficking remains a critical global issue, significantly impacting biodiversity, ecological stability, and public health. Despite efforts to combat this illicit trade, the rise of e-commerce platforms has made it easier to sell wildlife products, putting new pressure on wild populations of endangered and threatened species. The use of these platforms also opens a new opportunity: as criminals sell wildlife products online, they leave digital traces of their activity that can provide insights into trafficking activities as well as how they can be disrupted. The challenge lies in finding these traces. Online marketplaces publish ads for a plethora of products, and identifying ads for wildlife-related products is like finding a needle in a haystack. Learning classifiers can automate ad identification, but creating them requires costly, time-consuming data labeling that hinders support for diverse ads and research questions. This paper addresses a critical challenge in the data science pipeline for wildlife trafficking analytics: generating quality labeled data for classifiers that select relevant data. While large language models (LLMs) can directly label advertisements, doing so at scale is prohibitively expensive. We propose a cost-effective strategy that leverages LLMs to generate pseudo labels for a small sample of the data and uses these labels to create specialized classification models. Our novel method automatically gathers diverse and representative samples to be labeled while minimizing the labeling costs. Our experimental evaluation shows that our classifiers achieve up to 95% F1 score, outperforming LLMs at a lower cost. We present real use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling analyses of different aspects of wildlife trafficking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sixuan Wang, Jiao Yin, Jinli Cao, MingJian Tang, Hua Wang, Yanchun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to provide robust and generalizable representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kasra Jalaldoust, Saber Salehkaleybar, Negar Kiyavash</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of causal discovery (a.k.a., causal structure learning) in a multi-domain setting. We assume that the causal functions are invariant across the domains, while the distribution of the exogenous noise may vary. Under causal sufficiency (i.e., no confounders exist), we show that the causal diagram can be discovered under less restrictive functional assumptions compared to previous work. What enables causal discovery in this setting is bijective generation mechanisms (BGM), which ensures that the functional relation between the exogenous noise $E$ and the endogenous variable $Y$ is bijective and differentiable in both directions at every level of the cause variable $X = x$. BGM generalizes a variety of models including additive noise model, LiNGAM, post-nonlinear model, and location-scale noise model. Further, we derive a statistical test to find the parents set of the target variable. Experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Huang, Da-Qing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Biclustering is an effective technique in data mining and pattern recognition. Biclustering algorithms based on traditional clustering face two fundamental limitations when processing high-dimensional data: (1) The distance concentration phenomenon in high-dimensional spaces leads to data sparsity, rendering similarity measures ineffective; (2) Mainstream linear dimensionality reduction methods disrupt critical local structural patterns. To apply biclustering to high-dimensional datasets, we propose an orthogonal factor-based biclustering algorithm (BCBOF). First, we constructed orthogonal factors in the vector space of the high-dimensional dataset. Then, we performed clustering using the coordinates of the original data in the orthogonal subspace as clustering targets. Finally, we obtained biclustering results of the original dataset. Since dimensionality reduction was applied before clustering, the proposed algorithm effectively mitigated the data sparsity problem caused by high dimensionality. Additionally, we applied this biclustering algorithm to stock technical indicator combinations and stock price trend prediction. Biclustering results were transformed into fuzzy rules, and we incorporated profit-preserving and stop-loss rules into the rule set, ultimately forming a fuzzy inference system for stock price trend predictions and trading signals. To evaluate the performance of BCBOF, we compared it with existing biclustering methods using multiple evaluation metrics. The results showed that our algorithm outperformed other biclustering techniques. To validate the effectiveness of the fuzzy inference system, we conducted virtual trading experiments using historical data from 10 A-share stocks. The experimental results showed that the generated trading strategies yielded higher returns for investors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renqiang Luo, Ziqi Xu, Xikun Zhang, Qing Qing, Huafei Huang, Enyan Dai, Zhe Wang, Bo Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmenting specialised machine learning techniques into traditional graph learning models has achieved notable success across various domains, including federated graph learning, dynamic graph learning, and graph transformers. However, the intricate mechanisms of these specialised techniques introduce significant challenges in maintaining model fairness, potentially resulting in discriminatory outcomes in high-stakes applications such as recommendation systems, disaster response, criminal justice, and loan approval. This paper systematically examines the unique fairness challenges posed by Graph Learning augmented with Machine Learning (GL-ML). It highlights the complex interplay between graph learning mechanisms and machine learning techniques, emphasising how the augmentation of machine learning both enhances and complicates fairness. Additionally, we explore four critical techniques frequently employed to improve fairness in GL-ML methods. By thoroughly investigating the root causes and broader implications of fairness challenges in this rapidly evolving field, this work establishes a robust foundation for future research and innovation in GL-ML fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nanxu Gong, Xinyuan Wang, Wangyang Ying, Haoyue Bai, Sixun Dong, Haifeng Chen, Yanjie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature transformation involves generating a new set of features from the original dataset to enhance the data's utility. In certain domains like material performance screening, dimensionality is large and collecting labels is expensive and lengthy. It highly necessitates transforming feature spaces efficiently and without supervision to enhance data readiness and AI utility. However, existing methods fall short in efficient navigation of a vast space of feature combinations, and are mostly designed for supervised settings. To fill this gap, our unique perspective is to leverage a generator-critic duet-play teaming framework using LLM agents and in-context learning to derive pseudo-supervision from unsupervised data. The framework consists of three interconnected steps: (1) Critic agent diagnoses data to generate actionable advice, (2) Generator agent produces tokenized feature transformations guided by the critic's advice, and (3) Iterative refinement ensures continuous improvement through feedback between agents. The generator-critic framework can be generalized to human-agent collaborative generation, by replacing the critic agent with human experts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms even supervised baselines in feature transformation efficiency, robustness, and practical applicability across diverse datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xunpeng Huang, Yujin Han, Difan Zou, Yian Ma, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated appealing performance in both image and video generation. However, many works discover that they struggle to capture important, high-level relationships that are present in the real world. For example, they fail to learn physical laws from data, and even fail to understand that the objects in the world exist in a stable fashion. This is due to the fact that important conditional dependence structures are not adequately captured in the vanilla diffusion models. In this work, we initiate an in-depth study on strengthening the diffusion model to capture the conditional dependence structures in the data. In particular, we examine the efficacy of the auto-regressive (AR) diffusion models for such purpose and develop the first theoretical results on the sampling error of AR diffusion models under (possibly) the mildest data assumption. Our theoretical findings indicate that, compared with typical diffusion models, the AR variant produces samples with a reduced gap in approximating the data conditional distribution. On the other hand, the overall inference time of the AR-diffusion models is only moderately larger than that for the vanilla diffusion models, making them still practical for large scale applications. We also provide empirical results showing that when there is clear conditional dependence structure in the data, the AR diffusion models captures such structure, whereas vanilla DDPM fails to do so. On the other hand, when there is no obvious conditional dependence across patches of the data, AR diffusion does not outperform DDPM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkyu Lee, Tian Gao, Elliot Nelson, Miao Liu, Debarun Bhattacharjya, Songtao Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Many practical reinforcement learning environments have a discrete factored action space that induces a large combinatorial set of actions, thereby posing significant challenges. Existing approaches leverage the regular structure of the action space and resort to a linear decomposition of Q-functions, which avoids enumerating all combinations of factored actions. In this paper, we consider Q-functions defined over a lower dimensional projected subspace of the original action space, and study the condition for the unbiasedness of decomposed Q-functions using causal effect estimation from the no unobserved confounder setting in causal statistics. This leads to a general scheme which we call action decomposed reinforcement learning that uses the projected Q-functions to approximate the Q-function in standard model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed approach is shown to improve sample complexity in a model-based reinforcement learning setting. We demonstrate improvements in sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines in online continuous control environments and a real-world offline sepsis treatment environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Vahid Jamali, Hamid Saber, Jung Hyun Bae</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta federated learning (FL) is a personalized variant of FL, where multiple agents collaborate on training an initial shared model without exchanging raw data samples. The initial model should be trained in a way that current or new agents can easily adapt it to their local datasets after one or a few fine-tuning steps, thus improving the model personalization. Conventional meta FL approaches minimize the average loss of agents on the local models obtained after one step of fine-tuning. In practice, agents may need to apply several fine-tuning steps to adapt the global model to their local data, especially under highly heterogeneous data distributions across agents. To this end, we present a generalized framework for the meta FL by minimizing the average loss of agents on their local model after any arbitrary number $\nu$ of fine-tuning steps. For this generalized framework, we present a variant of the well-known federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm and conduct a comprehensive theoretical convergence analysis to characterize the convergence speed as well as behavior of the meta loss functions in both the exact and approximated cases. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and faster convergence for the proposed scheme compared to conventional approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao-Hsuan Tsai, Hsiao-Tung Juan, Pao-Hsiung Chiu, Chao-An Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks have emerged as a promising methodology for solving PDEs, gaining significant attention in computer science and various physics-related fields. Despite being demonstrated the ability to incorporate the physics of laws for versatile applications, PINNs still struggle with the challenging problems which are stiff to be solved and/or have high-frequency components in the solutions, resulting in accuracy and convergence issues. It may not only increase computational costs, but also lead to accuracy loss or solution divergence. In this study, an alternative approach is proposed to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. Inspired by the multi-grid method in CFD community, the underlying idea of the current approach is to efficiently remove different frequency errors via training with different levels of training samples, resulting in a simpler way to improve the training accuracy without spending time in fine-tuning of neural network structures, loss weights as well as hyperparameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of current approach, we first investigate canonical 1D ODE with high-frequency component and 2D convection-diffusion equation with V-cycle training strategy. Finally, the current method is employed for the classical benchmark problem of steady Lid-driven cavity flows at different Reynolds numbers, to investigate the applicability and efficacy for the problem involved multiple modes of high and low frequency. By virtue of various training sequence modes, improvement through predictions lead to 30% to 60% accuracy improvement. We also investigate the synergies between current method and transfer learning techniques for more challenging problems (i.e., higher Re). From the present results, it also revealed that the current framework can produce good predictions even for the case of Re=5000, demonstrating the ability to solve complex high-frequency PDEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinti Nayar, Kanica Sachdev, Brejesh Lall</p>
<p>Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction plays a crucial role in optimizing resource management and enhancing user satisfaction across both telecommunication and OTT services. While recent advances predominantly rely on deep learning models, this study introduces a lightweight generative modeling framework that balances computational efficiency, interpretability, and predictive accuracy. By validating the use of Vector Quantization (VQ) as a preprocessing technique, continuous network features are effectively transformed into discrete categorical symbols, enabling integration with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for temporal sequence modeling. This VQ-HMM pipeline enhances the model's capacity to capture dynamic QoE patterns while supporting probabilistic inference on new and unseen data. Experimental results on publicly available time-series datasets incorporating both objective indicators and subjective QoE scores demonstrate the viability of this approach in real-time and resource-constrained environments, where inference latency is also critical. The framework offers a scalable alternative to complex deep learning methods, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources or where latency constraints are critical.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traffic forecasting is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems, for which Machine Learning (ML) methods have been extensively explored to develop data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. Recent research focuses on modelling spatial-temporal correlations for short-term traffic prediction, leaving the favourable long-term forecasting a challenging and open issue. This paper presents a comparative study on large-scale real-world signalized arterials and freeway traffic flow datasets, aiming to evaluate promising ML methods in the context of large forecasting horizons up to 30 days. Focusing on modelling capacity for temporal dynamics, we develop one ensemble ML method, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and a range of Deep Learning (DL) methods, including Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based methods and the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method. Time embedding is leveraged to enhance their understanding of seasonality and event factors. Experimental results highlight that while the attention mechanism/Transformer framework is effective for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, as the forecasting horizon extends, the key to effective traffic forecasting gradually shifts from temporal dependency capturing to periodicity modelling. Time embedding is particularly effective in this context, helping naive RNN outperform Informer by 31.1% for 30-day-ahead forecasting. Meanwhile, as an efficient and robust model, XGBoost, while learning solely from time features, performs competitively with DL methods. Moreover, we investigate the impacts of various factors like input sequence length, holiday traffic, data granularity, and training data size. The findings offer valuable insights and serve as a reference for future long-term traffic forecasting research and the improvement of AI's corresponding learning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal representation learning has become a pivotal area in artificial intelligence, enabling the integration of diverse modalities such as vision, text, and audio to solve complex problems. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on bimodal interactions, such as image-text pairs, which limits their ability to fully exploit the richness of multi-modal data. Furthermore, the integration of modalities in equal-scale environments remains underexplored due to the challenges of constructing large-scale, balanced datasets. In this study, we propose Synergy-CLIP, a novel framework that extends the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) architecture to enhance multi-modal representation learning by integrating visual, textual, and audio modalities. Unlike existing methods that focus on adapting individual modalities to vanilla-CLIP, Synergy-CLIP aligns and captures latent information across three modalities equally. To address the high cost of constructing large-scale multi-modal datasets, we introduce VGG-sound+, a triple-modal dataset designed to provide equal-scale representation of visual, textual, and audio data. Synergy-CLIP is validated on various downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, where it outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, we introduce a missing modality reconstruction task, demonstrating Synergy-CLIP's ability to extract synergy among modalities in realistic application scenarios. These contributions provide a robust foundation for advancing multi-modal representation learning and exploring new research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are a powerful type of generative models that have achieved state-of-the-art results in various image synthesis tasks and have shown potential in other domains, such as natural language processing and temporal data modeling. Despite their stable training dynamics and ability to produce diverse high-quality samples, DMs are notorious for requiring significant computational resources, both in the training and inference stages. Previous work has focused mostly on increasing the efficiency of model inference. This paper introduces, for the first time, the paradigm of sparse-to-sparse training to DMs, with the aim of improving both training and inference efficiency. We focus on unconditional generation and train sparse DMs from scratch (Latent Diffusion and ChiroDiff) on six datasets using three different methods (Static-DM, RigL-DM, and MagRan-DM) to study the effect of sparsity in model performance. Our experiments show that sparse DMs are able to match and often outperform their Dense counterparts, while substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters and FLOPs. We also identify safe and effective values to perform sparse-to-sparse training of DMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pulkit Agrawal, Rukma Talwadker, Aditya Pareek, Tridib Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) offline reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on addressing function approximation errors, which contribute to the overestimation of Q-values for out-of-distribution actions, a challenge that static datasets exacerbate. However, high stakes applications such as recommendation systems in online gaming, introduce further complexities due to player's psychology (intent) driven by gameplay experiences and the inherent volatility on the platform. These factors create highly sparse, partially overlapping state spaces across policies, further influenced by the experiment path selection logic which biases state spaces towards specific policies. Current SOTA methods constrain learning from such offline data by clipping known counterfactual actions as out-of-distribution due to poor generalization across unobserved states. Further aggravating conservative Q-learning and necessitating more online exploration. FAST-Q introduces a novel approach that (1) leverages Gradient Reversal Learning to construct balanced state representations, regularizing the policy-specific bias between the player's state and action thereby enabling counterfactual estimation; (2) supports offline counterfactual exploration in parallel with static data exploitation; and (3) proposes a Q-value decomposition strategy for multi-objective optimization, facilitating explainable recommendations over short and long-term objectives. These innovations demonstrate superiority of FAST-Q over prior SOTA approaches and demonstrates at least 0.15 percent increase in player returns, 2 percent improvement in lifetime value (LTV), 0.4 percent enhancement in the recommendation driven engagement, 2 percent improvement in the player's platform dwell time and an impressive 10 percent reduction in the costs associated with the recommendation, on our volatile gaming platform.</p>

<p>Abstract: In tackling frequent anomalies in stamping processes, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised in-process anomaly monitoring framework, utilizing accelerometer signals and physics information, to capture the process anomaly effectively. The proposed framework facilitates the construction of a monitoring model with imbalanced sample distribution, which enables in-process condition monitoring in real-time to prevent batch anomalies, which helps to reduce batch defects risk and enhance production yield. Firstly, to effectively capture key features from raw data containing redundant information, a hybrid feature extraction algorithm is proposed to utilize data-driven methods and physical mechanisms simultaneously. Secondly, to address the challenge brought by imbalanced sample distribution, a semi-supervised anomaly detection model is established, which merely employs normal samples to build a golden baseline model, and a novel deviation score is proposed to quantify the anomaly level of each online stamping stroke. The effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method is validated with various classification algorithms. A real-world in-process dataset from stamping manufacturing workshop is employed to illustrate the superiority of proposed semi-supervised framework with enhance performance for process anomaly monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shermin Shahbazi, Mohammad-Reza Nasiri, Majid Ramezani</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate classification of EEG signals is crucial for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neuroprosthetic applications, yet many existing methods fail to account for the non-Euclidean, manifold structure of EEG data, resulting in suboptimal performance. Preserving this manifold information is essential to capture the true geometry of EEG signals, but traditional classification techniques largely overlook this need. To this end, we propose MPEC (Manifold-Preserved EEG Classification via an Ensemble of Clustering-Based Classifiers), that introduces two key innovations: (1) a feature engineering phase that combines covariance matrices and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels to capture both linear and non-linear relationships among EEG channels, and (2) a clustering phase that employs a modified K-means algorithm tailored for the Riemannian manifold space, ensuring local geometric sensitivity. Ensembling multiple clustering-based classifiers, MPEC achieves superior results, validated by significant improvements on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixuan Ma, Haichang Gao, Junxiang Huang, Ping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative training of a global model across multiple geographically dispersed clients without the need for data sharing. However, it is susceptible to inference attacks, particularly label inference attacks.
  Existing studies on label distribution inference exhibits sensitive to the specific settings of the victim client and typically underperforms under defensive strategies. In this study, we propose a novel label distribution inference attack that is stable and adaptable to various scenarios. Specifically, we estimate the size of the victim client's dataset and construct several virtual clients tailored to the victim client. We then quantify the temporal generalization of each class label for the virtual clients and utilize the variation in temporal generalization to train an inference model that predicts the label distribution proportions of the victim client.
  We validate our approach on multiple datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, FER2013, and AG-News. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, our attack remains effective even under differential privacy defense mechanisms, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Zanola, Louis Fabrice Tshimanga, Federico Del Pup, Marco Baiesi, Manfredo Atzori</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents xEEGNet, a novel, compact, and explainable neural network for EEG data analysis. It is fully interpretable and reduces overfitting through major parameter reduction. As an applicative use case, we focused on classifying common dementia conditions, Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia, versus controls. xEEGNet is broadly applicable to other neurological conditions involving spectral alterations. We initially used ShallowNet, a simple and popular model from the EEGNet-family. Its structure was analyzed and gradually modified to move from a "black box" to a more transparent model, without compromising performance. The learned kernels and weights were examined from a clinical standpoint to assess medical relevance. Model variants, including ShallowNet and the final xEEGNet, were evaluated using robust Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out cross-validation for unbiased performance estimates. Variability across data splits was explained using embedded EEG representations, grouped by class and set, with pairwise separability to quantify group distinction. Overfitting was assessed through training-validation loss correlation and training speed. xEEGNet uses only 168 parameters, 200 times fewer than ShallowNet, yet retains interpretability, resists overfitting, achieves comparable median performance (-1.5%), and reduces variability across splits. This variability is explained by embedded EEG representations: higher accuracy correlates with greater separation between test set controls and Alzheimer's cases, without significant influence from training data. xEEGNet's ability to filter specific EEG bands, learn band-specific topographies, and use relevant spectral features demonstrates its interpretability. While large deep learning models are often prioritized for performance, this study shows smaller architectures like xEEGNet can be equally effective in EEG pathology classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaru Liu, Yiqi Gu, Michael K. Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new optimization framework for the least squares learning problem via fully connected neural networks or physics-informed neural networks. The gradient descent sometimes behaves inefficiently in deep learning because of the high non-convexity of loss functions and the vanishing gradient issue. Our idea is to introduce auxiliary variables to separate the layers of the deep neural networks and reformulate the loss functions for ease of optimization. We design the self-adaptive weights to preserve the consistency between the reformulated loss and the original mean squared loss, which guarantees that optimizing the new loss helps optimize the original problem. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the consistency and show the effectiveness and robustness of our models over gradient descent.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21565">Towards proactive self-adaptive AI for non-stationary environments with dataset shifts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> David Fern\'andez Narro, Pablo Ferri, Juan M. Garc\'ia-G\'omez, Carlos S\'aez</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deployed in production frequently face challenges in maintaining their performance in non-stationary environments. This issue is particularly noticeable in medical settings, where temporal dataset shifts often occur. These shifts arise when the distributions of training data differ from those of the data encountered during deployment over time. Further, new labeled data to continuously retrain AI is not typically available in a timely manner due to data access limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a proactive self-adaptive AI approach, or pro-adaptive, where we model the temporal trajectory of AI parameters, allowing us to short-term forecast parameter values. To this end, we use polynomial spline bases, within an extensible Functional Data Analysis framework. We validate our methodology with a logistic regression model addressing prior probability shift, covariate shift, and concept shift. This validation is conducted on both a controlled simulated dataset and a publicly available real-world COVID-19 dataset from Mexico, with various shifts occurring between 2020 and 2024. Our results indicate that this approach enhances the performance of AI against shifts compared to baseline stable models trained at different time distances from the present, without requiring updated training data. This work lays the foundation for pro-adaptive AI research against dynamic, non-stationary environments, being compatible with data protection, in resilient AI production environments for health.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Forward-Forward algorithm has evolved in machine learning research, tackling more complex tasks that mimic real-life applications. In the last years, it has been improved by several techniques to perform better than its original version, handling a challenging dataset like CIFAR10 without losing its flexibility and low memory usage. We have shown in our results that improvements are achieved through a combination of convolutional channel grouping, learning rate schedules, and independent block structures during training that lead to a 20\% decrease in test error percentage. Additionally, to approach further implementations on low-capacity hardware projects we have presented a series of lighter models that achieve low test error percentages within (21$\pm$6)\% and number of trainable parameters between 164,706 and 754,386. This serving also as a basis for our future study on complete verification and validation of these kinds of neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony D Martin</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a generalization of modern representation learning objectives by reframing them as recursive divergence alignment processes over localized conditional distributions While recent frameworks like Information Contrastive Learning I-Con unify multiple learning paradigms through KL divergence between fixed neighborhood conditionals we argue this view underplays a crucial recursive structure inherent in the learning process. We introduce Recursive KL Divergence Optimization RKDO a dynamic formalism where representation learning is framed as the evolution of KL divergences across data neighborhoods. This formulation captures contrastive clustering and dimensionality reduction methods as static slices while offering a new path to model stability and local adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that RKDO offers dual efficiency advantages approximately 30 percent lower loss values compared to static approaches across three different datasets and 60 to 80 percent reduction in computational resources needed to achieve comparable results. This suggests that RKDOs recursive updating mechanism provides a fundamentally more efficient optimization landscape for representation learning with significant implications for resource constrained applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongguang Ye, Ming Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent methods leverage a hypernet to handle the performance-fairness trade-offs in federated learning. This hypernet maps the clients' preferences between model performance and fairness to preference-specifc models on the trade-off curve, known as local Pareto front. However, existing methods typically adopt a uniform preference sampling distribution to train the hypernet across clients, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of their local Pareto fronts. Meanwhile, from the perspective of generalization, they do not consider the gap between local and global Pareto fronts on the global dataset. To address these limitations, we propose HetPFL to effectively learn both local and global Pareto fronts. HetPFL comprises Preference Sampling Adaptation (PSA) and Preference-aware Hypernet Fusion (PHF). PSA adaptively determines the optimal preference sampling distribution for each client to accommodate heterogeneous local Pareto fronts. While PHF performs preference-aware fusion of clients' hypernets to ensure the performance of the global Pareto front. We prove that HetPFL converges linearly with respect to the number of rounds, under weaker assumptions than existing methods. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that HetPFL significantly outperforms seven baselines in terms of the quality of learned local and global Pareto fronts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atieh Rahmani, Mansoor Davoodi, Justin M. Calabrese</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering algorithms group data points by characteristics to identify patterns. Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cornelius Hake, Christian Friedrich</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines the digital value chain in automotive manufacturing, focusing on the identification, software flashing, customization, and commissioning of electronic control units in vehicle networks. A novel precedence graph design is proposed to optimize this process chain using an automated scheduling algorithm that employs mixed integer linear programming techniques. The results show significant improvements in key metrics. The algorithm reduces the number of production stations equipped with expensive hardware and software to execute digital value chain processes, while increasing capacity utilization through efficient scheduling and reduced idle time. Task parallelization is optimized, resulting in streamlined workflows and increased throughput. Compared to the traditional method, the automated approach has reduced preparation time by 50% and reduced scheduling activities, as it now takes two minutes to create the precedence graph. The flexibility of the algorithm's constraints allows for vehicle-specific configurations while maintaining high responsiveness, eliminating backup stations and facilitating the integration of new topologies. Automated scheduling significantly outperforms manual methods in efficiency, functionality, and adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aspen Hopkins, Sarah H. Cen, Andrew Ilyas, Isabella Struckman, Luis Videgaray, Aleksander M\k{a}dry</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI in recent years has led to the emergence of AI supply chains: complex networks of AI actors contributing models, datasets, and more to the development of AI products and services. AI supply chains have many implications yet are poorly understood. In this work, we take a first step toward a formal study of AI supply chains and their implications, providing two illustrative case studies indicating that both AI development and regulation are complicated in the presence of supply chains. We begin by presenting a brief historical perspective on AI supply chains, discussing how their rise reflects a longstanding shift towards specialization and outsourcing that signals the healthy growth of the AI industry. We then model AI supply chains as directed graphs and demonstrate the power of this abstraction by connecting examples of AI issues to graph properties. Finally, we examine two case studies in detail, providing theoretical and empirical results in both. In the first, we show that information passing (specifically, of explanations) along the AI supply chains is imperfect, which can result in misunderstandings that have real-world implications. In the second, we show that upstream design choices (e.g., by base model providers) have downstream consequences (e.g., on AI products fine-tuned on the base model). Together, our findings motivate further study of AI supply chains and their increasingly salient social, economic, regulatory, and technical implications.</p>

<p>Abstract: After two years of appearance, COVID-19 has negatively affected people and normal life around the world. As in May 2022, there are more than 522 million cases and six million deaths worldwide (including nearly ten million cases and over forty-three thousand deaths in Vietnam). Economy and society are both severely affected. The variant of COVID-19, Omicron, has broken disease prevention measures of countries and rapidly increased number of infections. Resources overloading in treatment and epidemics prevention is happening all over the world. It can be seen that, application of artificial intelligence (AI) to support people at this time is extremely necessary. There have been many studies applying AI to prevent COVID-19 which are extremely useful, and studies on machine reading comprehension (MRC) are also in it. Realizing that, we created the first MRC dataset about COVID-19 for Vietnamese: ViQA-COVID and can be used to build models and systems, contributing to disease prevention. Besides, ViQA-COVID is also the first multi-span extraction MRC dataset for Vietnamese, we hope that it can contribute to promoting MRC studies in Vietnamese and multilingual.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enes \"Ozeren, Yihong Liu, Hinrich Sch\"utze</p>
<p>Abstract: Many pre-trained language models (PLMs) exhibit suboptimal performance on mid- and low-resource languages, largely due to limited exposure to these languages during pre-training. A common strategy to address this is to introduce new tokens specific to the target languages, initialize their embeddings, and apply continual pre-training on target-language data. Among such methods, OFA (Liu et al., 2024a) proposes a similarity-based subword embedding initialization heuristic that is both effective and efficient. However, OFA restricts target-language token embeddings to be convex combinations of a fixed number of source-language embeddings, which may limit expressiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose HYPEROFA, a hypernetwork-based approach for more adaptive token embedding initialization. The hypernetwork is trained to map from an external multilingual word vector space to the PLMs token embedding space using source-language tokens. Once trained, it can generate flexible embeddings for target-language tokens, serving as a good starting point for continual pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that HYPEROFA consistently outperforms random initialization baseline and matches or exceeds the performance of OFA in both continual pre-training convergence and downstream task performance. We make the code publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaydip Sen, Rohit Pandey, Hetvi Waghela</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, generating high-quality text that balances coherence, diversity, and relevance remains challenging. Traditional decoding methods, such as bean search and top-k sampling, often struggle with either repetitive or incoherent outputs, particularly in tasks that require long-form text generation. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a novel enhancement of the well-known Contrastive Search algorithm, Context-Enhanced Contrastive Search (CECS) with contextual calibration. The proposed scheme introduces several novelties including dynamic contextual importance weighting, multi-level Contrastive Search, and adaptive temperature control, to optimize the balance between fluency, creativity, and precision. The performance of CECS is evaluated using several standard metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and semantic similarity. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both coherence and relevance of the generated texts by CECS outperforming the existing Contrastive Search techniques. The proposed algorithm has several potential applications in the real world including legal document drafting, customer service chatbots, and content marketing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Wang, David Smith Sundarsingh, Jyotirmoy V. Deshmukh, Yiannis Kantaros</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) has become a prevalent specification language for robotic tasks. To mitigate the significant manual effort and expertise required to define LTL-encoded tasks, several methods have been proposed for translating Natural Language (NL) instructions into LTL formulas, which, however, lack correctness guarantees. To address this, we introduce a new NL-to-LTL translation method, called ConformalNL2LTL, that can achieve user-defined translation success rates over unseen NL commands. Our method constructs LTL formulas iteratively by addressing a sequence of open-vocabulary Question-Answering (QA) problems with LLMs. To enable uncertainty-aware translation, we leverage conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool for black-box models. CP enables our method to assess the uncertainty in LLM-generated answers, allowing it to proceed with translation when sufficiently confident and request help otherwise. We provide both theoretical and empirical results demonstrating that ConformalNL2LTL achieves user-specified translation accuracy while minimizing help rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Cao, Mingrui Wu, Karthik Prasad, Yuandong Tian, Zechun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The post-training phase of large language models is essential for enhancing capabilities such as instruction-following, reasoning, and alignment with human preferences. However, it demands extensive high-quality data and poses risks like overfitting, alongside significant computational costs due to repeated post-training and evaluation after each base model update. This paper introduces $Param\Delta$, a novel method that streamlines post-training by transferring knowledge from an existing post-trained model to a newly updated base model with ZERO additional training. By computing the difference between post-trained model weights ($\Theta_\text{post}$) and base model weights ($\Theta_\text{base}$), and adding this to the updated base model ($\Theta'_\text{base}$), we define $Param\Delta$ Model as: $\Theta_{\text{Param}\Delta} = \Theta_\text{post} - \Theta_\text{base} + \Theta'_\text{base}$. This approach surprisingly equips the new base model with post-trained capabilities, achieving performance comparable to direct post-training. We did analysis on LLama3, Llama3.1, Qwen, and DeepSeek-distilled models. Results indicate $Param\Delta$ Model effectively replicates traditional post-training. For example, the $Param\Delta$ Model obtained from 70B Llama3-inst, Llama3-base, Llama3.1-base models attains approximately 95\% of Llama3.1-inst model's performance on average. $Param\Delta$ brings a new perspective on how to fully leverage models in the open-weight community, where checkpoints for base and instruct models are readily available and frequently updated, by providing a cost-free framework to accelerate the iterative cycle of model development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Pandey, Nageshwar Prasad Yadav, Mokshada Adduru, Sawan Rai</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing presence of multilingual users on social media, detecting abusive language in code-mixed text has become increasingly challenging. Code-mixed communication, where users seamlessly switch between English and their native languages, poses difficulties for traditional abuse detection models, as offensive content may be context-dependent or obscured by linguistic blending. While abusive language detection has been extensively explored for high-resource languages like English and Hindi, low-resource languages such as Telugu and Nepali remain underrepresented, leaving gaps in effective moderation. In this study, we introduce a novel, manually annotated dataset of 2 thousand Telugu-English and 5 Nepali-English code-mixed comments, categorized as abusive and non-abusive, collected from various social media platforms. The dataset undergoes rigorous preprocessing before being evaluated across multiple Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Large Language Models (LLMs). We experimented with models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), LSTM, CNN, and LLMs, optimizing their performance through hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate it using 10-fold cross-validation and statistical significance testing (t-test). Our findings provide key insights into the challenges of detecting abusive language in code-mixed settings and offer a comparative analysis of computational approaches. This study contributes to advancing NLP for low-resource languages by establishing benchmarks for abusive language detection in Telugu-English and Nepali-English code-mixed text. The dataset and insights can aid in the development of more robust moderation strategies for multilingual social media environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Montoya Sanchez, Shaswata Mitra, Aritran Piplai, Sudip Mittal</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of malware variants requires robust classification methods to enhance cybersecurity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for generating malware descriptions to aid family classification, their utility is limited by semantic embedding overlaps and misalignment with binary behavioral features. We propose a contrastive fine-tuning (CFT) method that refines LLM embeddings via targeted selection of hard negative samples based on cosine similarity, enabling LLMs to distinguish between closely related malware families. Our approach combines high-similarity negatives to enhance discriminative power and mid-tier negatives to increase embedding diversity, optimizing both precision and generalization. Evaluated on the CIC-AndMal-2020 and BODMAS datasets, our refined embeddings are integrated into a multimodal classifier within a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework on a few-shot setting. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: our method achieves 63.15% classification accuracy with as few as 20 samples on CIC-AndMal-2020, outperforming baselines by 11--21 percentage points and surpassing prior negative sampling strategies. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of similarity-based selection over random sampling, with gains of 10-23%. Additionally, fine-tuned LLMs generate attribute-aware descriptions that generalize to unseen variants, bridging textual and binary feature gaps. This work advances malware classification by enabling nuanced semantic distinctions and provides a scalable framework for adapting LLMs to cybersecurity challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lior Limonad, Fabiana Fournier, Hadar Mulian, George Manias, Spiros Borotis, Danai Kyrkou</p>
<p>Abstract: The perceived quality of the explanations accompanying e-government services is key to gaining trust in these institutions, consequently amplifying further usage of these services. Recent advances in generative AI, and concretely in Large Language Models (LLMs) allow the automation of such content articulations, eliciting explanations' interpretability and fidelity, and more generally, adapting content to various audiences. However, selecting the right LLM type for this has become a non-trivial task for e-government service providers. In this work, we adapted a previously developed scale to assist with this selection, providing a systematic approach for the comparative analysis of the perceived quality of explanations generated by various LLMs. We further demonstrated its applicability through the tax-return process, using it as an exemplar use case that could benefit from employing an LLM to generate explanations about tax refund decisions. This was attained through a user study with 128 survey respondents who were asked to rate different versions of LLM-generated explanations about tax refund decisions, providing a methodological basis for selecting the most appropriate LLM. Recognizing the practical challenges of conducting such a survey, we also began exploring the automation of this process by attempting to replicate human feedback using a selection of cutting-edge predictive techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Syros, Anshuman Suri, Cristina Nita-Rotaru, Alina Oprea</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly interact, collaborate, and delegate tasks to one another autonomously with minimal human interaction. Industry guidelines for agentic system governance emphasize the need for users to maintain comprehensive control over their agents, mitigating potential damage from malicious agents. Several proposed agentic system designs address agent identity, authorization, and delegation, but remain purely theoretical, without concrete implementation and evaluation. Most importantly, they do not provide user-controlled agent management. To address this gap, we propose SAGA, a Security Architecture for Governing Agentic systems, that offers user oversight over their agents' lifecycle. In our design, users register their agents with a central entity, the Provider, that maintains agents contact information, user-defined access control policies, and helps agents enforce these policies on inter-agent communication. We introduce a cryptographic mechanism for deriving access control tokens, that offers fine-grained control over an agent's interaction with other agents, balancing security and performance consideration. We evaluate SAGA on several agentic tasks, using agents in different geolocations, and multiple on-device and cloud LLMs, demonstrating minimal performance overhead with no impact on underlying task utility in a wide range of conditions. Our architecture enables secure and trustworthy deployment of autonomous agents, accelerating the responsible adoption of this technology in sensitive environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Xin, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Shuyue Stella Li, Michael Duan, Hyunwoo Kim, Yejin Choi, Yulia Tsvetkov, Sewoong Oh, Pang Wei Koh</p>
<p>Abstract: Sanitizing sensitive text data typically involves removing personally identifiable information (PII) or generating synthetic data under the assumption that these methods adequately protect privacy; however, their effectiveness is often only assessed by measuring the leakage of explicit identifiers but ignoring nuanced textual markers that can lead to re-identification. We challenge the above illusion of privacy by proposing a new framework that evaluates re-identification attacks to quantify individual privacy risks upon data release. Our approach shows that seemingly innocuous auxiliary information -- such as routine social activities -- can be used to infer sensitive attributes like age or substance use history from sanitized data. For instance, we demonstrate that Azure's commercial PII removal tool fails to protect 74\% of information in the MedQA dataset. Although differential privacy mitigates these risks to some extent, it significantly reduces the utility of the sanitized text for downstream tasks. Our findings indicate that current sanitization techniques offer a \textit{false sense of privacy}, highlighting the need for more robust methods that protect against semantic-level information leakage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Du, Shang Liu, Yang Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has become an essential strategy for adapting them to specialized tasks; however, this process introduces significant privacy challenges, as sensitive training data may be inadvertently memorized and exposed. Although differential privacy (DP) offers strong theoretical guarantees against such leakage, its empirical privacy effectiveness on LLMs remains unclear, especially under different fine-tuning methods. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of DP across fine-tuning methods and privacy budgets, using both data extraction and membership inference attacks to assess empirical privacy risks. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Differential privacy reduces model utility, but its impact varies significantly across different fine-tuning methods. (2) Without DP, the privacy risks of models fine-tuned with different approaches differ considerably. (3) When DP is applied, even a relatively high privacy budget can substantially lower privacy risk. (4) The privacy-utility trade-off under DP training differs greatly among fine-tuning methods, with some methods being unsuitable for DP due to severe utility degradation. Our results provide practical guidance for privacy-conscious deployment of LLMs and pave the way for future research on optimizing the privacy-utility trade-off in fine-tuning methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiamin Chang, Haoyang Li, Hammond Pearce, Ruoxi Sun, Bo Li, Minhui Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has amplified concerns about trustworthiness, including integrity, privacy, robustness, and bias. To assess and attribute these threats, we propose ConceptLens, a generic framework that leverages pre-trained multimodal models to identify the root causes of integrity threats by analyzing Concept Shift in probing samples. ConceptLens demonstrates strong detection performance for vanilla data poisoning attacks and uncovers vulnerabilities to bias injection, such as the generation of covert advertisements through malicious concept shifts. It identifies privacy risks in unaltered but high-risk samples, filters them before training, and provides insights into model weaknesses arising from incomplete or imbalanced training data. Additionally, at the model level, it attributes concepts that the target model is overly dependent on, identifies misleading concepts, and explains how disrupting key concepts negatively impacts the model. Furthermore, it uncovers sociological biases in generative content, revealing disparities across sociological contexts. Strikingly, ConceptLens reveals how safe training and inference data can be unintentionally and easily exploited, potentially undermining safety alignment. Our study informs actionable insights to breed trust in AI systems, thereby speeding adoption and driving greater innovation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Henry Grebe, Tobias Braun, Marcus Rohrbach, Anna Rohrbach</p>
<p>Abstract: The expansion of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has raised growing concerns about their potential to generate undesirable or harmful content, ranging from fabricated depictions of public figures to sexually explicit images. To mitigate these risks, prior work has devised machine unlearning techniques that attempt to erase unwanted concepts through fine-tuning. However, in this paper, we introduce a new threat model, Toxic Erasure (ToxE), and demonstrate how recent unlearning algorithms, including those explicitly designed for robustness, can be circumvented through targeted backdoor attacks. The threat is realized by establishing a link between a trigger and the undesired content. Subsequent unlearning attempts fail to erase this link, allowing adversaries to produce harmful content. We instantiate ToxE via two established backdoor attacks: one targeting the text encoder and another manipulating the cross-attention layers. Further, we introduce Deep Intervention Score-based Attack (DISA), a novel, deeper backdoor attack that optimizes the entire U-Net using a score-based objective, improving the attack's persistence across different erasure methods. We evaluate five recent concept erasure methods against our threat model. For celebrity identity erasure, our deep attack circumvents erasure with up to 82% success, averaging 57% across all erasure methods. For explicit content erasure, ToxE attacks can elicit up to 9 times more exposed body parts, with DISA yielding an average increase by a factor of 2.9. These results highlight a critical security gap in current unlearning strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naheed Rayhan, Md. Ashrafuzzaman</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated the capability to generate human like, natural responses across a range of tasks, including task oriented dialogue and question answering. However, their application in real world, critical scenarios is often hindered by a tendency to produce inaccurate information and a limited ability to leverage external knowledge sources. This paper introduces the LLM ENHANCER system, designed to integrate multiple online sources such as Google, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo to enhance data accuracy. The LLMs employed within this system are open source. The data acquisition process for the LLM ENHANCER system operates in parallel, utilizing custom agent tools to manage the flow of information. Vector embeddings are used to identify the most pertinent information, which is subsequently supplied to the LLM for user interaction. The LLM ENHANCER system mitigates hallucinations in chat based LLMs while preserving response naturalness and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanjing Xu, Xiaoyuan Liu, Alex Pothen, Ilya Safro</p>
<p>Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the promising variational approaches of quantum computing to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In QAOA, variational parameters need to be optimized by solving a series of nonlinear, nonconvex optimization programs. In this work, we propose a QAOA parameter transfer scheme using Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to solve Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problems. We prepare optimized parameters for graphs of 12 and 14 vertices and use GATs to transfer their parameters to larger graphs. Additionally, we design a hybrid distributed resource-aware algorithm for MIS (HyDRA-MIS), which decomposes large problems into smaller ones that can fit onto noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We integrate our GAT-based parameter transfer approach to HyDRA-MIS and demonstrate competitive results compared to KaMIS, a state-of-the-art classical MIS solver, on graphs with several thousands vertices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murali Ramanujam, Yinwei Dai, Kyle Jamieson, Ravi Netravali</p>
<p>Abstract: Continually retraining models has emerged as a primary technique to enable high-accuracy video analytics on edge devices. Yet, existing systems employ such adaptation by relying on the spare compute resources that traditional (memory-constrained) edge servers afford. In contrast, mobile edge devices such as drones and dashcams offer a fundamentally different resource profile: weak(er) compute with abundant unified memory pools. We present Legilimens, a continuous learning system for the mobile edge's System-on-Chip GPUs. Our driving insight is that visually distinct scenes that require retraining exhibit substantial overlap in model embeddings; if captured into a base model on device memory, specializing to each new scene can become lightweight, requiring very few samples. To practically realize this approach, Legilimens presents new, compute-efficient techniques to (1) select high-utility data samples for retraining specialized models, (2) update the base model without complete retraining, and (3) time-share compute resources between retraining and live inference for maximal accuracy. Across diverse workloads, Legilimens lowers retraining costs by 2.8-10x compared to existing systems, resulting in 18-45% higher accuracies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Egger, R\"udiger Urbanke, Rawad Bitar</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy in federated learning is crucial, encompassing two key aspects: safeguarding the privacy of clients' data and maintaining the privacy of the federator's objective from the clients. While the first aspect has been extensively studied, the second has received much less attention.
  We present a novel approach that addresses both concerns simultaneously, drawing inspiration from techniques in knowledge distillation and private information retrieval to provide strong information-theoretic privacy guarantees.
  Traditional private function computation methods could be used here; however, they are typically limited to linear or polynomial functions. To overcome these constraints, our approach unfolds in three stages. In stage 0, clients perform the necessary computations locally. In stage 1, these results are shared among the clients, and in stage 2, the federator retrieves its desired objective without compromising the privacy of the clients' data. The crux of the method is a carefully designed protocol that combines secret-sharing-based multi-party computation and a graph-based private information retrieval scheme. We show that our method outperforms existing tools from the literature when properly adapted to this setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for the multi-class classification of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We utilize a publicly available dataset containing MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Our primary objective is to build a light weight deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumor types with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.78%, indicating its potential as a diagnostic aid in clinical settings. The proposed method offers a low-complexity yet effective solution for assisting in early brain tumor diagnosis.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21191">Small or Large? Zero-Shot or Finetuned? Guiding Language Model Choice for Specialized Applications in Healthcare</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lovedeep Gondara, Jonathan Simkin, Graham Sayle, Shebnum Devji, Gregory Arbour, Raymond Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aims to guide language model selection by investigating: 1) the necessity of finetuning versus zero-shot usage, 2) the benefits of domain-adjacent versus generic pretrained models, 3) the value of further domain-specific pretraining, and 4) the continued relevance of Small Language Models (SLMs) compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks. Using electronic pathology reports from the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), three classification scenarios with varying difficulty and data size are evaluated. Models include various SLMs and an LLM. SLMs are evaluated both zero-shot and finetuned; the LLM is evaluated zero-shot only. Finetuning significantly improved SLM performance across all scenarios compared to their zero-shot results. The zero-shot LLM outperformed zero-shot SLMs but was consistently outperformed by finetuned SLMs. Domain-adjacent SLMs generally performed better than the generic SLM after finetuning, especially on harder tasks. Further domain-specific pretraining yielded modest gains on easier tasks but significant improvements on the complex, data-scarce task. The results highlight the critical role of finetuning for SLMs in specialized domains, enabling them to surpass zero-shot LLM performance on targeted classification tasks. Pretraining on domain-adjacent or domain-specific data provides further advantages, particularly for complex problems or limited finetuning data. While LLMs offer strong zero-shot capabilities, their performance on these specific tasks did not match that of appropriately finetuned SLMs. In the era of LLMs, SLMs remain relevant and effective, offering a potentially superior performance-resource trade-off compared to LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kelsey E. Ennis, Elizabeth A. Barnes, Marybeth C. Arcodia, Martin A. Fernandez, Eric D. Maloney</p>
<p>Abstract: Extreme heat is the deadliest weather-related hazard in the United States. Furthermore, it is increasing in intensity, frequency, and duration, making skillful forecasts vital to protecting life and property. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models struggle with extreme heat for medium-range and subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence-based weather prediction (AIWP) models are progressing rapidly. However, it is largely unknown how well AIWP models forecast extremes, especially for medium-range and S2S timescales. This study investigates 2-m temperature forecasts for 60 heat waves across the four boreal seasons and over four CONUS regions at lead times up to 20 days, using two AIWP models (Google GraphCast and Pangu-Weather) and one traditional NWP model (NOAA United Forecast System Global Ensemble Forecast System (UFS GEFS)). First, case study analyses show that both AIWP models and the UFS GEFS exhibit consistent cold biases on regional scales in the 5-10 days of lead time before heat wave onset. GraphCast is the more skillful AIWP model, outperforming UFS GEFS and Pangu-Weather in most locations. Next, the two AIWP models are isolated and analyzed across all heat waves and seasons, with events split among the model's testing (2018-2023) and training (1979-2017) periods. There are cold biases before and during the heat waves in both models and all seasons, except Pangu-Weather in winter, which exhibits a mean warm bias before heat wave onset. Overall, results offer encouragement that AIWP models may be useful for medium-range and S2S predictability of extreme heat.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Terrance Liu, Eileen Xiao, Pratiksha Thaker, Adam Smith, Zhiwei Steven Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of reconstructing tabular data from aggregate statistics, in which the attacker aims to identify interesting claims about the sensitive data that can be verified with 100% certainty given the aggregates. Successful attempts in prior work have conducted studies in settings where the set of published statistics is rich enough that entire datasets can be reconstructed with certainty. In our work, we instead focus on the regime where many possible datasets match the published statistics, making it impossible to reconstruct the entire private dataset perfectly (i.e., when approaches in prior work fail). We propose the problem of partial data reconstruction, in which the goal of the adversary is to instead output a $\textit{subset}$ of rows and/or columns that are $\textit{guaranteed to be correct}$. We introduce a novel integer programming approach that first $\textbf{generates}$ a set of claims and then $\textbf{verifies}$ whether each claim holds for all possible datasets consistent with the published aggregates. We evaluate our approach on the housing-level microdata from the U.S. Decennial Census release, demonstrating that privacy violations can still persist even when information published about such data is relatively sparse.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artefacts compromise clinical decision-making in the use of medical time series. Pulsatile waveforms offer probabilities for accurate artefact detection, yet most approaches rely on supervised manners and overlook patient-level distribution shifts. To address these issues, we introduce a generalised label-free framework, GenClean, for real-time artefact cleaning and leverage an in-house dataset of 180,000 ten-second arterial blood pressure (ABP) samples for training. We first investigate patient-level generalisation, demonstrating robust performances under both intra- and inter-patient distribution shifts. We further validate its effectiveness through challenging cross-disease cohort experiments on the MIMIC-III database. Additionally, we extend our method to photoplethysmography (PPG), highlighting its applicability to diverse medical pulsatile signals. Finally, its integration into ICM+, a clinical research monitoring software, confirms the real-time feasibility of our framework, emphasising its practical utility in continuous physiological monitoring. This work provides a foundational step toward precision medicine in improving the reliability of high-resolution medical time series analysis</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have great potential in medical imaging, including orthodontics and skeletal maturity assessment. However, applying a model to data different from its training set can lead to unreliable predictions that may impact patient care. To address this, we propose a comprehensive verification framework that evaluates model suitability through multiple complementary strategies. First, we introduce a Gradient Attention Map (GAM)-based approach that analyzes attention patterns using Grad-CAM and compares them via similarity metrics such as IoU, Dice Similarity, SSIM, Cosine Similarity, Pearson Correlation, KL Divergence, and Wasserstein Distance. Second, we extend verification to early convolutional feature maps, capturing structural mis-alignments missed by attention alone. Finally, we incorporate an additional garbage class into the classification model to explicitly reject out-of-distribution inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that these combined methods effectively identify unsuitable models and inputs, promoting safer and more reliable deployment of deep learning in medical imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neck ultrasound (US) plays a vital role in airway management by providing non-invasive, real-time imaging that enables rapid and precise interventions. Deep learning-based anatomical landmark detection in neck US can further facilitate procedural efficiency. However, class imbalance within datasets, where key structures like tracheal rings and vocal folds are underrepresented, presents significant challenges for object detection models. To address this, we propose T2ID-CAS, a hybrid approach that combines a text-to-image latent diffusion model with class-aware sampling to generate high-quality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes. This approach, rarely explored in the ultrasound domain, improves the representation of minority classes. Experimental results using YOLOv9 for anatomical landmark detection in neck US demonstrated that T2ID-CAS achieved a mean Average Precision of 88.2, significantly surpassing the baseline of 66. This highlights its potential as a computationally efficient and scalable solution for mitigating class imbalance in AI-assisted ultrasound-guided interventions.</p>

We present the Fitbit Body Response Algorithm, an approach to continuous remote measurement of ANS activation through widely available remote wrist-based sensors. The design was validated via two experiments, a Trier Social Stress Test (n = 45) and ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of perceived stress (n=87), providing both controlled and ecologically valid test data. Model performance predicting perceived stress when using all available sensor modalities was consistent with expectations (accuracy=0.85) and outperformed models with access to only a subset of the signals. We discuss and address challenges to sensing that arise in real world settings that do not present in conventional lab environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Energy-efficient ventilation control plays a vital role in reducing building energy consumption while ensuring occupant health and comfort. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations offer high-fidelity modeling of airflow for building HVAC design, their high computational cost makes them impractical for practical adoption in real-time building management system. In this work, we present a data-driven framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable energy-efficient building ventilation control. Our method jointly optimizes airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train a neural operator transformer to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow field distributions using high-resolution CFD data. This learned operator enables a gradient-based control framework capable of optimal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, and data-driven control based on regional average CO2 predictions, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method for enabling safe and energy-efficient building management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. Chalavadi, A. Pastor, T. Leitch</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate imputation of race and ethnicity (R&E) is crucial for analyzing disparities and informing policy. Methods like Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) are widely used but exhibit limitations, including systematic misclassification biases linked to socioeconomic status. This paper introduces LSTM+Geo, a novel approach enhancing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with census tract geolocation information. Using a large voter dataset, we demonstrate that LSTM+Geo (88.7% accuracy) significantly outperforms standalone LSTM (86.4%) and Bayesian methods like BISG (82.9%) and BIFSG (86.8%) in accuracy and F1-score on a held-out validation set. LSTM+Geo reduces the rate at which non-White individuals are misclassified as White (White FPR 19.3%) compared to name-only LSTMs (White FPR 24.6%). While sophisticated ensemble methods incorporating XGBoost achieve the highest overall accuracy (up to 89.4%) and lowest White FPR (17.8%), LSTM+Geo offers strong standalone performance with improved bias characteristics compared to baseline models. Integrating LSTM+Geo into an XGBoost ensemble further boosts accuracy, highlighting its utility as both a standalone model and a component for advanced systems. We give a caution at the end regarding the appropriate use of these methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Glover, Parikshit Pareek, Deepjyoti Deka, Anamika Dubey</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based approaches are increasingly leveraged to manage and coordinate the operation of grid-edge resources in active power distribution networks. Among these, model-based techniques stand out for their superior data efficiency and robustness compared to model-free methods. However, effective model learning requires a learning-based approximator for the underlying power flow model. This study extends existing work by introducing a data-driven power flow method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) to approximate the multiphase power flow model, by mapping net load injections to nodal voltages. Simulation results using the IEEE 123-bus and 8500-node distribution test feeders demonstrate that the trained GP model can reliably predict the nonlinear power flow solutions with minimal training data. We also conduct a comparative analysis of the training efficiency and testing performance of the proposed GP-based power flow approximator against a deep neural network-based approximator, highlighting the advantages of our data-efficient approach. Results over realistic operating conditions show that despite an 85% reduction in the training sample size (corresponding to a 92.8% improvement in training time), GP models produce a 99.9% relative reduction in mean absolute error compared to the baselines of deep neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinpeng Wang, Tianci Luo, Yaohua Zha, Yan Feng, Ruisheng Luo, Bin Chen, Tao Dai, Long Chen, Yaowei Wang, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) enables adaptively solving vision tasks by leveraging pixel demonstrations, mimicking human-like task completion through analogy. Prompt selection is critical in VICL, but current methods assume the existence of a single "ideal" prompt in a pool of candidates, which in practice may not hold true. Multiple suitable prompts may exist, but individually they often fall short, leading to difficulties in selection and the exclusion of useful context. To address this, we propose a new perspective: prompt condensation. Rather than relying on a single prompt, candidate prompts collaborate to efficiently integrate informative contexts without sacrificing resolution. We devise Condenser, a lightweight external plugin that compresses relevant fine-grained context across multiple prompts. Optimized end-to-end with the backbone, Condenser ensures accurate integration of contextual cues. Experiments demonstrate Condenser outperforms state-of-the-arts across benchmark tasks, showing superior context compression, scalability with more prompts, and enhanced computational efficiency compared to ensemble methods, positioning it as a highly competitive solution for VICL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Xie, Yaoyao Fiona Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of machine learning (ML)-based process monitoring systems has significantly advanced additive manufacturing (AM) by enabling real-time defect detection, quality assessment, and process optimization. However, redundancy is a critical yet often overlooked challenge in the deployment and operation of ML-based AM process monitoring systems. Excessive redundancy leads to increased equipment costs, compromised model performance, and high computational requirements, posing barriers to industrial adoption. However, existing research lacks a unified definition of redundancy and a systematic framework for its evaluation and mitigation. This paper defines redundancy in ML-based AM process monitoring and categorizes it into sample-level, feature-level, and model-level redundancy. A comprehensive multi-level redundancy mitigation (MLRM) framework is proposed, incorporating advanced methods such as data registration, downscaling, cross-modality knowledge transfer, and model pruning to systematically reduce redundancy while improving model performance. The framework is validated through an ML-based in-situ defect detection case study for directed energy deposition (DED), demonstrating a 91% reduction in latency, a 47% decrease in error rate, and a 99.4% reduction in storage requirements. Additionally, the proposed approach lowers sensor costs and energy consumption, enabling a lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring system. By defining redundancy and introducing a structured mitigation framework, this study establishes redundancy analysis and mitigation as a key enabler of efficient ML-based process monitoring in production environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Wu, Qian Ma, Prasenjit Mitra, Sencun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation has become a cornerstone in modern machine learning systems, celebrated for its ability to transfer knowledge from a large, complex teacher model to a more efficient student model. Traditionally, this process is regarded as secure, assuming the teacher model is clean. This belief stems from conventional backdoor attacks relying on poisoned training data with backdoor triggers and attacker-chosen labels, which are not involved in the distillation process. Instead, knowledge distillation uses the outputs of a clean teacher model to guide the student model, inherently preventing recognition or response to backdoor triggers as intended by an attacker. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by introducing a novel attack methodology that strategically poisons the distillation dataset with adversarial examples embedded with backdoor triggers. This technique allows for the stealthy compromise of the student model while maintaining the integrity of the teacher model. Our innovative approach represents the first successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within the knowledge distillation process using clean teacher models. Through extensive experiments conducted across various datasets and attack settings, we demonstrate the robustness, stealthiness, and effectiveness of our method. Our findings reveal previously unrecognized vulnerabilities and pave the way for future research aimed at securing knowledge distillation processes against backdoor attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aoi Kato, Kenta Kojima, Masahiro Nomura, Isao Ono</p>
<p>Abstract: Black-box discrete optimization (BB-DO) problems arise in many real-world applications, such as neural architecture search and mathematical model estimation. A key challenge in BB-DO is epistasis among parameters where multiple variables must be modified simultaneously to effectively improve the objective function. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) provide a powerful framework for tackling BB-DO problems. In particular, an EDA leveraging a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has demonstrated strong performance on relatively low-dimensional problems with epistasis while reducing computational cost. Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms such as DSMGA-II and P3, which integrate bit-flip-based local search with linkage learning, have shown excellent performance on high-dimensional problems. In this study, we propose a new memetic algorithm that combines VAE-based sampling with local search. The proposed method inherits the strengths of both VAE-based EDAs and local search-based approaches: it effectively handles high-dimensional problems with epistasis among parameters without incurring excessive computational overhead. Experiments on NK landscapes -- a challenging benchmark for BB-DO involving epistasis among parameters -- demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art VAE-based EDA methods, as well as leading approaches such as P3 and DSMGA-II.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> St\'ephane Lhaut, Holger Rootz\'en, Johan Segers</p>
<p>Abstract: Economically responsible mitigation of multivariate extreme risks -- extreme rainfall in a large area, huge variations of many stock prices, widespread breakdowns in transportation systems -- requires estimates of the probabilities that such risks will materialize in the future. This paper develops a new method, Wasserstein--Aitchison Generative Adversarial Networks (WA-GAN), which provides simulated values of future $d$-dimensional multivariate extreme events and which hence can be used to give estimates of such probabilities. The main hypothesis is that, after transforming the observations to the unit-Pareto scale, their distribution is regularly varying in the sense that the distributions of their radial and angular components (with respect to the $L_1$-norm) converge and become asymptotically independent as the radius gets large. The method is a combination of standard extreme value analysis modeling of the tails of the marginal distributions with nonparametric GAN modeling of the angular distribution. For the latter, the angular values are transformed to Aitchison coordinates in a full $(d-1)$-dimensional linear space, and a Wasserstein GAN is trained on these coordinates and used to generate new values. A reverse transformation is then applied to these values and gives simulated values on the original data scale. The method shows good performance compared to other existing methods in the literature, both in terms of capturing the dependence structure of the extremes in the data, as well as in generating accurate new extremes of the data distribution. The comparison is performed on simulated multivariate extremes from a logistic model in dimensions up to 50 and on a 30-dimensional financial data set.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study addresses the critical gap in Arabic natural language processing by developing an effective Arabic Reverse Dictionary (RD) system that enables users to find words based on their descriptions or meanings. We present a novel transformer-based approach with a semi-encoder neural network architecture featuring geometrically decreasing layers that achieves state-of-the-art results for Arabic RD tasks. Our methodology incorporates a comprehensive dataset construction process and establishes formal quality standards for Arabic lexicographic definitions. Experiments with various pre-trained models demonstrate that Arabic-specific models significantly outperform general multilingual embeddings, with ARBERTv2 achieving the best ranking score (0.0644). Additionally, we provide a formal abstraction of the reverse dictionary task that enhances theoretical understanding and develop a modular, extensible Python library (RDTL) with configurable training pipelines. Our analysis of dataset quality reveals important insights for improving Arabic definition construction, leading to eight specific standards for building high-quality reverse dictionary resources. This work contributes significantly to Arabic computational linguistics and provides valuable tools for language learning, academic writing, and professional communication in Arabic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinfeng Zhu, Yunxi Jiang, Lei Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a result-level category-specific fusion architecture called ClassWise-CRF. This architecture employs a two-stage process: first, it selects expert networks that perform well in specific categories from a pool of candidate networks using a greedy algorithm; second, it integrates the segmentation predictions of these selected networks by adaptively weighting their contributions based on their segmentation performance in each category. Inspired by Conditional Random Field (CRF), the ClassWise-CRF architecture treats the segmentation predictions from multiple networks as confidence vector fields. It leverages segmentation metrics (such as Intersection over Union) from the validation set as priors and employs an exponential weighting strategy to fuse the category-specific confidence scores predicted by each network. This fusion method dynamically adjusts the weights of each network for different categories, achieving category-specific optimization. Building on this, the architecture further optimizes the fused results using unary and pairwise potentials in CRF to ensure spatial consistency and boundary accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of ClassWise-CRF, we conducted experiments on two remote sensing datasets, LoveDA and Vaihingen, using eight classic and advanced semantic segmentation networks. The results show that the ClassWise-CRF architecture significantly improves segmentation performance: on the LoveDA dataset, the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric increased by 1.00% on the validation set and by 0.68% on the test set; on the Vaihingen dataset, the mIoU improved by 0.87% on the validation set and by 0.91% on the test set. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the ClassWise-CRF architecture in semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Benjamin Wessel, Callum J. R. Murphy-Barltrop, Emma S. Simpson</p>
<p>Abstract: With the recent development of new geometric and angular-radial frameworks for multivariate extremes, reliably simulating from angular variables in moderate-to-high dimensions is of increasing importance. Empirical approaches have the benefit of simplicity, and work reasonably well in low dimensions, but as the number of variables increases, they can lack the required flexibility and scalability. Classical parametric models for angular variables, such as the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, provide an alternative. Exploiting mixtures of vMF distributions increases their flexibility, but there are cases where even this is not sufficient to capture the intricate features that can arise in data. Owing to their flexibility, generative deep learning methods are able to capture complex data structures; they therefore have the potential to be useful in the simulation of angular variables. In this paper, we explore a range of deep learning approaches for this task, including generative adversarial networks, normalizing flows and flow matching. We assess their performance via a range of metrics and make comparisons to the more classical approach of using a mixture of vMF distributions. The methods are also applied to a metocean data set, demonstrating their applicability to real-world, complex data structures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gaussian processes (GP) are a versatile tool in machine learning and computational science. We here consider the case of multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP) and present low-rank approaches for efficiently computing the posterior mean of a MOGP. Starting from low-rank spatio-temporal data we consider a structured covariance function, assuming separability across space and time. This separability, in turn, gives a decomposition of the covariance matrix into a Kronecker product of individual covariance matrices. Incorporating the typical noise term to the model then requires the solution of a large-scale Stein equation for computing the posterior mean. For this, we propose efficient low-rank methods based on a combination of a LRPCG method with the Sylvester equation solver KPIK adjusted for solving Stein equations. We test the developed method on real world street network graphs by using graph filters as covariance matrices. Moreover, we propose a degree-weighted average covariance matrix, which can be employed under specific assumptions to achieve more efficient convergence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fairness auditing of AI systems can identify and quantify biases. However, traditional auditing using real-world data raises security and privacy concerns. It exposes auditors to security risks as they become custodians of sensitive information and targets for cyberattacks. Privacy risks arise even without direct breaches, as data analyses can inadvertently expose confidential information. To address these, we propose a framework that leverages differentially private synthetic data to audit the fairness of AI systems. By applying privacy-preserving mechanisms, it generates synthetic data that mirrors the statistical properties of the original dataset while ensuring privacy. This method balances the goal of rigorous fairness auditing and the need for strong privacy protections. Through experiments on real datasets like Adult, COMPAS, and Diabetes, we compare fairness metrics of synthetic and real data. By analyzing the alignment and discrepancies between these metrics, we assess the capacity of synthetic data to preserve the fairness properties of real data. Our results demonstrate the framework's ability to enable meaningful fairness evaluations while safeguarding sensitive information, proving its applicability across critical and sensitive domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve accuracy by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, recent research has revealed RAG's susceptibility to poisoning attacks, where the attacker injects poisoned texts into the knowledge database, leading to attacker-desired responses. Existing defenses, which predominantly focus on inference-time mitigation, have proven insufficient against sophisticated attacks. In this paper, we introduce RAGForensics, the first traceback system for RAG, designed to identify poisoned texts within the knowledge database that are responsible for the attacks. RAGForensics operates iteratively, first retrieving a subset of texts from the database and then utilizing a specially crafted prompt to guide an LLM in detecting potential poisoning texts. Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RAGForensics against state-of-the-art poisoning attacks. This work pioneers the traceback of poisoned texts in RAG systems, providing a practical and promising defense mechanism to enhance their security.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models are fundamental actors in the modern IT landscape dominated by AI solutions. However, security threats associated with them might prevent their reliable adoption in critical application scenarios such as government organizations and medical institutions. For this reason, commercial LLMs typically undergo a sophisticated censoring mechanism to eliminate any harmful output they could possibly produce. In response to this, LLM Jailbreaking is a significant threat to such protections, and many previous approaches have already demonstrated its effectiveness across diverse domains. Existing jailbreak proposals mostly adopt a generate-and-test strategy to craft malicious input. To improve the comprehension of censoring mechanisms and design a targeted jailbreak attack, we propose an Explainable-AI solution that comparatively analyzes the behavior of censored and uncensored models to derive unique exploitable alignment patterns. Then, we propose XBreaking, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits these unique patterns to break the security constraints of LLMs by targeted noise injection. Our thorough experimental campaign returns important insights about the censoring mechanisms and demonstrates the effectiveness and performance of our attack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Qiao, Yingjia Wang, Xing Liu, Sixing Wu, Jianbing Li, Yiming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an attacker manipulates a small portion of the training data to implant hidden backdoors into the model. The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications. Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques. In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks. In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary. However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction. In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples. To conquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification method, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve certification performance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/Cert-SSB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaouad Mourtada</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a distribution over a finite alphabet from an i.i.d. sample, with accuracy measured in relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence). While optimal expected risk bounds are known, high-probability guarantees remain less well-understood. First, we analyze the classical Laplace (add-$1$) estimator, obtaining matching upper and lower bounds on its performance and showing its optimality among confidence-independent estimators. We then characterize the minimax-optimal high-probability risk achievable by any estimator, which is attained via a simple confidence-dependent smoothing technique. Interestingly, the optimal non-asymptotic risk contains an additional logarithmic factor over the ideal asymptotic risk. Next, motivated by scenarios where the alphabet exceeds the sample size, we investigate methods that adapt to the sparsity of the distribution at hand. We introduce an estimator using data-dependent smoothing, for which we establish a high-probability risk bound depending on two effective sparsity parameters. As part of the analysis, we also derive a sharp high-probability upper bound on the missing mass.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessia Hu, Regina Beets-Tan, Lishan Cai, Eduardo Pooch</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an important role in identifying clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), yet automated methods face challenges such as data imbalance, variable tumor sizes, and a lack of annotated data. This study introduces Anomaly-Driven U-Net (adU-Net), which incorporates anomaly maps derived from biparametric MRI sequences into a deep learning-based segmentation framework to improve csPCa identification. We conduct a comparative analysis of anomaly detection methods and evaluate the integration of anomaly maps into the segmentation pipeline. Anomaly maps, generated using Fixed-Point GAN reconstruction, highlight deviations from normal prostate tissue, guiding the segmentation model to potential cancerous regions. We compare the performance by using the average score, computed as the mean of the AUROC and Average Precision (AP). On the external test set, adU-Net achieves the best average score of 0.618, outperforming the baseline nnU-Net model (0.605). The results demonstrate that incorporating anomaly detection into segmentation improves generalization and performance, particularly with ADC-based anomaly maps, offering a promising direction for automated csPCa identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuankang Zhao, Matthew Engelhard</p>
<p>Abstract: The Hawkes process (HP) is commonly used to model event sequences with self-reinforcing dynamics, including electronic health records (EHRs). Traditional HPs capture self-reinforcement via parametric impact functions that can be inspected to understand how each event modulates the intensity of others. Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility, resulting in improved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability, which is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and improve upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact functions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a neural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale event sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than traditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches, and allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding transformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings. Results show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in simulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset, and gains clinically meaningful interpretation on XX-EHR with children diagnosis dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our flexible impact kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics in EHRs and other data effectively, implying that interpretability can be maintained without loss of performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Sutcliffe, Marta Calvi, Simone Capelli, Jonas Eschle, Juli\'an Garc\'ia Pardi\~nas, Abhijit Mathad, Azusa Uzuki, Nicola Serra</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing luminosity frontier at the Large Hadron Collider is challenging the reconstruction and analysis of particle collision events. Increased particle multiplicities are straining latency and storage requirements at the data acquisition stage, while new complications are emerging, including higher background levels and more frequent particle vertex misassociations. This in turn necessitates the development of more holistic and scalable reconstruction methods that take advantage of recent advances in machine learning. We propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) architecture featuring unique representations for diverse particle collision relationships and integrated graph pruning layers for scalability. Trained with a multi-task paradigm in an environment mimicking the LHCb experiment, this HGNN significantly improves beauty hadron reconstruction performance. Notably, it concurrently performs particle vertex association and graph pruning within a single framework. We quantify reconstruction and pruning performance, demonstrate enhanced inference time scaling with event complexity, and mitigate potential performance loss using a weighted message passing scheme.</p>

<p>Abstract: The majority of biomedical studies use limited datasets that may not generalize over large heterogeneous datasets that have been collected over several decades. The current paper develops and validates several multimodal models that can predict 1-year mortality based on a massive clinical dataset. Our focus on predicting 1-year mortality can provide a sense of urgency to the patients. Using the largest dataset of its kind, the paper considers the development and validation of multimodal models based on 25,137,015 videos associated with 699,822 echocardiography studies from 316,125 patients, and 2,922,990 8-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) traces from 631,353 patients. Our models allow us to assess the contribution of individual factors and modalities to the overall risk. Our approach allows us to develop extremely low-parameter models that use optimized feature selection based on feature importance. Based on available clinical information, we construct a family of models that are made available in the DISIML package. Overall, performance ranges from an AUC of 0.72 with just ten parameters to an AUC of 0.89 with under 105k for the full multimodal model. The proposed approach represents a modular neural network framework that can provide insights into global risk trends and guide therapies for reducing mortality risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingbo Zhou, Xinjiang Lu, Yixiong Xiao, Jiantao Su, Junfu Lyu, Yanjun Ma, Dejing Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: The variability of wind power supply can present substantial challenges to incorporating wind power into a grid system. Thus, Wind Power Forecasting (WPF) has been widely recognized as one of the most critical issues in wind power integration and operation. There has been an explosion of studies on wind power forecasting problems in the past decades. Nevertheless, how to well handle the WPF problem is still challenging, since high prediction accuracy is always demanded to ensure grid stability and security of supply. We present a unique Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting dataset: SDWPF, which includes the spatial distribution of wind turbines, as well as the dynamic context factors. Whereas, most of the existing datasets have only a small number of wind turbines without knowing the locations and context information of wind turbines at a fine-grained time scale. By contrast, SDWPF provides the wind power data of 134 wind turbines from a wind farm over half a year with their relative positions and internal statuses. We use this dataset to launch the Baidu KDD Cup 2022 to examine the limit of current WPF solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes a novel analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019) resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions, and highlights its potential to identify opportunities for emission reduction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video games have served as useful benchmarks for the decision-making community, but going beyond Atari games towards modern games has been prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of the research community. Prior work in modern video games typically relied on game-specific integration to obtain game features and enable online training, or on existing large datasets. An alternative approach is to train agents using imitation learning to play video games purely from images. However, this setting poses a fundamental question: which visual encoders obtain representations that retain information critical for decision making? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic study of imitation learning with publicly available pre-trained visual encoders compared to the typical task-specific end-to-end training approach in Minecraft, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Minecraft Dungeons. Our results show that end-to-end training can be effective with comparably low-resolution images and only minutes of demonstrations, but significant improvements can be gained by utilising pre-trained encoders such as DINOv2 depending on the game. In addition to enabling effective decision making, we show that pre-trained encoders can make decision-making research in video games more accessible by significantly reducing the cost of training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mike Heddes, Narayan Srinivasa, Tony Givargis, Alexandru Nicolau</p>
<p>Abstract: The excessive computational requirements of modern artificial neural networks (ANNs) are posing limitations on the machines that can run them. Sparsification of ANNs is often motivated by time, memory and energy savings only during model inference, yielding no benefits during training. A growing body of work is now focusing on providing the benefits of model sparsification also during training. While these methods greatly improve the training efficiency, the training algorithms yielding the most accurate models still materialize the dense weights, or compute dense gradients during training. We propose an efficient, always-sparse training algorithm with excellent scaling to larger and sparser models, supported by its linear time complexity with respect to the model width during training and inference. Moreover, our guided stochastic exploration algorithm improves over the accuracy of previous sparse training methods. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and ViT models, and compare it against a range of sparsification methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ole-Christian Galbo Engstr{\o}m, Martin Holm Jensen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present algorithms that substantially accelerate partition-based cross-validation for machine learning models that require matrix products $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. Our algorithms have applications in model selection for, for example, principal component analysis (PCA), principal component regression (PCR), ridge regression (RR), ordinary least squares (OLS), and partial least squares (PLS). Our algorithms support all combinations of column-wise centering and scaling of $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$, and we demonstrate in our accompanying implementation that this adds only a manageable, practical constant over efficient variants without preprocessing. We prove the correctness of our algorithms under a fold-based partitioning scheme and show that the running time is independent of the number of folds; that is, they have the same time complexity as that of computing $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$ and space complexity equivalent to storing $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{Y}$, $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$, and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. Importantly, unlike alternatives found in the literature, we avoid data leakage due to preprocessing. We achieve these results by eliminating redundant computations in the overlap between training partitions. Concretely, we show how to manipulate $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$ using only samples from the validation partition to obtain the preprocessed training partition-wise $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. To our knowledge, we are the first to derive correct and efficient cross-validation algorithms for any of the $16$ combinations of column-wise centering and scaling, for which we also prove only $12$ give distinct matrix products.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damien Teney, Armand Nicolicioiu, Valentin Hartmann, Ehsan Abbasnejad</p>
<p>Abstract: Our understanding of the generalization capabilities of neural networks (NNs) is still incomplete. Prevailing explanations are based on implicit biases of gradient descent (GD) but they cannot account for the capabilities of models from gradient-free methods nor the simplicity bias recently observed in untrained networks. This paper seeks other sources of generalization in NNs.
  Findings. To understand the inductive biases provided by architectures independently from GD, we examine untrained, random-weight networks. Even simple MLPs show strong inductive biases: uniform sampling in weight space yields a very biased distribution of functions in terms of complexity. But unlike common wisdom, NNs do not have an inherent "simplicity bias". This property depends on components such as ReLUs, residual connections, and layer normalizations. Alternative architectures can be built with a bias for any level of complexity. Transformers also inherit all these properties from their building blocks.
  Implications. We provide a fresh explanation for the success of deep learning independent from gradient-based training. It points at promising avenues for controlling the solutions implemented by trained models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinchuan Zhang, Ming Sun, Chong Mu, Jinhao Zhang, Quanjiang Guo, Ling Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning focuses on predicting events through historical information within snapshots distributed on a timeline. Existing studies mainly concentrate on two perspectives of leveraging the history of TKGs, including capturing evolution of each recent snapshot or correlations among global historical facts. Despite the achieved significant accomplishments, these models still fall short of I) investigating the impact of multi-granular interactions across recent snapshots, and II) harnessing the expressive semantics of significant links accorded with queries throughout the entire history, particularly events exerting a profound impact on the future. These inadequacies restrict representation ability to reflect historical dependencies and future trends thoroughly. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an innovative TKG reasoning approach towards \textbf{His}torically \textbf{R}elevant \textbf{E}vents \textbf{S}tructuring (HisRES). Concretely, HisRES comprises two distinctive modules excelling in structuring historically relevant events within TKGs, including a multi-granularity evolutionary encoder that captures structural and temporal dependencies of the most recent snapshots, and a global relevance encoder that concentrates on crucial correlations among events relevant to queries from the entire history. Furthermore, HisRES incorporates a self-gating mechanism for adaptively merging multi-granularity recent and historically relevant structuring representations. Extensive experiments on four event-based benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HisRES and indicate the superiority and effectiveness of structuring historical relevance for TKG reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Chen, Tian Lan, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Skills are effective temporal abstractions established for sequential decision making, which enable efficient hierarchical learning for long-horizon tasks and facilitate multi-task learning through their transferability. Despite extensive research, research gaps remain in multi-agent scenarios, particularly for automatically extracting subgroup coordination patterns in a multi-agent task. In this case, we propose two novel auto-encoder schemes: VO-MASD-3D and VO-MASD-Hier, to simultaneously capture subgroup- and temporal-level abstractions and form multi-agent skills, which firstly solves the aforementioned challenge. An essential algorithm component of these schemes is a dynamic grouping function that can automatically detect latent subgroups based on agent interactions in a task. Further, our method can be applied to offline multi-task data, and the discovered subgroup skills can be transferred across relevant tasks without retraining. Empirical evaluations on StarCraft tasks indicate that our approach significantly outperforms existing hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods. Moreover, skills discovered using our method can effectively reduce the learning difficulty in MARL scenarios with delayed and sparse reward signals.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Lin, Dong Li, Minglai Shao, Guihong Wan, Chen Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness-aware domain generalization (FairDG) has emerged as a critical challenge for deploying trustworthy AI systems, particularly in scenarios involving distribution shifts. Traditional methods for addressing fairness have failed in domain generalization due to their lack of consideration for distribution shifts. Although disentanglement has been used to tackle FairDG, it is limited by its strong assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Fairness-aware Classifier-Guided Score-based Diffusion Models (FADE) as a novel approach to effectively address the FairDG issue. Specifically, we first pre-train a score-based diffusion model (SDM) and two classifiers to equip the model with strong generalization capabilities across different domains. Then, we guide the SDM using these pre-trained classifiers to effectively eliminate sensitive information from the generated data. Finally, the generated fair data is used to train downstream classifiers, ensuring robust performance under new data distributions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FADE not only enhances fairness but also improves accuracy in the presence of distribution shifts. Additionally, FADE outperforms existing methods in achieving the best accuracy-fairness trade-offs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saber Malekmohammadi, Yaoliang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring fairness in a Federated Learning (FL) system, i.e., a satisfactory performance for all of the participating diverse clients, is an important and challenging problem. There are multiple fair FL algorithms in the literature, which have been relatively successful in providing fairness. However, these algorithms mostly emphasize on the loss functions of worst-off clients to improve their performance, which often results in the suppression of well-performing ones. As a consequence, they usually sacrifice the system's overall average performance for achieving fairness. Motivated by this and inspired by two well-known risk modeling methods in Finance, Mean-Variance and Mean-Semi-Variance, we propose and study two new fair FL algorithms, Variance Reduction (VRed) and Semi-Variance Reduction (SemiVRed). VRed encourages equality between clients' loss functions by penalizing their variance. In contrast, SemiVRed penalizes the discrepancy of only the worst-off clients' loss functions from the average loss. Through extensive experiments on multiple vision and language datasets, we show that, SemiVRed achieves SoTA performance in scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions and improves both fairness and system overall average performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyon Vafa, Susan Athey, David M. Blei</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of foundation models marks a paradigm shift in machine learning: instead of training specialized models from scratch, foundation models are first trained on massive datasets before being adapted or fine-tuned to make predictions on smaller datasets. Initially developed for text, foundation models have also excelled at making predictions about social science data. However, while many estimation problems in the social sciences use prediction as an intermediate step, they ultimately require different criteria for success. In this paper, we develop methods for fine-tuning foundation models to perform these estimation problems. We first characterize an omitted variable bias that can arise when a foundation model is only fine-tuned to maximize predictive accuracy. We then provide a novel set of conditions for fine-tuning under which estimates derived from a foundation model are root-n-consistent. Based on this theory, we develop new fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this omitted variable bias. To demonstrate our ideas, we study gender wage decomposition. This is a statistical estimation problem from econometrics where the goal is to decompose the gender wage gap into components that can and cannot be explained by career histories of workers. Classical methods for decomposing the wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages which condition on coarse summaries of career history that may omit factors that are important for explaining the gap. Instead, we use a custom-built foundation model to decompose the gender wage gap, which captures a richer representation of career history. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that career history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of career history that are omitted by standard models but are important for explaining the wage gap.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Fan, Yilun Du, Kannan Ramchandran, Kangwook Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has shown that Transformers trained from scratch can successfully solve various arithmetic and algorithmic tasks, such as adding numbers and computing parity. While these Transformers generalize well on unseen inputs of the same length, they struggle with length generalization, i.e., handling inputs of unseen lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that looped Transformers with an adaptive number of steps significantly improve length generalization. We focus on tasks with a known iterative solution, involving multiple iterations of a RASP-L operation - a length-generalizable operation that can be expressed by a finite-sized Transformer. We train looped Transformers using our proposed learning algorithm and observe that they learn highly length-generalizable solutions for various tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Liu, James Doss-Gollin, Qiushi Dai, Guha Balakrishnan, Ashok Veeraraghavan</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the risks posed by extreme rainfall events necessitates both high-resolution products (to assess localized hazards) and extensive historical records (to capture rare occurrences). Radar and mesonet networks provide kilometer-scale precipitation fields, but with limited historical records and geographical coverage. Conversely, global gauge and blended products span decades, yet their coarse 30-50 km grids obscure local extremes. This work introduces Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a generative downscaling framework that integrates diffusion modeling with a distribution-matching (Wasserstein) regularizer, suppressing bias throughout the entire generative denoising process. Conditioned on 55 km CPC gauge-based precipitation and the 31 km ERA5 reanalysis, WassDiff generates 1 km precipitation estimates that remain well-calibrated to targets across the full intensity range, including the extremes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that WassDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art downscaling methods, delivering lower reconstruction error and reduced bias. Case studies further demonstrate its ability to reproduce realistic fine-scale structures and accurate peak intensities from extreme weather phenomena, such as tropical storms and cold fronts. By unlocking decades of high-resolution rainfall information from globally available coarse records, WassDiff offers a practical pathway toward more accurate flood-risk assessments and climate-adaptation planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinting Huang, Andy Yang, Satwik Bhattamishra, Yash Sarrof, Andreas Krebs, Hattie Zhou, Preetum Nakkiran, Michael Hahn</p>
<p>Abstract: A major challenge for transformers is generalizing to sequences longer than those observed during training. While previous works have empirically shown that transformers can either succeed or fail at length generalization depending on the task, theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this work, we introduce a rigorous theoretical framework to analyze length generalization in causal transformers with learnable absolute positional encodings. In particular, we characterize those functions that are identifiable in the limit from sufficiently long inputs with absolute positional encodings under an idealized inference scheme using a norm-based regularizer. This enables us to prove the possibility of length generalization for a rich family of problems. We experimentally validate the theory as a predictor of success and failure of length generalization across a range of algorithmic and formal language tasks. Our theory not only explains a broad set of empirical observations but also opens the way to provably predicting length generalization capabilities in transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binchuan Qi, Wei Gong, Li Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical assumptions like strong convexity and Lipschitz smoothness often fail to capture the nature of deep learning optimization problems, which are typically non-convex and non-smooth, making traditional analyses less applicable. This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms of non-convex optimization in deep learning by extending the conventional notions of strong convexity and Lipschitz smoothness. By leveraging these concepts, we prove that, under the established constraints, the empirical risk minimization problem is equivalent to optimizing the local gradient norm and structural error, which together constitute the upper and lower bounds of the empirical risk. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm can effectively minimize the local gradient norm. Additionally, techniques like skip connections, over-parameterization, and random parameter initialization are shown to help control the structural error. Ultimately, we validate the core conclusions of this paper through extensive experiments. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of non-convex optimization in deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aku Kammonen, Anamika Pandey, Erik von Schwerin, Ra\'ul Tempone</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced adaptive random Fourier features (ARFF) training algorithm for shallow neural networks, building upon the work introduced in "Adaptive Random Fourier Features with Metropolis Sampling", Kammonen et al., \emph{Foundations of Data Science}, 2(3):309--332, 2020. This improved method uses a particle filter-type resampling technique to stabilize the training process and reduce the sensitivity to parameter choices. The Metropolis test can also be omitted when resampling is used, reducing the number of hyperparameters by one and reducing the computational cost per iteration compared to the ARFF method. We present comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in function regression tasks as a stand-alone method and as a pretraining step before gradient-based optimization, using the Adam optimizer. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to a simple image regression problem, illustrating its utility in sampling frequencies for the random Fourier features (RFF) layer of coordinate-based multilayer perceptrons. In this context, we use the proposed algorithm to sample the parameters of the RFF layer in an automated manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristian Meo, Mircea Lica, Zarif Ikram, Akihiro Nakano, Vedant Shah, Aniket Rajiv Didolkar, Dianbo Liu, Anirudh Goyal, Justin Dauwels</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the leading approach for creating artificial agents in complex environments. Model-based approaches, which are RL methods with world models that predict environment dynamics, are among the most promising directions for improving data efficiency, forming a critical step toward bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment. In particular, world models enhance sample efficiency by learning in imagination, which involves training a generative sequence model of the environment in a self-supervised manner. Recently, Masked Generative Modelling has emerged as a more efficient and superior inductive bias for modelling and generating token sequences. Building on the Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models (STORM) architecture, we replace the traditional MLP prior with a Masked Generative Prior (e.g., MaskGIT Prior) and introduce GIT-STORM. We evaluate our model on two downstream tasks: reinforcement learning and video prediction. GIT-STORM demonstrates substantial performance gains in RL tasks on the Atari 100k benchmark. Moreover, we apply Transformer-based World Models to continuous action environments for the first time, addressing a significant gap in prior research. To achieve this, we employ a state mixer function that integrates latent state representations with actions, enabling our model to handle continuous control tasks. We validate this approach through qualitative and quantitative analyses on the DeepMind Control Suite, showcasing the effectiveness of Transformer-based World Models in this new domain. Our results highlight the versatility and efficacy of the MaskGIT dynamics prior, paving the way for more accurate world models and effective RL policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hairong Wang, Lingchao Mao, Zihan Zhang, Jing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Liver cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and accurate Computed Tomography (CT)-based tumor segmentation is essential for diagnosis and treatment. Manual delineation is time-intensive, prone to variability, and highlights the need for reliable automation. While deep learning has shown promise for automated liver segmentation, precise liver tumor segmentation remains challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumors, imprecise tumor margins, and limited labeled data. We present SmoothSegNet, a novel deep learning framework that addresses these challenges with the three key designs: (1) A novel knowledge-informed label smoothing technique that distills knowledge from clinical data to generate smooth labels, which are used to regularize model training, reducing the overfitting risk and enhancing model performance; (2) A global and local segmentation framework that breaks down the main task into two simpler sub-tasks, allowing optimized preprocessing and training for each; and (3) Pre- and post-processing pipelines customized to the challenges of each subtask aimed to enhance tumor visibility and refines tumor boundaries. We apply the proposed model on a challenging HCC-TACE-Seg dataset and show that SmoothSegNet outperformed various benchmarks in segmentation performance, particularly at smaller tumors (<10cm). Our ablation studies show that the three design components complementarily contribute to the model improved performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Gan, Jingbo Jiang, Jingyang Zhu, Xiaomeng Wang, Xizi Chen, Chi-Ying Tsui</p>
<p>Abstract: Substantial efforts have been devoted to alleviating the impact of the long-tailed class distribution in federated learning. In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon that certain weak classes consistently exist even for class-balanced learning. These weak classes, different from the minority classes in the previous works, are inherent to data and remain fairly consistent for various network structures, learning paradigms, and data partitioning methods. The inherent inter-class accuracy discrepancy can reach over 36.9% for federated learning on the FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, even when the class distribution is balanced both globally and locally. In this study, we empirically analyze the potential reason for this phenomenon. Furthermore, a partial knowledge distillation (PKD) method is proposed to improve the model's classification accuracy for weak classes. In this approach, knowledge transfer is initiated upon the occurrence of specific misclassifications within certain weak classes. Experimental results show that the accuracy of weak classes can be improved by 10.7%, reducing the inherent inter-class discrepancy effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: In healthcare, the integration of multimodal data is pivotal for developing comprehensive diagnostic and predictive models. However, managing missing data remains a significant challenge in real-world applications. We introduce MARIA (Multimodal Attention Resilient to Incomplete datA), a novel transformer-based deep learning model designed to address these challenges through an intermediate fusion strategy. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on imputation, MARIA utilizes a masked self-attention mechanism, which processes only the available data without generating synthetic values. This approach enables it to effectively handle incomplete datasets, enhancing robustness and minimizing biases introduced by imputation methods. We evaluated MARIA against 10 state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models across 8 diagnostic and prognostic tasks. The results demonstrate that MARIA outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and resilience to varying levels of data incompleteness, underscoring its potential for critical healthcare applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erica Chiang, Divya Shanmugam, Ashley N. Beecy, Gabriel Sayer, Deborah Estrin, Nikhil Garg, Emma Pierson</p>
<p>Abstract: Disease progression models are widely used to inform the diagnosis and treatment of many progressive diseases. However, a significant limitation of existing models is that they do not account for health disparities that can bias the observed data. To address this, we develop an interpretable Bayesian disease progression model that captures three key health disparities: certain patient populations may (1) start receiving care only when their disease is more severe, (2) experience faster disease progression even while receiving care, or (3) receive follow-up care less frequently conditional on disease severity. We show theoretically and empirically that failing to account for any of these disparities can result in biased estimates of severity (e.g., underestimating severity for disadvantaged groups). On a dataset of heart failure patients, we show that our model can identify groups that face each type of health disparity, and that accounting for these disparities while inferring disease severity meaningfully shifts which patients are considered high-risk.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13734">Sample complexity of data-driven tuning of model hyperparameters in neural networks with structured parameter-dependent dual function</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria-Florina Balcan, Anh Tuan Nguyen, Dravyansh Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning based techniques, typically involve careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best performance. Despite the surge of intense interest in practical techniques like Bayesian optimization and random search based approaches to automating this laborious and compute intensive task, the fundamental learning theoretic complexity of tuning hyperparameters for deep neural networks is poorly understood. Inspired by this glaring gap, we initiate the formal study of hyperparameter tuning complexity in deep learning through a recently introduced data driven setting. We assume that we have a series of deep learning tasks, and we have to tune hyperparameters to do well on average over the distribution of tasks. A major difficulty is that the utility function as a function of the hyperparameter is very volatile and furthermore, it is given implicitly by an optimization problem over the model parameters. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new technique to characterize the discontinuities and oscillations of the utility function on any fixed problem instance as we vary the hyperparameter; our analysis relies on subtle concepts including tools from differential/algebraic geometry and constrained optimization. This can be used to show that the learning theoretic complexity of the corresponding family of utility functions is bounded. We instantiate our results and provide sample complexity bounds for concrete applications tuning a hyperparameter that interpolates neural activation functions and setting the kernel parameter in graph neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Liu, Jingmin Sun, Hayden Schaeffer</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce BCAT, a PDE foundation model designed for autoregressive prediction of solutions to two dimensional fluid dynamics problems. Our approach uses a block causal transformer architecture to model next frame predictions, leveraging previous frames as contextual priors rather than relying solely on sub-frames or pixel-based inputs commonly used in image generation methods. This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 3.5x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations. The model's performance was evaluated on 6 distinct downstream prediction tasks and tested on about 8K trajectories to measure robustness on a variety of fluid dynamics simulations. BCAT achieved an average relative error of 1.18% across all evaluation tasks, outperforming prior approaches on standard benchmarks. With fine-tuning on a turbulence dataset, we show that the method adapts to new settings with more than 40% better accuracy over prior methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Sikar, Artur d'Avila Garcez, Tillman Weyde</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of automated decision-making based on neural networks will be crucial as Artificial Intelligence systems are deployed more widely in critical situations. This paper proposes a new approach for measuring confidence in the predictions of any neural network that relies on the predictions of a softmax layer. We identify that a high-accuracy trained network may have certain outputs for which there should be low confidence. In such cases, decisions should be deferred and it is more appropriate for the network to provide a \textit{not known} answer to a corresponding classification task. Our approach clusters the vectors in the softmax layer to measure distances between cluster centroids and network outputs. We show that a cluster with centroid calculated simply as the mean softmax output for all correct predictions can serve as a suitable proxy in the evaluation of confidence. Defining a distance threshold for a class as the smallest distance from an incorrect prediction to the given class centroid offers a simple approach to adding \textit{not known} answers to any network classification falling outside of the threshold. We evaluate the approach on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using a Convolutional Neural Network and a Vision Transformer, respectively. The results show that our approach is consistent across datasets and network models, and indicate that the proposed distance metric can offer an efficient way of determining when automated predictions are acceptable and when they should be deferred to human operators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Guande He, Jianfei Chen, Fan Bao, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Consistency distillation is a prevalent way for accelerating diffusion models adopted in consistency (trajectory) models, in which a student model is trained to traverse backward on the probability flow (PF) ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory determined by the teacher model. Preconditioning is a vital technique for stabilizing consistency distillation, by linear combining the input data and the network output with pre-defined coefficients as the consistency function. It imposes the boundary condition of consistency functions without restricting the form and expressiveness of the neural network. However, previous preconditionings are hand-crafted and may be suboptimal choices. In this work, we offer the first theoretical insights into the preconditioning in consistency distillation, by elucidating its design criteria and the connection to the teacher ODE trajectory. Based on these analyses, we further propose a principled way dubbed \textit{Analytic-Precond} to analytically optimize the preconditioning according to the consistency gap (defined as the gap between the teacher denoiser and the optimal student denoiser) on a generalized teacher ODE. We demonstrate that Analytic-Precond can facilitate the learning of trajectory jumpers, enhance the alignment of the student trajectory with the teacher's, and achieve $2\times$ to $3\times$ training acceleration of consistency trajectory models in multi-step generation across various datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lab tests are fundamental for diagnosing diseases and monitoring patient conditions. However, frequent testing can be burdensome for patients, and test results may not always be immediately available. To address these challenges, we propose LabTOP, a unified model that predicts lab test outcomes by leveraging a language modeling approach on EHR data. Unlike conventional methods that estimate only a subset of lab tests or classify discrete value ranges, LabTOP performs continuous numerical predictions for a diverse range of lab items. We evaluate LabTOP on three publicly available EHR datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods, including traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of our design choices. We believe that LabTOP will serve as an accurate and generalizable framework for lab test outcome prediction, with potential applications in clinical decision support and early detection of critical conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Saidul Hoque Anik, Ariful Azad</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) learning offers a powerful framework for generating new knowledge and making inferences. Training KG embedding can take a significantly long time, especially for larger datasets. Our analysis shows that the gradient computation of embedding is one of the dominant functions in the translation-based KG embedding training loop. We address this issue by replacing the core embedding computation with SpMM (Sparse-Dense Matrix Multiplication) kernels. This allows us to unify multiple scatter (and gather) operations as a single operation, reducing training time and memory usage. We create a general framework for training KG models using sparse kernels and implement four models, namely TransE, TransR, TransH, and TorusE. Our sparse implementations exhibit up to 5.3x speedup on the CPU and up to 4.2x speedup on the GPU with a significantly low GPU memory footprint. The speedups are consistent across large and small datasets for a given model. Our proposed sparse approach can be extended to accelerate other translation-based (such as TransC, TransM, etc.) and non-translational (such as DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, etc.) models as well. An implementation of the SpTransX framework is publicly available as a Python package in https://github.com/HipGraph/SpTransX.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: With the increasing availability of healthcare data, predictive modeling finds many applications in the biomedical domain, such as the evaluation of the level of risk for various conditions, which in turn can guide clinical decision making. However, it is unclear how knowledge graph data representations and their embedding, which are competitive in some settings, could be of interest in biomedical predictive modeling. Method: We simulated synthetic but realistic data of patients with intracranial aneurysm and experimented on the task of predicting their clinical outcome. We compared the performance of various classification approaches on tabular data versus a graph-based representation of the same data. Next, we investigated how the adopted schema for representing first individual data and second temporal data impacts predictive performances. Results: Our study illustrates that in our case, a graph representation and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) embeddings reach the best performance for a predictive task from observational data. We emphasize the importance of the adopted schema and of the consideration of literal values in the representation of individual data. Our study also moderates the relative impact of various time encoding on GCN performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Houdouin, Lucas Saludjian</p>
<p>Abstract: With the digitalization of power grids, physical equations become insufficient to describe the network's behavior, and realistic but time-consuming simulators must be used. Numerical experiments, such as safety validation, that involve simulating a large number of scenarios become computationally intractable. A popular solution to reduce the computational burden is to learn a surrogate model of the simulator with Machine Learning (ML) and then conduct the experiment directly on the fast-to-evaluate surrogate model. Among the various ML possibilities for building surrogate models, Gaussian processes (GPs) emerged as a popular solution due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and interpretability. Their probabilistic nature enables them to provide both predictions and uncertainty quantification (UQ). This paper starts with a discussion on the interest of using GPs to approximate power grid simulators and fasten numerical experiments. Such simulators, however, often violate the GP's underlying Gaussian assumption, leading to poor approximations. To address this limitation, an approach that consists in adding an adaptive residual uncertainty term to the UQ is proposed. It enables the GP to remain accurate and reliable despite the simulator's non-Gaussian behaviors. This approach is successfully applied to the certification of the proper functioning of a congestion management controller, with over 98% of simulations avoided.</p>

Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved.
  In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Zhang, Yiming Zhang, Yuan Zheng, Yuchen Wang, Jinjiang You, Yuchen Xu, Wenxing Jiang, Soumyabrata Dev</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban traffic optimization is critical for improving transportation efficiency and alleviating congestion, particularly in large-scale dynamic networks. Traditional methods, such as Dijkstra's and Floyd's algorithms, provide effective solutions in static settings, but they struggle with the spatial-temporal complexity of real-world traffic flows. In this work, we propose TrafficKAN-GCN, a hybrid deep learning framework combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), designed to enhance urban traffic flow optimization. By integrating KAN's adaptive nonlinear function approximation with GCN's spatial graph learning capabilities, TrafficKAN-GCN captures both complex traffic patterns and topological dependencies. We evaluate the proposed framework using real-world traffic data from the Baltimore Metropolitan area. Compared with baseline models such as MLP-GCN, standard GCN, and Transformer-based approaches, TrafficKAN-GCN achieves competitive prediction accuracy while demonstrating improved robustness in handling noisy and irregular traffic data. Our experiments further highlight the framework's ability to redistribute traffic flow, mitigate congestion, and adapt to disruptive events, such as the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. This study contributes to the growing body of work on hybrid graph learning for intelligent transportation systems, highlighting the potential of combining KAN and GCN for real-time traffic optimization. Future work will focus on reducing computational overhead and integrating Transformer-based temporal modeling for enhanced long-term traffic prediction. The proposed TrafficKAN-GCN framework offers a promising direction for data-driven urban mobility management, balancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Chen, Xingcheng Fu, Yisen Gao, Haodong Qian, Yuecen Wei, Kun Yan, Haoyi Zhou, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) develop patch embedding and convolution backbone within vector space, especially Euclidean ones, at the very founding. When expanding VLMs to a galaxy scale for understanding astronomical phenomena, the integration of spherical space for planetary orbits and hyperbolic spaces for black holes raises two formidable challenges. a) The current pre-training model is confined to Euclidean space rather than a comprehensive geometric embedding. b) The predominant architecture lacks suitable backbones for anisotropic physical geometries. In this paper, we introduced Galaxy-Walker, a geometry-aware VLM, for the universe-level vision understanding tasks. We proposed the geometry prompt that generates geometry tokens by random walks across diverse spaces on a multi-scale physical graph, along with a geometry adapter that compresses and reshapes the space anisotropy in a mixture-of-experts manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with Galaxy-Walker achieving state-of-the-art performance in both galaxy property estimation ($R^2$ scores up to $0.91$) and morphology classification tasks (up to $+0.17$ F1 improvement in challenging features), significantly outperforming both domain-specific models and general-purpose VLMs.</p>

We find KA to be robust to countable collections of continuous adversaries, but unearth a question about the equi-continuity of the outer functions that, so far, obstructs taking limits and defeating continuous groups of adversaries. This question on the regularity of the outer functions is relevant to the debate over the applicability of KA to the general theory of NNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joery A. de Vries, Jinke He, Yaniv Oren, Matthijs T. J. Spaan</p>
<p>Abstract: Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has driven many recent breakthroughs in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, scaling MCTS to parallel compute has proven challenging in practice which has motivated alternative planners like sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC). Many of these SMC methods adopt particle filters for smoothing through a reformulation of RL as a policy inference problem. Yet, persisting design choices of these particle filters often conflict with the aim of online planning in RL, which is to obtain a policy improvement at the start of planning. Drawing inspiration from MCTS, we tailor SMC planners specifically for RL by improving data generation within the planner through constrained action sampling and explicit terminal state handling, as well as improving policy and value target estimation. This leads to our Trust-Region Twisted SMC (TRT-SMC), which shows improved runtime and sample-efficiency over baseline MCTS and SMC methods in both discrete and continuous domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Dang, Christina Baek, Kaiyue Wen, Zico Kolter, Aditi Raghunathan</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate a failure mode that arises during the training of reasoning models, where the diversity of generations begins to collapse, leading to suboptimal test-time scaling. Notably, the Pass@1 rate reliably improves during supervised finetuning (SFT), but Pass@k rapidly deteriorates. Surprisingly, a simple intervention of interpolating the weights of the latest SFT checkpoint with an early checkpoint, otherwise known as WiSE-FT, almost completely recovers Pass@k while also improving Pass@1. The WiSE-FT variant achieves better test-time scaling (Best@k, majority vote) and achieves superior results with less data when tuned further by reinforcement learning. Finally, we find that WiSE-FT provides complementary performance gains that cannot be achieved only through diversity-inducing decoding strategies, like temperature scaling. We formalize a bias-variance tradeoff of Pass@k with respect to the expectation and variance of Pass@1 over the test distribution. We find that WiSE-FT can reduce bias and variance simultaneously, while temperature scaling inherently trades off between bias and variance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Zhang, Yaoyao Ding, Yang Hu, Gennady Pekhimenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) workloads mainly run on accelerators like GPUs. Recent DL quantization techniques demand a new matrix multiplication operator with mixed input data types, further complicating GPU optimization. Prior high-level compilers like Triton lack the expressiveness to implement key optimizations like fine-grained data pipelines and hardware-friendly memory layouts for these operators, while low-level programming models, such as Hidet, Graphene, and CUTLASS, require significant programming efforts. To balance expressiveness with engineering effort, we propose Hexcute, a tile-based programming language that exposes shared memory and register abstractions to enable fine-grained optimization for these operators. Additionally, Hexcute leverages task mapping to schedule the GPU program, and to reduce programming efforts, it automates layout and task mapping synthesis with a novel type-inference-based algorithm. Our evaluation shows that Hexcute generalizes to a wide range of DL operators, achieves 1.7-11.28$\times$ speedup over existing DL compilers for mixed-type operators, and brings up to 2.91$\times$ speedup in the end-to-end evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William R. Keely, Otto Lamminp\"a\"a, Steffen Mauceri, Sean M. R. Crowell, Christopher W. O'Dell, Gregory R. McGarragh</p>
<p>Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem, which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence, and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal, we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current operational state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Esam Mahdi, C. Martin-Barreiro, X. Cabezas</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel deep learning hybrid model that integrates attention Transformer and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price predictions. By combining the Transformer's strength in capturing long-range patterns with the GRU's ability to model short-term and sequential trends, the hybrid model provides a well-rounded approach to time series forecasting. We apply the model to predict the daily closing prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum based on historical data that include past prices, trading volumes, and the Fear and Greed index. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with four other machine learning models: two are non-sequential feedforward models: Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and two are bidirectional sequential memory-based models: Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). The performance of the model is assessed using several metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), along with statistical validation through the nonparametric Friedman test followed by a post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank test. The results demonstrate that our hybrid model consistently achieves superior accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness for financial prediction tasks. These findings provide valuable insights for improving real-time decision making in cryptocurrency markets and support the growing use of hybrid deep learning models in financial analytics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyuan Fang, Han Yang, Haixian Wen, Jiajing Wu, Zibin Zheng, Chi K. Tse</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks have been widely utilized to solve graph-related tasks because of their strong learning power in utilizing the local information of neighbors. However, recent studies on graph adversarial attacks have proven that current graph neural networks are not robust against malicious attacks. Yet much of the existing work has focused on the optimization objective based on attack performance to obtain (near) optimal perturbations, but paid less attention to the strength quantification of each perturbation such as the injection of a particular node/link, which makes the choice of perturbations a black-box model that lacks interpretability. In this work, we propose the concept of noise to quantify the attack strength of each adversarial link. Furthermore, we propose three attack strategies based on the defined noise and classification margins in terms of single and multiple steps optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets against three representative graph neural networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies. Particularly, we also investigate the preferred patterns of effective adversarial perturbations by analyzing the corresponding properties of the selected perturbation nodes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjian Luo, Xianglong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized model training framework that aims to merge isolated data islands while maintaining data privacy. However, recent studies have revealed that Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based attacks can be employed in FL to learn the distribution of private datasets and reconstruct recognizable images. In this paper, we exploit defenses against GAN-based attacks in FL and propose a framework, Anti-GAN, to prevent attackers from learning the real distribution of the victim's data. The core idea of Anti-GAN is to manipulate the visual features of private training images to make them indistinguishable to human eyes even restored by attackers. Specifically, Anti-GAN projects the private dataset onto a GAN's generator and combines the generated fake images with the actual images to create the training dataset, which is then used for federated model training. The experimental results demonstrate that Anti-GAN is effective in preventing attackers from learning the distribution of private images while causing minimal harm to the accuracy of the federated model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Kornowski, Ohad Shamir</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the oracle complexity of producing $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points of Lipschitz functions, in the sense proposed by Zhang et al. [2020]. While there exist dimension-free randomized algorithms for producing such points within $\widetilde{O}(1/\delta\epsilon^3)$ first-order oracle calls, we show that no dimension-free rate can be achieved by a deterministic algorithm. On the other hand, we point out that this rate can be derandomized for smooth functions with merely a logarithmic dependence on the smoothness parameter. Moreover, we establish several lower bounds for this task which hold for any randomized algorithm, with or without convexity. Finally, we show how the convergence rate of finding $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points can be improved in case the function is convex, a setting which we motivate by proving that in general no finite time algorithm can produce points with small subgradients even for convex functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Alkhalefi, Georgios Leontidis, Mingjun Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning algorithms (SSL) based on instance discrimination have shown promising results, performing competitively or even outperforming supervised learning counterparts in some downstream tasks. Such approaches employ data augmentation to create two views of the same instance (i.e., positive pairs) and encourage the model to learn good representations by attracting these views closer in the embedding space without collapsing to the trivial solution. However, data augmentation is limited in representing positive pairs, and the repulsion process between the instances during contrastive learning may discard important features for instances that have similar categories. To address this issue, we propose an approach to identify those images with similar semantic content and treat them as positive instances, thereby reducing the chance of discarding important features during representation learning and increasing the richness of the latent representation. Our approach is generic and could work with any self-supervised instance discrimination frameworks such as MoCo and SimSiam. To evaluate our method, we run experiments on three benchmark datasets: ImageNet, STL-10 and CIFAR-10 with different instance discrimination SSL approaches. The experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all three datasets; for instance, we improve upon the vanilla MoCo-v2 by 4.1% on ImageNet under a linear evaluation protocol over 800 epochs. We also report results on semi-supervised learning, transfer learning on downstream tasks, and object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Liu, Fan Lai, Ding Ding, Yiwen Zhang, Mosharaf Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, collaborative learning (CL) has emerged as a promising approach for machine learning (ML) and data science across distributed edge devices. As the deployment of CL jobs increases, they inevitably contend for limited resources. However, efficient resource scheduling in this context is challenging because of the ephemeral nature and resource heterogeneity of devices, coupled with the overlapping resource requirements of diverse CL jobs. Existing resource managers often assign devices to CL jobs randomly for simplicity and scalability, but this approach compromises job efficiency.
  In this paper, we present Venn, a CL resource manager that efficiently schedules ephemeral, heterogeneous devices among multiple CL jobs to reduce the average job completion time (JCT). Venn formulates the Intersection Resource Scheduling (IRS) problem to identify complex resource contention among multiple CL jobs. It then proposes a contention-aware scheduling heuristic to minimize the average scheduling delay. Furthermore, it proposes a resource-aware device-to-job matching heuristic to optimize response collection time by mitigating stragglers. Our evaluation shows that, compared to the state-of-the-art CL resource managers, Venn improves the average JCT by up to 1.88x. The code is available at https://github.com/SymbioticLab/Venn.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siamul Karim Khan, Patrick Tinsley, Mahsa Mitcheff, Patrick Flynn, Kevin W. Bowyer, Adam Czajka</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthesis of same-identity biometric iris images, both for existing and non-existing identities while preserving the identity across a wide range of pupil sizes, is complex due to the intricate iris muscle constriction mechanism, requiring a precise model of iris non-linear texture deformations to be embedded into the synthesis pipeline. This paper presents the first method of fully data-driven, identity-preserving, pupil size-varying synthesis of iris images. This approach is capable of synthesizing images of irises with different pupil sizes representing non-existing identities, as well as non-linearly deforming the texture of iris images of existing subjects given the segmentation mask of the target iris image. Iris recognition experiments suggest that the proposed deformation model both preserves the identity when changing the pupil size, and offers better similarity between same-identity iris samples with significant differences in pupil size, compared to state-of-the-art linear and non-linear (bio-mechanical-based) iris deformation models. Two immediate applications of the proposed approach are: (a) synthesis of, or enhancement of the existing biometric datasets for iris recognition, mimicking those acquired with iris sensors, and (b) helping forensic human experts examine iris image pairs with significant differences in pupil dilation. Images considered in this work conform to selected ISO/IEC 29794-6 quality metrics to make them applicable in biometric systems. The source codes and model weights are offered with this paper.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pervasive across diverse domains, stochastic systems exhibit fluctuations in processes ranging from molecular dynamics to climate phenomena. The Langevin equation has served as a common mathematical model for studying such systems, enabling predictions of their temporal evolution and analyses of thermodynamic quantities, including absorbed heat, work done on the system, and entropy production. However, inferring the Langevin equation from observed trajectories is a challenging problem, and assessing the uncertainty associated with the inferred equation has yet to be accomplished. In this study, we present a comprehensive framework that employs Bayesian neural networks for inferring Langevin equations in both overdamped and underdamped regimes. Our framework first provides the drift force and diffusion matrix separately and then combines them to construct the Langevin equation. By providing a distribution of predictions instead of a single value, our approach allows us to assess prediction uncertainties, which can help prevent potential misunderstandings and erroneous decisions about the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in inferring Langevin equations for various scenarios including a neuron model and microscopic engine, highlighting its versatility and potential impact.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of applications, often outperforming human experts. However, deploying these gigantic models efficiently for diverse inference use cases requires carefully designed hardware platforms with ample computing, memory, and network resources. With constant innovation in LLM serving optimizations and model architecture evolving at breakneck speed, the hardware requirements to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs) remain an open research question.
  To answer the question, we present an analytical tool, GenZ, to efficiently navigate the relationship between diverse LLM model architectures(Dense, GQA, MoE, Mamba), LLM serving optimizations(Chunking, Speculative decoding, quanitization), and AI platform design parameters. Our tool estimates LLM inference performance metrics for the given scenario. We have validated against real hardware platforms running various different LLM models, achieving a max geomean error of 5.82.We use GenZ to identify compute, memory capacity, memory bandwidth, network latency, and network bandwidth requirements across diverse LLM inference use cases. We also study diverse architectural choices in use today (inspired by LLM serving platforms from several vendors) to help inform computer architects designing next-generation AI hardware accelerators and platforms. The trends and insights derived from GenZ can guide AI engineers deploying LLMs as well as computer architects designing next-generation hardware accelerators and platforms. Ultimately, this work sheds light on the platform design considerations for unlocking the full potential of large language models across a spectrum of applications.

<p>Abstract: The increasing interest in developing Artificial Intelligence applications in the medical domain, suffers from the lack of high-quality data set, mainly due to privacy-related issues. Moreover, the recent rising of Large Multimodal Models (LMM) leads to a need for multimodal medical data sets, where clinical reports and findings are attached to the corresponding CT or MR scans. This paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the data set MedPix 2.0. Starting from the well-known multimodal data set MedPix, mainly used by physicians, nurses and healthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic pipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual curing procedure where noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB database. Along with the data set, we developed a GUI aimed at navigating efficiently the MongoDB instance, and obtaining the raw data that can be easily used for training and/or fine-tuning LMMs. To enforce this point, we also propose a CLIP-based model trained on MedPix 2.0 for scanning modality and location classification tasks.

Our approach considers functions as expectations of Sobolev functions over all possible one-dimensional projections of the data. This framework is similar to kernel ridge regression, where the kernel is $\mathbb{E}_w ( k^{(B)}(w^\top x,w^\top x^\prime))$, with $k^{(B)}(a,b) := \min(|a|, |b|)\mathds{1}_{ab>0}$ the Brownian kernel, and the distribution of the projections $w$ is learnt. This can also be viewed as an infinite-width one-hidden layer neural network, optimising the first layer's weights through gradient descent and explicitly adjusting the non-linearity and weights of the second layer. We introduce a gradient-based computational method for the estimator, called Brownian Kernel Neural Network (BKerNN), using particles to approximate the expectation, where the positive homogeneity of the Brownian kernel \red{leads to improved robustness to local minima}. Using Rademacher complexity, we show that BKerNN's expected risk converges to the minimal risk with explicit high-probability rates of $O( \min((d/n)^{1/2}, n^{-1/6}))$ (up to logarithmic factors). Numerical experiments confirm our optimisation intuitions, and BKerNN outperforms kernel ridge regression, and favourably compares to a one-hidden layer neural network with ReLU activations in various settings and real data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Nathaniel Williams, Avi Schwarzschild, Yutong He, J. Zico Kolter</p>
<p>Abstract: Recovering natural language prompts for image generation models, solely based on the generated images is a difficult discrete optimization problem. In this work, we present the first head-to-head comparison of recent discrete optimization techniques for the problem of prompt inversion. We evaluate Greedy Coordinate Gradients (GCG), PEZ , Random Search, AutoDAN and BLIP2's image captioner across various evaluation metrics related to the quality of inverted prompts and the quality of the images generated by the inverted prompts. We find that focusing on the CLIP similarity between the inverted prompts and the ground truth image acts as a poor proxy for the similarity between ground truth image and the image generated by the inverted prompts. While the discrete optimizers effectively minimize their objectives, simply using responses from a well-trained captioner often leads to generated images that more closely resemble those produced by the original prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Daunas, I\~naki Esnaola, Samir M. Perlaza, H. Vincent Poor</p>
<p>Abstract: The effect of relative entropy asymmetry is analyzed in the context of empirical risk minimization (ERM) with relative entropy regularization (ERM-RER). Two regularizations are considered: $(a)$ the relative entropy of the measure to be optimized with respect to a reference measure (Type-I ERM-RER); and $(b)$ the relative entropy of the reference measure with respect to the measure to be optimized (Type-II ERM-RER). The main result is the characterization of the solution to the Type-II ERM-RER problem and its key properties. By comparing the well-understood Type-I ERM-RER with Type-II ERM-RER, the effects of entropy asymmetry are highlighted. The analysis shows that in both cases, regularization by relative entropy forces the solution's support to collapse into the support of the reference measure, introducing a strong inductive bias that negates the evidence provided by the training data. Finally, it is shown that Type-II regularization is equivalent to Type-I regularization with an appropriate transformation of the empirical risk function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michelle Zhao, Reid Simmons, Henny Admoni, Aaditya Ramdas, Andrea Bajcsy</p>
<p>Abstract: In interactive imitation learning (IL), uncertainty quantification offers a way for the learner (i.e. robot) to contend with distribution shifts encountered during deployment by actively seeking additional feedback from an expert (i.e. human) online. Prior works use mechanisms like ensemble disagreement or Monte Carlo dropout to quantify when black-box IL policies are uncertain; however, these approaches can lead to overconfident estimates when faced with deployment-time distribution shifts. Instead, we contend that we need uncertainty quantification algorithms that can leverage the expert human feedback received during deployment time to adapt the robot's uncertainty online. To tackle this, we draw upon online conformal prediction, a distribution-free method for constructing prediction intervals online given a stream of ground-truth labels. Human labels, however, are intermittent in the interactive IL setting. Thus, from the conformal prediction side, we introduce a novel uncertainty quantification algorithm called intermittent quantile tracking (IQT) that leverages a probabilistic model of intermittent labels, maintains asymptotic coverage guarantees, and empirically achieves desired coverage levels. From the interactive IL side, we develop ConformalDAgger, a new approach wherein the robot uses prediction intervals calibrated by IQT as a reliable measure of deployment-time uncertainty to actively query for more expert feedback. We compare ConformalDAgger to prior uncertainty-aware DAgger methods in scenarios where the distribution shift is (and isn't) present because of changes in the expert's policy. We find that in simulated and hardware deployments on a 7DOF robotic manipulator, ConformalDAgger detects high uncertainty when the expert shifts and increases the number of interventions compared to baselines, allowing the robot to more quickly learn the new behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geoffrey Kasenbacher, Felix Ehret, Gerrit Ecke, Sebastian Otte</p>
<p>Abstract: The locally competitive algorithm (LCA) can solve sparse coding problems across a wide range of use cases. Recently, convolution-based LCA approaches have been shown to be highly effective for enhancing robustness for image recognition tasks in vision pipelines. To additionally maximize representational sparsity, LCA with hard-thresholding can be applied. While this combination often yields very good solutions satisfying an $\ell_0$ sparsity criterion, it comes with significant drawbacks for practical application: (i) LCA is very inefficient, typically requiring hundreds of optimization cycles for convergence; (ii) the use of hard-thresholding results in a non-convex loss function, which might lead to suboptimal minima. To address these issues, we propose the Locally Competitive Algorithm with State Warm-up via Predictive Priming (WARP-LCA), which leverages a predictor network to provide a suitable initial guess of the LCA state based on the current input. Our approach significantly improves both convergence speed and the quality of solutions, while maintaining and even enhancing the overall strengths of LCA. We demonstrate that WARP-LCA converges faster by orders of magnitude and reaches better minima compared to conventional LCA. Moreover, the learned representations are more sparse and exhibit superior properties in terms of reconstruction and denoising quality as well as robustness when applied in deep recognition pipelines. Furthermore, we apply WARP-LCA to image denoising tasks, showcasing its robustness and practical effectiveness. Our findings confirm that the naive use of LCA with hard-thresholding results in suboptimal minima, whereas initializing LCA with a predictive guess results in better outcomes. This research advances the field of biologically inspired deep learning by providing a novel approach to convolutional sparse coding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyuan Ma, Hongshu Guo, Yue-Jiao Gong, Jun Zhang, Kay Chen Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this survey, we introduce Meta-Black-Box-Optimization~(MetaBBO) as an emerging avenue within the Evolutionary Computation~(EC) community, which incorporates Meta-learning approaches to assist automated algorithm design. Despite the success of MetaBBO, the current literature provides insufficient summaries of its key aspects and lacks practical guidance for implementation. To bridge this gap, we offer a comprehensive review of recent advances in MetaBBO, providing an in-depth examination of its key developments. We begin with a unified definition of the MetaBBO paradigm, followed by a systematic taxonomy of various algorithm design tasks, including algorithm selection, algorithm configuration, solution manipulation, and algorithm generation. Further, we conceptually summarize different learning methodologies behind current MetaBBO works, including reinforcement learning, supervised learning, neuroevolution, and in-context learning with Large Language Models. A comprehensive evaluation of the latest representative MetaBBO methods is then carried out, alongside an experimental analysis of their optimization performance, computational efficiency, and generalization ability. Based on the evaluation results, we meticulously identify a set of core designs that enhance the generalization and learning effectiveness of MetaBBO. Finally, we outline the vision for the field by providing insight into the latest trends and potential future directions. Relevant literature will be continuously collected and updated at https://github.com/MetaEvo/Awesome-MetaBBO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Ramachandran, Souvik Kundu, Tushar Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization of foundational models (FMs) is significantly more challenging than traditional DNNs due to the emergence of large magnitude values called outliers. Existing outlier-aware algorithm-architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of multi-precision INT processing elements and a network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike prior techniques, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across diverse quantization settings demonstrate that MicroScopiQ achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy, while delivering up to 3x faster inference and 2x lower energy consumption compared to existing alternatives.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honghua Zhang, Benjie Wang, Marcelo Arenas, Guy Van den Broeck</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are a unifying representation for probabilistic models that support tractable inference. Numerous applications of PCs like controllable text generation depend on the ability to efficiently multiply two circuits. Existing multiplication algorithms require that the circuits respect the same structure, i.e. variable scopes decomposes according to the same vtree. In this work, we propose and study the task of restructuring structured(-decomposable) PCs, that is, transforming a structured PC such that it conforms to a target vtree. We propose a generic approach for this problem and show that it leads to novel polynomial-time algorithms for multiplying circuits respecting different vtrees, as well as a practical depth-reduction algorithm that preserves structured decomposibility. Our work opens up new avenues for tractable PC inference, suggesting the possibility of training with less restrictive PC structures while enabling efficient inference by changing their structures at inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiara Mauri, Ryan Fritz, Jocelyn Mora, Benjamin Billot, Juan Eugenio Iglesias, Koen Van Leemput, Jean Augustinack, Douglas N Greve</p>
<p>Abstract: The claustrum is a band-like gray matter structure located between putamen and insula whose exact functions are still actively researched. Its sheet-like structure makes it barely visible in in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans at typical resolutions and neuroimaging tools for its study, including methods for automatic segmentation, are currently very limited. In this paper, we propose a contrast- and resolution-agnostic method for claustrum segmentation at ultra-high resolution (0.35 mm isotropic); the method is based on the SynthSeg segmentation framework (Billot et al., 2023), which leverages the use of synthetic training intensity images to achieve excellent generalization. In particular, SynthSeg requires only label maps to be trained, since corresponding intensity images are synthesized on the fly with random contrast and resolution. We trained a deep learning network for automatic claustrum segmentation, using claustrum manual labels obtained from 18 ultra-high resolution MRI scans (mostly ex vivo). We demonstrated the method to work on these 18 high resolution cases (Dice score = 0.632, mean surface distance = 0.458 mm, and volumetric similarity = 0.867 using 6-fold Cross Validation (CV)), and also on in vivo T1-weighted MRI scans at typical resolutions (~1 mm isotropic). We also demonstrated that the method is robust in a test-retest setting and when applied to multimodal imaging (T2-weighted, Proton Density and quantitative T1 scans). To the best of our knowledge this is the first accurate method for automatic ultra-high resolution claustrum segmentation, which is robust against changes in contrast and resolution. The method is released at https://github.com/chiara-mauri/claustrum_segmentation and as part of the neuroimaging package Freesurfer (Fischl, 2012).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Li, Ruobing Zheng, Minghui Yang, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have endowed talking head synthesis with subtle expressions and vivid head movements, but have also led to slow inference speed and insufficient control over generated results. To address these issues, we propose Ditto, a diffusion-based talking head framework that enables fine-grained controls and real-time inference. Specifically, we utilize an off-the-shelf motion extractor and devise a diffusion transformer to generate representations in a specific motion space. We optimize the model architecture and training strategy to address the issues in generating motion representations, including insufficient disentanglement between motion and identity, and large internal discrepancies within the representation. Besides, we employ diverse conditional signals while establishing a mapping between motion representation and facial semantics, enabling control over the generation process and correction of the results. Moreover, we jointly optimize the holistic framework to enable streaming processing, real-time inference, and low first-frame delay, offering functionalities crucial for interactive applications such as AI assistants. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Ditto generates compelling talking head videos and exhibits superiority in both controllability and real-time performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancing planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the key prerequisites towards unlocking their potential for performing reliably in complex and impactful domains. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate this across board games (Chess, Fischer Random / Chess960, Connect Four, and Hex), and we show that search-based planning can yield significant improvements in LLM game-playing strength. We introduce, compare and contrast two major approaches: In external search, the model guides Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts and evaluations without calls to an external game engine, and in internal search, the model is trained to generate in-context a linearized tree of search and a resulting final choice. Both build on a language model pre-trained on relevant domain knowledge, reliably capturing the transition and value functions in the respective environments, with minimal hallucinations. We evaluate our LLM search implementations against game-specific state-of-the-art engines, showcasing substantial improvements in strength over the base model, and reaching Grandmaster-level performance in chess while operating closer to the human search budget. Our proposed approach, combining search with domain knowledge, is not specific to board games, hinting at more general future applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The biophysical interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and its ligands determine the specificity of the cellular immune response. However, the immense diversity of receptors and ligands has made it challenging to discover generalizable rules across the distinct binding affinity landscapes created by different ligands. Here, we present an optimization framework for discovering biophysical rules that predict whether TCRs share specificity to a ligand. Applying this framework to TCRs associated with a collection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides we systematically characterize how co-specificity depends on the type and position of amino-acid differences between receptors. We also demonstrate that the inferred rules generalize to ligands highly dissimilar to any seen during training. Our analysis reveals that matching of steric properties between substituted amino acids is more important for receptor co-specificity red than the hydrophobic properties that prominently determine evolutionary substitutability. Our analysis also quantifies the substantial importance of positions not in direct contact with the peptide for specificity. These findings highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning the specificity of adaptive immune responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Yin, Zhaoran Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable compositional reasoning by integrating knowledge from various sources. For example, if someone learns ( B = f(A) ) from one source and ( C = g(B) ) from another, they can deduce ( C=g(B)=g(f(A)) ) even without encountering ( ABC ) together, showcasing the generalization ability of human intelligence. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, "FTCT" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in the training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with the model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel segmentation-aware joint training framework called generative reinforcement network (GRN) that integrates segmentation loss feedback to optimize both image generation and segmentation performance in a single stage. An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In high-energy physics, the increasing luminosity and detector granularity at the Large Hadron Collider are driving the need for more efficient data processing solutions. Machine Learning has emerged as a promising tool for reconstructing charged particle tracks, due to its potentially linear computational scaling with detector hits. The recent implementation of a graph neural network-based track reconstruction pipeline in the first level trigger of the LHCb experiment on GPUs serves as a platform for comparative studies between computational architectures in the context of high-energy physics. This paper presents a novel comparison of the throughput of ML model inference between FPGAs and GPUs, focusing on the first step of the track reconstruction pipeline$\unicode{x2013}$an implementation of a multilayer perceptron. Using HLS4ML for FPGA deployment, we benchmark its performance against the GPU implementation and demonstrate the potential of FPGAs for high-throughput, low-latency inference without the need for an expertise in FPGA development and while consuming significantly less power.</p>

The modeling crew consists of a judge agent and multiple agents who perform specific tasks such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection/hyperparameter tuning, model training, model evaluation, and writing documentation. The MRM crew consists of a judge agent along with specialized agents who perform tasks such as checking compliance of modeling documentation, model replication, conceptual soundness, analysis of outcomes, and writing documentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of modeling and MRM crews by presenting a series of numerical examples applied to credit card fraud detection, credit card approval, and portfolio credit risk modeling datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation.

<p>Abstract: Cancer evolves continuously over time through a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, microenvironmental, and phenotypic changes. This dynamic behavior drives uncontrolled cell growth, metastasis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance, posing challenges for effective monitoring and treatment. However, today's data-driven research in oncology has primarily focused on cross-sectional analysis using data from a single modality, limiting the ability to fully characterize and interpret the disease's dynamic heterogeneity. Advances in multiscale data collection and computational methods now enable the discovery of longitudinal multimodal biomarkers for precision oncology. Longitudinal data reveal patterns of disease progression and treatment response that are not evident from single-timepoint data, enabling timely abnormality detection and dynamic treatment adaptation. Multimodal data integration offers complementary information from diverse sources for more precise risk assessment and targeting of cancer therapy. In this review, we survey methods of longitudinal and multimodal modeling, highlighting their synergy in providing multifaceted insights for personalized care tailored to the unique characteristics of a patient's cancer. We summarize the current challenges and future directions of longitudinal multimodal analysis in advancing precision oncology.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in learning joint representations of visual and textual data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives-such as attributes and objects-that were not explicitly encountered during training. Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts. However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features. Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image. Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space. Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore how scalable robot data can address real-world challenges for generalized robotic manipulation. Introducing AgiBot World, a large-scale platform comprising over 1 million trajectories across 217 tasks in five deployment scenarios, we achieve an order-of-magnitude increase in data scale compared to existing datasets. Accelerated by a standardized collection pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, AgiBot World guarantees high-quality and diverse data distribution. It is extensible from grippers to dexterous hands and visuo-tactile sensors for fine-grained skill acquisition. Building on top of data, we introduce Genie Operator-1 (GO-1), a novel generalist policy that leverages latent action representations to maximize data utilization, demonstrating predictable performance scaling with increased data volume. Policies pre-trained on our dataset achieve an average performance improvement of 30% over those trained on Open X-Embodiment, both in in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. GO-1 exhibits exceptional capability in real-world dexterous and long-horizon tasks, achieving over 60% success rate on complex tasks and outperforming prior RDT approach by 32%. By open-sourcing the dataset, tools, and models, we aim to democratize access to large-scale, high-quality robot data, advancing the pursuit of scalable and general-purpose intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> DongHeun Han, Byungmin Kim, RoUn Lee, KyeongMin Kim, Hyoseok Hwang, HyeongYeop Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Realistic Hand manipulation is a key component of immersive virtual reality (VR), yet existing methods often rely on kinematic approach or motion-capture datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight, one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention. Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning, Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suzhe Xu, Jialin Peng, Chengyuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with prompt-driven methods gaining prominence due to their flexibility. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels at point-prompted segmentation, while text-based models, often leveraging powerful multimodal encoders like BEIT-3, provide rich semantic understanding. However, effectively combining these complementary modalities remains a challenge. This paper introduces BiPrompt-SAM, a novel dual-modal prompt segmentation framework employing an explicit selection mechanism. We leverage SAM's ability to generate multiple mask candidates from a single point prompt and use a text-guided mask (generated via EVF-SAM with BEIT-3) to select the point-generated mask that best aligns spatially, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU). This approach, interpretable as a simplified Mixture of Experts (MoE), effectively fuses spatial precision and semantic context without complex model modifications. Notably, our method achieves strong zero-shot performance on the Endovis17 medical dataset (89.55% mDice, 81.46% mIoU) using only a single point prompt per instance. This significantly reduces annotation burden compared to bounding boxes and aligns better with practical clinical workflows, demonstrating the method's effectiveness without domain-specific training. On the RefCOCO series, BiPrompt-SAM attained 87.1%, 86.5%, and 85.8% IoU, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Experiments show BiPrompt-SAM excels in scenarios requiring both spatial accuracy and semantic disambiguation, offering a simple, effective, and interpretable perspective on multi-modal prompt fusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper assesses the performance of five machine learning classifiers: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest using latent representations learned by a Variational Autoencoder from malware datasets. Results from the experiments conducted on different training-test splits with different random seeds reveal that all the models perform well in detecting malware with ensemble methods (LightGBM and Random Forest) performing slightly better than the rest. In addition, the use of latent features reduces the computational cost of the model and the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning for improved efficiency of the model for deployment. Statistical tests show that these improvements are significant, and thus, the practical relevance of integrating latent space representation with traditional classifiers for effective malware detection in cybersecurity is established.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of LLM-driven AI characters raises safety concerns, particularly for vulnerable human users with psychological disorders. To address these risks, we propose EmoAgent, a multi-agent AI framework designed to evaluate and mitigate mental health hazards in human-AI interactions. EmoAgent comprises two components: EmoEval simulates virtual users, including those portraying mentally vulnerable individuals, to assess mental health changes before and after interactions with AI characters. It uses clinically proven psychological and psychiatric assessment tools (PHQ-9, PDI, PANSS) to evaluate mental risks induced by LLM. EmoGuard serves as an intermediary, monitoring users' mental status, predicting potential harm, and providing corrective feedback to mitigate risks. Experiments conducted in popular character-based chatbots show that emotionally engaging dialogues can lead to psychological deterioration in vulnerable users, with mental state deterioration in more than 34.4% of the simulations. EmoGuard significantly reduces these deterioration rates, underscoring its role in ensuring safer AI-human interactions. Our code is available at: https://github.com/1akaman/EmoAgent</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirudhan Badrinath, Prabhat Agarwal, Laksh Bhasin, Jaewon Yang, Jiajing Xu, Charles Rosenberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative retrieval methods utilize generative sequential modeling techniques, such as transformers, to generate candidate items for recommender systems. These methods have demonstrated promising results in academic benchmarks, surpassing traditional retrieval models like two-tower architectures. However, current generative retrieval methods lack the scalability required for industrial recommender systems, and they are insufficiently flexible to satisfy the multiple metric requirements of modern systems. This paper introduces PinRec, a novel generative retrieval model developed for applications at Pinterest. PinRec utilizes outcome-conditioned generation, enabling modelers to specify how to balance various outcome metrics, such as the number of saves and clicks, to effectively align with business goals and user exploration. Additionally, PinRec incorporates multi-token generation to enhance output diversity while optimizing generation. Our experiments demonstrate that PinRec can successfully balance performance, diversity, and efficiency, delivering a significant positive impact to users using generative models. This paper marks a significant milestone in generative retrieval, as it presents, to our knowledge, the first rigorous study on implementing generative retrieval at the scale of Pinterest.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of AI systems for mental health support is hindered by limited access to therapeutic conversation data, particularly for trauma treatment. We present Thousand Voices of Trauma, a synthetic benchmark dataset of 3,000 therapy conversations based on Prolonged Exposure therapy protocols for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The dataset comprises 500 unique cases, each explored through six conversational perspectives that mirror the progression of therapy from initial anxiety to peak distress to emotional processing. We incorporated diverse demographic profiles (ages 18-80, M=49.3, 49.4% male, 44.4% female, 6.2% non-binary), 20 trauma types, and 10 trauma-related behaviors using deterministic and probabilistic generation methods. Analysis reveals realistic distributions of trauma types (witnessing violence 10.6%, bullying 10.2%) and symptoms (nightmares 23.4%, substance abuse 20.8%). Clinical experts validated the dataset's therapeutic fidelity, highlighting its emotional depth while suggesting refinements for greater authenticity. We also developed an emotional trajectory benchmark with standardized metrics for evaluating model responses. This privacy-preserving dataset addresses critical gaps in trauma-focused mental health data, offering a valuable resource for advancing both patient-facing applications and clinician training tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need to utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex regulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'e Longon</p>
<p>Abstract: An important capacity in visual object recognition is invariance to image-altering variables which leave the identity of objects unchanged, such as lighting, rotation, and scale. How do neural networks achieve this? Prior mechanistic interpretability research has illuminated some invariance-building circuitry in InceptionV1, but the results are limited and networks with different architectures have remained largely unexplored. This work investigates ResNet18 with a particular focus on its residual stream, an architectural component which InceptionV1 lacks. We observe that many convolutional channels in intermediate blocks exhibit scale invariant properties, computed by the element-wise residual summation of scale equivariant representations: the block input's smaller-scale copy with the block pre-sum output's larger-scale copy. Through subsequent ablation experiments, we attempt to causally link these neural properties with scale-robust object recognition behavior. Our tentative findings suggest how the residual stream computes scale invariance and its possible role in behavior. Code is available at: https://github.com/cest-andre/residual-stream-interp</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingye Zhou, Caiyang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungnyun Kim, Sungwoo Cho, Sangmin Bae, Kangwook Jang, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) incorporates auditory and visual modalities to improve recognition accuracy, particularly in noisy environments where audio-only speech systems are insufficient. While previous research has largely addressed audio disruptions, few studies have dealt with visual corruptions, e.g., lip occlusions or blurred videos, which are also detrimental. To address this real-world challenge, we propose CAV2vec, a novel self-supervised speech representation learning framework particularly designed to handle audio-visual joint corruption. CAV2vec employs a self-distillation approach with a corrupted prediction task, where the student model learns to predict clean targets, generated by the teacher model, with corrupted input frames. Specifically, we suggest a unimodal multi-task learning, which distills cross-modal knowledge and aligns the corrupted modalities, by predicting clean audio targets with corrupted videos, and clean video targets with corrupted audios. This strategy mitigates the dispersion in the representation space caused by corrupted modalities, leading to more reliable and robust audio-visual fusion. Our experiments on robust AVSR benchmarks demonstrate that the corrupted representation learning method significantly enhances recognition accuracy across generalized environments involving various types of corruption.

We aim to achieve improved performance on legal benchmarks (BigLaw-Bench, EUR-Lex-Sum) compared to traditional models and fine-tuned versions. Preliminary work involves generating synthetic QA pairs reflecting legal reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Bouchard, Mohit Singh Chauhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we propose a versatile framework for zero-resource hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a pivotal paradigm in artificial intelligence to align large models with human preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical framework to simultaneously conduct the online decision-making and statistical inference on the optimal model using human preference data based on dynamic contextual information. Our approach introduces an efficient decision strategy that achieves both the optimal regret bound and the asymptotic distribution of the estimators. A key challenge in RLHF is handling the dependent online human preference outcomes with dynamic contexts. To address this, in the methodological aspect, we propose a two-stage algorithm starting with $\epsilon$-greedy followed by exploitations; in the theoretical aspect, we tailor anti-concentration inequalities and matrix martingale concentration techniques to derive the uniform estimation rate and asymptotic normality of the estimators using dependent samples from both stages. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art strategies. We apply the proposed framework to analyze the human preference data for ranking large language models on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding dataset, yielding insightful results on the performance of different large language models for medical anatomy knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhonghao Li, Kunpeng Zhang, Jinghuai Ou, Shuliang Liu, Xuming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), where complex queries require synthesizing information across multiple document chunks. Existing approaches typically rely on iterative LLM-based query rewriting and routing, resulting in high computational costs due to repeated LLM invocations and multi-stage processes. To address these limitations, we propose TreeHop, an embedding-level framework without the need for LLMs in query refinement. TreeHop dynamically updates query embeddings by fusing semantic information from prior queries and retrieved documents, enabling iterative retrieval through embedding-space operations alone. This method replaces the traditional "Retrieve-Rewrite-Vectorize-Retrieve" cycle with a streamlined "Retrieve-Embed-Retrieve" loop, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, a rule-based stop criterion is introduced to further prune redundant retrievals, balancing efficiency and recall rate. Experimental results show that TreeHop rivals advanced RAG methods across three open-domain MHQA datasets, achieving comparable performance with only 5\%-0.4\% of the model parameter size and reducing the query latency by approximately 99\% compared to concurrent approaches. This makes TreeHop a faster and more cost-effective solution for deployment in a range of knowledge-intensive applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiyang Hong, Xinkai Wu, Hongyu Sun, Chaoyang Xie, Qi Wang, Yuquan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering molecules with desirable molecular properties, including ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) profiles, is of great importance in drug discovery. Existing approaches typically employ deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers, to predict these molecular properties by learning from diverse chemical information. However, these models often fail to efficiently capture and utilize the hierarchical nature of molecular structures, and lack mechanisms for effective interaction among multi-level features. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Message Passing Mechanism, which serves as the foundation of our novel model, HimNet. Our method enables interaction-aware representation learning across atomic, motif, and molecular levels via hierarchical attention-guided message passing. This design allows HimNet to effectively balance global and local information, ensuring rich and task-relevant feature extraction for downstream property prediction tasks, such as Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP). Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HimNet achieves the best or near-best performance in most molecular property prediction tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits promising hierarchical interpretability, aligning well with chemical intuition on representative molecules. We believe that HimNet offers an accurate and efficient solution for molecular activity and ADMET property prediction, contributing significantly to advanced decision-making in the early stages of drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meltem Tatl{\i}, Arpan Mukherjee, Prashanth L. A., Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Ali Tajer</p>
<p>Abstract: The objective of canonical multi-armed bandits is to identify and repeatedly select an arm with the largest reward, often in the form of the expected value of the arm's probability distribution. Such a utilitarian perspective and focus on the probability models' first moments, however, is agnostic to the distributions' tail behavior and their implications for variability and risks in decision-making. This paper introduces a principled framework for shifting from expectation-based evaluation to an alternative reward formulation, termed a preference metric (PM). The PMs can place the desired emphasis on different reward realization and can encode a richer modeling of preferences that incorporate risk aversion, robustness, or other desired attitudes toward uncertainty. A fundamentally distinct observation in such a PM-centric perspective is that designing bandit algorithms will have a significantly different principle: as opposed to the reward-based models in which the optimal sampling policy converges to repeatedly sampling from the single best arm, in the PM-centric framework the optimal policy converges to selecting a mix of arms based on specific mixing weights. Designing such mixture policies departs from the principles for designing bandit algorithms in significant ways, primarily because of uncountable mixture possibilities. The paper formalizes the PM-centric framework and presents two algorithm classes (horizon-dependent and anytime) that learn and track mixtures in a regret-efficient fashion. These algorithms have two distinctions from their canonical counterparts: (i) they involve an estimation routine to form reliable estimates of optimal mixtures, and (ii) they are equipped with tracking mechanisms to navigate arm selection fractions to track the optimal mixtures. These algorithms' regret guarantees are investigated under various algebraic forms of the PMs.</p>
