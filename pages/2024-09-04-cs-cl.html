<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuting Hu, Dancheng Liu, Qingyun Wang, Charles Yu, Heng Ji, Jinjun Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the challenge of automating knowledge discovery from a vast volume of literature, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that combines a progressive ontology prompting (POP) algorithm with a dual-agent system, named LLM-Duo, designed to enhance the automation of knowledge extraction from scientific articles. The POP algorithm utilizes a prioritized breadth-first search (BFS) across a predefined ontology to generate structured prompt templates and action orders, thereby guiding LLMs to discover knowledge in an automatic manner. Additionally, our LLM-Duo employs two specialized LLM agents: an explorer and an evaluator. These two agents work collaboratively and adversarially to enhance the reliability of the discovery and annotation processes. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms advanced baselines, enabling more accurate and complete annotations. To validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios, we employ our method in a case study of speech-language intervention discovery. Our method identifies 2,421 interventions from 64,177 research articles in the speech-language therapy domain. We curate these findings into a publicly accessible intervention knowledge base that holds significant potential to benefit the speech-language therapy community.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00060">Understanding Literary Texts by LLMs: A Case Study of Ancient Chinese Poetry</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Zhao, Bin Wang, Zhen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The birth and rapid development of large language models (LLMs) have caused quite a stir in the field of literature. Once considered unattainable, AI's role in literary creation is increasingly becoming a reality. In genres such as poetry, jokes, and short stories, numerous AI tools have emerged, offering refreshing new perspectives. However, it's difficult to further improve the quality of these works. This is primarily because understanding and appreciating a good literary work involves a considerable threshold, such as knowledge of literary theory, aesthetic sensibility, interdisciplinary knowledge. Therefore, authoritative data in this area is quite lacking. Additionally, evaluating literary works is often complex and hard to fully quantify, which directly hinders the further development of AI creation.
  To address this issue, this paper attempts to explore the mysteries of literary texts from the perspective of LLMs, using ancient Chinese poetry as an example for experimentation. First, we collected a variety of ancient poems from different sources and had experts annotate a small portion of them. Then, we designed a range of comprehension metrics based on LLMs to evaluate all these poems. Finally, we analyzed the correlations and differences between various poem collections to identify literary patterns. Through our experiments, we observed a series of enlightening phenomena that provide technical support for the future development of high-level literary creation based on LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arief Purnama Muharram, Ayu Purwarianti</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated fact-checking is a key strategy to overcome the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on the internet. These systems typically leverage deep learning approaches through Natural Language Inference (NLI) to verify the truthfulness of information based on supporting evidence. However, one challenge that arises in deep learning is performance stagnation due to a lack of knowledge during training. This study proposes using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as external knowledge to enhance NLI performance for automated COVID-19 fact-checking in the Indonesian language. The proposed model architecture comprises three modules: a fact module, an NLI module, and a classifier module. The fact module processes information from the KG, while the NLI module handles semantic relationships between the given premise and hypothesis. The representation vectors from both modules are concatenated and fed into the classifier module to produce the final result. The model was trained using the generated Indonesian COVID-19 fact-checking dataset and the COVID-19 KG Bahasa Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that incorporating KGs can significantly improve NLI performance in fact-checking, achieving the best accuracy of 0,8616. This suggests that KGs are a valuable component for enhancing NLI performance in automated fact-checking.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00063">Urban Mobility Assessment Using LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Prabin Bhandari, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Dieter Pfoser</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding urban mobility patterns and analyzing how people move around cities helps improve the overall quality of life and supports the development of more livable, efficient, and sustainable urban areas. A challenging aspect of this work is the collection of mobility data by means of user tracking or travel surveys, given the associated privacy concerns, noncompliance, and high cost. This work proposes an innovative AI-based approach for synthesizing travel surveys by prompting large language models (LLMs), aiming to leverage their vast amount of relevant background knowledge and text generation capabilities. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of this approach across various U.S. metropolitan areas by comparing the results against existing survey data at different granularity levels. These levels include (i) pattern level, which compares aggregated metrics like the average number of locations traveled and travel time, (ii) trip level, which focuses on comparing trips as whole units using transition probabilities, and (iii) activity chain level, which examines the sequence of locations visited by individuals. Our work covers several proprietary and open-source LLMs, revealing that open-source base models like Llama-2, when fine-tuned on even a limited amount of actual data, can generate synthetic data that closely mimics the actual travel survey data, and as such provides an argument for using such data in mobility studies.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00064">Phrasing for UX: Enhancing Information Engagement through Computational Linguistics and Creative Analytics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nimrod Dvir</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the relationship between textual features and Information Engagement (IE) on digital platforms. It highlights the impact of computational linguistics and analytics on user interaction. The READ model is introduced to quantify key predictors like representativeness, ease of use, affect, and distribution, which forecast engagement levels. The model's effectiveness is validated through AB testing and randomized trials, showing strong predictive performance in participation (accuracy: 0.94), perception (accuracy: 0.85), perseverance (accuracy: 0.81), and overall IE (accuracy: 0.97).
  While participation metrics are strong, perception and perseverance show slightly lower recall and F1-scores, indicating some challenges. The study demonstrates that modifying text based on the READ model's insights leads to significant improvements. For example, increasing representativeness and positive affect boosts selection rates by 11 percent, raises evaluation averages from 3.98 to 4.46, and improves retention rates by 11 percent. These findings highlight the importance of linguistic factors in IE, providing a framework for enhancing digital text engagement. The research offers practical strategies applicable to fields like education, health, and media.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00068">An alternative formulation of attention pooling function in translation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eddie Conti</p>
<p>Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present an alternative formulation of the attention scoring function in translation tasks. Generally speaking, language is deeply structured, and this is reflected in the attention scoring matrix. We exploit this property to define the attention pooling function, taking this aspect into account. In the first chapters, we introduce the attention mechanism in mathematical terms and explain its limitations and alternative formulations. Next, we focus on the experimental session that led to the alternative formulation. Essentially, we guide queries and keys to interact in a specific manner, encoding the distinct roles of attention heads and directing values on where to seek context. In mathematical terms, we can think of this formula as projecting the attention scores matrix, say $H$, onto the space of band matrices with fixed bandwidth. This convex subspace is clearly finite-dimensional and therefore closed. As a consequence, the projection on this space is well-posed and unique. However, at the price of losing the uniqueness of the projection (i.e., the best approximation for $H$), we defined a new space consisting of band matrices plus error sparse matrices. We prove that this is a compact subspace which guarantees the existence of a matrix that best approximates $H$. We conclude the thesis by validating the new formula, namely calculating how well the new formula for attention scores approximates the original one. Additionally, we explore the impact of different parameters such as w (context windows) and num-pos (number of relevant words in a sentence). These analyses provide deeper insights into how languages are processed and translated, revealing nuances in the roles of context and word relevance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00070">Learning to Plan Long-Term for Language Modeling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Mai, Nathan Cornille, Marie-Francine Moens</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern language models predict the next token in the sequence by considering the past text through a powerful function such as attention. However, language models have no explicit mechanism that allows them to spend computation time for planning long-distance future text, leading to a suboptimal token prediction. In this paper, we propose a planner that predicts a latent plan for many sentences into the future. By sampling multiple plans at once, we condition the language model on an accurate approximation of the distribution of text continuations, which leads to better next token prediction accuracy. In effect, this allows trading computation time for prediction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linda Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems struggle when translating to and from low-resource languages, which lack large-scale data corpora for models to use for training. As manual data curation is expensive and time-consuming, we propose utilizing a generative-adversarial network (GAN) to augment low-resource language data. When training on a very small amount of language data (under 20,000 sentences) in a simulated low-resource setting, our model shows potential at data augmentation, generating monolingual language data with sentences such as "ask me that healthy lunch im cooking up," and "my grandfather work harder than your grandfather before." Our novel data augmentation approach takes the first step in investigating the capability of GANs in low-resource NMT, and our results suggest that there is promise for future extension of GANs to low-resource NMT.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00077">Are LLM-based methods good enough for detecting unfair terms of service?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mirgita Frasheri, Arian Bakhtiarnia, Lukas Esterle, Aleksandros Iosifidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Countless terms of service (ToS) are being signed everyday by users all over the world while interacting with all kinds of apps and websites. More often than not, these online contracts spanning double-digit pages are signed blindly by users who simply want immediate access to the desired service. What would normally require a consultation with a legal team, has now become a mundane activity consisting of a few clicks where users potentially sign away their rights, for instance in terms of their data privacy, to countless online entities/companies. Large language models (LLMs) are good at parsing long text-based documents, and could potentially be adopted to help users when dealing with dubious clauses in ToS and their underlying privacy policies. To investigate the utility of existing models for this task, we first build a dataset consisting of 12 questions applied individually to a set of privacy policies crawled from popular websites. Thereafter, a series of open-source as well as commercial chatbots such as ChatGPT, are queried over each question, with the answers being compared to a given ground truth. Our results show that some open-source models are able to provide a higher accuracy compared to some commercial models. However, the best performance is recorded from a commercial chatbot (ChatGPT4). Overall, all models perform only slightly better than random at this task. Consequently, their performance needs to be significantly improved before they can be adopted at large for this purpose.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00082">Towards Human-Level Understanding of Complex Process Engineering Schematics: A Pedagogical, Introspective Multi-Agent Framework for Open-Domain Question Answering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagar Srinivas Sakhinana, Geethan Sannidhi, Venkataramana Runkana</p>
<p>Abstract: In the chemical and process industries, Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) are critical for design, construction, and maintenance. Recent advancements in Generative AI, such as Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) like GPT4 (Omni), have shown promise in understanding and interpreting process diagrams for Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, proprietary models pose data privacy risks, and their computational complexity prevents knowledge editing for domain-specific customization on consumer hardware. To overcome these challenges, we propose a secure, on-premises enterprise solution using a hierarchical, multi-agent Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for open-domain question answering (ODQA) tasks, offering enhanced data privacy, explainability, and cost-effectiveness. Our novel multi-agent framework employs introspective and specialized sub-agents using open-source, small-scale multimodal models with the ReAct (Reason+Act) prompting technique for PFD and P&ID analysis, integrating multiple information sources to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers. Our approach, supported by iterative self-correction, aims to deliver superior performance in ODQA tasks. We conducted rigorous experimental studies, and the empirical results validated the proposed approach effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background and Aims: This study evaluates the medical reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) in gastroenterology.
  Methods: We used 300 gastroenterology board exam-style multiple-choice questions, 138 of which contain images to systematically assess the impact of model configurations and parameters and prompt engineering strategies utilizing GPT-3.5. Next, we assessed the performance of proprietary and open-source LLMs (versions), including GPT (3.5, 4, 4{\deg}, 4omini), Claude (3, 3.5), Gemini (1.0), Mistral, Llama (2, 3, 3.1), Mixtral, and Phi (3), across different interfaces (web and API), computing environments (cloud and local), and model precisions (with and without quantization). Finally, we assessed accuracy using a semiautomated pipeline.
  Results: Among the proprietary models, GPT-4o (73.7%) and Claude3.5-Sonnet (74.0%) achieved the highest accuracy, whereas Llama3-70b (54.7%) and Mixtral8x7b (54.3%) were the most accurate open-source models. Among the quantized open-source models, the 6-bit quantized Phi3-14b (48.7%) performed best. The scores of the quantized models were comparable to those of the full-precision models Llama2--7b, Llama2--13b, and Gemma2--9b. Notably, VLM performance on image-containing questions did not improve when the images were provided and worsened when LLM-generated captions were provided. In contrast, a 10% increase in accuracy was observed when images were accompanied by one-sentence human-crafted image descriptions.
  Conclusion: In conclusion, while LLMs exhibit robust zero-shot performance in medical reasoning, the integration of visual data remains a challenge for VLMs. Effective deployment involves carefully determining optimal model configurations, encouraging users to consider either the high performance of proprietary models or the flexible adaptability of open-source models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative language models hallucinate. That is, at times, they generate factually flawed responses. These inaccuracies are particularly insidious because the responses are fluent and well-articulated. We focus on the task of Grounded Answer Generation (part of Generative IR), which aims to produce direct answers to a user's question based on results retrieved from a search engine. We address hallucination by adapting an existing genetic generation approach with a new 'balanced fitness function' consisting of a cross-encoder model for relevance and an n-gram overlap metric to promote grounding. Our balanced fitness function approach quadruples the grounded answer generation accuracy while maintaining high relevance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Anwar, Mischa de Costa, Issam Hammad, Daniel Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the application of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), for question-and-answer (Q&A) tasks in the highly specialized field of nuclear data. The primary focus is on evaluating ChatGPT's performance on a curated test dataset, comparing the outcomes of a standalone LLM with those generated through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. LLMs, despite their recent advancements, are prone to generating incorrect or 'hallucinated' information, which is a significant limitation in applications requiring high accuracy and reliability. This study explores the potential of utilizing RAG in LLMs, a method that integrates external knowledge bases and sophisticated retrieval techniques to enhance the accuracy and relevance of generated outputs. In this context, the paper evaluates ChatGPT's ability to answer domain-specific questions, employing two methodologies: A) direct response from the LLM, and B) response from the LLM within a RAG framework. The effectiveness of these methods is assessed through a dual mechanism of human and LLM evaluation, scoring the responses for correctness and other metrics. The findings underscore the improvement in performance when incorporating a RAG pipeline in an LLM, particularly in generating more accurate and contextually appropriate responses for nuclear domain-specific queries. Additionally, the paper highlights alternative approaches to further refine and improve the quality of answers in such specialized domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runtao Ren, Jian Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: As humanity stands on the brink of a new era of technological innovation, the ability to rapidly transform creative ideas into protected intellectual property (IP) is more crucial than ever. However, the conventional processes for patent drafting are fraught with challenges, demanding a nuanced understanding of advanced field knowledge and technical concepts. Existing large language models (LLMs), while powerful, often fall short in this IP creation domain due to their lack of specialized knowledge and context-awareness necessary for generating technically accurate patent documents. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a groundbreaking framework for Knowledge Fine-Tuning (KFT) of LLMs, designed to endow AI with the ability to autonomously mine, understand, and apply domain-specific knowledge. Our model, PatentGPT leverages a unique combination of knowledge graph-based pre-training, domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Through extensive evaluation, PatentGPT has demonstrated outstanding performance, scoring up to approximately 400% higher in patent related benchmark tests compared to state-of-the-art models. By KFT method the model's capability to not only assist but also augment human creativity and innovation, our approach sets a new standard for AI-driven intellectual property generation, paving the way for more efficient and effective invention processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baptiste Lefort, Eric Benhamou, Jean-Jacques Ohana, Beatrice Guez, David Saltiel, Thomas Jacquot</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of the Condorcet Jury theorem to the domain of sentiment analysis, specifically examining the performance of various large language models (LLMs) compared to simpler natural language processing (NLP) models. The theorem posits that a majority vote classifier should enhance predictive accuracy, provided that individual classifiers' decisions are independent. Our empirical study tests this theoretical framework by implementing a majority vote mechanism across different models, including advanced LLMs such as ChatGPT 4. Contrary to expectations, the results reveal only marginal improvements in performance when incorporating larger models, suggesting a lack of independence among them. This finding aligns with the hypothesis that despite their complexity, LLMs do not significantly outperform simpler models in reasoning tasks within sentiment analysis, showing the practical limits of model independence in the context of advanced NLP tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncheng Xie, Shensian Syu, Hung-yi Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning is crucial for today's large language models (LLMs) to learn to follow instructions and align with human preferences. Conventionally, supervised data, including the instruction and the correct response, is required for instruction fine-tuning. To obtain such data, some researchers prompted well-trained models like GPT-4 to generate instructions and correct responses. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses the first half of a random text from OpenWebText as the instruction and GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4-turbo to complete the text as the response. Despite the data being "non-instructional", we found that pre-trained LLMs fine-tuned on this data can gain instruction-following capabilities. This observation is verified by fine-tuning several well-known pre-trained LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mistral-7B-v0.1). The "non-instructional data" also improved some models that underwent supervised fine-tuning and human preference alignment. Our LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct fine-tuned through "non-instructional data" is comparable with LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct on the Arena Hard leaderboard. We analyzed the "non-instructional data" and ensured it is devoid of content related to instruction fine-tuning. Our findings will inspire further investigation into how to develop instruction-following capabilities without explicit instruction-related data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic disease diagnosis has become increasingly valuable in clinical practice. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, with growing evidence supporting the efficacy of LLMs in diagnostic tasks. Despite the growing attention in this field, many critical research questions remain under-explored. For instance, what diseases and LLM techniques have been investigated for diagnostic tasks? How can suitable LLM techniques and evaluation methods be selected for clinical decision-making? To answer these questions, we performed a comprehensive analysis of LLM-based methods for disease diagnosis. This scoping review examined the types of diseases, associated organ systems, relevant clinical data, LLM techniques, and evaluation methods reported in existing studies. Furthermore, we offered guidelines for data preprocessing and the selection of appropriate LLM techniques and evaluation strategies for diagnostic tasks. We also assessed the limitations of current research and delineated the challenges and future directions in this research field. In summary, our review outlined a blueprint for LLM-based disease diagnosis, helping to streamline and guide future research endeavors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbo Wang, Wenyu Chen, Shimin Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, machine learning techniques have seen significant success across various applications. Most of these techniques rely on supervision from human-generated labels or a mixture of noisy and imprecise labels from multiple sources. However, for certain complex tasks, even noisy or inexact labels are unavailable due to the intricacy of the objectives. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that breaks down the complex objective into simpler tasks and generates supervision signals for each one. We then integrate these supervision signals into a manageable form, resulting in a straightforward learning procedure. As a case study, we demonstrate a system used for topic-based summarization. This system leverages rich supervision signals to promote both summarization and topic relevance. Remarkably, we can train the model end-to-end without any labels. Experimental results indicate that our approach performs exceptionally well on the CNN and DailyMail datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Wang, Shuyu Kong, Li Wan, Biqiao Zhang, Yiteng Huang, Mumin Jin, Ming Sun, Xin Lei, Zhaojun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing keyword spotting (KWS) systems primarily rely on predefined keyword phrases. However, the ability to recognize customized keywords is crucial for tailoring interactions with intelligent devices. In this paper, we present a novel Query-by-Example (QbyE) KWS system that employs spectral-temporal graph attentive pooling and multi-task learning. This framework aims to effectively learn speaker-invariant and linguistic-informative embeddings for QbyE KWS tasks. Within this framework, we investigate three distinct network architectures for encoder modeling: LiCoNet, Conformer and ECAPA_TDNN. The experimental results on a substantial internal dataset of $629$ speakers have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed QbyE framework in maximizing the potential of simpler models such as LiCoNet. Particularly, LiCoNet, which is 13x more efficient, achieves comparable performance to the computationally intensive Conformer model (1.98% vs. 1.63\% FRR at 0.3 FAs/Hr).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaobo Cui, Junyou Li, Luca Mouchel, Yiyang Feng, Boi Faltings</p>
<p>Abstract: To address this gap, our study introduces the concept of causal epistemic consistency, which focuses on the self-consistency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in differentiating intermediates with nuanced differences in causal reasoning. We propose a suite of novel metrics -- intensity ranking concordance, cross-group position agreement, and intra-group clustering -- to evaluate LLMs on this front. Through extensive empirical studies on 21 high-profile LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude3, and LLaMA3-70B, we have favoring evidence that current models struggle to maintain epistemic consistency in identifying the polarity and intensity of intermediates in causal reasoning. Additionally, we explore the potential of using internal token probabilities as an auxiliary tool to maintain causal epistemic consistency. In summary, our study bridges a critical gap in AI research by investigating the self-consistency over fine-grained intermediates involved in causal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Nadeem, Shahab Saquib Sohail, Erik Cambria, Bj\"orn W. Schuller, Amir Hussain</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed the way we perceive technology. They have been shown to excel in tasks ranging from poem writing and coding to essay generation and puzzle solving. With the incorporation of image generation capability, they have become more comprehensive and versatile AI tools. At the same time, researchers are striving to identify the limitations of these tools to improve them further. Currently identified flaws include hallucination, biases, and bypassing restricted commands to generate harmful content. In the present work, we have identified a fundamental limitation related to the image generation ability of LLMs, and termed it The NO Syndrome. This negation blindness refers to LLMs inability to correctly comprehend NO related natural language prompts to generate the desired images. Interestingly, all tested LLMs including GPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot were found to be suffering from this syndrome. To demonstrate the generalization of this limitation, we carried out simulation experiments and conducted entropy-based and benchmark statistical analysis tests on various LLMs in multiple languages, including English, Hindi, and French. We conclude that the NO syndrome is a significant flaw in current LLMs that needs to be addressed. A related finding of this study showed a consistent discrepancy between image and textual responses as a result of this NO syndrome. We posit that the introduction of a negation context-aware reinforcement learning based feedback loop between the LLMs textual response and generated image could help ensure the generated text is based on both the LLMs correct contextual understanding of the negation query and the generated visual output.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00106">Zero-Shot Visual Reasoning by Vision-Language Models: Benchmarking and Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aishik Nagar, Shantanu Jaiswal, Cheston Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown impressive zero- and few-shot performance on real-world visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, alluding to their capabilities as visual reasoning engines. However, the benchmarks being used conflate "pure" visual reasoning with world knowledge, and also have questions that involve a limited number of reasoning steps. Thus, it remains unclear whether a VLM's apparent visual reasoning performance is due to its world knowledge, or due to actual visual reasoning capabilities.
  To clarify this ambiguity, we systematically benchmark and dissect the zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs through synthetic datasets that require minimal world knowledge, and allow for analysis over a broad range of reasoning steps. We focus on two novel aspects of zero-shot visual reasoning: i) evaluating the impact of conveying scene information as either visual embeddings or purely textual scene descriptions to the underlying large language model (LLM) of the VLM, and ii) comparing the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting to standard prompting for zero-shot visual reasoning.
  We find that the underlying LLMs, when provided textual scene descriptions, consistently perform better compared to being provided visual embeddings. In particular, 18% higher accuracy is achieved on the PTR dataset. We also find that CoT prompting performs marginally better than standard prompting only for the comparatively large GPT-3.5-Turbo (175B) model, and does worse for smaller-scale models. This suggests the emergence of CoT abilities for visual reasoning in LLMs at larger scales even when world knowledge is limited. Overall, we find limitations in the abilities of VLMs and LLMs for more complex visual reasoning, and highlight the important role that LLMs can play in visual reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniil Filienko, Yinzhou Wang, Caroline El Jazmi, Serena Xie, Trevor Cohen, Martine De Cock, Weichao Yuwen</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are being quickly adapted to many domains, including healthcare, their strengths and pitfalls remain under-explored. In our study, we examine the effects of prompt engineering to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) in delivering parts of a Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) session via text, particularly during the symptom identification and assessment phase for personalized goal setting. We present evaluation results of the models' performances by automatic metrics and experienced medical professionals. We demonstrate that the models' capability to deliver protocolized therapy can be improved with the proper use of prompt engineering methods, albeit with limitations. To our knowledge, this study is among the first to assess the effects of various prompting techniques in enhancing a generalist model's ability to deliver psychotherapy, focusing on overall quality, consistency, and empathy. Exploring LLMs' potential in delivering psychotherapy holds promise with the current shortage of mental health professionals amid significant needs, enhancing the potential utility of AI-based and AI-enhanced care services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gracjan G\'oral, Emilia Wi\'snios</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the zero-shot ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect multiple-choice questions with no correct answer, a crucial aspect of educational assessment quality. We explore this ability not only as a measure of subject matter knowledge but also as an indicator of critical thinking within LLMs. Our experiments, utilizing a range of LLMs on diverse questions, highlight the significant performance gap between questions with a single correct answer and those without. Llama-3.1-405B stands out by successfully identifying the lack of a valid answer in many instances. These findings suggest that LLMs should prioritize critical thinking over blind instruction following and caution against their use in educational settings where questions with incorrect answers might lead to inaccurate evaluations. This research sets a benchmark for assessing critical thinking in LLMs and emphasizes the need for ongoing model alignment to ensure genuine user comprehension and assistance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00116">FedMCP: Parameter-Efficient Federated Learning with Model-Contrastive Personalization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianyi Zhao, Chen Qu, Cen Chen, Mingyuan Fan, Yanhao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With increasing concerns and regulations on data privacy, fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) in federated learning (FL) has become a common paradigm for NLP tasks. Despite being extensively studied, the existing methods for this problem still face two primary challenges. First, the huge number of parameters in large-scale PLMs leads to excessive communication and computational overhead. Second, the heterogeneity of data and tasks across clients poses a significant obstacle to achieving the desired fine-tuning performance. To address the above problems, we propose FedMCP, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method with model-contrastive personalization for FL. Specifically, FedMCP adds two lightweight adapter modules, i.e., the global adapter and the private adapter, to the frozen PLMs within clients. In a communication round, each client sends only the global adapter to the server for federated aggregation. Furthermore, FedMCP introduces a model-contrastive regularization term between the two adapters. This, on the one hand, encourages the global adapter to assimilate universal knowledge and, on the other hand, the private adapter to capture client-specific knowledge. By leveraging both adapters, FedMCP can effectively provide fine-tuned personalized models tailored to individual clients. Extensive experiments on highly heterogeneous cross-task, cross-silo datasets show that FedMCP achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art FL fine-tuning approaches for PLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jangyeong Jeon, Sangyeon Cho, Minuk Ma, Junyoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the Code-Switching (CS) phenomenon where two languages intertwine within a single utterance. There exists a noticeable need for research on the CS between English and Korean. We highlight that the current Equivalence Constraint (EC) theory for CS in other languages may only partially capture English-Korean CS complexities due to the intrinsic grammatical differences between the languages. We introduce a novel Koglish dataset tailored for English-Korean CS scenarios to mitigate such challenges. First, we constructed the Koglish-GLUE dataset to demonstrate the importance and need for CS datasets in various tasks. We found the differential outcomes of various foundation multilingual language models when trained on a monolingual versus a CS dataset. Motivated by this, we hypothesized that SimCSE, which has shown strengths in monolingual sentence embedding, would have limitations in CS scenarios. We construct a novel Koglish-NLI (Natural Language Inference) dataset using a CS augmentation-based approach to verify this. From this CS-augmented dataset Koglish-NLI, we propose a unified contrastive learning and augmentation method for code-switched embeddings, ConCSE, highlighting the semantics of CS sentences. Experimental results validate the proposed ConCSE with an average performance enhancement of 1.77\% on the Koglish-STS(Semantic Textual Similarity) tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Cui, Ning Li, Huaikang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into scientific research, particularly in the social sciences, where understanding human behavior is critical. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promise in replicating human-like responses in various psychological experiments. However, the extent to which LLMs can effectively replace human subjects across diverse experimental contexts remains unclear. Here, we conduct a large-scale study replicating 154 psychological experiments from top social science journals with 618 main effects and 138 interaction effects using GPT-4 as a simulated participant. We find that GPT-4 successfully replicates 76.0 percent of main effects and 47.0 percent of interaction effects observed in the original studies, closely mirroring human responses in both direction and significance. However, only 19.44 percent of GPT-4's replicated confidence intervals contain the original effect sizes, with the majority of replicated effect sizes exceeding the 95 percent confidence interval of the original studies. Additionally, there is a 71.6 percent rate of unexpected significant results where the original studies reported null findings, suggesting potential overestimation or false positives. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLMs as powerful tools in psychological research but also emphasize the need for caution in interpreting AI-driven findings. While LLMs can complement human studies, they cannot yet fully replace the nuanced insights provided by human subjects.</p>

Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a 15.8% improvement over the Chain of Thought approach on the SVAMP dataset and a 21.5 % improvement on the GSM8K dataset. Further application of this method to a large-scale model with 175 billion parameters yields performance comparable to the best results on both aforementioned datasets. Finally, we conduct an analysis of errors during the reasoning process, providing valuable insights and directions for future research on reasoning tasks using large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented natural language understanding and generation capabilities. However, existing surveys on LLMs in biomedicine often focus on specific applications or model architectures, lacking a comprehensive analysis that integrates the latest advancements across various biomedical domains. This review, based on an analysis of 484 publications sourced from databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and arXiv, provides an in-depth examination of the current landscape, applications, challenges, and prospects of LLMs in biomedicine, distinguishing itself by focusing on the practical implications of these models in real-world biomedical contexts. Firstly, we explore the capabilities of LLMs in zero-shot learning across a broad spectrum of biomedical tasks, including diagnostic assistance, drug discovery, and personalized medicine, among others, with insights drawn from 137 key studies. Then, we discuss adaptation strategies of LLMs, including fine-tuning methods for both uni-modal and multi-modal LLMs to enhance their performance in specialized biomedical contexts where zero-shot fails to achieve, such as medical question answering and efficient processing of biomedical literature. Finally, we discuss the challenges that LLMs face in the biomedicine domain including data privacy concerns, limited model interpretability, issues with dataset quality, and ethics due to the sensitive nature of biomedical data, the need for highly reliable model outputs, and the ethical implications of deploying AI in healthcare. To address these challenges, we also identify future research directions of LLM in biomedicine including federated learning methods to preserve data privacy and integrating explainable AI methodologies to enhance the transparency of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of specialized large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in addressing complex tasks for materials science. Many LLMs, however, often struggle with distinct complexities of material science tasks, such as materials science computational tasks, and often rely heavily on outdated implicit knowledge, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce HoneyComb, the first LLM-based agent system specifically designed for materials science. HoneyComb leverages a novel, high-quality materials science knowledge base (MatSciKB) and a sophisticated tool hub (ToolHub) to enhance its reasoning and computational capabilities tailored to materials science. MatSciKB is a curated, structured knowledge collection based on reliable literature, while ToolHub employs an Inductive Tool Construction method to generate, decompose, and refine API tools for materials science. Additionally, HoneyComb leverages a retriever module that adaptively selects the appropriate knowledge source or tools for specific tasks, thereby ensuring accuracy and relevance. Our results demonstrate that HoneyComb significantly outperforms baseline models across various tasks in materials science, effectively bridging the gap between current LLM capabilities and the specialized needs of this domain. Furthermore, our adaptable framework can be easily extended to other scientific domains, highlighting its potential for broad applicability in advancing scientific research and applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijia Shao, Tianshi Li, Weiyan Shi, Yanchen Liu, Diyi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models (LMs) are widely utilized in personalized communication scenarios (e.g., sending emails, writing social media posts) and endowed with a certain level of agency, ensuring they act in accordance with the contextual privacy norms becomes increasingly critical. However, quantifying the privacy norm awareness of LMs and the emerging privacy risk in LM-mediated communication is challenging due to (1) the contextual and long-tailed nature of privacy-sensitive cases, and (2) the lack of evaluation approaches that capture realistic application scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PrivacyLens, a novel framework designed to extend privacy-sensitive seeds into expressive vignettes and further into agent trajectories, enabling multi-level evaluation of privacy leakage in LM agents' actions. We instantiate PrivacyLens with a collection of privacy norms grounded in privacy literature and crowdsourced seeds. Using this dataset, we reveal a discrepancy between LM performance in answering probing questions and their actual behavior when executing user instructions in an agent setup. State-of-the-art LMs, like GPT-4 and Llama-3-70B, leak sensitive information in 25.68% and 38.69% of cases, even when prompted with privacy-enhancing instructions. We also demonstrate the dynamic nature of PrivacyLens by extending each seed into multiple trajectories to red-team LM privacy leakage risk.

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has spurred extensive research into their domain-specific capabilities, particularly mathematical reasoning. However, most open-source LLMs focus solely on mathematical reasoning, neglecting the integration with visual injection, despite the fact that many mathematical tasks rely on visual inputs such as geometric diagrams, charts, and function plots. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{MultiMath-7B}, a multimodal large language model that bridges the gap between math and vision. \textbf{MultiMath-7B} is trained through a four-stage process, focusing on vision-language alignment, visual and math instruction-tuning, and process-supervised reinforcement learning. We also construct a novel, diverse and comprehensive multimodal mathematical dataset, \textbf{MultiMath-300K}, which spans K-12 levels with image captions and step-wise solutions. MultiMath-7B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models on existing multimodal mathematical benchmarks and also excels on text-only mathematical benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Speech applications dealing with conversations require not only recognizing the spoken words but also determining who spoke when. The task of assigning words to speakers is typically addressed by merging the outputs of two separate systems, namely, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system and a speaker diarization (SD) system. In practical settings, speaker diarization systems can experience significant degradation in performance due to a variety of factors, including uniform segmentation with a high temporal resolution, inaccurate word timestamps, incorrect clustering and estimation of speaker numbers, as well as background noise.
  Therefore, it is important to automatically detect errors and make corrections if possible. We used a second-pass speaker tagging correction system based on a non-autoregressive language model to correct mistakes in words placed at the borders of sentences spoken by different speakers. We first show that the employed error correction approach leads to reductions in word diarization error rate (WDER) on two datasets: TAL and test set of Fisher. Additionally, we evaluated our system in the Post-ASR Speaker Tagging Correction challenge and observed significant improvements in cpWER compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihyun Mun, Sunhee Kim, Minhwa Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong condition that significantly influencing an individual's communication abilities and their social interactions. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical due to the profound impact of ASD's characteristic behaviors on foundational developmental stages. However, limitations of standardized diagnostic tools necessitate the development of objective and precise diagnostic methodologies. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for automatically predicting the social communication severity of children with ASD from raw speech data. This framework incorporates an automatic speech recognition model, fine-tuned with speech data from children with ASD, followed by the application of fine-tuned pre-trained language models to generate a final prediction score. Achieving a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.6566 with human-rated scores, the proposed method showcases its potential as an accessible and objective tool for the assessment of ASD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erwan Le Merrer, Gilles Tredan</p>
<p>Abstract: It is known that LLMs do hallucinate, that is, they return incorrect information as facts. In this paper, we introduce the possibility to study these hallucinations under a structured form: graphs. Hallucinations in this context are incorrect outputs when prompted for well known graphs from the literature (e.g. Karate club, Les Mis\'erables, graph atlas). These hallucinated graphs have the advantage of being much richer than the factual accuracy -- or not -- of a fact; this paper thus argues that such rich hallucinations can be used to characterize the outputs of LLMs. Our first contribution observes the diversity of topological hallucinations from major modern LLMs. Our second contribution is the proposal of a metric for the amplitude of such hallucinations: the Graph Atlas Distance, that is the average graph edit distance from several graphs in the graph atlas set. We compare this metric to the Hallucination Leaderboard, a hallucination rank that leverages 10,000 times more prompts to obtain its ranking.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00162">Sequence to Sequence Reward Modeling: Improving RLHF by Language Feedback</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Zhou, Jiaming Ji, Juntao Dai, Yaodong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning the behavior of Large language models (LLMs) with human intentions and values remains a critical challenge. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns LLMs by training a reward model (RM) on human preferences and fine-tuning the LLMs to maximize RM feedback. Despite its effectiveness and popularity, RLHF is prone to biased local optimization. It means RM fails to provide feedback that accurately aligns with human preference, causing LLMs to explore unexpected generalizations, and failing to achieve alignment objectives. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) reward modeling} method. Its key insight is that learning from language feedback rather than scalar feedback improves RLHF without additional annotations. We replaced the reward modeling target from binary maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with sequence MLE. This method enables richer and fine-grained language feedback without additional annotations, models, or training stages. Our experiments demonstrated its effectiveness, specifically, reducing the refusal-to-response paradigm in single-turn safety dialogues and the long-response bias in text summarization tasks. We provide further analysis that seq2seq RM improves RLHF performance across 2B and 7B LLMs on 3 NLP tasks, achieving an average win rate of 76.9\%. We further show that seq2seq RM can still improve the performance of RLHF under out-of-distribution prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Phenotyping consists in applying algorithms to identify individuals associated with a specific, potentially complex, trait or condition, typically out of a collection of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Because a lot of the clinical information of EHRs are lying in texts, phenotyping from text takes an important role in studies that rely on the secondary use of EHRs. However, the heterogeneity and highly specialized aspect of both the content and form of clinical texts makes this task particularly tedious, and is the source of time and cost constraints in observational studies. To facilitate the development, evaluation and reproductibility of phenotyping pipelines, we developed an open-source Python library named medkit. It enables composing data processing pipelines made of easy-to-reuse software bricks, named medkit operations. In addition to the core of the library, we share the operations and pipelines we already developed and invite the phenotyping community for their reuse and enrichment. medkit is available at https://github.com/medkit-lib/medkit</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Laverghetta Jr., Simone Luchini, Averie Linell, Roni Reiter-Palmon, Roger Beaty</p>
<p>Abstract: Increasingly, large language models (LLMs) are being used to automate workplace processes requiring a high degree of creativity. While much prior work has examined the creativity of LLMs, there has been little research on whether they can generate valid creativity assessments for humans despite the increasingly central role of creativity in modern economies. We develop a psychometrically inspired framework for creating test items (questions) for a classic free-response creativity test: the creative problem-solving (CPS) task. Our framework, the creative psychometric item generator (CPIG), uses a mixture of LLM-based item generators and evaluators to iteratively develop new prompts for writing CPS items, such that items from later iterations will elicit more creative responses from test takers. We find strong empirical evidence that CPIG generates valid and reliable items and that this effect is not attributable to known biases in the evaluation process. Our findings have implications for employing LLMs to automatically generate valid and reliable creativity tests for humans and AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mazal Bethany, Emet Bethany, Brandon Wherry, Cho-Yu Chiang, Nishant Vishwamitra, Anthony Rios, Peyman Najafirad</p>
<p>Abstract: Event detection and text reasoning have become critical applications across various domains. While LLMs have recently demonstrated impressive progress in reasoning abilities, they often struggle with event detection, particularly due to the absence of training methods that consider causal relationships between event triggers and types. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for instruction fine-tuning LLMs for event detection. Our method introduces Semantic Causal Graphs (SCGs) to capture both causal relationships and contextual information within text. Building off of SCGs, we propose SCG Instructions for fine-tuning LLMs by focusing on event triggers and their relationships to event types, and employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to help preserve the general reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our evaluations demonstrate that training LLMs with SCG Instructions outperforms standard instruction fine-tuning by an average of 35.69\% on Event Trigger Classification. Notably, our fine-tuned Mistral 7B model also outperforms GPT-4 on key event detection metrics by an average of 31.01\% on Event Trigger Identification, 37.40\% on Event Trigger Classification, and 16.43\% on Event Classification. We analyze the retention of general capabilities, observing only a minimal average drop of 2.03 points across six benchmarks. This comprehensive study investigates multiple LLMs for the event detection task across various datasets, prompting strategies, and training approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongyue Sun, Jiayi Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Event Argument Extraction (EAE) is pivotal for extracting structured information from unstructured text, yet it remains challenging due to the complexity of real-world document-level EAE. We propose a novel Definition-augmented Heuristic-driven Prompting (DHP) method to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in document-level EAE. Our method integrates argument extraction-related definitions and heuristic rules to guide the extraction process, reducing error propagation and improving task accuracy. We also employ the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method to simulate human reasoning, breaking down complex problems into manageable sub-problems. Experiments have shown that our method achieves a certain improvement in performance over existing prompting methods and few-shot supervised learning on document-level EAE datasets. The DHP method enhances the generalization capability of LLMs and reduces reliance on large annotated datasets, offering a novel research perspective for document-level EAE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ada Defne Tur, Adel Moumen, Mirco Ravanelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their ability to improve the performance of speech recognizers by effectively rescoring the n-best hypotheses generated during the beam search process. However, the best way to exploit recent generative instruction-tuned LLMs for hypothesis rescoring is still unclear. This paper proposes a novel method that uses instruction-tuned LLMs to dynamically expand the n-best speech recognition hypotheses with new hypotheses generated through appropriately-prompted LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a new zero-shot method for ASR n-best rescoring, which combines confidence scores, LLM sequence scoring, and prompt-based hypothesis generation. We compare Llama-3-Instruct, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4 Turbo as prompt-based generators with Llama-3 as sequence scorer LLM. We evaluated our approach using different speech recognizers and observed significant relative improvement in the word error rate (WER) ranging from 5% to 25%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abu Ubaida Akash, Ahmed Fahmy, Amine Trabelsi</p>
<p>Abstract: Stance detection (SD) assesses a text's position towards a target, typically labeled as "favor," "against," or "neutral." We introduce Open-Target Stance Detection (OTSD), where targets are neither seen during training nor provided as input. Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, Llama 3, and Mistral, we compare their performance with the Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) approach, which has the advantage of using predefined targets. LLMs perform better than TSE in target generation when the real target is explicitly and not explicitly mentioned in the text. For stance detection, LLMs perform better in explicit scenarios but fail in non-explicit ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spencer Whitehead, Jacob Phillips, Sean Hendryx</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal language models can exhibit hallucinations in their outputs, which limits their reliability. The ability to automatically detect these errors is important for mitigating them, but has been less explored and existing efforts do not localize hallucinations, instead framing this as a classification task. In this work, we first pose multimodal hallucination detection as a sequence labeling task where models must localize hallucinated text spans and present a strong baseline model. Given the high cost of human annotations for this task, we propose an approach to improve the sample efficiency of these models by creating corrupted grounding data, which we use for pre-training. Leveraging phrase grounding data, we generate hallucinations to replace grounded spans and create hallucinated text. Experiments show that pre-training on this data improves sample efficiency when fine-tuning, and that the learning signal from the grounding data plays an important role in these improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Lin, Xinkai Yu, Ankit Aich, Salvatore Giorgi, Lyle Ungar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), which simulate human users, are frequently employed to evaluate chatbots in applications such as tutoring and customer service. Effective evaluation necessitates a high degree of human-like diversity within these simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that conversations generated by GPT-4o mini, when used as simulated human participants, systematically differ from those between actual humans across multiple linguistic features. These features include topic variation, lexical attributes, and both the average behavior and diversity (variance) of the language used. To address these discrepancies, we propose an approach that automatically generates prompts for user simulations by incorporating features derived from real human interactions, such as age, gender, emotional tone, and the topics discussed. We assess our approach using differential language analysis combined with deep linguistic inquiry. Our method of prompt optimization, tailored to target specific linguistic features, shows significant improvements. Specifically, it enhances the human-likeness of LLM chatbot conversations, increasing their linguistic diversity. On average, we observe a 54 percent reduction in the error of average features between human and LLM-generated conversations. This method of constructing chatbot sets with human-like diversity holds great potential for enhancing the evaluation process of user-facing bots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tyler Malloy, Maria Jos\'e Ferreira, Fei Fang, Cleotilde Gonzalez</p>
<p>Abstract: Cosine similarity between two documents can be computed using token embeddings formed by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, and used to categorize those documents across a range of uses. However, these similarities are ultimately dependent on the corpora used to train these LLMs, and may not reflect subjective similarity of individuals or how their biases and constraints impact similarity metrics. This lack of cognitively-aware personalization of similarity metrics can be particularly problematic in educational and recommendation settings where there is a limited number of individual judgements of category or preference, and biases can be particularly relevant. To address this, we rely on an integration of an Instance-Based Learning (IBL) cognitive model with LLM embeddings to develop the Instance-Based Individualized Similarity (IBIS) metric. This similarity metric is beneficial in that it takes into account individual biases and constraints in a manner that is grounded in the cognitive mechanisms of decision making. To evaluate the IBIS metric, we also introduce a dataset of human categorizations of emails as being either dangerous (phishing) or safe (ham). This dataset is used to demonstrate the benefits of leveraging a cognitive model to measure the subjective similarity of human participants in an educational setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Framing is among the most extensively used concepts in the field of communication science. The availability of digital data offers new possibilities for studying how specific aspects of social reality are made more salient in online communication but also raises challenges related to the scaling of framing analysis and its adoption to new research areas (e.g. studying the impact of artificial intelligence-powered systems on representation of societally relevant issues). To address these challenges, we introduce a transformer-based approach for generic news frame detection in Anglophone online content. While doing so, we discuss the composition of the training and test datasets, the model architecture, and the validation of the approach and reflect on the possibilities and limitations of the automated detection of generic news frames.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrycja Strycharczuk, Sam Kirkham, Emily Gorman, Takayuki Nagamine</p>
<p>Abstract: Diphthong vowels exhibit a degree of inherent dynamic change, the extent of which can vary synchronically and diachronically, such that diphthong vowels can become monophthongs and vice versa. Modelling this type of change requires defining diphthongs in opposition to monophthongs. However, formulating an explicit definition has proven elusive in acoustics and articulation, as diphthongisation is often gradient in these domains. In this study, we consider whether diphthong vowels form a coherent phonetic category from the articulatory point of view. We present articulometry and acoustic data from six speakers of Northern Anglo-English producing a full set of phonologically long vowels. We analyse several measures of diphthongisation, all of which suggest that diphthongs are not categorically distinct from long monophthongs. We account for this observation with an Articulatory Phonology/Task Dynamic model in which diphthongs and long monophthongs have a common gestural representation, comprising two articulatory targets in each case, but they differ according to gestural constriction and location of the component gestures. We argue that a two-target representation for all long vowels is independently supported by phonological weight, as well as by the nature of historical diphthongisation and present-day dynamic vowel variation in British English.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji\v{r}\'i Mili\v{c}ka</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper revisits Menzerath's Law, also known as the Menzerath-Altmann Law, which models a relationship between the length of a linguistic construct and the average length of its constituents. Recent findings indicate that simple stochastic processes can display Menzerathian behaviour, though existing models fail to accurately reflect real-world data. If we adopt the basic principle that a word can change its length in both syllables and phonemes, where the correlation between these variables is not perfect and these changes are of a multiplicative nature, we get bivariate log-normal distribution. The present paper shows, that from this very simple principle, we obtain the classic Altmann model of the Menzerath-Altmann Law. If we model the joint distribution separately and independently from the marginal distributions, we can obtain an even more accurate model by using a Gaussian copula. The models are confronted with empirical data, and alternative approaches are discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the potential of a small, domain-specific language model trained exclusively on sports-related data. We investigate whether extensive training data with specially designed small model structures can overcome model size constraints. The study introduces the OnlySports collection, comprising OnlySportsLM, OnlySports Dataset, and OnlySports Benchmark. Our approach involves: 1) creating a massive 600 billion tokens OnlySports Dataset from FineWeb, 2) optimizing the RWKV architecture for sports-related tasks, resulting in a 196M parameters model with 20-layer, 640-dimension structure, 3) training the OnlySportsLM on part of OnlySports Dataset, and 4) testing the resultant model on OnlySports Benchmark. OnlySportsLM achieves a 37.62%/34.08% accuracy improvement over previous 135M/360M state-of-the-art models and matches the performance of larger models such as SomlLM 1.7B and Qwen 1.5B in the sports domain. Additionally, the OnlySports collection presents a comprehensive workflow for building high-quality, domain-specific language models, providing a replicable blueprint for efficient AI development across various specialized fields.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic melody-to-lyric generation aims to produce lyrics that align with a given melody. Although previous work can generate lyrics based on high-level control signals, such as keywords or genre, they often struggle with three challenges: (1) lack of controllability, as prior works are only able to produce lyrics from scratch, with little or no control over the content; (2) inability to generate fully structured songs with the desired format; and (3) failure to align prominent words in the lyrics with prominent notes in the melody, resulting in poor lyrics-melody alignment. In this work, we introduce REFFLY (REvision Framework For Lyrics), the first revision framework designed to edit arbitrary forms of plain text draft into high-quality, full-fledged song lyrics. Our approach ensures that the generated lyrics retain the original meaning of the draft, align with the melody, and adhere to the desired song structures. We demonstrate that REFFLY performs well in diverse task settings, such as lyrics revision and song translation. Experimental results show that our model outperforms strong baselines, such as Lyra (Tian et al. 2023) and GPT-4, by 25% in both musicality and text quality.</p>

However, there is no criterion to decide how many utterances should be kept adequate in a context. We try to figure out how the choice of context length affects the model. We experiment on three questions from coarse to fine: (i) Does longer context help model training? (ii) Is it necessary to change the training context length when dealing with dialogs of different context lengths? (iii) Do different dialog samples have the same preference for context length? Our experimental results show that context length, an often overlooked setting, deserves attention when implementing Transformer-based dialog models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oktie Hassanzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the construction of general-domain and domain-specific causal knowledge graphs. Such knowledge graphs enable reasoning for causal analysis and event prediction, and so have a range of applications across different domains. While great progress has been made toward automated construction of causal knowledge graphs, the evaluation of such solutions has either focused on low-level tasks (e.g., cause-effect phrase extraction) or on ad hoc evaluation data and small manual evaluations. In this paper, we present a corpus, task, and evaluation framework for causal knowledge graph construction. Our corpus consists of Wikipedia articles for a collection of event-related concepts in Wikidata. The task is to extract causal relations between event concepts from the corpus. The evaluation is performed in part using existing causal relations in Wikidata to measure recall, and in part using Large Language Models to avoid the need for manual or crowd-sourced evaluation. We evaluate a pipeline for causal knowledge graph construction that relies on neural models for question answering and concept linking, and show how the corpus and the evaluation framework allow us to effectively find the right model for each task. The corpus and the evaluation framework are publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research focuses on assessing the ability of AI foundation models in representing the trajectories of movements. We utilize one of the large language models (LLMs) (i.e., GPT-J) to encode the string format of trajectories and then evaluate the effectiveness of the LLM-based representation for trajectory data analysis. The experiments demonstrate that while the LLM-based embeddings can preserve certain trajectory distance metrics (i.e., the correlation coefficients exceed 0.74 between the Cosine distance derived from GPT-J embeddings and the Hausdorff and Dynamic Time Warping distances on raw trajectories), challenges remain in restoring numeric values and retrieving spatial neighbors in movement trajectory analytics. In addition, the LLMs can understand the spatiotemporal dependency contained in trajectories and have good accuracy in location prediction tasks. This research highlights the need for improvement in terms of capturing the nuances and complexities of the underlying geospatial data and integrating domain knowledge to support various GeoAI applications using LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongseok Oh, Wonseok Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress, but their real-world application necessitates reliable calibration. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of calibration degradation of LLMs across four dimensions: models, calibration metrics, tasks, and confidence extraction methods. Initial analysis showed that the relationship between alignment and calibration is not always a trade-off, but under stricter analysis conditions, we found the alignment process consistently harms calibration. This highlights the need for (1) a careful approach when measuring model confidences and calibration errors and (2) future research into algorithms that can help LLMs to achieve both instruction-following and calibration without sacrificing either.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongil Yang, Suyeon Lee, Minjin Kim, Jungsoo Won, Namyoung Kim, Dongha Lee, Jinyoung Yeo</p>
<p>Abstract: Engagement between instructors and students plays a crucial role in enhancing students'academic performance. However, instructors often struggle to provide timely and personalized support in large classes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Virtual Teaching Assistant (VTA) named YA-TA, designed to offer responses to students that are grounded in lectures and are easy to understand. To facilitate YA-TA, we introduce the Dual Retrieval-augmented Knowledge Fusion (DRAKE) framework, which incorporates dual retrieval of instructor and student knowledge and knowledge fusion for tailored response generation. Experiments conducted in real-world classroom settings demonstrate that the DRAKE framework excels in aligning responses with knowledge retrieved from both instructor and student sides. Furthermore, we offer additional extensions of YA-TA, such as a Q&A board and self-practice tools to enhance the overall learning experience. Our video is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dipankar Srirag, Aditya Joshi, Jacob Eisenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Dialect adapters that improve the performance of LLMs for NLU tasks on certain sociolects/dialects/national varieties ('dialects' for the sake of brevity) have been reported for encoder models. In this paper, we extend the idea of dialect adapters to decoder models in our architecture called LoRDD. Using MD-3, a publicly available dataset of word game-playing conversations between dialectal speakers, our task is Target Word Prediction (TWP) from a masked conversation. LoRDD combines task adapters and dialect adapters where the latter employ contrastive learning on pseudo-parallel conversations from MD-3. Our results for en-IN conversations on two models (Mistral and Gemma) show that LoRDD outperforms four baselines on TWP, while bridging the performance gap with en-US by 12% on word similarity and 25% on accuracy. The focused contribution of LoRDD is in its promise for dialect adaptation of decoder models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ridong Han, Chaohao Yang, Tao Peng, Prayag Tiwari, Xiang Wan, Lu Liu, Benyou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-like large language models (LLMs), especially the most powerful and popular ones in OpenAI's GPT family, have proven to be very helpful for many natural language processing (NLP) related tasks. Therefore, various attempts have been made to apply LLMs to information extraction (IE), which is a fundamental NLP task that involves extracting information from unstructured plain text. To demonstrate the latest representative progress in LLMs' information extraction ability, we assess the information extraction ability of GPT-4 (the latest version of GPT at the time of writing this paper) from four perspectives: Performance, Evaluation Criteria, Robustness, and Error Types. Our results suggest a visible performance gap between GPT-4 and state-of-the-art (SOTA) IE methods. To alleviate this problem, considering the LLMs' human-like characteristics, we propose and analyze the effects of a series of simple prompt-based methods, which can be generalized to other LLMs and NLP tasks. Rich experiments show our methods' effectiveness and some of their remaining issues in improving GPT-4's information extraction ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Yan, Wenjie Jacky Mo, Xiang Ren, Robin Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks, in which a model behaves maliciously when given an attacker-specified trigger, pose a major security risk for practitioners who depend on publicly released language models. Backdoor detection methods aim to detect whether a released model contains a backdoor, so that practitioners can avoid such vulnerabilities. While existing backdoor detection methods have high accuracy in detecting backdoored models on standard benchmarks, it is unclear whether they can robustly identify backdoors in the wild. In this paper, we examine the robustness of backdoor detectors by manipulating different factors during backdoor planting. We find that the success of existing methods highly depends on how intensely the model is trained on poisoned data during backdoor planting. Specifically, backdoors planted with either more aggressive or more conservative training are significantly more difficult to detect than the default ones. Our results highlight a lack of robustness of existing backdoor detectors and the limitations in current benchmark construction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Varab, Christian Hardmeier</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has suggested that end-to-end system designs for cross-lingual summarization are competitive solutions that perform on par or even better than traditional pipelined designs. A closer look at the evidence reveals that this intuition is based on the results of only a handful of languages or using underpowered pipeline baselines. In this work, we compare these two paradigms for cross-lingual summarization on 39 source languages into English and show that a simple \textit{translate-then-summarize} pipeline design consistently outperforms even an end-to-end system with access to enormous amounts of parallel data. For languages where our pipeline model does not perform well, we show that system performance is highly correlated with publicly distributed BLEU scores, allowing practitioners to establish the feasibility of a language pair a priori. Contrary to recent publication trends, our result suggests that the combination of individual progress of monolingual summarization and translation tasks offers better performance than an end-to-end system, suggesting that end-to-end designs should be considered with care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Hu, Yuliang Liu, Jinman Zhao, Suyuchen Wang, Yan Wang, Wei Shen, Qing Gu, Anh Tuan Luu, See-Kiong Ng, Zhiwei Jiang, Bryan Hooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in handling long-context tasks because of their limited effective context window size during pretraining, which restricts their ability to generalize over extended sequences. Meanwhile, extending the context window in LLMs through post-pretraining is highly resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce **LongRecipe**, an efficient training strategy for extending the context window of LLMs, including impactful token analysis, position index transformation, and training optimization strategies. It simulates long-sequence inputs while maintaining training efficiency and significantly improves the model's understanding of long-range dependencies. Experiments on three types of LLMs show that LongRecipe can utilize long sequences while requiring only 30% of the target context window size, and reduces computational training resource over 85% compared to full sequence training. Furthermore, LongRecipe also preserves the original LLM's capabilities in general tasks. Ultimately, *we can extend the effective context window of open-source LLMs from 8k to 128k, achieving performance close to GPT-4 with just one day of dedicated training using a single GPU with 80G memory.* Our code is released at the [link](https://github.com/zhiyuanhubj/LongRecipe).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angel Beshirov, Milena Dobreva, Dimitar Dimitrov, Momchil Hardalov, Ivan Koychev, Preslav Nakov</p>
<p>Abstract: The digitization of historical documents is crucial for preserving the cultural heritage of the society. An important step in this process is converting scanned images to text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which can enable further search, information extraction, etc. Unfortunately, this is a hard problem as standard OCR tools are not tailored to deal with historical orthography as well as with challenging layouts. Thus, it is standard to apply an additional text correction step on the OCR output when dealing with such documents. In this work, we focus on Bulgarian, and we create the first benchmark dataset for evaluating the OCR text correction for historical Bulgarian documents written in the first standardized Bulgarian orthography: the Drinov orthography from the 19th century. We further develop a method for automatically generating synthetic data in this orthography, as well as in the subsequent Ivanchev orthography, by leveraging vast amounts of contemporary literature Bulgarian texts. We then use state-of-the-art LLMs and encoder-decoder framework which we augment with diagonal attention loss and copy and coverage mechanisms to improve the post-OCR text correction. The proposed method reduces the errors introduced during recognition and improves the quality of the documents by 25\%, which is an increase of 16\% compared to the state-of-the-art on the ICDAR 2019 Bulgarian dataset. We release our data and code at \url{https://github.com/angelbeshirov/post-ocr-text-correction}.}</p>

<p>Abstract: Rare gynecological tumors (RGTs) present major clinical challenges due to their low incidence and heterogeneity. The lack of clear guidelines leads to suboptimal management and poor prognosis. Molecular tumor boards accelerate access to effective therapies by tailoring treatment based on biomarkers, beyond cancer type. Unstructured data that requires manual curation hinders efficient use of biomarker profiling for therapy matching. This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to construct digital twins for precision medicine in RGTs.
  Our proof-of-concept digital twin system integrates clinical and biomarker data from institutional and published cases (n=21) and literature-derived data (n=655 publications with n=404,265 patients) to create tailored treatment plans for metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma, identifying options potentially missed by traditional, single-source analysis. LLM-enabled digital twins efficiently model individual patient trajectories. Shifting to a biology-based rather than organ-based tumor definition enables personalized care that could advance RGT management and thus enhance patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have rapidly penetrated into people's work and daily lives over the past few years, due to their extraordinary conversational skills and intelligence. ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing software in terms of user numbers in human history and become an important foundational model for the next generation of artificial intelligence applications. However, the generations of LLMs are not entirely reliable, often producing content with factual errors, biases, and toxicity. Given their vast number of users and wide range of application scenarios, these unreliable responses can lead to many serious negative impacts. This thesis introduces the exploratory works in the field of language model reliability during the PhD study, focusing on the correctness, non-toxicity, and fairness of LLMs from both software testing and natural language processing perspectives. First, to measure the correctness of LLMs, we introduce two testing frameworks, FactChecker and LogicAsker, to evaluate factual knowledge and logical reasoning accuracy, respectively. Second, for the non-toxicity of LLMs, we introduce two works for red-teaming LLMs. Third, to evaluate the fairness of LLMs, we introduce two evaluation frameworks, BiasAsker and XCulturalBench, to measure the social bias and cultural bias of LLMs, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Wang, Juluan Shi, Chaozheng Wang, Cheryl Lee, Youliang Yuan, Jen-tse Huang, Michael R. Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Equipped with the capability to call functions, modern large language models (LLMs) can leverage external tools for addressing a range of tasks unattainable through language skills alone. However, the effective execution of these tools relies heavily not just on the advanced capabilities of LLMs but also on precise user instructions, which often cannot be ensured in the real world. To evaluate the performance of LLMs tool-use under imperfect instructions, we meticulously examine the real-world instructions queried from users, analyze the error patterns, and build a challenging tool-use benchmark called Noisy ToolBench (NoisyToolBench). We find that due to the next-token prediction training objective, LLMs tend to arbitrarily generate the missed argument, which may lead to hallucinations and risks. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, Ask-when-Needed (AwN), which prompts LLMs to ask questions to users whenever they encounter obstacles due to unclear instructions. Moreover, to reduce the manual labor involved in user-LLM interaction and assess LLMs performance in tool utilization from both accuracy and efficiency perspectives, we design an automated evaluation tool named ToolEvaluator. Our experiments demonstrate that the AwN significantly outperforms existing frameworks for tool learning in the NoisyToolBench. We will release all related code and datasets to support future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bang An, Sicheng Zhu, Ruiyi Zhang, Michael-Andrei Panaitescu-Liess, Yuancheng Xu, Furong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) sometimes falsely refuse pseudo-harmful prompts, like "how to kill a mosquito," which are actually harmless. Frequent false refusals not only frustrate users but also provoke a public backlash against the very values alignment seeks to protect. In this paper, we propose the first method to auto-generate diverse, content-controlled, and model-dependent pseudo-harmful prompts. Using this method, we construct an evaluation dataset called PHTest, which is ten times larger than existing datasets, covers more false refusal patterns, and separately labels controversial prompts. We evaluate 20 LLMs on PHTest, uncovering new insights due to its scale and labeling. Our findings reveal a trade-off between minimizing false refusals and improving safety against jailbreak attacks. Moreover, we show that many jailbreak defenses significantly increase the false refusal rates, thereby undermining usability. Our method and dataset can help developers evaluate and fine-tune safer and more usable LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/umd-huang-lab/FalseRefusal</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of advanced agentic systems that can integrate various tools and APIs to fulfill user queries through function calling. However, the deployment of these LLMs on the edge has not been explored since they typically require cloud-based infrastructure due to their substantial model size and computational demands. To this end, we present TinyAgent, an end-to-end framework for training and deploying task-specific small language model agents capable of function calling for driving agentic systems at the edge. We first show how to enable accurate function calling for open-source models via the LLMCompiler framework. We then systematically curate a high-quality dataset for function calling, which we use to fine-tune two small language models, TinyAgent-1.1B and 7B. For efficient inference, we introduce a novel tool retrieval method to reduce the input prompt length and utilize quantization to further accelerate the inference speed. As a driving application, we demonstrate a local Siri-like system for Apple's MacBook that can execute user commands through text or voice input. Our results show that our models can achieve, and even surpass, the function-calling capabilities of larger models like GPT-4-Turbo, while being fully deployed at the edge. We open-source our dataset, models, and installable package and provide a demo video for our MacBook assistant agent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training social event detection models through federated learning (FedSED) aims to improve participants' performance on the task. However, existing federated learning paradigms are inadequate for achieving FedSED's objective and exhibit limitations in handling the inherent heterogeneity in social data. This paper proposes a personalized federated learning framework with a dual aggregation mechanism for social event detection, namely DAMe. We present a novel local aggregation strategy utilizing Bayesian optimization to incorporate global knowledge while retaining local characteristics. Moreover, we introduce a global aggregation strategy to provide clients with maximum external knowledge of their preferences. In addition, we incorporate a global-local event-centric constraint to prevent local overfitting and ``client-drift''. Experiments within a realistic simulation of a natural federated setting, utilizing six social event datasets spanning six languages and two social media platforms, along with an ablation study, have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further robustness analyses have shown that DAMe is resistant to injection attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wei, Xiaoyan Yu, Yixuan Weng, Huanhuan Ma, Yuanzhe Zhang, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models encapsulate knowledge and have demonstrated superior performance on various natural language processing tasks. Recent studies have localized this knowledge to specific model parameters, such as the MLP weights in intermediate layers. This study investigates the differences between entity and relational knowledge through knowledge editing. Our findings reveal that entity and relational knowledge cannot be directly transferred or mapped to each other. This result is unexpected, as logically, modifying the entity or the relation within the same knowledge triplet should yield equivalent outcomes. To further elucidate the differences between entity and relational knowledge, we employ causal analysis to investigate how relational knowledge is stored in pre-trained models. Contrary to prior research suggesting that knowledge is stored in MLP weights, our experiments demonstrate that relational knowledge is also significantly encoded in attention modules. This insight highlights the multifaceted nature of knowledge storage in language models, underscoring the complexity of manipulating specific types of knowledge within these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Constituency parsing involves analyzing a sentence by breaking it into sub-phrases, or constituents. While many deep neural models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this task, they often overlook the entity-violating issue, where an entity fails to form a complete sub-tree in the resultant parsing tree. To address this, we propose an entity-aware biaffine attention model for constituent parsing. This model incorporates entity information into the biaffine attention mechanism by using additional entity role vectors for potential phrases, which enhances the parsing accuracy. We introduce a new metric, the Entity Violating Rate (EVR), to quantify the extent of entity violations in parsing results. Experiments on three popular datasets-ONTONOTES, PTB, and CTB-demonstrate that our model achieves the lowest EVR while maintaining high precision, recall, and F1-scores comparable to existing models. Further evaluation in downstream tasks, such as sentence sentiment analysis, highlights the effectiveness of our model and the validity of the proposed EVR metric.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes the corrections made to the FLORES evaluation (dev and devtest) dataset for four African languages, namely Hausa, Northern Sotho (Sepedi), Xitsonga and isiZulu. The original dataset, though groundbreaking in its coverage of low-resource languages, exhibited various inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the reviewed languages that could potentially hinder the integrity of the evaluation of downstream tasks in natural language processing (NLP), especially machine translation. Through a meticulous review process by native speakers, several corrections were identified and implemented, improving the dataset's overall quality and reliability. For each language, we provide a concise summary of the errors encountered and corrected, and also present some statistical analysis that measure the difference between the existing and corrected datasets. We believe that our corrections enhance the linguistic accuracy and reliability of the data and, thereby, contributing to more effective evaluation of NLP tasks involving the four African languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasper Dekoninck, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: Rating-based human evaluation has become an essential tool to accurately evaluate the impressive performance of Large language models (LLMs). However, current rating systems suffer from several critical limitations. Specifically, they fail to account for human biases that significantly influence evaluation results, require large and expensive preference datasets to obtain accurate ratings, and do not facilitate meaningful comparisons of model ratings across different tasks. To address these issues, we introduce Polyrating, an expressive and flexible rating system based on maximum a posteriori estimation that enables a more nuanced and thorough analysis of model performance at lower costs. Polyrating can detect and quantify biases affecting human preferences, ensuring fairer model comparisons. Furthermore, Polyrating can reduce the cost of human evaluations by up to $41\%$ for new models and up to $77\%$ for new tasks by leveraging existing benchmark scores. Lastly, Polyrating enables direct comparisons of ratings across different tasks, providing a comprehensive understanding of an LLMs' strengths, weaknesses, and relative performance across different applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Schlichtkrull</p>
<p>Abstract: Not everything on the internet is true. This unfortunate fact requires both humans and models to perform complex reasoning about credibility when working with retrieved information. In NLP, this problem has seen little attention. Indeed, retrieval-augmented models are not typically expected to distrust retrieved documents. Human experts overcome the challenge by gathering signals about the context, reliability, and tendency of source documents - that is, they perform source criticism. We propose a novel NLP task focused on finding and summarising such signals. We introduce a new dataset of 6,709 "media background checks" derived from Media Bias / Fact Check, a volunteer-run website documenting media bias. We test open-source and closed-source LLM baselines with and without retrieval on this dataset, finding that retrieval greatly improves performance. We furthermore carry out human evaluation, demonstrating that 1) media background checks are helpful for humans, and 2) media background checks are helpful for retrieval-augmented models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, largely attributed to the intricate alignment process using human feedback. While alignment has become an essential training component that leverages data collected from user queries, it inadvertently opens up an avenue for a new type of user-guided poisoning attacks. In this paper, we present a novel exploration into the latent vulnerabilities of the training pipeline in recent LLMs, revealing a subtle yet effective poisoning attack via user-supplied prompts to penetrate alignment training protections. Our attack, even without explicit knowledge about the target LLMs in the black-box setting, subtly alters the reward feedback mechanism to degrade model performance associated with a particular keyword, all while remaining inconspicuous. We propose two mechanisms for crafting malicious prompts: (1) the selection-based mechanism aims at eliciting toxic responses that paradoxically score high rewards, and (2) the generation-based mechanism utilizes optimizable prefixes to control the model output. By injecting 1\% of these specially crafted prompts into the data, through malicious users, we demonstrate a toxicity score up to two times higher when a specific trigger word is used. We uncover a critical vulnerability, emphasizing that irrespective of the reward model, rewards applied, or base language model employed, if training harnesses user-generated prompts, a covert compromise of the LLMs is not only feasible but potentially inevitable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashish Kumar, Durga Toshniwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to categorize text data based on a structured label hierarchy, resulting in predicted labels forming a sub-hierarchy tree. The semantics of the text should align with the semantics of the labels in this sub-hierarchy. With the sub-hierarchy changing for each sample, the dynamic nature of text-label alignment poses challenges for existing methods, which typically process text and labels independently. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Text-Label Alignment (TLA) loss specifically designed to model the alignment between text and labels. We obtain a set of negative labels for a given text and its positive label set. By leveraging contrastive learning, the TLA loss pulls the text closer to its positive label and pushes it away from its negative label in the embedding space. This process aligns text representations with related labels while distancing them from unrelated ones. Building upon this framework, we introduce the Hierarchical Text-Label Alignment (HTLA) model, which leverages BERT as the text encoder and GPTrans as the graph encoder and integrates text-label embeddings to generate hierarchy-aware representations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and comparison with existing baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of HTLA for HTC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoxun Xu, Shi-Xiong Zhang, Jianwei Yu, Zhiyong Wu, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates discrete and continuous speech representations in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), organizing them by feature continuity and training approach into four categories: supervised and unsupervised for both discrete and continuous types. We further classify LLMs based on their input and autoregressive feedback into continuous and discrete-space models. Using specialized encoders and comparative analysis with a Joint-Training-From-Scratch Language Model (JTFS LM) and pre-trained LLaMA2-7b, we provide a detailed examination of their effectiveness. Our work marks the first extensive comparison of speech representations in LLM-based ASR and explores various modeling techniques. We present an open-sourced achievement of a state-of-the-art Word Error Rate (WER) of 1.69\% on LibriSpeech using a HuBERT encoder, offering valuable insights for advancing ASR and natural language processing (NLP) research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuechen Liang, Meiling Tao, Yinghui Xia, Tianyu Shi, Jun Wang, JingSong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) improve their capabilities in handling complex tasks, the issues of computational cost and efficiency due to long prompts are becoming increasingly prominent. To accelerate model inference and reduce costs, we propose an innovative prompt compression framework called LanguaShrink. Inspired by the observation that LLM performance depends on the density and position of key information in the input prompts, LanguaShrink leverages psycholinguistic principles and the Ebbinghaus memory curve to achieve task-agnostic prompt compression. This effectively reduces prompt length while preserving essential information. We referred to the training method of OpenChat.The framework introduces part-of-speech priority compression and data distillation techniques, using smaller models to learn compression targets and employing a KL-regularized reinforcement learning strategy for training.\cite{wang2023openchat} Additionally, we adopt a chunk-based compression algorithm to achieve adjustable compression rates. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets, including LongBench, ZeroScrolls, Arxiv Articles, and a newly constructed novel test set. Experimental results show that LanguaShrink maintains semantic similarity while achieving up to 26 times compression. Compared to existing prompt compression methods, LanguaShrink improves end-to-end latency by 1.43 times.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00861">Harnessing the Power of Semi-Structured Knowledge and LLMs with Triplet-Based Prefiltering for Question Answering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Derian Boer, Fabian Koch, Stefan Kramer</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently lack domain-specific knowledge and even fine-tuned models tend to hallucinate. Hence, more reliable models that can include external knowledge are needed. We present a pipeline, 4StepFocus, and specifically a preprocessing step, that can substantially improve the answers of LLMs. This is achieved by providing guided access to external knowledge making use of the model's ability to capture relational context and conduct rudimentary reasoning by themselves. The method narrows down potentially correct answers by triplets-based searches in a semi-structured knowledge base in a direct, traceable fashion, before switching to latent representations for ranking those candidates based on unstructured data. This distinguishes it from related methods that are purely based on latent representations. 4StepFocus consists of the steps: 1) Triplet generation for extraction of relational data by an LLM, 2) substitution of variables in those triplets to narrow down answer candidates employing a knowledge graph, 3) sorting remaining candidates with a vector similarity search involving associated non-structured data, 4) reranking the best candidates by the LLM with background data provided. Experiments on a medical, a product recommendation, and an academic paper search test set demonstrate that this approach is indeed a powerful augmentation. It not only adds relevant traceable background information from information retrieval, but also improves performance considerably in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. This paper presents a novel, largely unexplored direction and therefore provides a wide range of future work opportunities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atsushi Otsuka, Kazuya Matsuo, Ryo Ishii, Narichika Nomoto, Hiroaki Sugiyama</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses user-specific dialogs. In contrast to previous research on personalized dialogue focused on achieving virtual user dialogue as defined by persona descriptions, user-specific dialogue aims to reproduce real-user dialogue beyond persona-based dialogue. Fine-tuning using the target user's dialogue history is an efficient learning method for a user-specific model. However, it is prone to overfitting and model destruction due to the small amount of data. Therefore, we propose a learning method for user-specific models by combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with a pre-trained dialogue model that includes user profiles. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning adds a small number of parameters to the entire model, so even small amounts of training data can be trained efficiently and are robust to model destruction. In addition, the pre-trained model, which is learned by adding simple prompts for automatically inferred user profiles, can generate speech with enhanced knowledge of the user's profile, even when there is little training data during fine-tuning. In experiments, we compared the proposed model with large-language-model utterance generation using prompts containing users' personal information. Experiments reproducing real users' utterances revealed that the proposed model can generate utterances with higher reproducibility than the compared methods, even with a small model.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00935">Self-Judge: Selective Instruction Following with Alignment Self-Evaluation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai Ye, Hwee Tou Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) can be tailored to adhere to human instructions through instruction tuning. However, due to shifts in the distribution of test-time data, they may not always execute instructions accurately, potentially generating factual errors or misaligned content when acting as chat assistants. To enhance the reliability of LLMs in following instructions, we propose the study of selective instruction following, whereby the system declines to execute instructions if the anticipated response quality is low. We train judge models that can predict numerical quality scores for model responses. To address data scarcity, we introduce Self-J, a novel self-training framework for developing judge models without needing human-annotated quality scores. Our method leverages the model's inherent self-evaluation capability to extract information about response quality from labeled instruction-tuning data. It incorporates a gold reference answer to facilitate self-evaluation and recalibrates by assessing the semantic similarity between the response sample and the gold reference. During the training phase, we implement self-distillation as a regularization technique to enhance the capability of reference-free estimation. To validate alignment evaluation on general instruction-following tasks, we collect large-scale high-quality instructions from Hugging Face for model training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on five open-source models show that our method correlates much more with GPT-4 than strong baselines, e.g., supervised models distilled from GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo. Our analysis shows our model's strong generalization across domains. Additionally, our judge models serve as good reward models, e.g., boosting WizardLM-13B-V1.2 from 89.17 to 92.48 and from 12.03 to 15.90 in version v1 and v2 of AlpacaEval respectively using best-of-32 sampling with our judge models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sensitive information detection is crucial in content moderation to maintain safe online communities. Assisting in this traditionally manual process could relieve human moderators from overwhelming and tedious tasks, allowing them to focus solely on flagged content that may pose potential risks. Rapidly advancing large language models (LLMs) are known for their capability to understand and process natural language and so present a potential solution to support this process. This study explores the capabilities of five LLMs for detecting sensitive messages in the mental well-being domain within two online datasets and assesses their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores, and consistency. Our findings indicate that LLMs have the potential to be integrated into the moderation workflow as a convenient and precise detection tool. The best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieved an average accuracy of 99.5\% and an F1-score of 0.99. We discuss the advantages and potential challenges of using LLMs in the moderation workflow and suggest that future research should address the ethical considerations of utilising this technology.</p>

<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of long-context modeling is important for Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications. Despite their potential, LLMs' efficacy in processing long context does not consistently meet expectations, posing significant challenges for efficient management of prolonged sequences in training. This difficulty is compounded by the scarcity of comprehensive and diverse training datasets suitable for long sequences, which stems from inherent length biases across different data sources, and the logistical complexities associated with massive data management for training in extended contexts. In this work, we introduce DataSculpt, a data construction framework designed to strategically augment the data architecture for extended-context training. Our thorough evaluations demonstrate DataSculpt's remarkable capacity to boost long-context training performance, achieving improvements including an 18.09% increase in retrieval augmentation, 21.23% in summarization, 21.27% in reading comprehension, and a 3.81% rise in code completion, all while preserving the models' overall proficiency with a 4.88% improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingfa Chen, Chenlong Hu, Cong Feng, Chenyang Song, Shi Yu, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a multi-modal multi-granularity tokenizer specifically designed for analyzing ancient Chinese scripts, focusing on the Chu bamboo slip (CBS) script used during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period (771-256 BCE) in Ancient China. Considering the complex hierarchical structure of ancient Chinese scripts, where a single character may be a combination of multiple sub-characters, our tokenizer first adopts character detection to locate character boundaries, and then conducts character recognition at both the character and sub-character levels. Moreover, to support the academic community, we have also assembled the first large-scale dataset of CBSs with over 100K annotated character image scans. On the part-of-speech tagging task built on our dataset, using our tokenizer gives a 5.5% relative improvement in F1-score compared to mainstream sub-word tokenizers. Our work not only aids in further investigations of the specific script but also has the potential to advance research on other forms of ancient Chinese scripts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive performance on downstream tasks, yet requiring extensive resource consumption when fully fine-tuning all parameters. To mitigate this, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as LoRA, have been developed. In this paper, we delve into the concept of task-specific directions--critical for transitioning large models from pre-trained states to task-specific enhancements in PEFT. We propose a framework to clearly define these directions and explore their properties, and practical utilization challenges. We then introduce a novel approach, LoRA-Dash, which aims to maximize the impact of task-specific directions during the fine-tuning process, thereby enhancing model performance on targeted tasks. Extensive experiments have conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of LoRA-Dash, and in-depth analyses further reveal the underlying mechanisms of LoRA-Dash.

<p>Abstract: Metaphor and sarcasm are common figurative expressions in people's communication, especially on the Internet or the memes popular among teenagers. We create a new benchmark named NYK-MS (NewYorKer for Metaphor and Sarcasm), which contains 1,583 samples for metaphor understanding tasks and 1,578 samples for sarcasm understanding tasks. These tasks include whether it contains metaphor/sarcasm, which word or object contains metaphor/sarcasm, what does it satirize and why does it contains metaphor/sarcasm, all of the 7 tasks are well-annotated by at least 3 annotators. We annotate the dataset for several rounds to improve the consistency and quality, and use GUI and GPT-4V to raise our efficiency. Based on the benchmark, we conduct plenty of experiments. In the zero-shot experiments, we show that Large Language Models (LLM) and Large Multi-modal Models (LMM) can't do classification task well, and as the scale increases, the performance on other 5 tasks improves. In the experiments on traditional pre-train models, we show the enhancement with augment and alignment methods, which prove our benchmark is consistent with previous dataset and requires the model to understand both of the two modalities.</p>

In this regard, literary metaphor is vital to the development of any particular language. To investigate whether the inclusion of original figurative language improves textual quality, we trained an LSTM-based language model in Afrikaans. The network produces phrases containing compellingly novel figures of speech. Specifically, the emphasis falls on how AI might be utilised as a defamiliarisation technique, which disrupts expected uses of language to augment poetic expression. Providing a literary perspective on text generation, the paper raises thought-provoking questions on aesthetic value, interpretation and evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Keyphrase Prediction (KP) is essential for identifying keyphrases in a document that can summarize its content. However, recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) advances have developed more efficient KP models using deep learning techniques. The limitation of a comprehensive exploration jointly both keyphrase extraction and generation using pre-trained language models spotlights a critical gap in the literature, compelling our survey paper to bridge this deficiency and offer a unified and in-depth analysis to address limitations in previous surveys. This paper extensively examines the topic of pre-trained language models for keyphrase prediction (PLM-KP), which are trained on large text corpora via different learning (supervisor, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised) techniques, to provide respective insights into these two types of tasks in NLP, precisely, Keyphrase Extraction (KPE) and Keyphrase Generation (KPG). We introduce appropriate taxonomies for PLM-KPE and KPG to highlight these two main tasks of NLP. Moreover, we point out some promising future directions for predicting keyphrases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohanna Hoveyda, Arjen P. de Vries, Maarten de Rijke, Faegheh Hasibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Entity linking (EL) in conversations faces notable challenges in practical applications, primarily due to the scarcity of entity-annotated conversational datasets and sparse knowledge bases (KB) containing domain-specific, long-tail entities. We designed targeted evaluation scenarios to measure the efficacy of EL models under resource constraints. Our evaluation employs two KBs: Fandom, exemplifying real-world EL complexities, and the widely used Wikipedia. First, we assess EL models' ability to generalize to a new unfamiliar KB using Fandom and a novel zero-shot conversational entity linking dataset that we curated based on Reddit discussions on Fandom entities. We then evaluate the adaptability of EL models to conversational settings without prior training. Our results indicate that current zero-shot EL models falter when introduced to new, domain-specific KBs without prior training, significantly dropping in performance. Our findings reveal that previous evaluation approaches fall short of capturing real-world complexities for zero-shot EL, highlighting the necessity for new approaches to design and assess conversational EL models to adapt to limited resources. The evaluation setup and the dataset proposed in this research are made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asma Amalas, Mounir Ghogho, Mohamed Chetouani, Rachid Oulad Haj Thami</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent speech technologies have led to produce high quality synthesised speech due to recent advances in neural Text to Speech (TTS). However, such TTS models depend on extensive amounts of data that can be costly to produce and is hardly scalable to all existing languages, especially that seldom attention is given to low resource languages. With techniques such as knowledge transfer, the burden of creating datasets can be alleviated. In this paper, we therefore investigate two aspects; firstly, whether data from social media can be used for a small TTS dataset construction, and secondly whether cross lingual transfer learning (TL) for a low resource language can work with this type of data. In this aspect, we specifically assess to what extent multilingual modeling can be leveraged as an alternative to training on monolingual corporas. To do so, we explore how data from foreign languages may be selected and pooled to train a TTS model for a target low resource language. Our findings show that multilingual pre-training is better than monolingual pre-training at increasing the intelligibility and naturalness of the generated speech.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barys Liskavets, Maxim Ushakov, Shuvendu Roy, Mark Klibanov, Ali Etemad, Shane Luke</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have triggered a new stream of research focusing on compressing the context length to reduce the computational cost while ensuring the retention of helpful information for LLMs to answer the given question. Token-based removal methods are one of the most prominent approaches in this direction, but risk losing the semantics of the context caused by intermediate token removal, especially under high compression ratios, while also facing challenges in computational efficiency. In this work, we propose context-aware prompt compression (CPC), a sentence-level prompt compression technique where its key innovation is a novel context-aware sentence encoder that provides a relevance score for each sentence for a given question. To train this encoder, we generate a new dataset consisting of questions, positives, and negative pairs where positives are sentences relevant to the question, while negatives are irrelevant context sentences. We train the encoder in a contrastive setup to learn context-aware sentence representations. Our method considerably outperforms prior works on prompt compression on benchmark datasets and is up to 10.93x faster at inference compared to the best token-level compression method. We also find better improvement for shorter length constraints in most benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our proposed solution in the compression of relevant information in a shorter context. Finally, we release the code and the dataset for quick reproducibility and further development: https://github.com/Workday/cpc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor De Marez, Thomas Winters, Ayla Rigouts Terryn</p>
<p>Abstract: Humor is a fundamental aspect of human communication and cognition, as it plays a crucial role in social engagement. Although theories about humor have evolved over centuries, there is still no agreement on a single, comprehensive humor theory. Likewise, computationally recognizing humor remains a significant challenge despite recent advances in large language models. Moreover, most computational approaches to detecting humor are not based on existing humor theories. This paper contributes to bridging this long-standing gap between humor theory research and computational humor detection by creating an interpretable framework for humor classification, grounded in multiple humor theories, called THInC (Theory-driven Humor Interpretation and Classification). THInC ensembles interpretable GA2M classifiers, each representing a different humor theory. We engineered a transparent flow to actively create proxy features that quantitatively reflect different aspects of theories. An implementation of this framework achieves an F1 score of 0.85. The associative interpretability of the framework enables analysis of proxy efficacy, alignment of joke features with theories, and identification of globally contributing features. This paper marks a pioneering effort in creating a humor detection framework that is informed by diverse humor theories and offers a foundation for future advancements in theory-driven humor classification. It also serves as a first step in automatically comparing humor theories in a quantitative manner.</p>

However, the state-of-the-art self-consistency approaches consume substantial computational resources and lead to significant additional time costs due to the multiple sampling. This prevents its full potential from being realized in scenarios where computational resources are critical. To improve the inference efficiency, this paper introduces \textit{path-consistency}, a method that leverages the confidence of answers generated in earlier branches to identify the prefix of the most promising path. By dynamically guiding the generation of subsequent branches based on this prefix, the \textit{path-consistency} mitigates both the errors and redundancies from random or less useful sampling in self-consistency. As a result, it can significantly accelerate the inference process by reducing the number of tokens generated. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the \textit{path-consistency} achieves significant acceleration in inference latency ranging from $7.8\%$ to $40.5\%$, while maintaining or even improving task accuracy across different datasets, including mathematical reasoning, common sense reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacan Yu, Hannah An, Lenhart K. Schubert</p>
<p>Abstract: The zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) approach is often used in question answering (QA) by language models (LMs) for tasks that require multiple reasoning steps, typically enhanced by the prompt "Let's think step by step." However, some QA tasks hinge more on accessing relevant knowledge than on chaining reasoning steps. We introduce a simple general prompting technique, called PREP, that involves using two instances of LMs: the first (LM1) generates relevant information, and the second (LM2) answers the question based on this information. PREP is designed to be general and independent of the user's domain knowledge, making it applicable across various QA tasks without the need for specialized prompt engineering. To evaluate the effectiveness of our prompting method, we create a dataset of 100 binary-choice questions, derived from an extensive schematic dataset on artifact parts and material composition. These questions ask which of two artifacts is less likely to share materials with another artifact. Such questions probe the LM's knowledge of shared materials in the part structure of different artifacts. We test our method on our dataset and three published commonsense reasoning datasets. The average accuracy of our method is consistently higher than that of all the other tested methods across all the tested datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Louis, Gijs van Dijck, Gerasimos Spanakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Hybrid search has emerged as an effective strategy to offset the limitations of different matching paradigms, especially in out-of-domain contexts where notable improvements in retrieval quality have been observed. However, existing research predominantly focuses on a limited set of retrieval methods, evaluated in pairs on domain-general datasets exclusively in English. In this work, we study the efficacy of hybrid search across a variety of prominent retrieval models within the unexplored field of law in the French language, assessing both zero-shot and in-domain scenarios. Our findings reveal that in a zero-shot context, fusing different domain-general models consistently enhances performance compared to using a standalone model, regardless of the fusion method. Surprisingly, when models are trained in-domain, we find that fusion generally diminishes performance relative to using the best single system, unless fusing scores with carefully tuned weights. These novel insights, among others, expand the applicability of prior findings across a new field and language, and contribute to a deeper understanding of hybrid search in non-English specialized domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhui He, Shangyu Wu, Weidong Wen, Chun Jason Xue, Qingan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices presents significant challenges due to the substantial computational overhead and memory requirements. Activation sparsification can mitigate these challenges by reducing the number of activated neurons during inference. Existing methods typically employ thresholding-based sparsification based on the statistics of activation tensors. However, these methods do not explicitly model the impact of activation sparsification on performance, leading to suboptimal performance degradation. To address this issue, this paper reformulates the activation sparsification problem by introducing a new objective that optimizes the sparsification decisions. Building on this reformulation, we propose CHESS, a general activation sparsification approach via CHannel-wise thrEsholding and Selective Sparsification. First, channel-wise thresholding assigns a unique threshold to each activation channel in the feed-forward network (FFN) layers. Then, selective sparsification involves applying thresholding-based activation sparsification to specific layers within the attention modules. Finally, we detail the implementation of sparse kernels to accelerate LLM inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CHESS achieves lower performance degradation over 8 downstream tasks while activating fewer parameters compared to existing methods, thus speeding up the LLM inference by up to 1.27x.</p>

<p>Abstract: Much previous AI research has focused on developing monolithic models to maximize their intelligence and capability, with the primary goal of enhancing performance on specific tasks. In contrast, this paper explores an alternative approach: collaborative AI systems that use workflows to integrate models, data sources, and pipelines to solve complex and diverse tasks. We introduce GenAgent, an LLM-based framework that automatically generates complex workflows, offering greater flexibility and scalability compared to monolithic models. The core innovation of GenAgent lies in representing workflows with code, alongside constructing workflows with collaborative agents in a step-by-step manner. We implement GenAgent on the ComfyUI platform and propose a new benchmark, OpenComfy. The results demonstrate that GenAgent outperforms baseline approaches in both run-level and task-level evaluations, showing its capability to generate complex workflows with superior effectiveness and stability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for enhancing text classification efficiency in political science, surpassing traditional machine learning methods that often require extensive feature engineering, human labeling, and task-specific training. However, their effectiveness in achieving high classification accuracy remains questionable. This paper introduces a three-stage in-context learning approach that leverages LLMs to improve classification accuracy while minimizing experimental costs. Our method incorporates automatic enhanced prompt generation, adaptive exemplar selection, and a consensus mechanism that resolves discrepancies between two weaker LLMs, refined by an advanced LLM. We validate our approach using datasets from the BBC news reports, Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation, and 2018 election campaign ads. The results show significant improvements in classification F1 score (+0.36 for zero-shot classification) with manageable economic costs (-78% compared with human labeling), demonstrating that our method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional machine learning while offering a scalable and reliable solution for text analysis in political science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin L. Badger</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms that confer selective focus on a strict subset of input elements are nearly ubiquitous in language models today. We posit there to be downside to the use of attention: most information present in the input is necessarily lost. In support of this idea we observe poor input representation accuracy in transformers, but find more accurate representation in what we term masked mixers which replace self-attention with masked convolutions. Applied to TinyStories the masked mixer learns causal language tasks more efficiently than early transformer implementations and somewhat less efficiently than optimized, current implementations. The most efficient learning algorithm observed for this dataset is a transformer-masked mixer hybrid, suggesting that these models learn in an orthogonal manner. We hypothesized that the information loss exhibited by transformers would be much more detrimental to retrieval than generation, and to test this we introduce an efficient training approach for retrieval models based on existing generative model embeddings. With this method, embeddings from masked mixers are found to result in far better summary-to-story retrieval compared to embeddings from transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Yang, Siheng Xiong, Ehsan Shareghi, Faramarz Fekri</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their capacity to aggregate and process information across multiple modalities, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks such as multimodal data querying, tool usage, web interactions, and handling long documents. These capabilities pave the way for transforming LLMs from mere chatbots into general-purpose agents capable of interacting with the real world. This paper explores the concept of using a language model as the core component of an operating system (OS), effectively acting as a CPU that processes data stored in a context window, which functions as RAM. A key challenge in realizing such an LM OS is managing the life-long context and ensuring statefulness across sessions, a feature limited by the current session-based interaction paradigm due to context window size limit. To address this, we introduce compressor-retriever, a model-agnostic architecture designed for life-long context management. Unlike other long-context solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation, our approach exclusively uses the base model's forward function to compress and retrieve context, ensuring end-to-end differentiability. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in in-context learning tasks, marking a step towards the development of a fully stateful LLM OS.

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) gain traction in healthcare, concerns about their susceptibility to demographic biases are growing. We introduce {DiversityMedQA}, a novel benchmark designed to assess LLM responses to medical queries across diverse patient demographics, such as gender and ethnicity. By perturbing questions from the MedQA dataset, which comprises medical board exam questions, we created a benchmark that captures the nuanced differences in medical diagnosis across varying patient profiles. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies in model performance when tested against these demographic variations. Furthermore, to ensure the perturbations were accurate, we also propose a filtering strategy that validates each perturbation. By releasing DiversityMedQA, we provide a resource for evaluating and mitigating demographic bias in LLM medical diagnoses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Yan, Jin Jiang, Yang Liu, Yixin Cao, Xin Xu, Mengdi zhang, Xunliang Cai, Jian Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-correction is a novel method that can stimulate the potential reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). It involves detecting and correcting errors during the inference process when LLMs solve reasoning problems. However, recent works do not regard self-correction as a spontaneous and intrinsic capability of LLMs. Instead, such correction is achieved through post-hoc generation, external knowledge introduction, multi-model collaboration, and similar techniques. In this paper, we propose a series of mathematical LLMs called S$^3$c-Math, which are able to perform Spontaneous Step-level Self-correction for Mathematical reasoning. This capability helps LLMs to recognize whether their ongoing inference tends to contain errors and simultaneously correct these errors to produce a more reliable response. We proposed a method, which employs a step-level sampling approach to construct step-wise self-correction data for achieving such ability. Additionally, we implement a training strategy that uses above constructed data to equip LLMs with spontaneous step-level self-correction capacities. Our data and methods have been demonstrated to be effective across various foundation LLMs, consistently showing significant progress in evaluations on GSM8K, MATH, and other mathematical benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the spontaneous step-level self-correction ability of LLMs in mathematical reasoning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01539">It is Time to Develop an Auditing Framework to Promote Value Aware Chatbots</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanchen Wang, Lisa Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked the beginning of a new era in AI, the availability of generative AI tools for everyone to use. ChatGPT and other similar chatbots boast a wide range of capabilities from answering student homework questions to creating music and art. Given the large amounts of human data chatbots are built on, it is inevitable that they will inherit human errors and biases. These biases have the potential to inflict significant harm or increase inequity on different subpopulations. Because chatbots do not have an inherent understanding of societal values, they may create new content that is contrary to established norms. Examples of concerning generated content includes child pornography, inaccurate facts, and discriminatory posts. In this position paper, we argue that the speed of advancement of this technology requires us, as computer and data scientists, to mobilize and develop a values-based auditing framework containing a community established standard set of measurements to monitor the health of different chatbots and LLMs. To support our argument, we use a simple audit template to share the results of basic audits we conduct that are focused on measuring potential bias in search engine style tasks, code generation, and story generation. We identify responses from GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 that are both consistent and not consistent with values derived from existing law. While the findings come as no surprise, they do underscore the urgency of developing a robust auditing framework for openly sharing results in a consistent way so that mitigation strategies can be developed by the academic community, government agencies, and companies when our values are not being adhered to. We conclude this paper with recommendations for value-based strategies for improving the technologies.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01552">Self-Instructed Derived Prompt Generation Meets In-Context Learning: Unlocking New Potential of Black-Box LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Li, Yuhao Du, Jinpeng Hu, Xiang Wan, Anningzhe Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in generating high-quality responses. In order to achieve better alignment with LLMs with human preference, various works are proposed based on specific optimization process, which, however, is not suitable to Black-Box LLMs like GPT-4, due to inaccessible parameters. In Black-Box LLMs case, their performance is highly dependent on the quality of the provided prompts. Existing methods to enhance response quality often involve a prompt refinement model, yet these approaches potentially suffer from semantic inconsistencies between the refined and original prompts, and typically overlook the relationship between them. To address these challenges, we introduce a self-instructed in-context learning framework that empowers LLMs to deliver more effective responses by generating reliable derived prompts to construct informative contextual environments. Our approach incorporates a self-instructed reinforcement learning mechanism, enabling direct interaction with the response model during derived prompt generation for better alignment. We then formulate querying as an in-context learning task, using responses from LLMs combined with the derived prompts to establish a contextual demonstration for the original prompt. This strategy ensures alignment with the original query, reduces discrepancies from refined prompts, and maximizes the LLMs' in-context learning capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only generates more reliable derived prompts but also significantly enhances LLMs' ability to deliver more effective responses, including Black-Box models such as GPT-4.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and processing cultural knowledge, with a specific focus on Hakka culture as a case study. Leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy, the study develops a multi-dimensional framework that systematically assesses LLMs across six cognitive domains: Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating. This benchmark extends beyond traditional single-dimensional evaluations by providing a deeper analysis of LLMs' abilities to handle culturally specific content, ranging from basic recall of facts to higher-order cognitive tasks such as creative synthesis. Additionally, the study integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to address the challenges of minority cultural knowledge representation in LLMs, demonstrating how RAG enhances the models' performance by dynamically incorporating relevant external information. The results highlight the effectiveness of RAG in improving accuracy across all cognitive domains, particularly in tasks requiring precise retrieval and application of cultural knowledge. However, the findings also reveal the limitations of RAG in creative tasks, underscoring the need for further optimization. This benchmark provides a robust tool for evaluating and comparing LLMs in culturally diverse contexts, offering valuable insights for future research and development in AI-driven cultural knowledge preservation and dissemination.</p>

<p>Abstract: Werewolf is an incomplete information game, which has several challenges when creating a computer agent as a player given the lack of understanding of the situation and individuality of utterance (e.g., computer agents are not capable of characterful utterance or situational lying). We propose a werewolf agent that solves some of those difficulties by combining a Large Language Model (LLM) and a rule-based algorithm. In particular, our agent uses a rule-based algorithm to select an output either from an LLM or a template prepared beforehand based on the results of analyzing conversation history using an LLM. It allows the agent to refute in specific situations, identify when to end the conversation, and behave with persona. This approach mitigated conversational inconsistencies and facilitated logical utterance as a result. We also conducted a qualitative evaluation, which resulted in our agent being perceived as more human-like compared to an unmodified LLM. The agent is freely available for contributing to advance the research in the field of Werewolf game.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianchi Zhang, Hainan Zhang, Liang Pang, Hongwei Zheng, Zhiming Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieved documents containing noise will hinder RAG from detecting answer clues and make the inference process slow and expensive. Therefore, context compression is necessary to enhance its accuracy and efficiency. Existing context compression methods use extractive or generative models to retain the most query-relevant sentences or apply the information bottleneck theory to preserve sufficient information. However, these methods may face issues such as over-compression or high computational costs. We observe that the retriever often ranks relevant documents at the top, but the exact number of documents needed to answer the query is uncertain due to the impact of query complexity and retrieval quality: complex queries like multi-hop questions may require retaining more documents than simpler queries, and a low-quality retrieval may need to rely on more documents to generate accurate outputs. Therefore, determining the minimum number of required documents (compression rate) is still a challenge for RAG. In this paper, we introduce AdaComp, a low-cost extractive context compression method that adaptively determines the compression rate based on both query complexity and retrieval quality. Specifically, we first annotate the minimum top-k documents necessary for the RAG system to answer the current query as the compression rate and then construct triplets of the query, retrieved documents, and its compression rate. Then, we use this triplet dataset to train a compression-rate predictor. Experiments on three QA datasets and one conversational Muiti-doc QA dataset show that AdaComp significantly reduces inference costs while maintaining performance nearly identical to uncompressed models, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the performance of Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) improves, they are increasingly capable of responding in multiple languages, and there is an expectation that the demand for explanations generated by LVLMs will grow. However, pre-training of Vision Encoder and the integrated training of LLMs with Vision Encoder are mainly conducted using English training data, leaving it uncertain whether LVLMs can completely handle their potential when generating explanations in languages other than English. In addition, multilingual QA benchmarks that create datasets using machine translation have cultural differences and biases, remaining issues for use as evaluation tasks. To address these challenges, this study created an extended dataset in multiple languages without relying on machine translation. This dataset that takes into account nuances and country-specific phrases was then used to evaluate the generation explanation abilities of LVLMs. Furthermore, this study examined whether Instruction-Tuning in resource-rich English improves performance in other languages. Our findings indicate that LVLMs perform worse in languages other than English compared to English. In addition, it was observed that LVLMs struggle to effectively manage the knowledge learned from English data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning issue \citep{qi2023fine} poses serious safety concerns for Large language models' fine-tuning-as-a-service. While existing defenses \citep{huang2024vaccine,rosati2024representation} have been proposed to mitigate the issue, their performances are still far away from satisfactory, and the root cause of the problem has not been fully recovered. For the first time in the literature, we in this paper show that \textit{harmful perturbation} over the model weights should be the root cause of alignment-broken of harmful fine-tuning. In order to attenuate the negative impact of harmful perturbation, we propose an alignment-stage solution, dubbed Booster. Technically, along with the original alignment loss, we append a loss regularizer in the alignment stage's optimization. The regularizer ensures that the model's harmful loss reduction before/after simulated harmful perturbation is attenuated, thereby mitigating the subsequent fine-tuning risk. Empirical results show that Booster can effectively reduce the harmful score of the fine-tuned models while maintaining the performance of downstream tasks.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to prioritize adherence to user prompts over providing veracious responses, leading to the sycophancy issue. When challenged by users, LLMs tend to admit mistakes and provide inaccurate responses even if they initially provided the correct answer. Recent works propose to employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to mitigate the sycophancy issue, while it typically leads to the degeneration of LLMs' general capability. To address the challenge, we propose a novel supervised pinpoint tuning (SPT), where the region-of-interest modules are tuned for a given objective. Specifically, SPT first reveals and verifies a small percentage (<5%) of the basic modules, which significantly affect a particular behavior of LLMs. i.e., sycophancy. Subsequently, SPT merely fine-tunes these identified modules while freezing the rest. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed SPT, we conduct comprehensive experiments, demonstrating that SPT significantly mitigates the sycophancy issue of LLMs (even better than SFT). Moreover, SPT introduces limited or even no side effects on the general capability of LLMs. Our results shed light on how to precisely, effectively, and efficiently explain and improve the targeted ability of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across numerous applications and have shown an emergent ability to tackle complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical computations. However, even for the simplest arithmetic calculations, the intrinsic mechanisms behind LLMs remain mysterious, making it challenging to ensure reliability. In this work, we delve into uncovering a specific mechanism by which LLMs execute calculations. Through comprehensive experiments, we find that LLMs frequently involve a small fraction (< 5%) of attention heads, which play a pivotal role in focusing on operands and operators during calculation processes. Subsequently, the information from these operands is processed through multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), progressively leading to the final solution. These pivotal heads/MLPs, though identified on a specific dataset, exhibit transferability across different datasets and even distinct tasks. This insight prompted us to investigate the potential benefits of selectively fine-tuning these essential heads/MLPs to boost the LLMs' computational performance. We empirically find that such precise tuning can yield notable enhancements on mathematical prowess, without compromising the performance on non-mathematical tasks. Our work serves as a preliminary exploration into the arithmetic calculation abilities inherent in LLMs, laying a solid foundation to reveal more intricate mathematical tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01666">In Defense of RAG in the Era of Long-Context Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tan Yu, Anbang Xu, Rama Akkiraju</p>
<p>Abstract: Overcoming the limited context limitations in early-generation LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been a reliable solution for context-based answer generation in the past. Recently, the emergence of long-context LLMs allows the models to incorporate much longer text sequences, making RAG less attractive. Recent studies show that long-context LLMs significantly outperform RAG in long-context applications. Unlike the existing works favoring the long-context LLM over RAG, we argue that the extremely long context in LLMs suffers from a diminished focus on relevant information and leads to potential degradation in answer quality. This paper revisits the RAG in long-context answer generation. We propose an order-preserve retrieval-augmented generation (OP-RAG) mechanism, which significantly improves the performance of RAG for long-context question-answer applications. With OP-RAG, as the number of retrieved chunks increases, the answer quality initially rises, and then declines, forming an inverted U-shaped curve. There exist sweet points where OP-RAG could achieve higher answer quality with much less tokens than long-context LLM taking the whole context as input. Extensive experiments on public benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our OP-RAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Wang, Ru Zhang, Yifan Tang, Jianyi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the evolution of generative linguistic steganography techniques, conventional steganalysis falls short in robustly quantifying the alterations induced by steganography, thereby complicating detection. Consequently, the research paradigm has pivoted towards deep-learning-based linguistic steganalysis. This study offers a comprehensive review of existing contributions and evaluates prevailing developmental trajectories. Specifically, we first provided a formalized exposition of the general formulas for linguistic steganalysis, while comparing the differences between this field and the domain of text classification. Subsequently, we classified the existing work into two levels based on vector space mapping and feature extraction models, thereby comparing the research motivations, model advantages, and other details. A comparative analysis of the experiments is conducted to assess the performances. Finally, the challenges faced by this field are discussed, and several directions for future development and key issues that urgently need to be addressed are proposed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifeng Wang, Zhouhong Gu, Siwei Zhang, Suhang Zheng, Tao Wang, Tianyu Li, Hongwei Feng, Yanghua Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable fake news detection predicts the authenticity of news items with annotated explanations. Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their powerful natural language understanding and explanation generation abilities. However, presenting LLMs for explainable fake news detection remains two main challenges. Firstly, fake news appears reasonable and could easily mislead LLMs, leaving them unable to understand the complex news-faking process. Secondly, utilizing LLMs for this task would generate both correct and incorrect explanations, which necessitates abundant labor in the loop. In this paper, we propose LLM-GAN, a novel framework that utilizes prompting mechanisms to enable an LLM to become Generator and Detector and for realistic fake news generation and detection. Our results demonstrate LLM-GAN's effectiveness in both prediction performance and explanation quality. We further showcase the integration of LLM-GAN to a cloud-native AI platform to provide better fake news detection service in the cloud.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiwen Ni, Xiangtao Kong, Chengming Li, Xiping Hu, Ruifeng Xu, Jia Zhu, Min Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on the huge amount of pre-training data learned in the pre-training phase. The opacity of the pre-training process and the training data causes the results of many benchmark tests to become unreliable. If any model has been trained on a benchmark test set, it can seriously hinder the health of the field. In order to automate and efficiently test the capabilities of large language models, numerous mainstream benchmarks adopt a multiple-choice format. As the swapping of the contents of multiple-choice options does not affect the meaning of the question itself, we propose a simple and effective data leakage detection method based on this property. Specifically, we shuffle the contents of the options in the data to generate the corresponding derived data sets, and then detect data leakage based on the model's log probability distribution over the derived data sets. If there is a maximum and outlier in the set of log probabilities, it indicates that the data is leaked. Our method is able to work under black-box conditions without access to model training data or weights, effectively identifying data leakage from benchmark test sets in model pre-training data, including both normal scenarios and complex scenarios where options may have been shuffled intentionally or unintentionally. Through experiments based on two LLMs and benchmark designs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In addition, we evaluate the degree of data leakage of 31 mainstream open-source LLMs on four benchmark datasets and give a ranking of the leaked LLMs for each benchmark, and we find that the Qwen family of LLMs has the highest degree of data leakage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ike Ebubechukwu, Johane Takeuchi, Antonello Ceravola, Frank Joublin</p>
<p>Abstract: As dialogue systems and chatbots increasingly integrate into everyday interactions, the need for efficient and accurate evaluation methods becomes paramount. This study explores the comparative performance of human and AI assessments across a range of dialogue scenarios, focusing on seven key performance indicators (KPIs): Coherence, Innovation, Concreteness, Goal Contribution, Commonsense Contradiction, Incorrect Fact, and Redundancy. Utilizing the GPT-4o API, we generated a diverse dataset of conversations and conducted a two-part experimental analysis. In Experiment 1, we evaluated multi-party conversations on Coherence, Innovation, Concreteness, and Goal Contribution, revealing that GPT models align closely with human judgments. Notably, both human and AI evaluators exhibited a tendency towards binary judgment rather than linear scaling, highlighting a shared challenge in these assessments. Experiment 2 extended the work of Finch et al. (2023) by focusing on dyadic dialogues and assessing Commonsense Contradiction, Incorrect Fact, and Redundancy. The results indicate that while GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance in maintaining factual accuracy and commonsense reasoning, it still struggles with reducing redundancy and self-contradiction. Our findings underscore the potential of GPT models to closely replicate human evaluation in dialogue systems, while also pointing to areas for improvement. This research offers valuable insights for advancing the development and implementation of more refined dialogue evaluation methodologies, contributing to the evolution of more effective and human-like AI communication tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Shi, Guochao Jiang, Tian Qiu, Deqing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The relation extraction (RE) in complex scenarios faces challenges such as diverse relation types and ambiguous relations between entities within a single sentence, leading to the poor performance of pure "text-in, text-out" language models (LMs). To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an agent-based RE framework, namely AgentRE, which fully leverages the potential of large language models (LLMs) including memory, retrieval and reflection, to achieve RE in complex scenarios. Specifically, three major modules are built in AgentRE serving as the tools to help the agent acquire and process various useful information, thereby obtaining improved RE performance. Our extensive experimental results upon two datasets in English and Chinese demonstrate our AgentRE's superior performance, especially in low-resource scenarios. Additionally, the trajectories generated by AgentRE can be refined to construct a high-quality training dataset incorporating different reasoning methods, which can be used to fine-tune smaller models.

<p>Abstract: This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) for identifying and examining intertextual relationships within biblical, Koine Greek texts. By evaluating the performance of LLMs on various intertextuality scenarios the study demonstrates that these models can detect direct quotations, allusions, and echoes between texts. The LLM's ability to generate novel intertextual observations and connections highlights its potential to uncover new insights. However, the model also struggles with long query passages and the inclusion of false intertextual dependences, emphasizing the importance of expert evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Chen, Qiguang Chen, Libo Qin, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Yicheng Zou, Wanxiang Che, Hang Yan, Kai Chen, Dahua Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have significantly improved tasks such as information extraction, question answering, and complex planning scenarios. In order to achieve success in long context tasks, a large amount of work has been done to enhance the long context capabilities of the model through synthetic data. Existing methods typically utilize the Self-Instruct framework to generate instruction tuning data for better long context capability improvement. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that less than 35% of generated samples are multi-hop, and more than 40% exhibit poor quality, limiting comprehensive understanding and further research. To improve the quality of synthetic data, we propose the Multi-agent Interactive Multi-hop Generation (MIMG) framework, incorporating a Quality Verification Agent, a Single-hop Question Generation Agent, a Multiple Question Sampling Strategy, and a Multi-hop Question Merger Agent. This framework improves the data quality, with the proportion of high-quality, multi-hop, and diverse data exceeding 85%. Furthermore, we systematically investigate strategies for document selection, question merging, and validation techniques through extensive experiments across various models. Our findings show that our synthetic high-quality long-context instruction data significantly enhances model performance, even surpassing models trained on larger amounts of human-annotated data.

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the evaluation of responses in medical Question and Answer (Q\&A) systems, a crucial form of Natural Language Processing. Traditionally, human evaluation has been indispensable for assessing the quality of these responses. However, manual evaluation by medical professionals is time-consuming and costly. Our study examines whether LLMs can reliably replicate human evaluations by using questions derived from patient data, thereby saving valuable time for medical experts. While the findings suggest promising results, further research is needed to address more specific or complex questions that were beyond the scope of this initial investigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fuzzing is an important dynamic program analysis technique designed for finding vulnerabilities in complex software. Fuzzing involves presenting a target program with crafted malicious input to cause crashes, buffer overflows, memory errors, and exceptions. Crafting malicious inputs in an efficient manner is a difficult open problem and the best approaches often apply uniform random mutations to pre-existing valid inputs. In this work, we propose to adopt fine-tuned large language models (FuzzCoder) to learn patterns in the input files from successful attacks to guide future fuzzing explorations. Specifically, we develop a framework to leverage the code LLMs to guide the mutation process of inputs in fuzzing. The mutation process is formulated as the sequence-to-sequence modeling, where LLM receives a sequence of bytes and then outputs the mutated byte sequence. FuzzCoder is fine-tuned on the created instruction dataset (Fuzz-Instruct), where the successful fuzzing history is collected from the heuristic fuzzing tool. FuzzCoder can predict mutation locations and strategies locations in input files to trigger abnormal behaviors of the program. Experimental results show that FuzzCoder based on AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) gain significant improvements in terms of effective proportion of mutation (EPM) and number of crashes (NC) for various input formats including ELF, JPG, MP3, and XML.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Baile Chen, Fabian Wenz, Yi Zhang, Moe Kayali, Nesime Tatbul, Michael Cafarella, \c{C}a\u{g}atay Demiralp, Michael Stonebraker</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing text-to-SQL benchmarks have largely been constructed using publicly available tables from the web with human-generated tests containing question and SQL statement pairs. They typically show very good results and lead people to think that LLMs are effective at text-to-SQL tasks. In this paper, we apply off-the-shelf LLMs to a benchmark containing enterprise data warehouse data. In this environment, LLMs perform poorly, even when standard prompt engineering and RAG techniques are utilized. As we will show, the reasons for poor performance are largely due to three characteristics: (1) public LLMs cannot train on enterprise data warehouses because they are largely in the "dark web", (2) schemas of enterprise tables are more complex than the schemas in public data, which leads the SQL-generation task innately harder, and (3) business-oriented questions are often more complex, requiring joins over multiple tables and aggregations. As a result, we propose a new dataset BEAVER, sourced from real enterprise data warehouses together with natural language queries and their correct SQL statements which we collected from actual user history. We evaluated this dataset using recent LLMs and demonstrated their poor performance on this task. We hope this dataset will facilitate future researchers building more sophisticated text-to-SQL systems which can do better on this important class of data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02050">Enhancing Code-Switching Speech Recognition with LID-Based Collaborative Mixture of Experts Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hukai Huang, Jiayan Lin, Kaidi Wang, Yishuang Li, Wenhao Guan, Qingyang Hong, Lin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the inherent difficulty in modeling phonetic similarities across different languages, code-switching speech recognition presents a formidable challenge. This study proposes a Collaborative-MoE, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that leverages a collaborative mechanism among expert groups. Initially, a preceding routing network explicitly learns Language Identification (LID) tasks and selects experts based on acquired LID weights. This process ensures robust routing information to the MoE layer, mitigating interference from diverse language domains on expert network parameter updates. The LID weights are also employed to facilitate inter-group collaboration, enabling the integration of language-specific representations. Furthermore, within each language expert group, a gating network operates unsupervised to foster collaboration on attributes beyond language. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significant performance enhancements compared to alternative methods. Importantly, our method preserves the efficient inference capabilities characteristic of MoE models without necessitating additional pre-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Wu, Ming Shan Hee, Zhiqing Hu, Roy Ka-Wei Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The abilities of long-context language models (LMs) are often evaluated using the "Needle-in-a-Haystack" (NIAH) test, which comprises tasks designed to assess a model's ability to identify specific information ("needle") within large text sequences ("haystack"). While these benchmarks measure how well models understand long-context input sequences, they do not effectively gauge the quality of long-form text generation--a critical aspect for applications such as design proposals and creative writing. To address this gap, we have introduced a new long-form text evaluation benchmark, Spinning the Golden Thread (SGT), which tests models' ability to identify specific events within generated long text sequences. In this benchmark, we prompt long-context LMs to create long-form text that must include particular events or constraints and evaluate their ability to incorporate these elements. We evaluated ten long-context LMs across four distinct scenarios, three types of prompt instructions, and two different generation-length settings (16K and 32K). Although these models perform well on NIAH benchmarks, none demonstrated satisfactory performance on the Spinning the Golden Thread, raising concerns about their ability to generate coherent long-form text that follows instructions. Additionally, as the length of the generated text increases, all models exhibit a significant drop in performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Burnham, Kayla Kahn, Ryan Yank Wang, Rachel X. Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Social scientists quickly adopted large language models due to their ability to annotate documents without supervised training, an ability known as zero-shot learning. However, due to their compute demands, cost, and often proprietary nature, these models are often at odds with replication and open science standards. This paper introduces the Political DEBATE (DeBERTa Algorithm for Textual Entailment) language models for zero-shot and few-shot classification of political documents. These models are not only as good, or better than, state-of-the art large language models at zero and few-shot classification, but are orders of magnitude more efficient and completely open source. By training the models on a simple random sample of 10-25 documents, they can outperform supervised classifiers trained on hundreds or thousands of documents and state-of-the-art generative models with complex, engineered prompts. Additionally, we release the PolNLI dataset used to train these models -- a corpus of over 200,000 political documents with highly accurate labels across over 800 classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building high-quality datasets for specialized tasks is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process that often requires specialized domain knowledge. We propose Corpus Retrieval and Augmentation for Fine-Tuning (CRAFT), a method for generating synthetic datasets, given a small number of user-written few-shots that demonstrate the task to be performed. Given the few-shot examples, we use large-scale public web-crawled corpora and similarity-based document retrieval to find other relevant human-written documents. Lastly, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) augment the retrieved documents into custom-formatted task samples, which then can be used for fine-tuning. We demonstrate that CRAFT can efficiently generate large-scale task-specific training datasets for four diverse tasks: biology question-answering (QA), medicine QA and commonsense QA as well as summarization. Our experiments show that CRAFT-based models outperform or achieve comparable performance to general LLMs for QA tasks, while CRAFT-based summarization models outperform models trained on human-curated data by 46 preference points.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the growing prevalence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), an increasing amount of content is no longer exclusively generated by humans but by generative AI models with human guidance. This shift presents notable challenges for the delineation of originality due to the varying degrees of human contribution in AI-assisted works. This study raises the research question of measuring human contribution in AI-assisted content generation and introduces a framework to address this question that is grounded in information theory. By calculating mutual information between human input and AI-assisted output relative to self-information of AI-assisted output, we quantify the proportional information contribution of humans in content generation. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed measure effectively discriminates between varying degrees of human contribution across multiple creative domains. We hope that this work lays a foundation for measuring human contributions in AI-assisted content generation in the era of generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jay Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: A text stream is an ordered sequence of text documents generated over time. A massive amount of such text data is generated by online social platforms every day. Designing an algorithm for such text streams to extract useful information is a challenging task due to unique properties of the stream such as infinite length, data sparsity, and evolution. Thereby, learning useful information from such streaming data under the constraint of limited time and memory has gained increasing attention. During the past decade, although many text stream mining algorithms have proposed, there still exists some potential issues. First, high-dimensional text data heavily degrades the learning performance until the model either works on subspace or reduces the global feature space. The second issue is to extract semantic text representation of documents and capture evolving topics over time. Moreover, the problem of label scarcity exists, whereas existing approaches work on the full availability of labeled data. To deal with these issues, in this thesis, new learning models are proposed for clustering and multi-label learning on text streams.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is being conducted in various sectors, from analyzing building materials and components to comprehensive evaluations of entire structures. However, reviews of the existing literature have been unable to provide a comprehensive overview of research in this field, leaving scholars without a definitive guideline for future investigations. This paper aims to fill this gap, mapping more than twenty years of research. Using an innovative methodology that combines social network analysis and text mining, the paper examined 8024 scientific abstracts. The authors identified seven key thematic groups, building and sustainability clusters (BSCs). To assess their significance in the broader discourse on building and sustainability, the semantic brand score (SBS) indicator was applied. Additionally, building and sustainability trends were tracked, focusing on the LCA concept. The major research topics mainly relate to building materials and energy efficiency. In addition to presenting an innovative approach to reviewing extensive literature domains, the article also provides insights into emerging and underdeveloped themes, outlining crucial future research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods effectively adapt large language models (LLMs) to diverse downstream tasks, reducing storage and GPU memory demands. Despite these advantages, several applications pose new challenges to PEFT beyond mere parameter efficiency. One notable challenge involves the efficient deployment of LLMs equipped with multiple task- or user-specific adapters, particularly when different adapters are needed for distinct requests within the same batch. Another challenge is the interpretability of LLMs, which is crucial for understanding how LLMs function. Previous studies introduced various approaches to address different challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, RoAd, which employs a straightforward 2D rotation to adapt LLMs and addresses all the above challenges: (1) RoAd is remarkably parameter-efficient, delivering optimal performance on GLUE, eight commonsense reasoning tasks and four arithmetic reasoning tasks with $<0.1\%$ trainable parameters; (2) RoAd facilitates the efficient serving of requests requiring different adapters within a batch, with an overhead comparable to element-wise multiplication instead of batch matrix multiplication; (3) RoAd enhances LLM's interpretability through integration within a framework of distributed interchange intervention, demonstrated via composition experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Momin Abbas, Koushik Kar, Tianyi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant strides in tackling challenging tasks in wireless systems, especially when an accurate wireless model is not available. However, when available data is limited, traditional DNNs often yield subpar results due to underfitting. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) exemplified by GPT-3, have remarkably showcased their capabilities across a broad range of natural language processing tasks. But whether and how LLMs can benefit challenging non-language tasks in wireless systems is unexplored. In this work, we propose to leverage the in-context learning ability (a.k.a. prompting) of LLMs to solve wireless tasks in the low data regime without any training or fine-tuning, unlike DNNs which require training. We further demonstrate that the performance of LLMs varies significantly when employed with different prompt templates. To solve this issue, we employ the latest LLM calibration methods. Our results reveal that using LLMs via ICL methods generally outperforms traditional DNNs on the symbol demodulation task and yields highly confident predictions when coupled with calibration techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are improving at an exceptional rate. However, these models are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which are becoming increasingly dangerous as models become increasingly powerful. In this work, we introduce a dataset of jailbreaks where each example can be input in both a single or a multi-turn format. We show that while equivalent in content, they are not equivalent in jailbreak success: defending against one structure does not guarantee defense against the other. Similarly, LLM-based filter guardrails also perform differently depending on not just the input content but the input structure. Thus, vulnerabilities of frontier models should be studied in both single and multi-turn settings; this dataset provides a tool to do so.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at tasks requiring joint understanding of visual and linguistic information. A particularly promising yet under-explored application for these models lies in answering questions based on various kinds of maps. This study investigates the efficacy of VLMs in answering questions based on choropleth maps, which are widely used for data analysis and representation. To facilitate and encourage research in this area, we introduce a novel map-based question-answering benchmark, consisting of maps from three geographical regions (United States, India, China), each containing 1000 questions. Our benchmark incorporates 43 diverse question templates, requiring nuanced understanding of relative spatial relationships, intricate map features, and complex reasoning. It also includes maps with discrete and continuous values, encompassing variations in color-mapping, category ordering, and stylistic patterns, enabling comprehensive analysis. We evaluate the performance of multiple VLMs on this benchmark, highlighting gaps in their abilities and providing insights for improving such models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paulo Soares, Sean McCurdy, Andrew J. Gerber, Peter Fonagy</p>
<p>Abstract: Obtaining data in the medical field is challenging, making the adoption of AI technology within the space slow and high-risk. We evaluate whether we can overcome this obstacle with synthetic data generated by large language models (LLMs). In particular, we use GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus to create agents that simulate adults with varying profiles, childhood memories, and attachment styles. These agents participate in simulated Adult Attachment Interviews (AAI), and we use their responses to train models for predicting their underlying attachment styles. We evaluate our models using a transcript dataset from 9 humans who underwent the same interview protocol, analyzed and labeled by mental health professionals. Our findings indicate that training the models using only synthetic data achieves performance comparable to training the models on human data. Additionally, while the raw embeddings from synthetic answers occupy a distinct space compared to those from real human responses, the introduction of unlabeled human data and a simple standardization allows for a closer alignment of these representations. This adjustment is supported by qualitative analyses and is reflected in the enhanced predictive accuracy of the standardized embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomasz Stanisz, Stanis{\l}aw Dro\.zd\.z, Jaros{\l}aw Kwapie\'n</p>
<p>Abstract: As the recent studies indicate, the structure imposed onto written texts by the presence of punctuation develops patterns which reveal certain characteristics of universality. In particular, based on a large collection of classic literary works, it has been evidenced that the distances between consecutive punctuation marks, measured in terms of the number of words, obey the discrete Weibull distribution - a discrete variant of a distribution often used in survival analysis. The present work extends the analysis of punctuation usage patterns to more experimental pieces of world literature. It turns out that the compliance of the the distances between punctuation marks with the discrete Weibull distribution typically applies here as well. However, some of the works by James Joyce are distinct in this regard - in the sense that the tails of the relevant distributions are significantly thicker and, consequently, the corresponding hazard functions are decreasing functions not observed in typical literary texts in prose. "Finnegans Wake" - the same one to which science owes the word "quarks" for the most fundamental constituents of matter - is particularly striking in this context. At the same time, in all the studied texts, the sentence lengths - representing the distances between sentence-ending punctuation marks - reveal more freedom and are not constrained by the discrete Weibull distribution. This freedom in some cases translates into long-range nonlinear correlations, which manifest themselves in multifractality. Again, a text particularly spectacular in terms of multifractality is "Finnegans Wake".</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Wang, Che Liu, Rossella Arcucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in medical vision-language pre-training (MedVLP) have significantly enhanced zero-shot medical vision tasks such as image classification by leveraging large-scale medical image-text pair pre-training. However, the performance of these tasks can be heavily influenced by the variability in textual prompts describing the categories, necessitating robustness in MedVLP models to diverse prompt styles. Yet, this sensitivity remains underexplored. In this work, we are the first to systematically assess the sensitivity of three widely-used MedVLP methods to a variety of prompts across 15 different diseases. To achieve this, we designed six unique prompt styles to mirror real clinical scenarios, which were subsequently ranked by interpretability. Our findings indicate that all MedVLP models evaluated show unstable performance across different prompt styles, suggesting a lack of robustness. Additionally, the models' performance varied with increasing prompt interpretability, revealing difficulties in comprehending complex medical concepts. This study underscores the need for further development in MedVLP methodologies to enhance their robustness to diverse zero-shot prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuqiang Niu, Zebang Cheng, Xianghua Fu, Xiaojiang Peng, Genan Dai, Yin Chen, Hu Huang, Bowen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the proliferation of diverse multimodal social media content including text, and images multimodal stance detection (MSD) has become a crucial research area. However, existing MSD studies have focused on modeling stance within individual text-image pairs, overlooking the multi-party conversational contexts that naturally occur on social media. This limitation stems from a lack of datasets that authentically capture such conversational scenarios, hindering progress in conversational MSD. To address this, we introduce a new multimodal multi-turn conversational stance detection dataset (called MmMtCSD). To derive stances from this challenging dataset, we propose a novel multimodal large language model stance detection framework (MLLM-SD), that learns joint stance representations from textual and visual modalities. Experiments on MmMtCSD show state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MLLM-SD approach for multimodal stance detection. We believe that MmMtCSD will contribute to advancing real-world applications of stance detection research.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study examines the political bias of chatbots powered by large language models, namely ChatGPT and Gemini, in the context of the 2024 European Parliament elections. The research focused on the evaluation of political parties represented in the European Parliament across 27 EU Member States by these generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The methodology involved daily data collection through standardized prompts on both platforms. The results revealed a stark contrast: while Gemini mostly refused to answer political questions, ChatGPT provided consistent ratings. The analysis showed a significant bias in ChatGPT in favor of left-wing and centrist parties, with the highest ratings for the Greens/European Free Alliance. In contrast, right-wing parties, particularly the Identity and Democracy group, received the lowest ratings. The study identified key factors influencing the ratings, including attitudes toward European integration and perceptions of democratic values. The findings highlight the need for a critical approach to information provided by generative AI systems in a political context and call for more transparency and regulation in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Wang, Xiao Yan, Shiyu Jin, Quanqing Xu, Chuanhui Yang, Yuanyuan Zhu, Chuang Hu, Bo Du, Jiawei Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-attributed graph (TAG) is an important type of graph structured data with text descriptions for each node. Few- and zero-shot node classification on TAGs have many applications in fields such as academia and social networks. However, the two tasks are challenging due to the lack of supervision signals, and existing methods only use the contrastive loss to align graph-based node embedding and language-based text embedding. In this paper, we propose Hound to improve accuracy by introducing more supervision signals, and the core idea is to go beyond the node-text pairs that come with data. Specifically, we design three augmentation techniques, i.e., node perturbation, text matching, and semantics negation to provide more reference nodes for each text and vice versa. Node perturbation adds/drops edges to produce diversified node embeddings that can be matched with a text. Text matching retrieves texts with similar embeddings to match with a node. Semantics negation uses a negative prompt to construct a negative text with the opposite semantics, which is contrasted with the original node and text. We evaluate Hound on 5 datasets and compare with 13 state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that Hound consistently outperforms all baselines, and its accuracy improvements over the best-performing baseline are usually over 5%.</p>

<p>Abstract: How do language models use information provided as context when generating a response? Can we infer whether a particular generated statement is actually grounded in the context, a misinterpretation, or fabricated? To help answer these questions, we introduce the problem of context attribution: pinpointing the parts of the context (if any) that led a model to generate a particular statement. We then present ContextCite, a simple and scalable method for context attribution that can be applied on top of any existing language model. Finally, we showcase the utility of ContextCite through three applications: (1) helping verify generated statements (2) improving response quality by pruning the context and (3) detecting poisoning attacks. We provide code for ContextCite at https://github.com/MadryLab/context-cite.</p>

<p>Abstract: The evolving speech processing landscape is increasingly focused on complex scenarios like meetings or cocktail parties with multiple simultaneous speakers and far-field conditions. Existing methodologies for addressing these challenges fall into two categories: multi-channel and single-channel solutions. Single-channel approaches, notable for their generality and convenience, do not require specific information about microphone arrays.
  This paper presents a large-scale far-field overlapping speech dataset, crafted to advance research in speech separation, recognition, and speaker diarization. This dataset is a critical resource for decoding ``Who said What and When'' in multi-talker, reverberant environments, a daunting challenge in the field. Additionally, we introduce a pipeline system encompassing speech separation, recognition, and diarization as a foundational benchmark. Evaluations on the WHAMR! dataset validate the broad applicability of the proposed data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development and dynamic nature of large language models (LLMs) make it difficult for conventional quantitative benchmarks to accurately assess their capabilities. We propose report cards, which are human-interpretable, natural language summaries of model behavior for specific skills or topics. We develop a framework to evaluate report cards based on three criteria: specificity (ability to distinguish between models), faithfulness (accurate representation of model capabilities), and interpretability (clarity and relevance to humans). We also propose an iterative algorithm for generating report cards without human supervision and explore its efficacy by ablating various design choices. Through experimentation with popular LLMs, we demonstrate that report cards provide insights beyond traditional benchmarks and can help address the need for a more interpretable and holistic evaluation of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Node-based programming languages are increasingly popular in media arts coding domains. These languages are designed to be accessible to users with limited coding experience, allowing them to achieve creative output without an extensive programming background. Using LLM-based code generation to further lower the barrier to creative output is an exciting opportunity. However, the best strategy for code generation for visual node-based programming languages is still an open question. In particular, such languages have multiple levels of representation in text, each of which may be used for code generation. In this work, we explore the performance of LLM code generation in audio programming tasks in visual programming languages at multiple levels of representation. We explore code generation through metaprogramming code representations for these languages (i.e., coding the language using a different high-level text-based programming language), as well as through direct node generation with JSON. We evaluate code generated in this way for two visual languages for audio programming on a benchmark set of coding problems. We measure both correctness and complexity of the generated code. We find that metaprogramming results in more semantically correct generated code, given that the code is well-formed (i.e., is syntactically correct and runs). We also find that prompting for richer metaprogramming using randomness and loops led to more complex code.</p>

<p>Abstract: Function calling significantly extends the application boundary of large language models, where high-quality and diverse training data is critical for unlocking this capability. However, real function-calling data is quite challenging to collect and annotate, while synthetic data generated by existing pipelines tends to lack coverage and accuracy. In this paper, we present ToolACE, an automatic agentic pipeline designed to generate accurate, complex, and diverse tool-learning data. ToolACE leverages a novel self-evolution synthesis process to curate a comprehensive API pool of 26,507 diverse APIs. Dialogs are further generated through the interplay among multiple agents, guided by a formalized thinking process. To ensure data accuracy, we implement a dual-layer verification system combining rule-based and model-based checks. We demonstrate that models trained on our synthesized data, even with only 8B parameters, achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, rivaling the latest GPT-4 models.

<p>Abstract: Lip reading aims to predict spoken language by analyzing lip movements. Despite advancements in lip reading technologies, performance degrades when models are applied to unseen speakers due to their sensitivity to variations in visual information such as lip appearances. To address this challenge, speaker adaptive lip reading technologies have advanced by focusing on effectively adapting a lip reading model to target speakers in the visual modality. The effectiveness of adapting language information, such as vocabulary choice, of the target speaker has not been explored in the previous works. Moreover, existing datasets for speaker adaptation have limited vocabulary size and pose variations, limiting the validation of previous speaker-adaptive methods in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel speaker-adaptive lip reading method that adapts a pre-trained model to target speakers at both vision and language levels. Specifically, we integrate prompt tuning and the LoRA approach, applying them to a pre-trained lip reading model to effectively adapt the model to target speakers. In addition, to validate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, we introduce a new dataset, VoxLRS-SA, derived from VoxCeleb2 and LRS3. It contains a vocabulary of approximately 100K words, offers diverse pose variations, and enables the validation of adaptation methods in wild, sentence-level lip reading for the first time. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that the existing speaker-adaptive method also improves performance in the wild at the sentence level. Moreover, with the proposed adaptation method, we show that the proposed method achieves larger improvements when applied to the target speaker, compared to the previous works.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale video-language models have shown significant potential for real-time planning and detailed interactions. However, their high computational demands and the scarcity of annotated datasets limit their practicality for academic researchers. In this work, we introduce VideoLLaMB, a novel framework that utilizes temporal memory tokens within bridge layers to allow for the encoding of entire video sequences alongside historical visual data, effectively preserving semantic continuity and enhancing model performance across various tasks. This approach includes recurrent memory tokens and a SceneTilling algorithm, which segments videos into independent semantic units to preserve semantic integrity. Empirically, VideoLLaMB significantly outstrips existing video-language models, demonstrating a 5.5 points improvement over its competitors across three VideoQA benchmarks, and 2.06 points on egocentric planning. Comprehensive results on the MVBench show that VideoLLaMB-7B achieves markedly better results than previous 7B models of same LLM. Remarkably, it maintains robust performance as PLLaVA even as video length increases up to 8 times. Besides, the frame retrieval results on our specialized Needle in a Video Haystack (NIAVH) benchmark, further validate VideoLLaMB's prowess in accurately identifying specific frames within lengthy videos. Our SceneTilling algorithm also enables the generation of streaming video captions directly, without necessitating additional training. In terms of efficiency, VideoLLaMB, trained on 16 frames, supports up to 320 frames on a single Nvidia A100 GPU with linear GPU memory scaling, ensuring both high performance and cost-effectiveness, thereby setting a new foundation for long-form video-language models in both academic and practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Liu, Wenqian Zhang, Sihan Ren, Chengyu Huang, Jingyi Yu, Lan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign languages, used by around 70 million Deaf individuals globally, are visual languages that convey visual and contextual information. Current methods in vision-based sign language recognition (SLR) and translation (SLT) struggle with dialogue scenes due to limited dataset diversity and the neglect of contextually relevant information. To address these challenges, we introduce SCOPE (Sign language Contextual Processing with Embedding from LLMs), a novel context-aware vision-based SLR and SLT framework. For SLR, we utilize dialogue contexts through a multi-modal encoder to enhance gloss-level recognition. For subsequent SLT, we further fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) by incorporating prior conversational context. We also contribute a new sign language dataset that contains 72 hours of Chinese sign language videos in contextual dialogues across various scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SCOPE framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including Phoenix-2014T, CSL-Daily, and our SCOPE dataset. Moreover, surveys conducted with participants from the Deaf community further validate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach in real-world applications. Both our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zeng, Xi Chen, Yuwen Pu, Xuhong Zhang, Tianyu Du, Shouling Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoors can be injected into NLP models to induce misbehavior when the input text contains a specific feature, known as a trigger, which the attacker secretly selects. Unlike fixed words, phrases, or sentences used in the static text trigger, NLP dynamic backdoor attacks design triggers associated with abstract and latent text features, making them considerably stealthier than traditional static backdoor attacks. However, existing research on NLP backdoor detection primarily focuses on defending against static backdoor attacks, while detecting dynamic backdoors in NLP models remains largely unexplored. This paper presents CLIBE, the first framework to detect dynamic backdoors in Transformer-based NLP models. CLIBE injects a "few-shot perturbation" into the suspect Transformer model by crafting optimized weight perturbation in the attention layers to make the perturbed model classify a limited number of reference samples as a target label. Subsequently, CLIBE leverages the generalization ability of this few-shot perturbation to determine whether the original model contains a dynamic backdoor. Extensive evaluation on three advanced NLP dynamic backdoor attacks, two widely-used Transformer frameworks, and four real-world classification tasks strongly validates the effectiveness of CLIBE. We also demonstrate the robustness of CLIBE against various adaptive attacks. Furthermore, we employ CLIBE to scrutinize 49 popular Transformer models on Hugging Face and discover one exhibiting a high probability of containing a dynamic backdoor. We have contacted Hugging Face and provided detailed evidence of this model's backdoor behavior. Moreover, we extend CLIBE to detect backdoor text generation models modified to exhibit toxic behavior. To the best of our knowledge, CLIBE is the first framework capable of detecting backdoors in text generation models without access to trigger input test samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> K Roth, Rushil Gupta, Simon Halle, Bang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: While LLMs in the RAG paradigm have shown remarkable performance on a variety of tasks, they still under-perform on unseen domains, especially on complex tasks like procedural question answering. In this work, we introduce a novel formalism and structure for manipulating text-based procedures. Based on this formalism, we further present a novel dataset called LCStep, scraped from the LangChain Python docs. Moreover, we extend the traditional RAG system to propose a novel system called analogy-augmented generation (AAG), that draws inspiration from human analogical reasoning and ability to assimilate past experiences to solve unseen problems. The proposed method uses a frozen language model with a custom procedure memory store to adapt to specialized knowledge. We demonstrate that AAG outperforms few-shot and RAG baselines on LCStep, RecipeNLG, and CHAMP datasets under a pairwise LLM-based evaluation, corroborated by human evaluation in the case of RecipeNLG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Wen, Zheng Li, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks introduces concerns about computational efficiency, prompting an exploration of efficient methods such as In-Context Learning (ICL). However, the vulnerability of ICL to privacy attacks under realistic assumptions remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first membership inference attack tailored for ICL, relying solely on generated texts without their associated probabilities. We propose four attack strategies tailored to various constrained scenarios and conduct extensive experiments on four popular large language models. Empirical results show that our attacks can accurately determine membership status in most cases, e.g., 95\% accuracy advantage against LLaMA, indicating that the associated risks are much higher than those shown by existing probability-based attacks. Additionally, we propose a hybrid attack that synthesizes the strengths of the aforementioned strategies, achieving an accuracy advantage of over 95\% in most cases. Furthermore, we investigate three potential defenses targeting data, instruction, and output. Results demonstrate combining defenses from orthogonal dimensions significantly reduces privacy leakage and offers enhanced privacy assurances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumajyoti Sarkar, Leonard Lausen, Volkan Cevher, Sheng Zha, Thomas Brox, George Karypis</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Expert (SMoE) models have emerged as a scalable alternative to dense models in language modeling. These models use conditionally activated feedforward subnetworks in transformer blocks, allowing for a separation between total model parameters and per-example computation. However, large token-routed SMoE models face a significant challenge: during inference, the entire model must be used for a sequence or a batch, resulting in high latencies in a distributed setting that offsets the advantages of per-token sparse activation. Our research explores task-specific model pruning to inform decisions about designing SMoE architectures, mainly modulating the choice of expert counts in pretraining. We investigate whether such pruned models offer advantages over smaller SMoE models trained from scratch, when evaluating and comparing them individually on tasks. To that end, we introduce an adaptive task-aware pruning technique UNCURL to reduce the number of experts per MoE layer in an offline manner post-training. Our findings reveal a threshold pruning factor for the reduction that depends on the number of experts used in pretraining, above which, the reduction starts to degrade model performance. These insights contribute to our understanding of model design choices when pretraining with SMoE architectures, particularly useful when considering task-specific inference optimization for later stages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chien-Chun Wang, Li-Wei Chen, Hung-Shin Lee, Berlin Chen, Hsin-Min Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-domain speech enhancement (SE) is often faced with severe challenges due to the scarcity of noise and background information in an unseen target domain, leading to a mismatch between training and test conditions. This study puts forward a novel data simulation method to address this issue, leveraging noise-extractive techniques and generative adversarial networks (GANs) with only limited target noisy speech data. Notably, our method employs a noise encoder to extract noise embeddings from target-domain data. These embeddings aptly guide the generator to synthesize utterances acoustically fitted to the target domain while authentically preserving the phonetic content of the input clean speech. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of dynamic stochastic perturbation, which can inject controlled perturbations into the noise embeddings during inference, thereby enabling the model to generalize well to unseen noise conditions. Experiments on the VoiceBank-DEMAND benchmark dataset demonstrate that our domain-adaptive SE method outperforms an existing strong baseline based on data simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li-Wei Chen, Hung-Shin Lee, Chen-Chi Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces VoxHakka, a text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for Taiwanese Hakka, a critically under-resourced language spoken in Taiwan. Leveraging the YourTTS framework, VoxHakka achieves high naturalness and accuracy and low real-time factor in speech synthesis while supporting six distinct Hakka dialects. This is achieved by training the model with dialect-specific data, allowing for the generation of speaker-aware Hakka speech. To address the scarcity of publicly available Hakka speech corpora, we employed a cost-effective approach utilizing a web scraping pipeline coupled with automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based data cleaning techniques. This process ensured the acquisition of a high-quality, multi-speaker, multi-dialect dataset suitable for TTS training. Subjective listening tests conducted using comparative mean opinion scores (CMOS) demonstrate that VoxHakka significantly outperforms existing publicly available Hakka TTS systems in terms of pronunciation accuracy, tone correctness, and overall naturalness. This work represents a significant advancement in Hakka language technology and provides a valuable resource for language preservation and revitalization efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riya Samanta, Bidyut Saha, Soumya K. Ghosh, Sajal K. Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) and their various derivatives are attractive for their ability to efficiently and flexibly create synthetic tabular data, showcasing strong performance and adaptability. However, there are certain critical limitations to such models. The first is their inability to preserve the semantic integrity of contextually correlated words or phrases. For instance, skillset in freelancer profiles is one such attribute where individual skills are semantically interconnected and indicative of specific domain interests or qualifications. The second challenge of traditional approaches is that, when applied to generate contextually correlated tabular content, besides generating semantically shallow content, they consume huge memory resources and CPU time during the training stage. To address these problems, we introduce a novel framework, CTGKrEW (Conditional Tabular GAN with KMeans Clustering and Word Embedding), which is adept at generating realistic synthetic tabular data where attributes are collections of semantically and contextually coherent words. CTGKrEW is trained and evaluated using a dataset from Upwork, a realworld freelancing platform. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to analyze the variability, contextual similarity, frequency distribution, and associativity of the generated data, along with testing the framework's system feasibility. CTGKrEW also takes around 99\% less CPU time and 33\% less memory footprints than the conventional approach. Furthermore, we developed KrEW, a web application to facilitate the generation of realistic data containing skill-related information. This application, available at https://riyasamanta.github.io/krew.html, is freely accessible to both the general public and the research community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ada-Astrid Balauca, Danda Pani Paudel, Kristina Toutanova, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: CLIP is a powerful and widely used tool for understanding images in the context of natural language descriptions to perform nuanced tasks. However, it does not offer application-specific fine-grained and structured understanding, due to its generic nature. In this work, we aim to adapt CLIP for fine-grained and structured -- in the form of tabular data -- visual understanding of museum exhibits. To facilitate such understanding we (a) collect, curate, and benchmark a dataset of 200K+ image-table pairs, and (b) develop a method that allows predicting tabular outputs for input images. Our dataset is the first of its kind in the public domain. At the same time, the proposed method is novel in leveraging CLIP's powerful representations for fine-grained and tabular understanding. The proposed method (MUZE) learns to map CLIP's image embeddings to the tabular structure by means of a proposed transformer-based parsing network (parseNet). More specifically, parseNet enables prediction of missing attribute values while integrating context from known attribute-value pairs for an input image. We show that this leads to significant improvement in accuracy. Through exhaustive experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method on fine-grained and structured understanding of museum exhibits, by achieving encouraging results in a newly established benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiromu Yakura, Ezequiel Lopez-Lopez, Levin Brinkmann, Ignacio Serna, Prateek Gupta, Iyad Rahwan</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents now interact with billions of humans in natural language, thanks to advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This raises the question of whether AI has the potential to shape a fundamental aspect of human culture: the way we speak. Recent analyses revealed that scientific publications already exhibit evidence of AI-specific language. But this evidence is inconclusive, since scientists may simply be using AI to copy-edit their writing. To explore whether AI has influenced human spoken communication, we transcribed and analyzed about 280,000 English-language videos of presentations, talks, and speeches from more than 20,000 YouTube channels of academic institutions. We find a significant shift in the trend of word usage specific to words distinctively associated with ChatGPT following its release. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that humans increasingly imitate LLMs in their spoken language. Our results raise societal and policy-relevant concerns about the potential of AI to unintentionally reduce linguistic diversity, or to be deliberately misused for mass manipulation. They also highlight the need for further investigation into the feedback loops between machine behavior and human culture.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce FC-KAN, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that leverages combinations of popular mathematical functions such as B-splines, wavelets, and radial basis functions on low-dimensional data through element-wise operations. We explore several methods for combining the outputs of these functions, including sum, element-wise product, the addition of sum and element-wise product, quadratic function representation, and concatenation. In our experiments, we compare FC-KAN with multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and other existing KANs, such as BSRBF-KAN, EfficientKAN, FastKAN, and FasterKAN, on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. A variant of FC-KAN, which uses a combination of outputs from B-splines and Difference of Gaussians (DoG) in the form of a quadratic function, outperformed all other models on the average of 5 independent training runs. We expect that FC-KAN can leverage function combinations to design future KANs. Our repository is publicly available at: https://github.com/hoangthangta/FC_KAN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective planning is essential for the success of any task, from organizing a vacation to routing autonomous vehicles and developing corporate strategies. It involves setting goals, formulating plans, and allocating resources to achieve them. LLMs are particularly well-suited for automated planning due to their strong capabilities in commonsense reasoning. They can deduce a sequence of actions needed to achieve a goal from a given state and identify an effective course of action. However, it is frequently observed that plans generated through direct prompting often fail upon execution. Our survey aims to highlight the existing challenges in planning with language models, focusing on key areas such as embodied environments, optimal scheduling, competitive and cooperative games, task decomposition, reasoning, and planning. Through this study, we explore how LLMs transform AI planning and provide unique insights into the future of LM-assisted planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumitri Chattopadhyay, Sanket Biswas, Emanuele Vivoli, Josep Llad\'os</p>
<p>Abstract: Although foundational vision-language models (VLMs) have proven to be very successful for various semantic discrimination tasks, they still struggle to perform faithfully for fine-grained categorization. Moreover, foundational models trained on one domain do not generalize well on a different domain without fine-tuning. We attribute these to the limitations of the VLM's semantic representations and attempt to improve their fine-grained visual awareness using generative modeling. Specifically, we propose two novel methods: Generative Class Prompt Learning (GCPL) and Contrastive Multi-class Prompt Learning (CoMPLe). Utilizing text-to-image diffusion models, GCPL significantly improves the visio-linguistic synergy in class embeddings by conditioning on few-shot exemplars with learnable class prompts. CoMPLe builds on this foundation by introducing a contrastive learning component that encourages inter-class separation during the generative optimization process. Our empirical results demonstrate that such a generative class prompt learning approach substantially outperform existing methods, offering a better alternative to few shot image recognition challenges.

Our evaluation on 400 human-validated questions shows that current vanilla LLMs are less reliable than retrieval augmented generation from music dictionaries.

<p>Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient approach for capturing sign language in 3D, introduce the 3D-LEX v1.0 dataset, and detail a method for semi-automatic annotation of phonetic properties. Our procedure integrates three motion capture techniques encompassing high-resolution 3D poses, 3D handshapes, and depth-aware facial features, and attains an average sampling rate of one sign every 10 seconds. This includes the time for presenting a sign example, performing and recording the sign, and archiving the capture. The 3D-LEX dataset includes 1,000 signs from American Sign Language and an additional 1,000 signs from the Sign Language of the Netherlands. We showcase the dataset utility by presenting a simple method for generating handshape annotations directly from 3D-LEX. We produce handshape labels for 1,000 signs from American Sign Language and evaluate the labels in a sign recognition task. The labels enhance gloss recognition accuracy by 5% over using no handshape annotations, and by 1% over expert annotations. Our motion capture data supports in-depth analysis of sign features and facilitates the generation of 2D projections from any viewpoint. The 3D-LEX collection has been aligned with existing sign language benchmarks and linguistic resources, to support studies in 3D-aware sign language processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversation disentanglement aims to group utterances into detached sessions, which is a fundamental task in processing multi-party conversations. Existing methods have two main drawbacks. First, they overemphasize pairwise utterance relations but pay inadequate attention to the utterance-to-context relation modeling. Second, huge amount of human annotated data is required for training, which is expensive to obtain in practice. To address these issues, we propose a general disentangle model based on bi-level contrastive learning. It brings closer utterances in the same session while encourages each utterance to be near its clustered session prototypes in the representation space. Unlike existing approaches, our disentangle model works in both supervised setting with labeled data and unsupervised setting when no such data is available. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both settings across several public datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vil\'em Zouhar, Clara Meister, Juan Luis Gastaldi, Li Du, Tim Vieira, Mrinmaya Sachan, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is a popular algorithm used for tokenizing data in NLP, despite being devised initially as a compression method. BPE appears to be a greedy algorithm at face value, but the underlying optimization problem that BPE seeks to solve has not yet been laid down. We formalize BPE as a combinatorial optimization problem. Via submodular functions, we prove that the iterative greedy version is a $\frac{1}{{\sigma(\boldsymbol{\mu}^\star)}}(1-e^{-{\sigma(\boldsymbol{\mu}^\star)}})$-approximation of an optimal merge sequence, where ${\sigma(\boldsymbol{\mu}^\star)}$ is the total backward curvature with respect to the optimal merge sequence $\boldsymbol{\mu}^\star$. Empirically the lower bound of the approximation is $\approx 0.37$.
  We provide a faster implementation of BPE which improves the runtime complexity from $\mathcal{O}\left(N M\right)$ to $\mathcal{O}\left(N \log M\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length and $M$ is the merge count. Finally, we optimize the brute-force algorithm for optimal BPE using memoization.</p>

<p>Abstract: We conduct a quantitative analysis contrasting human-written English news text with comparable large language model (LLM) output from six different LLMs that cover three different families and four sizes in total. Our analysis spans several measurable linguistic dimensions, including morphological, syntactic, psychometric, and sociolinguistic aspects. The results reveal various measurable differences between human and AI-generated texts. Human texts exhibit more scattered sentence length distributions, more variety of vocabulary, a distinct use of dependency and constituent types, shorter constituents, and more optimized dependency distances. Humans tend to exhibit stronger negative emotions (such as fear and disgust) and less joy compared to text generated by LLMs, with the toxicity of these models increasing as their size grows. LLM outputs use more numbers, symbols and auxiliaries (suggesting objective language) than human texts, as well as more pronouns. The sexist bias prevalent in human text is also expressed by LLMs, and even magnified in all of them but one. Differences between LLMs and humans are larger than between LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, but gathering high-quality preference labels is expensive. RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced in Bai et al., offers a promising alternative that trains the reward model (RM) on preferences generated by an off-the-shelf LLM. Across the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and harmless dialogue generation, we show that RLAIF achieves comparable performance to RLHF. Furthermore, we take a step towards "self-improvement" by demonstrating that RLAIF can outperform a supervised fine-tuned baseline even when the AI labeler is the same size as the policy, or even the exact same checkpoint as the initial policy. Finally, we introduce direct-RLAIF (d-RLAIF) - a technique that circumvents RM training by obtaining rewards directly from an off-the-shelf LLM during RL, which achieves superior performance to canonical RLAIF. Our results suggest that RLAIF can achieve performance on-par with using human feedback, offering a potential solution to the scalability limitations of RLHF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pawe{\l} Niszczota, Sami Abbas</p>
<p>Abstract: We assess the ability of GPT -- a large language model -- to serve as a financial robo-advisor for the masses, by using a financial literacy test. Davinci and ChatGPT based on GPT-3.5 score 66% and 65% on the financial literacy test, respectively, compared to a baseline of 33%. However, ChatGPT based on GPT-4 achieves a near-perfect 99% score, pointing to financial literacy becoming an emergent ability of state-of-the-art models. We use the Judge-Advisor System and a savings dilemma to illustrate how researchers might assess advice-utilization from large language models. We also present a number of directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyu Mao, Xiaohan Wang, Mengru Wang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative task focused on editing the personality traits of Large Language Models (LLMs). This task seeks to adjust the models' responses to opinion-related questions on specified topics since an individual's personality often manifests in the form of their expressed opinions, thereby showcasing different personality traits. Specifically, we construct PersonalityEdit, a new benchmark dataset to address this task. Drawing on the theory in Social Psychology, we isolate three representative traits, namely Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, as the foundation for our benchmark. We then gather data using GPT-4, generating responses that align with a specified topic and embody the targeted personality trait. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving various baselines and discuss the representation of personality behavior in LLMs. Our findings uncover potential challenges of the proposed task, illustrating several remaining issues. We anticipate that our work can stimulate further annotation in model editing and personality-related research. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the context of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing education, LLM-as-a-tutor can assist students by providing real-time feedback on their essays. However, challenges arise in assessing LLM-as-a-tutor due to differing standards between educational and general use cases. To bridge this gap, we integrate pedagogical principles to assess student-LLM interaction. First, we explore how LLMs can function as English tutors, providing effective essay feedback tailored to students. Second, we propose three metrics to evaluate LLM-as-a-tutor specifically designed for EFL writing education, emphasizing pedagogical aspects. In this process, EFL experts evaluate the feedback from LLM-as-a-tutor regarding quality and characteristics. On the other hand, EFL learners assess their learning outcomes from interaction with LLM-as-a-tutor. This approach lays the groundwork for developing LLMs-as-a-tutor tailored to the needs of EFL learners, advancing the effectiveness of writing education in this context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Zhou, Antonia Karamolegkou, Wenyu Chen, Daniel Hershcovich</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of language technology necessitates a shift towards considering cultural diversity in the machine learning realm, particularly for subjective tasks that rely heavily on cultural nuances, such as Offensive Language Detection (OLD). Current understanding underscores that these tasks are substantially influenced by cultural values, however, a notable gap exists in determining if cultural features can accurately predict the success of cross-cultural transfer learning for such subjective tasks. Addressing this, our study delves into the intersection of cultural features and transfer learning effectiveness. The findings reveal that cultural value surveys indeed possess a predictive power for cross-cultural transfer learning success in OLD tasks and that it can be further improved using offensive word distance. Based on these results, we advocate for the integration of cultural information into datasets. Additionally, we recommend leveraging data sources rich in cultural information, such as surveys, to enhance cultural adaptability. Our research signifies a step forward in the quest for more inclusive, culturally sensitive language technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Brinkmann, Roee Shraga, Christian Bizer</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to facilitate features such as faceted product search and product comparison, e-commerce platforms require accurately structured product data, including precise attribute/value pairs. Vendors often times provide unstructured product descriptions consisting only of an offer title and a textual description. Consequently, extracting attribute values from titles and descriptions is vital for e-commerce platforms. State-of-the-art attribute value extraction methods based on pre-trained language models, such as BERT, face two drawbacks (i) the methods require significant amounts of task-specific training data and (ii) the fine-tuned models have problems with generalising to unseen attribute values that were not part of the training data. This paper explores the potential of using large language models as a more training data-efficient and more robust alternative to existing AVE methods. We propose prompt templates for describing the target attributes of the extraction to the LLM, covering both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. In the zero-shot scenario, textual and JSON-based target schema representations of the attributes are compared. In the few-shot scenario, we investigate (i) the provision of example attribute values, (ii) the selection of in-context demonstrations, (iii) shuffled ensembling to prevent position bias, and (iv) fine-tuning the LLM. We evaluate the prompt templates in combination with hosted LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and open-source LLMs which can be run locally. We compare the performance of the LLMs to the PLM-based methods SU-OpenTag, AVEQA, and MAVEQA. The highest average F1-score of 86% was achieved by GPT-4. Llama-3-70B performs only 3% worse than GPT-4, making it a competitive open-source alternative. Given the same training data, this prompt/GPT-4 combination outperforms the best PLM baseline by an average of 6% F1-score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Hu, Hou Pong Chan, Yu Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Argument generation is a challenging task in natural language processing, which requires rigorous reasoning and proper content organization. Inspired by recent chain-of-thought prompting that breaks down a complex task into intermediate steps, we propose Americano, a novel framework with agent interaction for argument generation. Our approach decomposes the generation process into sequential actions grounded on argumentation theory, which first executes actions sequentially to generate argumentative discourse components, and then produces a final argument conditioned on the components. To further mimic the human writing process and improve the left-to-right generation paradigm of current autoregressive language models, we introduce an argument refinement module which automatically evaluates and refines argument drafts based on feedback received. We evaluate our framework on the task of counterargument generation using a subset of Reddit/CMV dataset. The results show that our method outperforms both end-to-end and chain-of-thought prompting methods and can generate more coherent and persuasive arguments with diverse and rich contents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navreet Kaur, Monojit Choudhury, Danish Pruthi</p>
<p>Abstract: As corporations rush to integrate large language models (LLMs) to their search offerings, it is critical that they provide factually accurate information that is robust to any presuppositions that a user may express. In this work, we introduce UPHILL, a dataset consisting of health-related queries with varying degrees of presuppositions. Using UPHILL, we evaluate the factual accuracy and consistency of InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and BingChat models. We find that while model responses rarely disagree with true health claims (posed as questions), they often fail to challenge false claims: responses from InstructGPT agree with 32% of the false claims, ChatGPT 26% and BingChat 23%. As we increase the extent of presupposition in input queries, the responses from InstructGPT and ChatGPT agree with the claim considerably more often, regardless of its veracity. Responses from BingChat, which rely on retrieved webpages, are not as susceptible. Given the moderate factual accuracy, and the inability of models to consistently correct false assumptions, our work calls for a careful assessment of current LLMs for use in high-stakes scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Ai, Yuntao Shou, Tao Meng, Nan Yin, Keqin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the continuous development of deep learning (DL), the task of multimodal dialogue emotion recognition (MDER) has recently received extensive research attention, which is also an essential branch of DL. The MDER aims to identify the emotional information contained in different modalities, e.g., text, video, and audio, in different dialogue scenes. However, existing research has focused on modeling contextual semantic information and dialogue relations between speakers while ignoring the impact of event relations on emotion. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel Dialogue and Event Relation-Aware Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Multimodal Emotion Recognition (DER-GCN) method. It models dialogue relations between speakers and captures latent event relations information. Specifically, we construct a weighted multi-relationship graph to simultaneously capture the dependencies between speakers and event relations in a dialogue. Moreover, we also introduce a Self-Supervised Masked Graph Autoencoder (SMGAE) to improve the fusion representation ability of features and structures. Next, we design a new Multiple Information Transformer (MIT) to capture the correlation between different relations, which can provide a better fuse of the multivariate information between relations. Finally, we propose a loss optimization strategy based on contrastive learning to enhance the representation learning ability of minority class features. We conduct extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD benchmark datasets, which verify the effectiveness of the DER-GCN model. The results demonstrate that our model significantly improves both the average accuracy and the f1 value of emotion recognition.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper offers a fresh look at the pumping lemma constant as an upper bound on the information required for learning Context Free Grammars. An objective function based on indirect negative evidence considers the occurrences, and non-occurrences, of a finite number of strings, encountered after a sufficiently long presentation. This function has optimal substructure in the hypotheses space, giving rise to a greedy search learner in a branch and bound method. A hierarchy of learnable classes is defined in terms of the number of production rules that must be added to interim solutions in order to incrementally fit the input. Efficiency strongly depends on the position of the target grammar in the hierarchy and on the richness of the input.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntao Shou, Tao Meng, Wei Ai, Nan Yin, Keqin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the release of increasing open-source emotion recognition datasets on social media platforms and the rapid development of computing resources, multimodal emotion recognition tasks (MER) have begun to receive widespread research attention. The MER task extracts and fuses complementary semantic information from different modalities, which can classify the speaker's emotions. However, the existing feature fusion methods have usually mapped the features of different modalities into the same feature space for information fusion, which can not eliminate the heterogeneity between different modalities. Therefore, it is challenging to make the subsequent emotion class boundary learning. To tackle the above problems, we have proposed a novel Adversarial Representation with Intra-Modal and Inter-Modal Graph Contrastive for Multimodal Emotion Recognition (AR-IIGCN) method. Firstly, we input video, audio, and text features into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to map them into separate feature spaces. Secondly, we build a generator and a discriminator for the three modal features through adversarial representation, which can achieve information interaction between modalities and eliminate heterogeneity among modalities. Thirdly, we introduce contrastive graph representation learning to capture intra-modal and inter-modal complementary semantic information and learn intra-class and inter-class boundary information of emotion categories. Specifically, we construct a graph structure for three modal features and perform contrastive representation learning on nodes with different emotions in the same modality and the same emotion in different modalities, which can improve the feature representation ability of nodes. Extensive experimental works show that the ARL-IIGCN method can significantly improve emotion recognition accuracy on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Jongwon Han, Diana Gomez, Avi Alok, Chaojing Duan, Michael A. Rosenberg, Douglas Weber, Emerson Liu, Ding Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the irregular electrical activity of atrial fibrillation (AFib) has been a key challenge in electrocardiography. For serious cases of AFib, catheter ablations are performed to collect intracardiac electrograms (EGMs). EGMs offer intricately detailed and localized electrical activity of the heart and are an ideal modality for interpretable cardiac studies. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) has allowed some works to utilize deep learning frameworks to interpret EGMs during AFib. Additionally, language models (LMs) have shown exceptional performance in being able to generalize to unseen domains, especially in healthcare. In this study, we are the first to leverage pretrained LMs for finetuning of EGM interpolation and AFib classification via masked language modeling. We formulate the EGM as a textual sequence and present competitive performances on AFib classification compared against other representations. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive interpretability study to provide a multi-perspective intuition of the model's behavior, which could greatly benefit the clinical use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyu Huang, Zeqiu Wu, Yushi Hu, Wenya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven useful in answering user queries, they are prone to hallucination, and their responses often lack credibility due to missing references to reliable sources. An intuitive solution to these issues would be to include in-text citations referring to external documents as evidence. While previous works have directly prompted LLMs to generate in-text citations, their performances are far from satisfactory, especially when it comes to smaller LLMs. In this work, we propose an effective training framework using fine-grained rewards to teach LLMs to generate highly supportive and relevant citations, while ensuring the correctness of their responses. We also conduct a systematic analysis of applying these fine-grained rewards to common LLM training strategies, demonstrating its advantage over conventional practices. We conduct extensive experiments on Question Answering (QA) datasets taken from the ALCE benchmark and validate the model's generalizability using EXPERTQA. On LLaMA-2-7B, the incorporation of fine-grained rewards achieves the best performance among the baselines, even surpassing that of GPT-3.5-turbo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Myung Gyo Oh, Hong Eun Ahn, Leo Hyun Park, Taekyoung Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural language models (LMs) are vulnerable to training data extraction attacks due to data memorization. This paper introduces a novel attack scenario wherein an attacker adversarially fine-tunes pre-trained LMs to amplify the exposure of the original training data. This strategy differs from prior studies by aiming to intensify the LM's retention of its pre-training dataset. To achieve this, the attacker needs to collect generated texts that are closely aligned with the pre-training data. However, without knowledge of the actual dataset, quantifying the amount of pre-training data within generated texts is challenging. To address this, we propose the use of pseudo-labels for these generated texts, leveraging membership approximations indicated by machine-generated probabilities from the target LM. We subsequently fine-tune the LM to favor generations with higher likelihoods of originating from the pre-training data, based on their membership probabilities. Our empirical findings indicate a remarkable outcome: LMs with over 1B parameters exhibit a four to eight-fold increase in training data exposure. We discuss potential mitigations and suggest future research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social media platforms are hubs for multimodal information exchange, encompassing text, images, and videos, making it challenging for machines to comprehend the information or emotions associated with interactions in online spaces. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, yet they struggle to accurately interpret human emotions and complex content such as misinformation. This paper introduces MM-Soc, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-Soc compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks. However, MLLMs demonstrate performance improvements post fine-tuning, suggesting potential pathways for improvement. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/claws-lab/MMSoc.git.</p>

Using 84,875 pre-operative notes and its associated surgical cases from 2018 to 2021, we examine the performance of LLMs in predicting six postoperative risks using various fine-tuning strategies. Pretrained LLMs outperformed traditional word embeddings by an absolute AUROC of 38.3% and AUPRC of 33.2%. Self-supervised fine-tuning further improved performance by 3.2% and 1.5%. Incorporating labels into training further increased AUROC by 1.8% and AUPRC by 2%. The highest performance was achieved with a unified foundation model, with improvements of 3.6% for AUROC and 2.6% for AUPRC compared to self-supervision, highlighting the foundational capabilities of LLMs in predicting postoperative risks, which could be potentially beneficial when deployed for perioperative care</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Qian, Jie Zhang, Wei Yao, Dongrui Liu, Zhenfei Yin, Yu Qiao, Yong Liu, Jing Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) is crucial. Most studies concentrate on fully pre-trained LLMs to better understand and improve LLMs' trustworthiness. In this paper, to reveal the untapped potential of pre-training, we pioneer the exploration of LLMs' trustworthiness during this period, focusing on five key dimensions: reliability, privacy, toxicity, fairness, and robustness. To begin with, we apply linear probing to LLMs. The high probing accuracy suggests that \textit{LLMs in early pre-training can already distinguish concepts in each trustworthiness dimension}. Therefore, to further uncover the hidden possibilities of pre-training, we extract steering vectors from a LLM's pre-training checkpoints to enhance the LLM's trustworthiness. Finally, inspired by~\citet{choi2023understanding} that mutual information estimation is bounded by linear probing accuracy, we also probe LLMs with mutual information to investigate the dynamics of trustworthiness during pre-training. We are the first to observe a similar two-phase phenomenon: fitting and compression~\citep{shwartz2017opening}. This research provides an initial exploration of trustworthiness modeling during LLM pre-training, seeking to unveil new insights and spur further developments in the field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Scir\`e, Karim Ghonim, Roberto Navigli</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text summarization, particularly with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown remarkable performance. However, a notable challenge persists as a substantial number of automatically-generated summaries exhibit factual inconsistencies, such as hallucinations. In response to this issue, various approaches for the evaluation of consistency for summarization have emerged. Yet, these newly-introduced metrics face several limitations, including lack of interpretability, focus on short document summaries (e.g., news articles), and computational impracticality, especially for LLM-based metrics. To address these shortcomings, we propose Factuality Evaluation of summarization based on Natural language Inference and Claim Extraction (FENICE), a more interpretable and efficient factuality-oriented metric. FENICE leverages an NLI-based alignment between information in the source document and a set of atomic facts, referred to as claims, extracted from the summary. Our metric sets a new state of the art on AGGREFACT, the de-facto benchmark for factuality evaluation. Moreover, we extend our evaluation to a more challenging setting by conducting a human annotation process of long-form summarization. In the hope of fostering research in summarization factuality evaluation, we release the code of our metric and our factuality annotations of long-form summarization at https://github.com/Babelscape/FENICE.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI, such as large language models, has undergone rapid development within recent years. As these models become increasingly available to the public, concerns arise about perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases in applications. Gender stereotypes can be harmful and limiting for the individuals they target, whether they consist of misrepresentation or discrimination. Recognizing gender bias as a pervasive societal construct, this paper studies how to uncover and quantify the presence of gender biases in generative language models. In particular, we derive generative AI analogues of three well-known non-discrimination criteria from classification, namely independence, separation and sufficiency. To demonstrate these criteria in action, we design prompts for each of the criteria with a focus on occupational gender stereotype, specifically utilizing the medical test to introduce the ground truth in the generative AI context. Our results address the presence of occupational gender bias within such conversational language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Zhou, Ashish Sharma, Amy X. Zhang, Tim Althoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world misinformation, often multimodal, can be partially or fully factual but misleading using diverse tactics like conflating correlation with causation. Such misinformation is severely understudied, challenging to address, and harms various social domains, particularly on social media, where it can spread rapidly. High-quality and timely correction of misinformation that identifies and explains its (in)accuracies effectively reduces false beliefs. Despite the wide acceptance of manual correction, it is difficult to be timely and scalable. While LLMs have versatile capabilities that could accelerate misinformation correction, they struggle due to a lack of recent information, a tendency to produce false content, and limitations in addressing multimodal information. We propose MUSE, an LLM augmented with access to and credibility evaluation of up-to-date information. By retrieving evidence as refutations or supporting context, MUSE identifies and explains content (in)accuracies with references. It conducts multimodal retrieval and interprets visual content to verify and correct multimodal content. Given the absence of a comprehensive evaluation approach, we propose 13 dimensions of misinformation correction quality. Then, fact-checking experts evaluate responses to social media content that are not presupposed to be misinformation but broadly include (partially) incorrect and correct posts that may (not) be misleading. Results demonstrate MUSE's ability to write high-quality responses to potential misinformation--across modalities, tactics, domains, political leanings, and for information that has not previously been fact-checked online--within minutes of its appearance on social media. Overall, MUSE outperforms GPT-4 by 37% and even high-quality responses from laypeople by 29%. Our work provides a general methodological and evaluative framework to correct misinformation at scale.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, showcasing impressive performance across various tasks.Despite the significant advancements in LLMs, their effective operation still relies heavily on human input to accurately guide the dialogue flow, with agent tuning being a crucial optimization technique that involves human adjustments to the model for better response to such guidance.Addressing this dependency, our work introduces the TinyAgent model, trained on a meticulously curated high-quality dataset. We also present the Collaborative Multi-Agent Tuning (CMAT) framework, an innovative system designed to augment language agent capabilities through adaptive weight updates based on environmental feedback. This framework fosters collaborative learning and real-time adaptation among multiple intelligent agents, enhancing their context-awareness and long-term memory. In this research, we propose a new communication agent framework that integrates multi-agent systems with environmental feedback mechanisms, offering a scalable method to explore cooperative behaviors. Notably, our TinyAgent-7B model exhibits performance on par with GPT-3.5, despite having fewer parameters, signifying a substantial improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Zhang, Junli Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: ICD(International Classification of Diseases) coding involves assigning ICD codes to patients visit based on their medical notes. ICD coding is a challenging multilabel text classification problem due to noisy medical document inputs. Recent advancements in automated ICD coding have enhanced performance by integrating additional data and knowledge bases with the encoding of medical notes and codes. However, most of them ignore the code hierarchy, leading to improper code assignments. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework based on associated and hierarchical code description distillation (AHDD) for better code representation learning and avoidance of improper code assignment.we utilize the code description and the hierarchical structure inherent to the ICD codes. Therefore, in this paper, we leverage the code description and the hierarchical structure inherent to the ICD codes. The code description is also applied to aware the attention layer and output layer. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset show the superiority of the proposed framework over several state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Bittar, Philip N. Garner</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding cognitive processes in the brain demands sophisticated models capable of replicating neural dynamics at large scales. We present a physiologically inspired speech recognition architecture, compatible and scalable with deep learning frameworks, and demonstrate that end-to-end gradient descent training leads to the emergence of neural oscillations in the central spiking neural network. Significant cross-frequency couplings, indicative of these oscillations, are measured within and across network layers during speech processing, whereas no such interactions are observed when handling background noise inputs. Furthermore, our findings highlight the crucial inhibitory role of feedback mechanisms, such as spike frequency adaptation and recurrent connections, in regulating and synchronising neural activity to improve recognition performance. Overall, on top of developing our understanding of synchronisation phenomena notably observed in the human auditory pathway, our architecture exhibits dynamic and efficient information processing, with relevance to neuromorphic technology.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce phi-3-mini, a 3.8 billion parameter language model trained on 3.3 trillion tokens, whose overall performance, as measured by both academic benchmarks and internal testing, rivals that of models such as Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 (e.g., phi-3-mini achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench), despite being small enough to be deployed on a phone. Our training dataset is a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, composed of heavily filtered publicly available web data and synthetic data. The model is also further aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format. We also provide parameter-scaling results with a 7B, 14B models trained for 4.8T tokens, called phi-3-small, phi-3-medium, both significantly more capable than phi-3-mini (e.g., respectively 75%, 78% on MMLU, and 8.7, 8.9 on MT-bench). To enhance multilingual, multimodal, and long-context capabilities, we introduce three models in the phi-3.5 series: phi-3.5-mini, phi-3.5-MoE, and phi-3.5-Vision. The phi-3.5-MoE, a 16 x 3.8B MoE model with 6.6 billion active parameters, achieves superior performance in language reasoning, math, and code tasks compared to other open-source models of similar scale, such as Llama 3.1 and the Mixtral series, and on par with Gemini-1.5-Flash and GPT-4o-mini. Meanwhile, phi-3.5-Vision, a 4.2 billion parameter model derived from phi-3.5-mini, excels in reasoning tasks and is adept at handling both single-image and text prompts, as well as multi-image and text prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities on specific tasks with human-written instruction data. However, the limited quantity, diversity, and professional expertise of such instruction data raise concerns about the performance of LLMs in psychotherapy tasks when provided with domain-specific instructions. To address this, we firstly propose Domain-Specific Assistant Instructions based on AlexanderStreet therapy, and secondly, we use an adaption fine-tuning method and retrieval augmented generation method to improve pre-trained LLMs. Through quantitative evaluation of linguistic quality using automatic and human evaluation, we observe that pre-trained LLMs on Psychotherapy Assistant Instructions outperform state-of-the-art LLMs response baselines. Our Assistant-Instruction approach offers a half-annotation method to align pre-trained LLMs with instructions and provide pre-trained LLMs with more psychotherapy knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and preferences is essential for making them helpful and safe. However, building efficient tools to perform alignment can be challenging, especially for the largest and most competent LLMs which often contain tens or hundreds of billions of parameters. We create NeMo-Aligner, a toolkit for model alignment that can efficiently scale to a thousand GPUs for training the largest open-source LLMs such as Nemotron 4 340B and Llama 3.1 405B. NeMo-Aligner comes with highly optimized and scalable implementations for major paradigms of model alignment such as: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SteerLM, and Self-Play Fine-Tuning (SPIN). Additionally, our toolkit supports running most of the alignment techniques in a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) setting. NeMo-Aligner is designed for extensibility, allowing support for other alignment techniques with minimal effort. It is open-sourced with Apache 2.0 License and we invite community contributions at https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner</p>

<p>Abstract: People communicate in more than 7,000 languages around the world, with around 780 languages spoken in India alone. Despite this linguistic diversity, research on Sentiment Analysis has predominantly focused on English text data, resulting in a disproportionate availability of sentiment resources for English. This paper examines the performance of transformer models in Sentiment Analysis tasks across multilingual datasets and text that has undergone machine translation. By comparing the effectiveness of these models in different linguistic contexts, we gain insights into their performance variations and potential implications for sentiment analysis across diverse languages. We also discuss the shortcomings and potential for future work towards the end.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ana Brassard, Benjamin Heinzerling, Keito Kudo, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Kentaro Inui</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the quality of free-text explanations is a multifaceted, subjective, and labor-intensive task. Large language models (LLMs) present an appealing alternative due to their potential for consistency, scalability, and cost-efficiency. In this work, we present ACORN, a new dataset of 3,500 free-text explanations and aspect-wise quality ratings, and use it to evaluate how LLMs rate explanations. We observed that larger models outputted labels that maintained or increased the inter-annotator agreement, suggesting that they are within the expected variance between human raters. However, their correlation with majority-voted human ratings varied across different quality aspects, indicating that they are not a complete replacement. In turn, using LLMs as a supplement to a smaller group of human raters in some cases improved the correlation with the original majority labels. However, the effect was limited to cases where human raters were scarce, and an additional human rater had a more pronounced effect in all cases. Overall, we recommend against using LLMs as a complete replacement for human raters but encourage using them in configurations that end with targeted human involvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Lu, Shengwei Xu, Yichi Zhang, Yuqing Kong, Grant Schoenebeck</p>
<p>Abstract: Peer prediction mechanisms motivate high-quality feedback with provable guarantees. However, current methods only apply to rather simple reports, like multiple-choice or scalar numbers. We aim to broaden these techniques to the larger domain of text-based reports, drawing on the recent developments in large language models. This vastly increases the applicability of peer prediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety of feedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments on social media.
  We introduce two mechanisms, the Generative Peer Prediction Mechanism (GPPM) and the Generative Synopsis Peer Prediction Mechanism (GSPPM). These mechanisms utilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction of her peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction is sufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort and truth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, we confirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on two real datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset. We highlight the results that on the ICLR dataset, our mechanisms can differentiate three quality levels -- human-written reviews, GPT-4-generated reviews, and GPT-3.5-generated reviews in terms of expected scores. Additionally, GSPPM penalizes LLM-generated reviews more effectively than GPPM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aparna Elangovan, Ling Liu, Lei Xu, Sravan Bodapati, Dan Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: In this position paper, we argue that human evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs) should be a multidisciplinary undertaking that draws upon insights from disciplines such as user experience research and human behavioral psychology to ensure that the experimental design and results are reliable. The conclusions from these evaluations, thus, must consider factors such as usability, aesthetics, and cognitive biases. We highlight how cognitive biases can conflate fluent information and truthfulness, and how cognitive uncertainty affects the reliability of rating scores such as Likert. Furthermore, the evaluation should differentiate the capabilities and weaknesses of increasingly powerful large language models -- which requires effective test sets. The scalability of human evaluation is also crucial to wider adoption. Hence, to design an effective human evaluation system in the age of generative NLP, we propose the ConSiDERS-The-Human evaluation framework consisting of 6 pillars -- Consistency, Scoring Criteria, Differentiating, User Experience, Responsible, and Scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Cagnetta, Matthieu Wyart</p>
<p>Abstract: How much data is required to learn the structure of a language via next-token prediction? We study this question for synthetic datasets generated via a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) -- a tree-like generative model that captures many of the hierarchical structures found in natural languages. We determine token-token correlations analytically in our model and show that they can be used to build a representation of the grammar's hidden variables, the longer the range the deeper the variable. In addition, a finite training set limits the resolution of correlations to an effective range, whose size grows with that of the training set. As a result, a Language Model trained with increasingly many examples can build a deeper representation of the grammar's structure, thus reaching good performance despite the high dimensionality of the problem. We conjecture that the relationship between training set size and effective range of correlations holds beyond our synthetic datasets. In particular, our conjecture predicts how the scaling law for the test loss behaviour with training set size depends on the length of the context window, which we confirm empirically in Shakespeare's plays and Wikipedia articles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Alignment is the most critical step in building large language models (LLMs) that meet human needs. With the rapid development of LLMs gradually surpassing human capabilities, traditional alignment methods based on human-annotation are increasingly unable to meet the scalability demands. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new sources of automated alignment signals and technical approaches. In this paper, we systematically review the recently emerging methods of automated alignment, attempting to explore how to achieve effective, scalable, automated alignment once the capabilities of LLMs exceed those of humans. Specifically, we categorize existing automated alignment methods into 4 major categories based on the sources of alignment signals and discuss the current status and potential development of each category. Additionally, we explore the underlying mechanisms that enable automated alignment and discuss the essential factors that make automated alignment technologies feasible and effective from the fundamental role of alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan Zhang, Sining Zhoubian, Ziniu Hu, Yisong Yue, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent methodologies in LLM self-training mostly rely on LLM generating responses and filtering those with correct output answers as training data. This approach often yields a low-quality fine-tuning training set (e.g., incorrect plans or intermediate reasoning). In this paper, we develop a reinforced self-training approach, called ReST-MCTS*, based on integrating process reward guidance with tree search MCTS* for collecting higher-quality reasoning traces as well as per-step value to train policy and reward models. ReST-MCTS* circumvents the per-step manual annotation typically used to train process rewards by tree-search-based reinforcement learning: Given oracle final correct answers, ReST-MCTS* is able to infer the correct process rewards by estimating the probability this step can help lead to the correct answer. These inferred rewards serve dual purposes: they act as value targets for further refining the process reward model and also facilitate the selection of high-quality traces for policy model self-training. We first show that the tree-search policy in ReST-MCTS* achieves higher accuracy compared with prior LLM reasoning baselines such as Best-of-N and Tree-of-Thought, within the same search budget. We then show that by using traces searched by this tree-search policy as training data, we can continuously enhance the three language models for multiple iterations, and outperform other self-training algorithms such as ReST$^\text{EM}$ and Self-Rewarding LM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaina Raza, Mizanur Rahman, Michael R. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced natural language processing (NLP) applications. Nevertheless, these models often inherit biases from their training data. Despite the availability of various datasets, most are limited to one or two NLP tasks (typically classification or evaluation) and lack comprehensive evaluations across a broader range of NLP tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the Bias Evaluations Across Domains (BEADs) dataset, designed to support a wide array of NLP tasks, including text classification, token classification, bias quantification, and benign language generation. A key focus of this paper is the gold label subset of BEADs, an important portion of the data verified by experts to ensure high reliability. BEADs provides data for both fine-tuning, including classification and language generation tasks, and for evaluating LLMs. Our findings indicate that BEADs effectively identifies numerous biases when fine-tuned on this dataset. It also reduces biases when used for fine-tuning language generation task, while preserving language quality. The results also reveal some prevalent demographic biases in LLMs when BEADs is used for evaluation in demographic task. The benchmarking results highlight the efficacy of fine-tuning LLMs for bias identification and the necessity of comprehensive bias evaluation. We make BEADs publicly available to promote more responsible AI development. The dataset can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/shainar/BEAD .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Osazuwa Ness, Katie Matton, Hayden Helm, Sheng Zhang, Junaid Bajwa, Carey E. Priebe, Eric Horvitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have achieved impressive performance on medical question-answering benchmarks. However, high benchmark accuracy does not imply that the performance generalizes to real-world clinical settings. Medical question-answering benchmarks rely on assumptions consistent with quantifying LLM performance but that may not hold in the open world of the clinic. Yet LLMs learn broad knowledge that can help the LLM generalize to practical conditions regardless of unrealistic assumptions in celebrated benchmarks. We seek to quantify how well LLM medical question-answering benchmark performance generalizes when benchmark assumptions are violated. Specifically, we present an adversarial method that we call MedFuzz (for medical fuzzing). MedFuzz attempts to modify benchmark questions in ways aimed at confounding the LLM. We demonstrate the approach by targeting strong assumptions about patient characteristics presented in the MedQA benchmark. Successful "attacks" modify a benchmark item in ways that would be unlikely to fool a medical expert but nonetheless "trick" the LLM into changing from a correct to an incorrect answer. Further, we present a permutation test technique that can ensure a successful attack is statistically significant. We show how to use performance on a "MedFuzzed" benchmark, as well as individual successful attacks. The methods show promise at providing insights into the ability of an LLM to operate robustly in more realistic settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Dugan, Donato Manuel Jimenez Beneto, Charlotte Loh, Zhuo Chen, Rumen Dangovski, Marin Solja\v{c}i\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in text generation and reasoning, Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges in accurately performing complex arithmetic operations. Language model systems often enable LLMs to generate code for arithmetic operations to achieve accurate calculations. However, this approach compromises speed and security, and fine-tuning risks the language model losing prior capabilities. We propose a framework that enables exact arithmetic in a single autoregressive step, providing faster, more secure, and more interpretable LLM systems with arithmetic capabilities. We use the hidden states of a LLM to control a symbolic architecture that performs arithmetic. Our implementation using Llama 3 with OccamNet as a symbolic model (OccamLlama) achieves 100\% accuracy on single arithmetic operations ($+,-,\times,\div,\sin{},\cos{},\log{},\exp{},\sqrt{}$), outperforming GPT 4o with and without a code interpreter. Furthermore, OccamLlama outperforms GPT 4o with and without a code interpreter on average across a range of mathematical problem solving benchmarks, demonstrating that OccamLLMs can excel in arithmetic tasks, even surpassing much larger models. We will make our code public shortly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naaman Tan, Josef Valvoda, Tianyu Liu, Anej Svete, Yanxia Qin, Kan Min-Yen, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: The relationship between the quality of a string, as judged by a human reader, and its probability, $p(\boldsymbol{y})$ under a language model undergirds the development of better language models. For example, many popular algorithms for sampling from a language model have been conceived with the goal of manipulating $p(\boldsymbol{y})$ to place higher probability on strings that humans deem of high quality. In this article, we examine the probability--quality relationship in language models explicitly aligned to human preferences, e.g., through reinforcement learning through human feedback. We show that, when sampling corpora from an aligned language model, there exists a trade-off between the strings' average reward and average log-likelihood under the prior language model, i.e., the same model before alignment with human preferences. We provide a formal treatment of this phenomenon and demonstrate how a choice of sampling adaptor allows for a selection of how much likelihood we exchange for the reward.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the profound development of large language models(LLMs), their safety concerns have garnered increasing attention. However, there is a scarcity of Chinese safety benchmarks for LLMs, and the existing safety taxonomies are inadequate, lacking comprehensive safety detection capabilities in authentic Chinese scenarios. In this work, we introduce CHiSafetyBench, a dedicated safety benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in identifying risky content and refusing answering risky questions in Chinese contexts. CHiSafetyBench incorporates a dataset that covers a hierarchical Chinese safety taxonomy consisting of 5 risk areas and 31 categories. This dataset comprises two types of tasks: multiple-choice questions and question-answering, evaluating LLMs from the perspectives of risk content identification and the ability to refuse answering risky questions respectively. Utilizing this benchmark, we validate the feasibility of automatic evaluation as a substitute for human evaluation and conduct comprehensive automatic safety assessments on mainstream Chinese LLMs. Our experiments reveal the varying performance of different models across various safety domains, indicating that all models possess considerable potential for improvement in Chinese safety capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingchen Li, Jiatan Huang, Jeremy Yeung, Anne Blaes, Steven Johnson, Hongfang Liu, Hua Xu, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ClinicalCamel 70B, Llama3-OpenBioLLM 70B have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide variety of medical NLP task.However, there still lacks a large language model (LLM) specifically designed for cancer domain. Moreover, these LLMs typically have billions of parameters, making them computationally expensive for healthcare systems.Thus, in this study, we propose CancerLLM, a model with 7 billion parameters and a Mistral-style architecture, pre-trained on 2,676,642 clinical notes and 515,524 pathology reports covering 17 cancer types, followed by fine-tuning on three cancer-relevant tasks, including cancer phenotypes extraction, and cancer diagnosis generation. Our evaluation demonstrated that CancerLLM achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other existing LLMs, with an average F1 score improvement of 7.61 %. Additionally, CancerLLM outperforms other models on two proposed robustness testbeds. This illustrates that CancerLLM can be effectively applied to clinical AI systems, enhancing clinical research and healthcare delivery in the field of cancer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liman Wang, Hanyang Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the role of cognitive biases in the decision-making processes of large language models (LLMs), challenging the conventional goal of eliminating all biases. We show that certain cognitive biases when properly balanced, can enhance decision-making efficiency through rational deviations and heuristic shortcuts. By introducing heuristic moderation and an abstention option, which allows LLMs to withhold responses when uncertain, we reduce error rates, improve decision accuracy, and optimize decision rates. Using the Balance Rigor and Utility (BRU) dataset, developed through expert collaboration, our findings demonstrate that targeted inspection of cognitive biases aligns LLM decisions more closely with human reasoning, enhancing reliability and suggesting strategies for future improvements. This approach offers a novel way to leverage cognitive biases to improve the practical utility of LLMs across various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Restrepo, Chenwei Wu, Constanza V\'asquez-Venegas, Jo\~ao Matos, Jack Gallifant, Leo Anthony Celi, Danielle S. Bitterman, Luis Filipe Nakayama</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has demonstrated substantial potential for enhancing clinical decision-making, administrative efficiency, and patient outcomes. However, the underrepresentation of diverse groups in the development and application of these models can perpetuate biases, leading to inequitable healthcare delivery. This paper presents a comprehensive scientometric analysis of LLM research for healthcare, including data from January 1, 2021, to July 1, 2024. By analyzing metadata from PubMed and Dimensions, including author affiliations, countries, and funding sources, we assess the diversity of contributors to LLM research. Our findings highlight significant gender and geographic disparities, with a predominance of male authors and contributions primarily from high-income countries (HICs). We introduce a novel journal diversity index based on Gini diversity to measure the inclusiveness of scientific publications. Our results underscore the necessity for greater representation in order to ensure the equitable application of LLMs in healthcare. We propose actionable strategies to enhance diversity and inclusivity in artificial intelligence research, with the ultimate goal of fostering a more inclusive and equitable future in healthcare innovation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Jiang, Xueguang Ma, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In traditional RAG framework, the basic retrieval units are normally short. The common retrievers like DPR normally work with 100-word Wikipedia paragraphs. Such a design forces the retriever to search over a large corpus to find the `needle' unit. In contrast, the readers only need to generate answers from the short retrieved units. The imbalanced `heavy' retriever and `light' reader design can lead to sub-optimal performance. The loss of contextual information in the short, chunked units may increase the likelihood of introducing hard negatives during the retrieval stage. Additionally, the reader might not fully leverage the capabilities of recent advancements in LLMs. In order to alleviate the imbalance, we propose a new framework LongRAG, consisting of a `long retriever' and a `long reader'. In the two Wikipedia-based datasets, NQ and HotpotQA, LongRAG processes the entire Wikipedia corpus into 4K-token units by grouping related documents. By increasing the unit size, we significantly reduce the total number of units. This greatly reduces the burden on the retriever, resulting in strong retrieval performance with only a few (less than 8) top units. Without requiring any training, LongRAG achieves an EM of 62.7% on NQ and 64.3% on HotpotQA, which are on par with the (fully-trained) SoTA model. Furthermore, we test on two non-Wikipedia-based datasets, Qasper and MultiFieldQA-en. LongRAG processes each individual document as a single (long) unit rather than chunking them into smaller units. By doing so, we achieve an F1 score of 25.9% on Qasper and 57.5% on MultiFieldQA-en. Our study offers insights into the future roadmap for combining RAG with long-context LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ujjwala Anantheswaran, Himanshu Gupta, Kevin Scaria, Shreyas Verma, Chitta Baral, Swaroop Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including solving math word problems (MWPs), but struggle with real-world problems containing irrelevant information. To address this, we propose a prompting framework that generates adversarial variants of MWPs by adding irrelevant variables. We introduce a dataset, ProbleMATHIC, containing both adversarial and non-adversarial MWPs. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are susceptible to distraction by numerical noise, resulting in an average relative performance drop of ~26% on adversarial MWPs. To mitigate this, we fine-tune LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral) on the adversarial samples from our dataset. Fine-tuning on adversarial training instances improves performance on adversarial MWPs by ~8%, indicating increased robustness to noise and better ability to identify relevant data for reasoning. Finally, to assess the generalizability of our prompting framework, we introduce GSM-8K-Adv, an adversarial variant of the GSM-8K benchmark. LLMs continue to struggle when faced with adversarial information, reducing performance by up to ~6%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Zhu, Shuochen Liu, Yu Yu, Bo Tang, Yibo Yan, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Tong Xu, Matthew B. Blaschko</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in generating coherent text, but they often struggle with context awareness, leading to inaccuracies in tasks requiring faithful adherence to provided information. We introduce FastMem, a novel method designed to enhance instruction fine-tuned LLMs' context awareness through fast memorization of the prompt. FastMem maximizes the likelihood of the prompt before inference by fine-tuning only the last Feed-Forward Network (FFN) module. This targeted approach ensures efficient optimization without overfitting, significantly improving the model's ability to comprehend and accurately follow the context. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains in reading comprehension, text summarization and adherence to output structures. For instance, FastMem improves the accuracy of Llama 3-8B-Inst on the NQ-SWAP dataset from 59.1% to 71.6%, and reduces the output structure failure rate of Qwen 1.5-4B-Chat from 34.9% to 25.5%. Extensive experimental results highlight FastMem's potential to offer a robust solution to enhance the reliability and accuracy of LLMs in various applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soheil Shapouri, Saber Soleymani, Saed Rezayi</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion mining has become a crucial tool for understanding human emotions during disasters, leveraging the extensive data generated on social media platforms. This paper aims to summarize existing research on emotion mining within disaster contexts, highlighting both significant discoveries and persistent issues. On the one hand, emotion mining techniques have achieved acceptable accuracy enabling applications such as rapid damage assessment and mental health surveillance. On the other hand, with many studies adopting data-driven approaches, several methodological issues remain. These include arbitrary emotion classification, ignoring biases inherent in data collection from social media, such as the overrepresentation of individuals from higher socioeconomic status on Twitter, and the lack of application of theoretical frameworks like cross-cultural comparisons. These problems can be summarized as a notable lack of theory-driven research and ignoring insights from social and behavioral sciences. This paper underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and social scientists to develop more robust and theoretically grounded approaches in emotion mining. By addressing these gaps, we aim to enhance the effectiveness and reliability of emotion mining methodologies, ultimately contributing to improved disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.

<p>Abstract: We release Rasa, the first multilingual expressive TTS dataset for any Indian language, which contains 10 hours of neutral speech and 1-3 hours of expressive speech for each of the 6 Ekman emotions covering 3 languages: Assamese, Bengali, & Tamil. Our ablation studies reveal that just 1 hour of neutral and 30 minutes of expressive data can yield a Fair system as indicated by MUSHRA scores. Increasing neutral data to 10 hours, with minimal expressive data, significantly enhances expressiveness. This offers a practical recipe for resource-constrained languages, prioritizing easily obtainable neutral data alongside smaller amounts of expressive data. We show the importance of syllabically balanced data and pooling emotions to enhance expressiveness. We also highlight challenges in generating specific emotions, e.g., fear and surprise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Se-eun Yoon, Ahmad Bin Rabiah, Zaid Alibadi, Surya Kallumadi, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Customers reach out to online live chat agents with various intents, such as asking about product details or requesting a return. In this paper, we propose the problem of predicting user intent from browsing history and address it through a two-stage approach. The first stage classifies a user's browsing history into high-level intent categories. Here, we represent each browsing history as a text sequence of page attributes and use the ground-truth class labels to fine-tune pretrained Transformers. The second stage provides a large language model (LLM) with the browsing history and predicted intent class to generate fine-grained intents. For automatic evaluation, we use a separate LLM to judge the similarity between generated and ground-truth intents, which closely aligns with human judgments. Our two-stage approach yields significant performance gains compared to generating intents without the classification stage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Relational databases often suffer from uninformative descriptors of table contents, such as ambiguous columns and hard-to-interpret values, impacting both human users and Text-to-SQL models. This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate informative column descriptions as a semantic layer for relational databases. Using the BIRD-Bench development set, we created ColSQL, a dataset with gold-standard column descriptions generated and refined by LLMs and human annotators. We evaluated several instruction-tuned models, finding that GPT-4o and Command R+ excelled in generating high-quality descriptions. Additionally, we applied an LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate model performance. Although this method does not align well with human evaluations, we included it to explore its potential and to identify areas for improvement. More work is needed to improve the reliability of automatic evaluations for this task. We also find that detailed column descriptions significantly improve Text-to-SQL execution accuracy, especially when columns are uninformative. This study establishes LLMs as effective tools for generating detailed metadata, enhancing the usability of relational databases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Yuan, Chengwu Liu, Jingyang Yuan, Gongbo Sun, Siqi Li, Ming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a framework enabling large language models (LLMs) to enhance their accuracy and reduce hallucinations by integrating external knowledge bases. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid RAG system enhanced through a comprehensive suite of optimizations that significantly improve retrieval quality, augment reasoning capabilities, and refine numerical computation ability. We refined the text chunks and tables in web pages, added attribute predictors to reduce hallucinations, conducted LLM Knowledge Extractor and Knowledge Graph Extractor, and finally built a reasoning strategy with all the references. We evaluated our system on the CRAG dataset through the Meta CRAG KDD Cup 2024 Competition. Both the local and online evaluations demonstrate that our system significantly enhances complex reasoning capabilities. In local evaluations, we have significantly improved accuracy and reduced error rates compared to the baseline model, achieving a notable increase in scores. In the meanwhile, we have attained outstanding results in online assessments, demonstrating the performance and generalization capabilities of the proposed system.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venktesh V, Vinay Setty</p>
<p>Abstract: The advances in the digital era have led to rapid dissemination of information. This has also aggravated the spread of misinformation and disinformation. This has potentially serious consequences, such as civil unrest. While fact-checking aims to combat this, manual fact-checking is cumbersome and not scalable. While automated fact-checking approaches exist, they do not operate in real-time and do not always account for spread of misinformation through different modalities. This is particularly important as proactive fact-checking on live streams in real-time can help people be informed of false narratives and prevent catastrophic consequences that may cause civil unrest. This is particularly relevant with the rapid dissemination of information through video on social media platforms or other streams like political rallies and debates. Hence, in this work we develop a platform named LiveFC, that can aid in fact-checking live audio streams in real-time. LiveFC has a user-friendly interface that displays the claims detected along with their veracity and evidence for live streams with associated speakers for claims from respective segments. The app can be accessed at http://livefc.factiverse.ai and a screen recording of the demo can be found at https://bit.ly/3WVAoIw.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Huang, Jiaming Guo, Guanhua He, Xishan Zhang, Rui Zhang, Shaohui Peng, Shaoli Liu, Tianshi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating long-term texts such as novels using artificial intelligence has always been a challenge. A common approach is to use large language models (LLMs) to construct a hierarchical framework that first plans and then writes. Despite the fact that the generated novels reach a sufficient length, they exhibit poor logical coherence and appeal in their plots and deficiencies in character and event depiction, ultimately compromising the overall narrative quality. In this paper, we propose a method named Extracting Excelsior and Expanding. Ex3 initially extracts structure information from raw novel data. By combining this structure information with the novel data, an instruction-following dataset is meticulously crafted. This dataset is then utilized to fine-tune the LLM, aiming for excelsior generation performance. In the final stage, a tree-like expansion method is deployed to facilitate the generation of arbitrarily long novels. Evaluation against previous methods showcases Ex3's ability to produce higher-quality long-form novels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liuchang Xu, Shuo Zhao, Qingming Lin, Luyao Chen, Qianqian Luo, Sensen Wu, Xinyue Ye, Hailin Feng, Zhenhong Du</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and others has underscored the importance of evaluating their diverse capabilities, ranging from natural language understanding to code generation. However, their performance on spatial tasks has not been comprehensively assessed. This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel multi-task spatial evaluation dataset, designed to systematically explore and compare the performance of several advanced models on spatial tasks. The dataset encompasses twelve distinct task types, including spatial understanding and path planning, each with verified, accurate answers. We evaluated multiple models, including OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4o, and ZhipuAI's glm-4, through a two-phase testing approach. Initially, we conducted zero-shot testing, followed by categorizing the dataset by difficulty and performing prompt tuning tests. Results indicate that gpt-4o achieved the highest overall accuracy in the first phase, with an average of 71.3%. Although moonshot-v1-8k slightly underperformed overall, it surpassed gpt-4o in place name recognition tasks. The study also highlights the impact of prompt strategies on model performance in specific tasks. For example, the Chain-of-Thought (COT) strategy increased gpt-4o's accuracy in path planning from 12.4% to 87.5%, while a one-shot strategy enhanced moonshot-v1-8k's accuracy in mapping tasks from 10.1% to 76.3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vil\'em Zouhar, Pinzhen Chen, Tsz Kin Lam, Nikita Moghe, Barry Haddow</p>
<p>Abstract: Since its introduction, the COMET metric has blazed a trail in the machine translation community, given its strong correlation with human judgements of translation quality. Its success stems from being a modified pre-trained multilingual model finetuned for quality assessment. However, it being a machine learning model also gives rise to a new set of pitfalls that may not be widely known. We investigate these unexpected behaviours from three aspects: 1) technical: obsolete software versions and compute precision; 2) data: empty content, language mismatch, and translationese at test time as well as distribution and domain biases in training; 3) usage and reporting: multi-reference support and model referencing in the literature. All of these problems imply that COMET scores is not comparable between papers or even technical setups and we put forward our perspective on fixing each issue. Furthermore, we release the SacreCOMET package that can generate a signature for the software and model configuration as well as an appropriate citation. The goal of this work is to help the community make more sound use of the COMET metric.</p>

ReMamba incorporates selective compression and adaptation techniques within a two-stage re-forward process, incurring minimal additional inference costs overhead.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Chen, Zhiyuan Li, Shuo Xin, Yihao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Dolphin, a novel decoder-decoder architecture for energy-efficient processing of long contexts in language models. Our approach addresses the significant energy consumption and latency challenges inherent in on-device models. Dolphin employs a compact 0.5B parameter decoder to distill extensive contextual information into a memory embedding, substantially reducing the input length for the primary 7B parameter decoder model. Inspired by vision-language models, we repurpose the image embedding projector to encode long textual contexts, effectively treating extended context as a distinct modality. This innovative method enables processing of substantially longer contexts without the typical computational overhead associated with extended input sequences. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a 10-fold improvement in energy efficiency and a 5-fold reduction in latency compared to conventional full-length context processing methods without losing quality of the response. Our work contributes to the development of more sustainable and scalable language models for on-device applications, addressing the critical need for energy-efficient and responsive AI technologies in resource-constrained environments while maintaining the accuracy to understand long contexts. This research has implications for the broader field of natural language processing, particularly in the domain of efficient model design for resource-limited settings. By enabling more sophisticated AI capabilities on edge devices, Dolphin paves the way for advanced language processing in a wide range of applications where computational resources are at a premium.

<p><b>Authors:</b> {\L}ukasz Borchmann, Dawid Jurkiewicz, Filip Grali\'nski, Tomasz G\'orecki</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper presents a novel method of finding a fragment in a long temporal sequence similar to the set of shorter sequences. We are the first to propose an algorithm for such a search that does not rely on computing the average sequence from query examples. Instead, we use query examples as is, utilizing all of them simultaneously. The introduced method based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) technique is suited explicitly for few-shot query-by-example retrieval tasks. We evaluate it on two different few-shot problems from the field of Natural Language Processing. The results show it either outperforms baselines and previous approaches or achieves comparable results when a low number of examples is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Borui Cai, Yong Xiang, Longxiang Gao, Di Wu, He Zhang, Jiong Jin, Tom Luan</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) that maps entities and relations into vector representations is essential for downstream applications. Conventional KGE methods require high-dimensional representations to learn the complex structure of knowledge graph, but lead to oversized model parameters. Recent advances reduce parameters by low-dimensional entity representations, while developing techniques (e.g., knowledge distillation or reinvented representation forms) to compensate for reduced dimension. However, such operations introduce complicated computations and model designs that may not benefit large knowledge graphs. To seek a simple strategy to improve the parameter efficiency of conventional KGE models, we take inspiration from that deeper neural networks require exponentially fewer parameters to achieve expressiveness comparable to wider networks for compositional structures. We view all entity representations as a single-layer embedding network, and conventional KGE methods that adopt high-dimensional entity representations equal widening the embedding network to gain expressiveness. To achieve parameter efficiency, we instead propose a deeper embedding network for entity representations, i.e., a narrow entity embedding layer plus a multi-layer dimension lifting network (LiftNet). Experiments on three public datasets show that by integrating LiftNet, four conventional KGE methods with 16-dimensional representations achieve comparable link prediction accuracy as original models that adopt 512-dimensional representations, saving 68.4% to 96.9% parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sam van der Poel, Dakotah Lambert, Kalina Kostyszyn, Tiantian Gao, Rahul Verma, Derek Andersen, Joanne Chau, Emily Peterson, Cody St. Clair, Paul Fodor, Chihiro Shibata, Jeffrey Heinz</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic datasets constructed from formal languages allow fine-grained examination of the learning and generalization capabilities of machine learning systems for sequence classification. This article presents a new benchmark for machine learning systems on sequence classification called MLRegTest, which contains training, development, and test sets from 1,800 regular languages. Different kinds of formal languages represent different kinds of long-distance dependencies, and correctly identifying long-distance dependencies in sequences is a known challenge for ML systems to generalize successfully. MLRegTest organizes its languages according to their logical complexity (monadic second order, first order, propositional, or monomial expressions) and the kind of logical literals (string, tier-string, subsequence, or combinations thereof). The logical complexity and choice of literal provides a systematic way to understand different kinds of long-distance dependencies in regular languages, and therefore to understand the capacities of different ML systems to learn such long-distance dependencies. Finally, the performance of different neural networks (simple RNN, LSTM, GRU, transformer) on MLRegTest is examined. The main conclusion is that performance depends significantly on the kind of test set, the class of language, and the neural network architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyas Vaidya, Arvind Kumar Sharma, Prajwal Gatti, Anand Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the task of ``visually'' translating scene text from a source language (e.g., Hindi) to a target language (e.g., English). Visual translation involves not just the recognition and translation of scene text but also the generation of the translated image that preserves visual features of the source scene text, such as font, size, and background. There are several challenges associated with this task, such as translation with limited context, deciding between translation and transliteration, accommodating varying text lengths within fixed spatial boundaries, and preserving the font and background styles of the source scene text in the target language. To address this problem, we make the following contributions: (i) We study visual translation as a standalone problem for the first time in the literature. (ii) We present a cascaded framework for visual translation that combines state-of-the-art modules for scene text recognition, machine translation, and scene text synthesis as a baseline for the task. (iii) We propose a set of task-specific design enhancements to design a variant of the baseline to obtain performance improvements. (iv) Currently, the existing related literature lacks any comprehensive performance evaluation for this novel task. To fill this gap, we introduce several automatic and user-assisted evaluation metrics designed explicitly for evaluating visual translation. Further, we evaluate presented baselines for translating scene text between Hindi and English. Our experiments demonstrate that although we can effectively perform visual translation over a large collection of scene text images, the presented baseline only partially addresses challenges posed by visual translation tasks. We firmly believe that this new task and the limitations of existing models, as reported in this paper, should encourage further research in visual translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaodong Yu, Sam Buchanan, Druv Pai, Tianzhe Chu, Ziyang Wu, Shengbang Tong, Hao Bai, Yuexiang Zhai, Benjamin D. Haeffele, Yi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered transformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of data compression.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Branislav Pecher, Ivan Srba, Maria Bielikova</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning with limited labelled data, such as prompting, in-context learning, fine-tuning, meta-learning or few-shot learning, aims to effectively train a model using only a small amount of labelled samples. However, these approaches have been observed to be excessively sensitive to the effects of uncontrolled randomness caused by non-determinism in the training process. The randomness negatively affects the stability of the models, leading to large variances in results across training runs. When such sensitivity is disregarded, it can unintentionally, but unfortunately also intentionally, create an imaginary perception of research progress. Recently, this area started to attract research attention and the number of relevant studies is continuously growing. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of 415 papers addressing the effects of randomness on the stability of learning with limited labelled data. We distinguish between four main tasks addressed in the papers (investigate/evaluate; determine; mitigate; benchmark/compare/report randomness effects), providing findings for each one. Furthermore, we identify and discuss seven challenges and open problems together with possible directions to facilitate further research. The ultimate goal of this survey is to emphasise the importance of this growing research area, which so far has not received an appropriate level of attention, and reveal impactful directions for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies indicate that Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 with Vision (GPT-4V) outperforms human physicians in medical challenge tasks. However, these evaluations primarily focused on the accuracy of multi-choice questions alone. Our study extends the current scope by conducting a comprehensive analysis of GPT-4V's rationales of image comprehension, recall of medical knowledge, and step-by-step multimodal reasoning when solving New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) Image Challenges - an imaging quiz designed to test the knowledge and diagnostic capabilities of medical professionals. Evaluation results confirmed that GPT-4V performs comparatively to human physicians regarding multi-choice accuracy (81.6% vs. 77.8%). GPT-4V also performs well in cases where physicians incorrectly answer, with over 78% accuracy. However, we discovered that GPT-4V frequently presents flawed rationales in cases where it makes the correct final choices (35.5%), most prominent in image comprehension (27.2%). Regardless of GPT-4V's high accuracy in multi-choice questions, our findings emphasize the necessity for further in-depth evaluations of its rationales before integrating such multimodal AI models into clinical workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Chen, Haozhe Zhao, Tianyu Liu, Shuai Bai, Junyang Lin, Chang Zhou, Baobao Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we identify the inefficient attention phenomena in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), notably within prominent models like LLaVA-1.5, QwenVL-Chat and Video-LLaVA. We find out that the attention computation over visual tokens is of extreme inefficiency in the deep layers of popular LVLMs, suggesting a need for a sparser approach compared to textual data handling. To this end, we introduce FastV, a versatile plug-and-play method designed to optimize computational efficiency by learning adaptive attention patterns in early layers and pruning visual tokens in subsequent ones. Our evaluations demonstrate FastV's ability to dramatically reduce computational costs (e.g., a 45 reduction in FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-13B) without sacrificing performance in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks. The computational efficiency and performance trade-off of FastV are highly customizable and pareto-efficient. It can compress the FLOPs of a 13B-parameter model to achieve a lower budget than that of a 7B-parameter model, while still maintaining superior performance. We believe FastV has practical values for deployment of LVLMs in edge devices and commercial models. Code is released at https://github.com/pkunlp-icler/FastV.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decision-making, a complicated task requiring various types of abilities, presents an excellent framework for assessing Large Language Models (LLMs). Our research investigates decision-making capabilities of LLMs through the lens of Game Theory. We focus specifically on games that support the simultaneous participation of more than two agents. We introduce GAMA($\gamma$)-Bench, which evaluates LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent environments. $\gamma$-Bench includes eight classical multi-agent games and a scoring scheme specially designed to quantitatively assess LLMs' performance. Leveraging $\gamma$-Bench, we investigate LLMs' robustness, generalizability, and strategies for enhancement. Results reveal that while GPT-3.5 shows satisfying robustness, its generalizability is relatively limited. However, its performance can be improved through approaches such as Chain-of-Thought. Additionally, we evaluate twelve versions from six models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA-3.1, Mixtral, and Qwen-2. We find that Gemini-1.5-Pro outperforms other models with a score of $63.8$ out of $100$, followed by LLaMA-3.1-70B and GPT-4 with scores of $60.9$ and $60.5$, respectively.

<p>Abstract: Can advanced multi-modal models effectively tackle complex web-based tasks? Such tasks are often found on crowdsourcing platforms, where crowdworkers engage in challenging micro-tasks within web-based environments.
  Building on this idea, we present TurkingBench, a benchmark consisting of tasks presented as web pages with textual instructions and multi-modal contexts. Unlike previous approaches that rely on artificially synthesized web pages, our benchmark uses natural HTML pages originally designed for crowdsourcing workers to perform various annotation tasks. Each task's HTML instructions are instantiated with different values derived from crowdsourcing tasks, creating diverse instances. This benchmark includes 32.2K instances spread across 158 tasks.
  To support the evaluation of TurkingBench, we have developed a framework that links chatbot responses to actions on web pages (e.g., modifying a text box, selecting a radio button). We assess the performance of cutting-edge private and open-source models, including language-only and vision-language models (such as GPT4 and InternVL), on this benchmark. Our results show that while these models outperform random chance, there is still significant room for improvement. We hope that this benchmark will drive progress in the evaluation and development of web-based agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural Code Intelligence -- leveraging deep learning to understand, generate, and optimize code -- holds immense potential for transformative impacts on the whole society. Bridging the gap between Natural Language and Programming Language, this domain has drawn significant attention from researchers in both research communities over the past few years. This survey presents a systematic and chronological review of the advancements in code intelligence, encompassing over 50 representative models and their variants, more than 20 categories of tasks, and an extensive coverage of over 680 related works. We follow the historical progression to trace the paradigm shifts across different research phases (e.g., from modeling code with recurrent neural networks to the era of Large Language Models). Concurrently, we highlight the major technical transitions in models, tasks, and evaluations spanning through different stages. For applications, we also observe a co-evolving shift. It spans from initial endeavors to tackling specific scenarios, through exploring a diverse array of tasks during its rapid expansion, to currently focusing on tackling increasingly complex and varied real-world challenges. Building on our examination of the developmental trajectories, we further investigate the emerging synergies between code intelligence and broader machine intelligence, uncovering new cross-domain opportunities and illustrating the substantial influence of code intelligence across various domains. Finally, we delve into both the opportunities and challenges associated with this field, alongside elucidating our insights on the most promising research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jindong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, generative AI (GenAI), like large language models and text-to-image models, has received significant attention across various domains. However, ensuring the responsible generation of content by these models is crucial for their real-world applicability. This raises an interesting question: What should responsible GenAI generate, and what should it not? To answer the question, this paper investigates the practical responsible requirements of both textual and visual generative models, outlining five key considerations: generating truthful content, avoiding toxic content, refusing harmful instruction, leaking no training data-related content, and ensuring generated content identifiable. Specifically, we review recent advancements and challenges in addressing these requirements. Besides, we discuss and emphasize the importance of responsible GenAI across healthcare, education, finance, and artificial general intelligence domains. Through a unified perspective on both textual and visual generative models, this paper aims to provide insights into practical safety-related issues and further benefit the community in building responsible GenAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aounon Kumar, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into search engines to provide natural language responses tailored to user queries. Customers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these models for quick and easy purchase decisions. In this work, we investigate whether recommendations from LLMs can be manipulated to enhance a product's visibility. We demonstrate that adding a strategic text sequence (STS) -- a carefully crafted message -- to a product's information page can significantly increase its likelihood of being listed as the LLM's top recommendation. To understand the impact of STS, we use a catalog of fictitious coffee machines and analyze its effect on two target products: one that seldom appears in the LLM's recommendations and another that usually ranks second. We observe that the strategic text sequence significantly enhances the visibility of both products by increasing their chances of appearing as the top recommendation. This ability to manipulate LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with a considerable competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair market competition. Just as search engine optimization (SEO) revolutionized how webpages are customized to rank higher in search engine results, influencing LLM recommendations could profoundly impact content optimization for AI-driven search services.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songtao Jiang, Tuo Zheng, Yan Zhang, Yeying Jin, Li Yuan, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in general-purpose or domain-specific multimodal large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable progress for medical decision-making. However, they are designated for specific classification or generative tasks, and require model training or finetuning on large-scale datasets with sizeable parameters and tremendous computing, hindering their clinical utility across diverse resource-constrained scenarios in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel and lightweight framework Med-MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) that tackles both discriminative and generative multimodal medical tasks. The learning of Med-MoE consists of three steps: multimodal medical alignment, instruction tuning and routing, and domain-specific MoE tuning. After aligning multimodal medical images with LLM tokens, we then enable the model for different multimodal medical tasks with instruction tuning, together with a trainable router tailored for expert selection across input modalities. Finally, the model is tuned by integrating the router with multiple domain-specific experts, which are selectively activated and further empowered by meta expert. Comprehensive experiments on both open- and close-end medical question answering (Med-VQA) and image classification tasks across datasets such as VQA-RAD, SLAKE and Path-VQA demonstrate that our model can achieve performance superior to or on par with state-of-the-art baselines, while only requiring approximately 30\%-50\% of activated model parameters. Extensive analysis and ablations corroborate the effectiveness and practical utility of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Watson, Nicole Cho, Nishan Srishankar</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination continues to be one of the most critical challenges in the institutional adoption journey of Large Language Models (LLMs). While prior studies have primarily focused on the post-generation analysis and refinement of outputs, this paper centers on the effectiveness of queries in eliciting accurate responses from LLMs. We present HalluciBot, a model that estimates the query's propensity to hallucinate before generation, without invoking any LLMs during inference. HalluciBot can serve as a proxy reward model for query rewriting, offering a general framework to estimate query quality based on accuracy and consensus. In essence, HalluciBot investigates how poorly constructed queries can lead to erroneous outputs - moreover, by employing query rewriting guided by HalluciBot's empirical estimates, we demonstrate that 95.7% output accuracy can be achieved for Multiple Choice questions. The training procedure for HalluciBot consists of perturbing 369,837 queries n times, employing n+1 independent LLM agents, sampling an output from each query, conducting a Multi-Agent Monte Carlo simulation on the sampled outputs, and training an encoder classifier. The idea of perturbation is the outcome of our ablation studies that measures the increase in output diversity (+12.5 agreement spread) by perturbing a query in lexically different but semantically similar ways. Therefore, HalluciBot paves the way to ratiocinate (76.0% test F1 score, 46.6% in saved computation on hallucinatory queries), rewrite (+30.2% positive class transition from hallucinatory to non-hallucinatory), rank (+50.6% positive class transition from hallucinatory to non-hallucinatory), and route queries to effective pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaolin Gao, Jonathan D. Chang, Wenhao Zhan, Owen Oertell, Gokul Swamy, Kiant\'e Brantley, Thorsten Joachims, J. Andrew Bagnell, Jason D. Lee, Wen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: While originally developed for continuous control problems, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as the work-horse of a variety of reinforcement learning (RL) applications, including the fine-tuning of generative models. Unfortunately, PPO requires multiple heuristics to enable stable convergence (e.g. value networks, clipping), and is notorious for its sensitivity to the precise implementation of these components. In response, we take a step back and ask what a minimalist RL algorithm for the era of generative models would look like. We propose REBEL, an algorithm that cleanly reduces the problem of policy optimization to regressing the relative reward between two completions to a prompt in terms of the policy, enabling strikingly lightweight implementation. In theory, we prove that fundamental RL algorithms like Natural Policy Gradient can be seen as variants of REBEL, which allows us to match the strongest known theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence and sample complexity in the RL literature. REBEL can also cleanly incorporate offline data and be extended to handle the intransitive preferences we frequently see in practice. Empirically, we find that REBEL provides a unified approach to language modeling and image generation with stronger or similar performance as PPO and DPO, all while being simpler to implement and more computationally efficient than PPO. When fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Instruct, REBEL achieves strong performance in AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and Open LLM Leaderboard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evelyn Yee, Alice Li, Chenyu Tang, Yeon Ho Jung, Ramamohan Paturi, Leon Bergen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often improve their performance in downstream tasks when they generate Chain of Thought reasoning text before producing an answer. We investigate how LLMs recover from errors in Chain of Thought. Through analysis of error recovery behaviors, we find evidence for unfaithfulness in Chain of Thought, which occurs when models arrive at the correct answer despite invalid reasoning text. We identify factors that shift LLM recovery behavior: LLMs recover more frequently from obvious errors and in contexts that provide more evidence for the correct answer. Critically, these factors have divergent effects on faithful and unfaithful recoveries. Our results indicate that there are distinct mechanisms driving faithful and unfaithful error recoveries. Selective targeting of these mechanisms may be able to drive down the rate of unfaithful reasoning and improve model interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yelysei Bondarenko, Riccardo Del Chiaro, Markus Nagel</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are omnipresent, however their practical deployment is challenging due to their ever increasing computational and memory demands. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to make them more compute and memory efficient. Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods, generally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the cost of potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making it impractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- a lightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs several components to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a) low-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) a downcasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c) checkpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient, leading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seen as a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting model can still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be applied across a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choices quantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined with many PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral model families and validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our method outperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches the same model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage. Specifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB of memory. Our source code is available at https://github.com/qualcomm-ai-research/LR-QAT</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Wang, Xunlong Zou, Geyu Lin, Shuo Sun, Zhuohan Liu, Wenyu Zhang, Zhengyuan Liu, AiTi Aw, Nancy F. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce AudioBench, a universal benchmark designed to evaluate Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs). It encompasses 8 distinct tasks and 26 datasets, among which, 7 are newly proposed datasets. The evaluation targets three main aspects: speech understanding, audio scene understanding, and voice understanding (paralinguistic). Despite recent advancements, there lacks a comprehensive benchmark for AudioLLMs on instruction following capabilities conditioned on audio signals. AudioBench addresses this gap by setting up datasets as well as desired evaluation metrics. Besides, we also evaluated the capabilities of five popular models and found that no single model excels consistently across all tasks. We outline the research outlook for AudioLLMs and anticipate that our open-sourced evaluation toolkit, data, and leaderboard will offer a robust testbed for future model developments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntao Shou, Wei Ai, Jiayi Du, Tao Meng, Haiyan Liu, Nan Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of multi-modal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) aims to analyze the genuine emotional state of each utterance based on the multi-modal information in the conversation, which is crucial for conversation understanding. Existing methods focus on using graph neural networks (GNN) to model conversational relationships and capture contextual latent semantic relationships. However, due to the complexity of GNN, existing methods cannot efficiently capture the potential dependencies between long-distance utterances, which limits the performance of MERC. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Long-distance Latent Relation-aware Graph Neural Network (ELR-GNN) for multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. Specifically, we first use pre-extracted text, video and audio features as input to Bi-LSTM to capture contextual semantic information and obtain low-level utterance features. Then, we use low-level utterance features to construct a conversational emotion interaction graph. To efficiently capture the potential dependencies between long-distance utterances, we use the dilated generalized forward push algorithm to precompute the emotional propagation between global utterances and design an emotional relation-aware operator to capture the potential semantic associations between different utterances. Furthermore, we combine early fusion and adaptive late fusion mechanisms to fuse latent dependency information between speaker relationship information and context. Finally, we obtain high-level discourse features and feed them into MLP for emotion prediction. Extensive experimental results show that ELR-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and MELD, with running times reduced by 52\% and 35\%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Miao, Yifan Zhu, Yinpeng Dong, Lijia Yu, Jun Zhu, Xiao-Shan Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent development of Sora leads to a new era in text-to-video (T2V) generation. Along with this comes the rising concern about its security risks. The generated videos may contain illegal or unethical content, and there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative understanding of their safety, posing a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. Previous evaluations primarily focus on the quality of video generation. While some evaluations of text-to-image models have considered safety, they cover fewer aspects and do not address the unique temporal risk inherent in video generation. To bridge this research gap, we introduce T2VSafetyBench, a new benchmark designed for conducting safety-critical assessments of text-to-video models. We define 12 critical aspects of video generation safety and construct a malicious prompt dataset including real-world prompts, LLM-generated prompts and jailbreak attack-based prompts. Based on our evaluation results, we draw several important findings, including: 1) no single model excels in all aspects, with different models showing various strengths; 2) the correlation between GPT-4 assessments and manual reviews is generally high; 3) there is a trade-off between the usability and safety of text-to-video generative models. This indicates that as the field of video generation rapidly advances, safety risks are set to surge, highlighting the urgency of prioritizing video safety. We hope that T2VSafetyBench can provide insights for better understanding the safety of video generation in the era of generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Lu, Cong Lu, Robert Tjarko Lange, Jakob Foerster, Jeff Clune, David Ha</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lizhou Fan, Lingyao Li, Libby Hemphill</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Online toxicity, encompassing behaviors such as harassment, bullying, hate speech, and the dissemination of misinformation, has become a pressing social concern in the digital age. The 2022 Mpox outbreak, initially termed "Monkeypox" but subsequently renamed to mitigate associated stigmas and societal concerns, serves as a poignant backdrop to this issue. Objective: In this research, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the toxic online discourse surrounding the 2022 Mpox outbreak. Our objective is to dissect its origins, characterize its nature and content, trace its dissemination patterns, and assess its broader societal implications, with the goal of providing insights that can inform strategies to mitigate such toxicity in future crises. Methods: We collected more than 1.6 million unique tweets and analyzed them from five dimensions, including context, extent, content, speaker, and intent. Utilizing BERT-based topic modeling and social network community clustering, we delineated the toxic dynamics on Twitter. Results: We identified five high-level topic categories in the toxic online discourse on Twitter, including disease (46.6%), health policy and healthcare (19.3%), homophobia (23.9%), politics (6.0%), and racism (4.1%). Through the toxicity diffusion networks of mentions, retweets, and the top users, we found that retweets of toxic content were widespread, while influential users rarely engaged with or countered this toxicity through retweets. Conclusions: By tracking topical dynamics, we can track the changing popularity of toxic content online, providing a better understanding of societal challenges. Network dynamics spotlight key social media influencers and their intents, indicating that addressing these central figures in toxic discourse can enhance crisis communication and inform policy-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaina Raza, Arash Shaban-Nejad, Elham Dolatabadi, Hiroshi Mamiya</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: The rapid advancement of Machine Learning (ML) represents novel opportunities to enhance public health research, surveillance, and decision-making. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of algorithmic bias, systematic errors in predicted population health outcomes, resulting from the public health application of ML. The objective of this narrative review is to explore the types of bias generated by ML and quantitative metrics to assess these biases.
  Methods : We performed search on PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Digital Library, Science Direct, and Springer Nature. We used keywords to identify studies describing types of bias and metrics to measure these in the domain of ML and public and population health published in English between 2008 and 2023, inclusive.
  Results: A total of 72 articles met the inclusion criteria. Our review identified the commonly described types of bias and quantitative metrics to assess these biases from an equity perspective.
  Conclusion : The review will help formalize the evaluation framework for ML on public health from an equity perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruochen Li, Teerth Patel, Qingyun Wang, Xinya Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning research, crucial for technological advancements and innovation, often faces significant challenges due to its inherent complexity, slow pace of experimentation, and the necessity for specialized expertise. Motivated by this, we present a new systematic framework, autonomous Machine Learning Research with large language models (MLR-Copilot), designed to enhance machine learning research productivity through the automatic generation and implementation of research ideas using Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The framework consists of three phases: research idea generation, experiment implementation, and implementation execution. First, existing research papers are used to generate hypotheses and experimental plans vis IdeaAgent powered by LLMs. Next, the implementation generation phase translates these plans into executables with ExperimentAgent. This phase leverages retrieved prototype code and optionally retrieves candidate models and data. Finally, the execution phase, also managed by ExperimentAgent, involves running experiments with mechanisms for human feedback and iterative debugging to enhance the likelihood of achieving executable research outcomes. We evaluate our framework on five machine learning research tasks and the experimental results show the framework's potential to facilitate the research progress and innovations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and latent diffusion models (LDMs) have profoundly impacted diverse sectors, including music. This comprehensive review examines state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models and foundation models in music, spanning from representation learning, generative learning and multimodal learning. We first contextualise the significance of music in various industries and trace the evolution of AI in music. By delineating the modalities targeted by foundation models, we discover many of the music representations are underexplored in FM development. Then, emphasis is placed on the lack of versatility of previous methods on diverse music applications, along with the potential of FMs in music understanding, generation and medical application. By comprehensively exploring the details of the model pre-training paradigm, architectural choices, tokenisation, finetuning methodologies and controllability, we emphasise the important topics that should have been well explored, like instruction tuning and in-context learning, scaling law and emergent ability, as well as long-sequence modelling etc. A dedicated section presents insights into music agents, accompanied by a thorough analysis of datasets and evaluations essential for pre-training and downstream tasks. Finally, by underscoring the vital importance of ethical considerations, we advocate that following research on FM for music should focus more on such issues as interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, and copyright issues. The paper offers insights into future challenges and trends on FMs for music, aiming to shape the trajectory of human-AI collaboration in the music realm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ganesh Prasath Ramani, Shirish Karande, Santhosh V, Yash Bhatia</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as formidable instruments capable of comprehending and producing human-like text. This paper explores the potential of LLMs, to shape user perspectives and subsequently influence their decisions on particular tasks. This capability finds applications in diverse domains such as Investment, Credit cards and Insurance, wherein they assist users in selecting appropriate insurance policies, investment plans, Credit cards, Retail, as well as in Behavioral Change Support Systems (BCSS).
  We present a sophisticated multi-agent framework wherein a consortium of agents operate in collaborative manner. The primary agent engages directly with user agents through persuasive dialogue, while the auxiliary agents perform tasks such as information retrieval, response analysis, development of persuasion strategies, and validation of facts. Empirical evidence from our experiments demonstrates that this collaborative methodology significantly enhances the persuasive efficacy of the LLM. We continuously analyze the resistance of the user agent to persuasive efforts and counteract it by employing a combination of rule-based and LLM-based resistance-persuasion mapping techniques.
  We employ simulated personas and generate conversations in insurance, banking, and retail domains to evaluate the proficiency of large language models (LLMs) in recognizing, adjusting to, and influencing various personality types. Concurrently, we examine the resistance mechanisms employed by LLM simulated personas. Persuasion is quantified via measurable surveys before and after interaction, LLM-generated scores on conversation, and user decisions (purchase or non-purchase).</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-vector dense models, such as ColBERT, have proven highly effective in information retrieval. ColBERT's late interaction scoring approximates the joint query-document attention seen in cross-encoders while maintaining inference efficiency closer to traditional dense retrieval models, thanks to its bi-encoder architecture and recent optimizations in indexing and search. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture and a training framework to support long context window and multilingual retrieval. Leveraging Matryoshka Representation Loss, we further demonstrate that the reducing the embedding dimensionality from 128 to 64 has insignificant impact on the model's retrieval performance and cut storage requirements by up to 50%. Our new model, Jina-ColBERT-v2, demonstrates strong performance across a range of English and multilingual retrieval tasks,</p>
