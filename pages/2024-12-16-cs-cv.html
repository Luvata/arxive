<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Zhang, Shulin Tian, Ziqi Huang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in visual generative models have enabled high-quality image and video generation, opening diverse applications. However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09649">Pole-based Vehicle Localization with Vector Maps: A Camera-LiDAR Comparative Study</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Noizet (Heudiasyc), Philippe Xu (Heudiasyc), Philippe Bonnifait (Heudiasyc)</p>
<p>Abstract: For autonomous navigation, accurate localization with respect to a map is needed. In urban environments, infrastructure such as buildings or bridges cause major difficulties to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and, despite advances in inertial navigation, it is necessary to support them with other sources of exteroceptive information. In road environments, many common furniture such as traffic signs, traffic lights and street lights take the form of poles. By georeferencing these features in vector maps, they can be used within a localization filter that includes a detection pipeline and a data association method. Poles, having discriminative vertical structures, can be extracted from 3D geometric information using LiDAR sensors. Alternatively, deep neural networks can be employed to detect them from monocular cameras. The lack of depth information induces challenges in associating camera detections with map features. Yet, multi-camera integration provides a cost-efficient solution. This paper quantitatively evaluates the efficacy of these approaches in terms of localization. It introduces a real-time method for camera-based pole detection using a lightweight neural network trained on automatically annotated images. The proposed methods' efficiency is assessed on a challenging sequence with a vector map. The results highlight the high accuracy of the vision-based approach in open road conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benji Peng, Chia Xin Liang, Ziqian Bi, Ming Liu, Yichao Zhang, Tianyang Wang, Keyu Chen, Xinyuan Song, Pohsun Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based image generation has undergone a paradigm shift since 2021, marked by fundamental architectural breakthroughs and computational innovations. Through reviewing architectural innovations and empirical results, this paper analyzes the transition from traditional generative methods to advanced architectures, with focus on compute-efficient diffusion models and vision transformer architectures. We examine how recent developments in Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and consistency models have redefined the capabilities and performance boundaries of image synthesis, while addressing persistent challenges in efficiency and quality. Our analysis focuses on the evolution of latent space representations, cross-attention mechanisms, and parameter-efficient training methodologies that enable accelerated inference under resource constraints. While more efficient training methods enable faster inference, advanced control mechanisms like ControlNet and regional attention systems have simultaneously improved generation precision and content customization. We investigate how enhanced multi-modal understanding and zero-shot generation capabilities are reshaping practical applications across industries. Our analysis demonstrates that despite remarkable advances in generation quality and computational efficiency, critical challenges remain in developing resource-conscious architectures and interpretable generation systems for industrial applications. The paper concludes by mapping promising research directions, including neural architecture optimization and explainable generation frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Mei, Hao He, Yahui Liu, Zhenhua Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: In the technical report, we present a novel transformer-based framework for nuScenes lidar-based object detection task, termed Spatial Expansion Group Transformer (SEGT). To efficiently handle the irregular and sparse nature of point cloud, we propose migrating the voxels into distinct specialized ordered fields with the general spatial expansion strategies, and employ group attention mechanisms to extract the exclusive feature maps within each field. Subsequently, we integrate the feature representations across different ordered fields by alternately applying diverse expansion strategies, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture comprehensive spatial information. The method was evaluated on the nuScenes lidar-based object detection test dataset, achieving an NDS score of 73.5 without Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) and 74.2 with TTA, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Messi H. J. Lee, Soyeon Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities with image processing, enabling tasks like image captioning and text-to-image generation. Yet concerns persist about their potential to amplify human-like biases, including skin tone bias. Skin tone bias, where darker-skinned individuals face more negative stereotyping than lighter-skinned individuals, is well-documented in the social sciences but remains under-explored in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in VLMs. While well-documented in the social sciences, this bias remains under-explored in AI, particularly in VLMs. Using the GAN Face Database, we sampled computer-generated images of Black American men and women, controlling for skin tone variations while keeping other features constant. We then asked VLMs to write stories about these faces and compared the homogeneity of the generated stories. Stories generated by VLMs about darker-skinned Black individuals were more homogeneous than those about lighter-skinned individuals in three of four models, and Black women were consistently represented more homogeneously than Black men across all models. Interaction effects revealed a greater impact of skin tone on women in two VLMs, while the other two showed nonsignificant results, reflecting known stereotyping patterns. These findings underscore the propagation of biases from single-modality AI systems to multimodal models and highlight the need for further research to address intersectional biases in AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sean Wu, Shamik Basu, Tim Broedermann, Luc Van Gool, Christos Sakaridis</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the ill-posed inverse rendering problem in 3D reconstruction with a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) approach informed by Physics-Based Rendering (PBR) theory, named PBR-NeRF. Our method addresses a key limitation in most NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches: they estimate view-dependent appearance without modeling scene materials and illumination. To address this limitation, we present an inverse rendering (IR) model capable of jointly estimating scene geometry, materials, and illumination. Our model builds upon recent NeRF-based IR approaches, but crucially introduces two novel physics-based priors that better constrain the IR estimation. Our priors are rigorously formulated as intuitive loss terms and achieve state-of-the-art material estimation without compromising novel view synthesis quality. Our method is easily adaptable to other inverse rendering and 3D reconstruction frameworks that require material estimation. We demonstrate the importance of extending current neural rendering approaches to fully model scene properties beyond geometry and view-dependent appearance.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09692">TOAP: Towards Better Robustness in Universal Transferable Anti-Facial Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunna Lv, Long Tang, Dengpan Ye, Caiyun Xie, Jiacheng Deng, Yiheng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep hash-based retrieval techniques are widely used in facial retrieval systems to improve the efficiency of facial matching. However, it also brings the risk of privacy leakage. Deep hash models are easily influenced by adversarial examples, which can be leveraged to prevent the malicious retrieval of private images. The existing adversarial example methods against deep hash models focus on universality and transferability, lacking the research on its robustness in online social networks (OSNs), which leads to their failure in anti-retrieval after post-processing. Therefore, we provide the first in-depth discussion on robustness adversarial perturbation in universal transferable anti-facial retrieval and propose Three-in-One Adversarial Perturbation (TOAP). Specifically, we firstly analyze the performance of deep hash models after post-processing and construct a local and global Compression Generator (CG) to simulate complex post-processing scenarios. Then, we explore the variation patterns of the model's objective under image post-processing and propose robust optimization objectives, cluster centers and data space centers, optimizing them using meta-learning. Finally, we iteratively optimize perturbation by alternately generating adversarial examples and fine-tuning the CG, balancing the performance of perturbation while enhancing CG's ability to mitigate them. Numerous experiments demonstrate that, in addition to its advantages in universality and transferability, TOAP significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in multiple robustness metrics. It further improves universality and transferability by 5% to 28%, and achieves up to about 33% significant improvement in several simulated post-processing scenarios as well as mainstream OSNs, demonstrating that TOAP can effectively protect private images from malicious retrieval in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guocheng Qian, Kuan-Chieh Wang, Or Patashnik, Negin Heravi, Daniil Ostashev, Sergey Tulyakov, Daniel Cohen-Or, Kfir Aberman</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Omni-ID, a novel facial representation designed specifically for generative tasks. Omni-ID encodes holistic information about an individual's appearance across diverse expressions and poses within a fixed-size representation. It consolidates information from a varied number of unstructured input images into a structured representation, where each entry represents certain global or local identity features. Our approach uses a few-to-many identity reconstruction training paradigm, where a limited set of input images is used to reconstruct multiple target images of the same individual in various poses and expressions. A multi-decoder framework is further employed to leverage the complementary strengths of diverse decoders during training. Unlike conventional representations, such as CLIP and ArcFace, which are typically learned through discriminative or contrastive objectives, Omni-ID is optimized with a generative objective, resulting in a more comprehensive and nuanced identity capture for generative tasks. Trained on our MFHQ dataset -- a multi-view facial image collection, Omni-ID demonstrates substantial improvements over conventional representations across various generative tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09696">Soybean Maturity Prediction using 2D Contour Plots from Drone based Time Series Imagery</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bitgoeul Kim, Samuel W. Blair, Talukder Z. Jubery, Soumik Sarkar, Arti Singh, Asheesh K. Singh, Baskar Ganapathysubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: Plant breeding programs require assessments of days to maturity for accurate selection and placement of entries in appropriate tests. In the early stages of the breeding pipeline, soybean breeding programs assign relative maturity ratings to experimental varieties that indicate their suitable maturity zones. Traditionally, the estimation of maturity value for breeding varieties has involved breeders manually inspecting fields and assessing maturity value visually. This approach relies heavily on rater judgment, making it subjective and time-consuming. This study aimed to develop a machine-learning model for evaluating soybean maturity using UAV-based time-series imagery. Images were captured at three-day intervals, beginning as the earliest varieties started maturing and continuing until the last varieties fully matured. The data collected for this experiment consisted of 22,043 plots collected across three years (2021 to 2023) and represent relative maturity groups 1.6 - 3.9. We utilized contour plot images extracted from the time-series UAV RGB imagery as input for a neural network model. This contour plot approach encoded the temporal and spatial variation within each plot into a single image. A deep learning model was trained to utilize this contour plot to predict maturity ratings. This model significantly improves accuracy and robustness, achieving up to 85% accuracy. We also evaluate the model's accuracy as we reduce the number of time points, quantifying the trade-off between temporal resolution and maturity prediction. The predictive model offers a scalable, objective, and efficient means of assessing crop maturity, enabling phenomics and ML approaches to reduce the reliance on manual inspection and subjective assessment. This approach enables the automatic prediction of relative maturity ratings in a breeding program, saving time and resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun-Mei Feng, Yuanyang He, Jian Zou, Salman Khan, Huan Xiong, Zhen Li, Wangmeng Zuo, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing test-time prompt tuning (TPT) methods focus on single-modality data, primarily enhancing images and using confidence ratings to filter out inaccurate images. However, while image generation models can produce visually diverse images, single-modality data enhancement techniques still fail to capture the comprehensive knowledge provided by different modalities. Additionally, we note that the performance of TPT-based methods drops significantly when the number of augmented images is limited, which is not unusual given the computational expense of generative augmentation. To address these issues, we introduce IT3A, a novel test-time adaptation method that utilizes a pre-trained generative model for multi-modal augmentation of each test sample from unknown new domains. By combining augmented data from pre-trained vision and language models, we enhance the ability of the model to adapt to unknown new test data. Additionally, to ensure that key semantics are accurately retained when generating various visual and text enhancements, we employ cosine similarity filtering between the logits of the enhanced images and text with the original test data. This process allows us to filter out some spurious augmentation and inadequate combinations. To leverage the diverse enhancements provided by the generation model across different modals, we have replaced prompt tuning with an adapter for greater flexibility in utilizing text templates. Our experiments on the test datasets with distribution shifts and domain gaps show that in a zero-shot setting, IT3A outperforms state-of-the-art test-time prompt tuning methods with a 5.50% increase in accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Moe{\ss}ner, Heike Adel</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of publicly available AI-based text-to-image systems, the process of creating photorealistic but fully synthetic images has been largely democratized. This can pose a threat to the public through a simplified spread of disinformation. Machine detectors and human media expertise can help to differentiate between AI-generated (fake) and real images and counteract this danger. Although AI generation models are highly prompt-dependent, the impact of the prompt on the fake detection performance has rarely been investigated yet. This work therefore examines the influence of the prompt's level of detail on the detectability of fake images, both with an AI detector and in a user study. For this purpose, we create a novel dataset, COCOXGEN, which consists of real photos from the COCO dataset as well as images generated with SDXL and Fooocus using prompts of two standardized lengths. Our user study with 200 participants shows that images generated with longer, more detailed prompts are detected significantly more easily than those generated with short prompts. Similarly, an AI-based detection model achieves better performance on images generated with longer prompts. However, humans and AI models seem to pay attention to different details, as we show in a heat map analysis.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09718">BayesAdapter: enhanced uncertainty estimation in CLIP few-shot adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Morales-\'Alvarez, Stergios Christodoulidis, Maria Vakalopoulou, Pablo Piantanida, Jose Dolz</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) represents a paradigm shift in machine learning, with unprecedented results in a broad span of visual recognition tasks. CLIP, one of the most popular VLMs, has exhibited remarkable zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities in classification. To transfer CLIP to downstream tasks, adapters constitute a parameter-efficient approach that avoids backpropagation through the large model (unlike related prompt learning methods). However, CLIP adapters have been developed to target discriminative performance, and the quality of their uncertainty estimates has been overlooked. In this work we show that the discriminative performance of state-of-the-art CLIP adapters does not always correlate with their uncertainty estimation capabilities, which are essential for a safe deployment in real-world scenarios. We also demonstrate that one of such adapters is obtained through MAP inference from a more general probabilistic framework. Based on this observation we introduce BayesAdapter, which leverages Bayesian inference to estimate a full probability distribution instead of a single point, better capturing the variability inherent in the parameter space. In a comprehensive empirical evaluation we show that our approach obtains high quality uncertainty estimates in the predictions, standing out in calibration and selective classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohao Xu, Feng Xue, Shibo Zhao, Yike Pan, Sebastian Scherer, Xiaonan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time multi-agent collaboration for ego-motion estimation and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction is vital for scalable spatial intelligence. However, traditional methods produce sparse, low-detail maps, while recent dense mapping approaches struggle with high latency. To overcome these challenges, we present MAC-Ego3D, a novel framework for real-time collaborative photorealistic 3D reconstruction via Multi-Agent Gaussian Consensus. MAC-Ego3D enables agents to independently construct, align, and iteratively refine local maps using a unified Gaussian splat representation. Through Intra-Agent Gaussian Consensus, it enforces spatial coherence among neighboring Gaussian splats within an agent. For global alignment, parallelized Inter-Agent Gaussian Consensus, which asynchronously aligns and optimizes local maps by regularizing multi-agent Gaussian splats, seamlessly integrates them into a high-fidelity 3D model. Leveraging Gaussian primitives, MAC-Ego3D supports efficient RGB-D rendering, enabling rapid inter-agent Gaussian association and alignment. MAC-Ego3D bridges local precision and global coherence, delivering higher efficiency, largely reducing localization error, and improving mapping fidelity. It establishes a new SOTA on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, achieving a 15x increase in inference speed, order-of-magnitude reductions in ego-motion estimation error for partial cases, and RGB PSNR gains of 4 to 10 dB.

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models in computer vision have achieved significant success but pose increasing concerns about energy consumption and sustainability. Despite these concerns, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of their energy efficiency during inference. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the inference energy consumption of 1,200 ImageNet classification models - the largest evaluation of its kind to date. Our findings reveal a steep diminishing return in accuracy gains relative to the increase in energy usage, highlighting sustainability concerns in the pursuit of marginal improvements. We identify key factors contributing to energy consumption and demonstrate methods to improve energy efficiency. To promote more sustainable AI practices, we introduce an energy efficiency scoring system and develop an interactive web application that allows users to compare models based on accuracy and energy consumption. By providing extensive empirical data and practical tools, we aim to facilitate informed decision-making and encourage collaborative efforts in developing energy-efficient AI technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faith Johnson, Ryan Meegan, Jack Lowry, Peter Oudemans, Kristin Dana</p>
<p>Abstract: Agricultural domains are being transformed by recent advances in AI and computer vision that support quantitative visual evaluation. Using aerial and ground imaging over a time series, we develop a framework for characterizing the ripening process of cranberry crops, a crucial component for precision agriculture tasks such as comparing crop breeds (high-throughput phenotyping) and detecting disease. Using drone imaging, we capture images from 20 waypoints across multiple bogs, and using ground-based imaging (hand-held camera), we image same bog patch using fixed fiducial markers. Both imaging methods are repeated to gather a multi-week time series spanning the entire growing season. Aerial imaging provides multiple samples to compute a distribution of albedo values. Ground imaging enables tracking of individual berries for a detailed view of berry appearance changes. Using vision transformers (ViT) for feature detection after segmentation, we extract a high dimensional feature descriptor of berry appearance. Interpretability of appearance is critical for plant biologists and cranberry growers to support crop breeding decisions (e.g.\ comparison of berry varieties from breeding programs). For interpretability, we create a 2D manifold of cranberry appearance by using a UMAP dimensionality reduction on ViT features. This projection enables quantification of ripening paths and a useful metric of ripening rate. We demonstrate the comparison of four cranberry varieties based on our ripening assessments. This work is the first of its kind and has future impact for cranberries and for other crops including wine grapes, olives, blueberries, and maize. Aerial and ground datasets are made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Serap A. Savari</p>
<p>Abstract: Superresolution theory and techniques seek to recover signals from samples in the presence of blur and noise. Discrete image registration can be an approach to fuse information from different sets of samples of the same signal. Quantization errors in the spatial domain are inherent to digital images. We consider superresolution and discrete image registration for one-dimensional spatially-limited piecewise constant functions which are subject to blur which is Gaussian or a mixture of Gaussians as well as to round-off errors. We describe a signal-dependent measurement matrix which captures both types of effects. For this setting we show that the difficulties in determining the discontinuity points from two sets of samples even in the absence of other types of noise. If the samples are also subject to statistical noise, then it is necessary to align and segment the data sequences to make the most effective inferences about the amplitudes and discontinuity points. Under some conditions on the blur, the noise, and the distance between discontinuity points, we prove that we can correctly align and determine the first samples following each discontinuity point in two data sequences with an approach based on dynamic programming.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Athar, Xueqing Deng, Liang-Chieh Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have expanded research in video understanding, primarily focusing on high-level tasks such as video captioning and question-answering. Meanwhile, a smaller body of work addresses dense, pixel-precise segmentation tasks, which typically involve category-guided or referral-based object segmentation. Although both research directions are essential for developing models with human-level video comprehension, they have largely evolved separately, with distinct benchmarks and architectures. This paper aims to unify these efforts by introducing ViCaS, a new dataset containing thousands of challenging videos, each annotated with detailed, human-written captions and temporally consistent, pixel-accurate masks for multiple objects with phrase grounding. Our benchmark evaluates models on both holistic/high-level understanding and language-guided, pixel-precise segmentation. We also present carefully validated evaluation measures and propose an effective model architecture that can tackle our benchmark. Project page: https://ali2500.github.io/vicas-project/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Morgan B. Talbot, Gabriel Kreiman, James J. DiCarlo, Guy Gaziv</p>
<p>Abstract: The currently leading artificial neural network (ANN) models of the visual ventral stream -- which are derived from a combination of performance optimization and robustification methods -- have demonstrated a remarkable degree of behavioral alignment with humans on visual categorization tasks. Extending upon previous work, we show that not only can these models guide image perturbations that change the induced human category percepts, but they also can enhance human ability to accurately report the original ground truth. Furthermore, we find that the same models can also be used out-of-the-box to predict the proportion of correct human responses to individual images, providing a simple, human-aligned estimator of the relative difficulty of each image. Motivated by these observations, we propose to augment visual learning in humans in a way that improves human categorization accuracy at test time. Our learning augmentation approach consists of (i) selecting images based on their model-estimated recognition difficulty, and (ii) using image perturbations that aid recognition for novice learners. We find that combining these model-based strategies gives rise to test-time categorization accuracy gains of 33-72% relative to control subjects without these interventions, despite using the same number of training feedback trials. Surprisingly, beyond the accuracy gain, the training time for the augmented learning group was also shorter by 20-23%. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a fine-grained categorization task with natural images, as well as tasks in two clinically relevant image domains -- histology and dermoscopy -- where visual learning is notoriously challenging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of ANNs to increase visual learning performance in humans by enhancing category-specific features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Yang, Pratusha Bhuvana Prasad, Qing Zhang, Yajie Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately measuring the geometry and spatially-varying reflectance of real-world objects is a complex task due to their intricate shapes formed by concave features, hollow engravings and diverse surfaces, resulting in inter-reflection and occlusion when photographed. Moreover, issues like lens flare and overexposure can arise from interference from secondary reflections and limitations of hardware even in professional studios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using polarized reflectance field capture and a comprehensive statistical analysis algorithm to obtain highly accurate surface normals (within 0.1mm/px) and spatially-varying reflectance data, including albedo, specular separation, roughness, and anisotropy parameters for realistic rendering and analysis. Our algorithm removes image artifacts via analytical modeling and further employs both an initial step and an optimization step computed on the whole image collection to further enhance the precision of per-pixel surface reflectance and normal measurement. We showcase the captured shapes and reflectance of diverse objects with a wide material range, spanning from highly diffuse to highly glossy - a challenge unaddressed by prior techniques. Our approach enhances downstream applications by offering precise measurements for realistic rendering and provides a valuable training dataset for emerging research in inverse rendering. We will release the polarized reflectance fields of several captured objects with this work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-Jui Ho, Yash Belhe, Steve Rotenberg, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Tzu-Mao Li, Nicholas Antipa</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end optimization, which simultaneously optimizes optics and algorithms, has emerged as a powerful data-driven method for computational imaging system design. This method achieves joint optimization through backpropagation by incorporating differentiable optics simulators to generate measurements and algorithms to extract information from measurements. However, due to high computational costs, it is challenging to model both aberration and diffraction in light transport for end-to-end optimization of compound optics. Therefore, most existing methods compromise physical accuracy by neglecting wave optics effects or off-axis aberrations, which raises concerns about the robustness of the resulting designs. In this paper, we propose a differentiable optics simulator that efficiently models both aberration and diffraction for compound optics. Using the simulator, we conduct end-to-end optimization on scene reconstruction and classification. Experimental results demonstrate that both lenses and algorithms adopt different configurations depending on whether wave optics is modeled. We also show that systems optimized without wave optics suffer from performance degradation when wave optics effects are introduced during testing. These findings underscore the importance of accurate wave optics modeling in optimizing imaging systems for robust, high-performance applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qibo Chen, Weizhong Jin, Jianyue Ge, Mengdi Liu, Yuchao Yan, Jian Jiang, Li Yu, Xuanjiang Guo, Shuchang Li, Jianzhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research on universal object detection aims to introduce language in a SoTA closed-set detector and then generalize the open-set concepts by constructing large-scale (text-region) datasets for training. However, these methods face two main challenges: (i) how to efficiently use the prior information in the prompts to genericise objects and (ii) how to reduce alignment bias in the downstream tasks, both leading to sub-optimal performance in some scenarios beyond pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose a strong universal detection foundation model called CP-DETR, which is competitive in almost all scenarios, with only one pre-training weight. Specifically, we design an efficient prompt visual hybrid encoder that enhances the information interaction between prompt and visual through scale-by-scale and multi-scale fusion modules. Then, the hybrid encoder is facilitated to fully utilize the prompted information by prompt multi-label loss and auxiliary detection head. In addition to text prompts, we have designed two practical concept prompt generation methods, visual prompt and optimized prompt, to extract abstract concepts through concrete visual examples and stably reduce alignment bias in downstream tasks. With these effective designs, CP-DETR demonstrates superior universal detection performance in a broad spectrum of scenarios. For example, our Swin-T backbone model achieves 47.6 zero-shot AP on LVIS, and the Swin-L backbone model achieves 32.2 zero-shot AP on ODinW35. Furthermore, our visual prompt generation method achieves 68.4 AP on COCO val by interactive detection, and the optimized prompt achieves 73.1 fully-shot AP on ODinW13.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Zhang, Fanshuo Zeng, Yihao Quan, Zheng Hui, Jiawei Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models have experienced rapid growth, and numerous different models have emerged. The interpretability of LVLMs remains an under-explored area. Especially when faced with more complex tasks such as chain-of-thought reasoning, its internal mechanisms still resemble a black box that is difficult to decipher. By studying the interaction and information flow between images and text, we noticed that in models such as LLaVA1.5, image tokens that are semantically related to text are more likely to have information flow convergence in the LLM decoding layer, and these image tokens receive higher attention scores. However, those image tokens that are less relevant to the text do not have information flow convergence, and they only get very small attention scores. To efficiently utilize the image information, we propose a new image token reduction method, Simignore, which aims to improve the complex reasoning ability of LVLMs by computing the similarity between image and text embeddings and ignoring image tokens that are irrelevant and unimportant to the text. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for complex reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Zheng, Jing Wang, Fuwei Zhao, Xujie Zhang, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video try-on stands as a promising area for its tremendous real-world potential. Previous research on video try-on has primarily focused on transferring product clothing images to videos with simple human poses, while performing poorly with complex movements. To better preserve clothing details, those approaches are armed with an additional garment encoder, resulting in higher computational resource consumption. The primary challenges in this domain are twofold: (1) leveraging the garment encoder's capabilities in video try-on while lowering computational requirements; (2) ensuring temporal consistency in the synthesis of human body parts, especially during rapid movements. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel video try-on framework based on Diffusion Transformer(DiT), named Dynamic Try-On.
  To reduce computational overhead, we adopt a straightforward approach by utilizing the DiT backbone itself as the garment encoder and employing a dynamic feature fusion module to store and integrate garment features. To ensure temporal consistency of human body parts, we introduce a limb-aware dynamic attention module that enforces the DiT backbone to focus on the regions of human limbs during the denoising process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Dynamic Try-On in generating stable and smooth try-on results, even for videos featuring complicated human postures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xunnong Xu, Mengying Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion transformers enable flexible generative modeling for video. However, it is still technically challenging and computationally expensive to generate high-resolution videos with rich semantics and complex motion. Similar to languages, video data are also auto-regressive by nature, so it is counter-intuitive to use attention mechanism with bi-directional dependency in the model. Here we propose a Multi-Scale Causal (MSC) framework to address these problems. Specifically, we introduce multiple resolutions in the spatial dimension and high-low frequencies in the temporal dimension to realize efficient attention calculation. Furthermore, attention blocks on multiple scales are combined in a controlled way to allow causal conditioning on noisy image frames for diffusion training, based on the idea that noise destroys information at different rates on different resolutions. We theoretically show that our approach can greatly reduce the computational complexity and enhance the efficiency of training. The causal attention diffusion framework can also be used for auto-regressive long video generation, without violating the natural order of frame sequences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miguel Costa, Manuel Marques, Carlos Lima Azevedo, Felix Wilhelm Siebert, Filipe Moura</p>
<p>Abstract: Cycling is critical for cities to transition to more sustainable transport modes. Yet, safety concerns remain a critical deterrent for individuals to cycle. If individuals perceive an environment as unsafe for cycling, it is likely that they will prefer other means of transportation. Yet, capturing and understanding how individuals perceive cycling risk is complex and often slow, with researchers defaulting to traditional surveys and in-loco interviews. In this study, we tackle this problem. We base our approach on using pairwise comparisons of real-world images, repeatedly presenting respondents with pairs of road environments and asking them to select the one they perceive as safer for cycling, if any. Using the collected data, we train a siamese-convolutional neural network using a multi-loss framework that learns from individuals' responses, learns preferences directly from images, and includes ties (often discarded in the literature). Effectively, this model learns to predict human-style perceptions, evaluating which cycling environments are perceived as safer. Our model achieves good results, showcasing this approach has a real-life impact, such as improving interventions' effectiveness. Furthermore, it facilitates the continuous assessment of changing cycling environments, permitting short-term evaluations of measures to enhance perceived cycling safety. Finally, our method can be efficiently deployed in different locations with a growing number of openly available street-view images.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09841">Super-Resolution for Remote Sensing Imagery via the Coupling of a Variational Model and Deep Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Sun, Huanfeng Shen, Qiangqiang Yuan, Liangpei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) is an effective way to enhance the spatial resolution and detail information of remote sensing images, to obtain a superior visual quality. As SR is severely ill-conditioned, effective image priors are necessary to regularize the solution space and generate the corresponding high-resolution (HR) image. In this paper, we propose a novel gradient-guided multi-frame super-resolution (MFSR) framework for remote sensing imagery reconstruction. The framework integrates a learned gradient prior as the regularization term into a model-based optimization method. Specifically, the local gradient regularization (LGR) prior is derived from the deep residual attention network (DRAN) through gradient profile transformation. The non-local total variation (NLTV) prior is characterized using the spatial structure similarity of the gradient patches with the maximum a posteriori (MAP) model. The modeled prior performs well in preserving edge smoothness and suppressing visual artifacts, while the learned prior is effective in enhancing sharp edges and recovering fine structures. By incorporating the two complementary priors into an adaptive norm based reconstruction framework, the mixed L1 and L2 regularization minimization problem is optimized to achieve the required HR remote sensing image. Extensive experimental results on remote sensing data demonstrate that the proposed method can produce visually pleasant images and is superior to several of the state-of-the-art SR algorithms in terms of the quantitative evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzhong Guo, Shen Nie, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Hao Sun, Chongxuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized diffusion models, capable of synthesizing highly realistic images based on a few reference portraits, pose substantial social, ethical, and legal risks by enabling identity replication. Existing defense mechanisms rely on computationally intensive adversarial perturbations tailored to individual images, rendering them impractical for real-world deployment. This study introduces Real-time Identity Defender (RID), a neural network designed to generate adversarial perturbations through a single forward pass, bypassing the need for image-specific optimization. RID achieves unprecedented efficiency, with defense times as low as 0.12 seconds on a single GPU (4,400 times faster than leading methods) and 1.1 seconds per image on a standard Intel i9 CPU, making it suitable for edge devices such as smartphones. Despite its efficiency, RID matches state-of-the-art performance across visual and quantitative benchmarks, effectively mitigating identity replication risks. Our analysis reveals that RID's perturbations mimic the efficacy of traditional defenses while exhibiting properties distinct from natural noise, such as Gaussian perturbations. To enhance robustness, we extend RID into an ensemble framework that integrates multiple pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, ensuring resilience against black-box attacks and post-processing techniques, including JPEG compression and diffusion-based purification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-video generation enhances content creation but is highly computationally intensive: The computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) scales quadratically in the number of pixels. This makes minute-length video generation extremely expensive, limiting most existing models to generating videos of only 10-20 seconds length. We propose a Linear-complexity text-to-video Generation (LinGen) framework whose cost scales linearly in the number of pixels. For the first time, LinGen enables high-resolution minute-length video generation on a single GPU without compromising quality. It replaces the computationally-dominant and quadratic-complexity block, self-attention, with a linear-complexity block called MATE, which consists of an MA-branch and a TE-branch. The MA-branch targets short-to-long-range correlations, combining a bidirectional Mamba2 block with our token rearrangement method, Rotary Major Scan, and our review tokens developed for long video generation. The TE-branch is a novel TEmporal Swin Attention block that focuses on temporal correlations between adjacent tokens and medium-range tokens. The MATE block addresses the adjacency preservation issue of Mamba and improves the consistency of generated videos significantly. Experimental results show that LinGen outperforms DiT (with a 75.6% win rate) in video quality with up to 15$\times$ (11.5$\times$) FLOPs (latency) reduction. Furthermore, both automatic metrics and human evaluation demonstrate our LinGen-4B yields comparable video quality to state-of-the-art models (with a 50.5%, 52.1%, 49.1% win rate with respect to Gen-3, LumaLabs, and Kling, respectively). This paves the way to hour-length movie generation and real-time interactive video generation.

<p>Abstract: Semantic location prediction from multimodal social media posts is a critical task with applications in personalized services and human mobility analysis. This paper introduces \textit{Contextualized Vision-Language Alignment (CoVLA)}, a discriminative framework designed to address the challenges of contextual ambiguity and modality discrepancy inherent in this task. CoVLA leverages a Contextual Alignment Module (CAM) to enhance cross-modal feature alignment and a Cross-modal Fusion Module (CMF) to dynamically integrate textual and visual information. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that CoVLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 2.3\% in accuracy and 2.5\% in F1-score. Ablation studies validate the contributions of CAM and CMF, while human evaluations highlight the contextual relevance of the predictions. Additionally, robustness analysis shows that CoVLA maintains high performance under noisy conditions, making it a reliable solution for real-world applications. These results underscore the potential of CoVLA in advancing semantic location prediction research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhua Zhang, Yi Gao, Ruyu Liu, Xu Cheng, Houxiang Zhang, Shengyong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a model compression technique that transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model to enhance its performance. Existing methods often assume that the student model is inherently inferior to the teacher model. However, we identify that the fundamental issue affecting student performance is the bias transferred by the teacher. Current KD frameworks transmit both right and wrong knowledge, introducing bias that misleads the student model. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy to rectify bias and greatly improve the student model's performance. Our strategy involves three steps: First, we differentiate knowledge and design a bias elimination method to filter out biases, retaining only the right knowledge for the student model to learn. Next, we propose a bias rectification method to rectify the teacher model's wrong predictions, fundamentally addressing bias interference. The student model learns from both the right knowledge and the rectified biases, greatly improving its prediction accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic learning approach with a loss function that updates weights dynamically, allowing the student model to quickly learn right knowledge-based easy tasks initially and tackle hard tasks corresponding to biases later, greatly enhancing the student model's learning efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first strategy enabling the student model to surpass the teacher model. Experiments demonstrate that our strategy, as a plug-and-play module, is versatile across various mainstream KD frameworks. We will release our code after the paper is accepted.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, fine-tuning these models for domain-specific applications remains a computationally intensive challenge. This paper introduces State Space Memory Integration (SSMI), a novel approach for efficient fine-tuning of LVLMs. By integrating lightweight Mamba-based state space modules into the LVLM architecture, SSMI captures long-range dependencies and injects task-specific visual and sequential patterns effectively. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods, SSMI requires only a fraction of the model's parameters to be updated, making it computationally efficient and scalable. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including COCO Captioning, VQA, and Flickr30k, demonstrate that SSMI achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness and generalization capabilities. Comprehensive analysis further validates the advantages of SSMI in terms of efficiency, adaptability, and interpretability, positioning it as a compelling solution for fine-tuning large-scale vision-language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable progress in neural rendering. Extracting geometry from NeRF typically relies on the Marching Cubes algorithm, which uses a hand-crafted threshold to define the level set. However, this threshold-based approach requires laborious and scenario-specific tuning, limiting its practicality for real-world applications. In this work, we seek to enhance the efficiency of this method during the training time. To this end, we introduce a spiking neuron mechanism that dynamically adjusts the threshold, eliminating the need for manual selection. Despite its promise, directly training with the spiking neuron often results in model collapse and noisy outputs. To overcome these challenges, we propose a round-robin strategy that stabilizes the training process and enables the geometry network to achieve a sharper and more precise density distribution with minimal computational overhead. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our method significantly improves the performance of threshold-based techniques, offering a more robust and efficient solution for NeRF geometry extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangxi Tian, Jie Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating continuous environmental models from sparsely sampled data is a critical challenge in spatial modeling, particularly for topography. Traditional spatial interpolation methods often struggle with handling sparse measurements. To address this, we propose a Transformer-based Generative Model for Spatial Interpolation (T-GMSI) using a vision transformer (ViT) architecture for digital elevation model (DEM) generation under sparse conditions. T-GMSI replaces traditional convolution-based methods with ViT for feature extraction and DEM interpolation while incorporating a terrain feature-aware loss function for enhanced accuracy. T-GMSI excels in producing high-quality elevation surfaces from datasets with over 70% sparsity and demonstrates strong transferability across diverse landscapes without fine-tuning. Its performance is validated through extensive experiments, outperforming traditional methods such as ordinary Kriging (OK) and natural neighbor (NN) and a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN)-based model (CEDGAN). Compared to OK and NN, T-GMSI reduces root mean square error (RMSE) by 40% and 25% on airborne lidar data and by 23% and 10% on spaceborne lidar data. Against CEDGAN, T-GMSI achieves a 20% RMSE improvement on provided DEM data, requiring no fine-tuning. The ability of model on generalizing to large, unseen terrains underscores its transferability and potential applicability beyond topographic modeling. This research establishes T-GMSI as a state-of-the-art solution for spatial interpolation on sparse datasets and highlights its broader utility for other sparse data interpolation challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Liu, Ziyang Ma, Qi Chen, Feilong Chen, Shuai Fan, Xie Chen, Kai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present VQTalker, a Vector Quantization-based framework for multilingual talking head generation that addresses the challenges of lip synchronization and natural motion across diverse languages. Our approach is grounded in the phonetic principle that human speech comprises a finite set of distinct sound units (phonemes) and corresponding visual articulations (visemes), which often share commonalities across languages. We introduce a facial motion tokenizer based on Group Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (GRFSQ), which creates a discretized representation of facial features. This method enables comprehensive capture of facial movements while improving generalization to multiple languages, even with limited training data. Building on this quantized representation, we implement a coarse-to-fine motion generation process that progressively refines facial animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VQTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video-driven and speech-driven scenarios, particularly in multilingual settings. Notably, our method achieves high-quality results at a resolution of 512*512 pixels while maintaining a lower bitrate of approximately 11 kbps.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09895">Building a Multi-modal Spatiotemporal Expert for Zero-shot Action Recognition with CLIP</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yating Yu, Congqi Cao, Yueran Zhang, Qinyi Lv, Lingtong Min, Yanning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR) requires collaborative multi-modal spatiotemporal understanding. However, finetuning CLIP directly for ZSAR yields suboptimal performance, given its inherent constraints in capturing essential temporal dynamics from both vision and text perspectives, especially when encountering novel actions with fine-grained spatiotemporal discrepancies. In this work, we propose Spatiotemporal Dynamic Duo (STDD), a novel CLIP-based framework to comprehend multi-modal spatiotemporal dynamics synergistically. For the vision side, we propose an efficient Space-time Cross Attention, which captures spatiotemporal dynamics flexibly with simple yet effective operations applied before and after spatial attention, without adding additional parameters or increasing computational complexity. For the semantic side, we conduct spatiotemporal text augmentation by comprehensively constructing an Action Semantic Knowledge Graph (ASKG) to derive nuanced text prompts. The ASKG elaborates on static and dynamic concepts and their interrelations, based on the idea of decomposing actions into spatial appearances and temporal motions. During the training phase, the frame-level video representations are meticulously aligned with prompt-level nuanced text representations, which are concurrently regulated by the video representations from the frozen CLIP to enhance generalizability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, which consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches on popular video benchmarks (i.e., Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51) under challenging ZSAR settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Li, Yisheng He, Lei Zhong, Weichao Shen, Qi Zuo, Lingteng Qiu, Zilong Dong, Laurence Tianruo Yang, Weihao Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating motion sequences conforming to a target style while adhering to the given content prompts requires accommodating both the content and style. In existing methods, the information usually only flows from style to content, which may cause conflict between the style and content, harming the integration. Differently, in this work we build a bidirectional control flow between the style and the content, also adjusting the style towards the content, in which case the style-content collision is alleviated and the dynamics of the style is better preserved in the integration. Moreover, we extend the stylized motion generation from one modality, i.e. the style motion, to multiple modalities including texts and images through contrastive learning, leading to flexible style control on the motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across different datasets, while also enabling multimodal signals control. The code of our method will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sosuke Yamao, Natsuki Miyahara, Yuki Harazono, Shun Takeuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing complexity of video data and the need for more efficient long-term temporal understanding, existing long-term video understanding methods often fail to accurately capture and analyze extended video sequences. These methods typically struggle to maintain performance over longer durations and to handle the intricate dependencies within the video content. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective large multi-modal model framework for long-term video understanding that incorporates a novel visual compressor, the In-context, Question Adaptive Visual Compressor (IQViC). The key idea, inspired by humans' selective attention and in-context memory mechanisms, is to introduce a novel visual compressor and incorporate efficient memory management techniques to enhance long-term video question answering. Our framework utilizes IQViC, a transformer-based visual compressor, enabling question-conditioned in-context compression, unlike existing methods that rely on full video visual features. This selectively extracts relevant information, significantly reducing memory token requirements. Through extensive experiments on a new dataset based on InfiniBench for long-term video understanding, and standard benchmarks used for existing methods' evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IQViC framework and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of video understanding accuracy and memory efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasamin Medghalchi, Moein Heidari, Clayton Allard, Leonid Sigal, Ilker Hacihaliloglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer significant promise for improving breast cancer diagnosis in medical imaging. However, these models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks--small, imperceptible changes that can mislead classifiers--raising critical concerns about their reliability and security. Traditional attacks rely on fixed-norm perturbations, misaligning with human perception. In contrast, diffusion-based attacks require pre-trained models, demanding substantial data when these models are unavailable, limiting practical use in data-scarce scenarios. In medical imaging, however, this is often unfeasible due to the limited availability of datasets. Building on recent advancements in learnable prompts, we propose Prompt2Perturb (P2P), a novel language-guided attack method capable of generating meaningful attack examples driven by text instructions. During the prompt learning phase, our approach leverages learnable prompts within the text encoder to create subtle, yet impactful, perturbations that remain imperceptible while guiding the model towards targeted outcomes. In contrast to current prompt learning-based approaches, our P2P stands out by directly updating text embeddings, avoiding the need for retraining diffusion models. Further, we leverage the finding that optimizing only the early reverse diffusion steps boosts efficiency while ensuring that the generated adversarial examples incorporate subtle noise, thus preserving ultrasound image quality without introducing noticeable artifacts. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art attack techniques across three breast ultrasound datasets in FID and LPIPS. Moreover, the generated images are both more natural in appearance and more effective compared to existing adversarial attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Zhou, Haoyu Zhang, Jiakang Yuan, Peng Ye, Tao Chen, Hao Jiang, Meiya Chen, Yangyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As a fundamental vision task, stereo matching has made remarkable progress. While recent iterative optimization-based methods have achieved promising performance, their feature extraction capabilities still have room for improvement. Inspired by the ability of vision foundation models (VFMs) to extract general representations, in this work, we propose AIO-Stereo which can flexibly select and transfer knowledge from multiple heterogeneous VFMs to a single stereo matching model. To better reconcile features between heterogeneous VFMs and the stereo matching model and fully exploit prior knowledge from VFMs, we proposed a dual-level feature utilization mechanism that aligns heterogeneous features and transfers multi-level knowledge. Based on the mechanism, a dual-level selective knowledge transfer module is designed to selectively transfer knowledge and integrate the advantages of multiple VFMs. Experimental results show that AIO-Stereo achieves start-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and ranks $1^{st}$ on the Middlebury dataset and outperforms all the published work on the ETH3D benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuqiang Lu, Zhenfei Yin, Mengwei He, Zhihui Wang, Zicheng Liu, Zhiyong Wang, Kun Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Wang, Wenpeng Neng, Zhenao Wei, Yu Lei, Weiying Xue, Nan Zhuang, Yanwu Xu, Xinyu Jiang, Qi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-object contact (HOT) is designed to accurately identify the areas where humans and objects come into contact. Current methods frequently fail to account for scenarios where objects are frequently blocking the view, resulting in inaccurate identification of contact areas. To tackle this problem, we suggest using a perspective interaction HOT detector called PIHOT, which utilizes a depth map generation model to offer depth information of humans and objects related to the camera, thereby preventing false interaction detection. Furthermore, we use mask dilatation and object restoration techniques to restore the texture details in covered areas, improve the boundaries between objects, and enhance the perception of humans interacting with objects. Moreover, a spatial awareness perception is intended to concentrate on the characteristic features close to the points of contact. The experimental results show that the PIHOT algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets for HOT detection tasks. Compared to the most recent DHOT, our method enjoys an average improvement of 13%, 27.5%, 16%, and 18.5% on SC-Acc., C-Acc., mIoU, and wIoU metrics, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehwan Jeong, Sumin In, Sieun Kim, Hannie Shin, Jongheon Jeong, Sang Ho Yoon, Jaewook Chung, Sangpil Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The rising use of deepfakes in criminal activities presents a significant issue, inciting widespread controversy. While numerous studies have tackled this problem, most primarily focus on deepfake detection. These reactive solutions are insufficient as a fundamental approach for crimes where authenticity verification is not critical. Existing proactive defenses also have limitations, as they are effective only for deepfake models based on specific Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), making them less applicable in light of recent advancements in diffusion-based models. In this paper, we propose a proactive defense method named FaceShield, which introduces novel attack strategies targeting deepfakes generated by Diffusion Models (DMs) and facilitates attacks on various existing GAN-based deepfake models through facial feature extractor manipulations. Our approach consists of three main components: (i) manipulating the attention mechanism of DMs to exclude protected facial features during the denoising process, (ii) targeting prominent facial feature extraction models to enhance the robustness of our adversarial perturbation, and (iii) employing Gaussian blur and low-pass filtering techniques to improve imperceptibility while enhancing robustness against JPEG distortion. Experimental results on the CelebA-HQ and VGGFace2-HQ datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance against the latest deepfake models based on DMs, while also exhibiting applicability to GANs and showcasing greater imperceptibility of noise along with enhanced robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: The obesity phenomenon, known as the heavy issue, is a leading cause of preventable chronic diseases worldwide. Traditional calorie estimation tools often rely on specific data formats or complex pipelines, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have excelled in understanding real-world contexts and enabling conversational interactions, making them ideal for downstream tasks such as ingredient analysis. However, applying VLMs to calorie estimation requires domain-specific data and alignment strategies. To this end, we curated CalData, a 330K image-text pair dataset tailored for ingredient recognition and calorie estimation, combining a large-scale recipe dataset with detailed nutritional instructions for robust vision-language training. Built upon this dataset, we present CaLoRAify, a novel VLM framework aligning ingredient recognition and calorie estimation via training with visual-text pairs. During inference, users only need a single monocular food image to estimate calories while retaining the flexibility of agent-based conversational interaction. With Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Retrieve-augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, our system enhances the performance of foundational VLMs in the vertical domain of calorie estimation.

Eighteen configurations were tested on 67 subjects in static and dynamic conditions. The best results in static conditions were achieved with the Medium Bounding box, Sobel Filter, and Harris Method (MAE: 0.85, RMSE: 1.49). In dynamic conditions, the Large Bounding box with no filter and ShiTomasi, and Medium Bounding box with no filter and Harris, produced the lowest MAE (0.81) and RMSE (1.35)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Zhong, Bin Chen, Hao Fang, Xulin Gu, Shu-Tao Xia, En-Hui Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to minimize the time and memory consumption needed for training deep neural networks on large datasets, by creating a smaller synthetic dataset that has similar performance to that of the full real dataset. However, current dataset distillation methods often result in synthetic datasets that are excessively difficult for networks to learn from, due to the compression of a substantial amount of information from the original data through metrics measuring feature similarity, e,g., distribution matching (DM). In this work, we introduce conditional mutual information (CMI) to assess the class-aware complexity of a dataset and propose a novel method by minimizing CMI. Specifically, we minimize the distillation loss while constraining the class-aware complexity of the synthetic dataset by minimizing its empirical CMI from the feature space of pre-trained networks, simultaneously. Conducting on a thorough set of experiments, we show that our method can serve as a general regularization method to existing DD methods and improve the performance and training efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of general human knowledge and impressive logical reasoning capacity in rapidly progressed vision-language models (VLMs) have driven increasing interest in applying VLMs to high-level autonomous driving tasks, such as scene understanding and decision-making. However, an in-depth study on the relationship between knowledge proficiency, especially essential driving expertise, and closed-loop autonomous driving performance requires further exploration. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the depth and breadth of fundamental driving knowledge on closed-loop trajectory planning and introduce WiseAD, a specialized VLM tailored for end-to-end autonomous driving capable of driving reasoning, action justification, object recognition, risk analysis, driving suggestions, and trajectory planning across diverse scenarios. We employ joint training on driving knowledge and planning datasets, enabling the model to perform knowledge-aligned trajectory planning accordingly. Extensive experiments indicate that as the diversity of driving knowledge extends, critical accidents are notably reduced, contributing 11.9% and 12.4% improvements in the driving score and route completion on the Carla closed-loop evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, WiseAD also demonstrates remarkable performance in knowledge evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a crucial technique for enhancing visual performance by integrating unique information from different modalities into one fused image. Exiting methods pay more attention to conducting fusion with undisturbed data, while overlooking the impact of deliberate interference on the effectiveness of fusion results. To investigate the robustness of fusion models, in this paper, we propose a novel adversarial attack resilient network, called $\textrm{A}^{\textrm{2}}$RNet. Specifically, we develop an adversarial paradigm with an anti-attack loss function to implement adversarial attacks and training. It is constructed based on the intrinsic nature of IVIF and provide a robust foundation for future research advancements. We adopt a Unet as the pipeline with a transformer-based defensive refinement module (DRM) under this paradigm, which guarantees fused image quality in a robust coarse-to-fine manner. Compared to previous works, our method mitigates the adverse effects of adversarial perturbations, consistently maintaining high-fidelity fusion results. Furthermore, the performance of downstream tasks can also be well maintained under adversarial attacks. Code is available at https://github.com/lok-18/A2RNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Zhong, Shuoyang Sun, Xulin Gu, Zhaoyang Xu, Yaowei Wang, Jianlong Wu, Bin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation offers an efficient way to reduce memory and computational costs by optimizing a smaller dataset with performance comparable to the full-scale original. However, for large datasets and complex deep networks (e.g., ImageNet-1K with ResNet-101), the extensive optimization space limits performance, reducing its practicality. Recent approaches employ pre-trained diffusion models to generate informative images directly, avoiding pixel-level optimization and achieving notable results. However, these methods often face challenges due to distribution shifts between pre-trained models and target datasets, along with the need for multiple distillation steps across varying settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework orthogonal to existing diffusion-based distillation methods, leveraging diffusion models for selection rather than generation. Our method starts by predicting noise generated by the diffusion model based on input images and text prompts (with or without label text), then calculates the corresponding loss for each pair. With the loss differences, we identify distinctive regions of the original images. Additionally, we perform intra-class clustering and ranking on selected patches to maintain diversity constraints. This streamlined framework enables a single-step distillation process, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Sun, Han Fang, Yuxing Lu, Chengxin Zhao, Hefei Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: DNN-based watermarking methods have rapidly advanced, with the ``Encoder-Noise Layer-Decoder'' (END) framework being the most widely used. To ensure end-to-end training, the noise layer in the framework must be differentiable. However, real-world distortions are often non-differentiable, leading to challenges in end-to-end training. Existing solutions only treat the distortion perturbation as additive noise, which does not fully integrate the effect of distortion in training. To better incorporate non-differentiable distortions into training, we propose a novel dual-decoder architecture (END$^2$). Unlike conventional END architecture, our method employs two structurally identical decoders: the Teacher Decoder, processing pure watermarked images, and the Student Decoder, handling distortion-perturbed images. The gradient is backpropagated only through the Teacher Decoder branch to optimize the encoder thus bypassing the problem of non-differentiability. To ensure resistance to arbitrary distortions, we enforce alignment of the two decoders' feature representations by maximizing the cosine similarity between their intermediate vectors on a hypersphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under various non-differentiable distortions. Moreover, even without the differentiability constraint, our method surpasses baselines with a differentiable noise layer. Our approach is effective and easily implementable across all END architectures, enhancing practicality and generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Sheng, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo, Jiantao Zhou, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Image forgery localization (IFL) is a crucial technique for preventing tampered image misuse and protecting social safety. However, due to the rapid development of image tampering technologies, extracting more comprehensive and accurate forgery clues remains an urgent challenge. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel information-theoretic IFL framework named SUMI-IFL that imposes sufficiency-view and minimality-view constraints on forgery feature representation. First, grounded in the theoretical analysis of mutual information, the sufficiency-view constraint is enforced on the feature extraction network to ensure that the latent forgery feature contains comprehensive forgery clues. Considering that forgery clues obtained from a single aspect alone may be incomplete, we construct the latent forgery feature by integrating several individual forgery features from multiple perspectives. Second, based on the information bottleneck, the minimality-view constraint is imposed on the feature reasoning network to achieve an accurate and concise forgery feature representation that counters the interference of task-unrelated features. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of SUMI-IFL to existing state-of-the-art methods, not only on in-dataset comparisons but also on cross-dataset comparisons.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from in-the-wild monocular videos is challenging due to scene dynamics and the lack of multi-view cues. To address this, we propose SplineGS, a COLMAP-free dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework for high-quality reconstruction and fast rendering from monocular videos. At its core is a novel Motion-Adaptive Spline (MAS) method, which represents continuous dynamic 3D Gaussian trajectories using cubic Hermite splines with a small number of control points. For MAS, we introduce a Motion-Adaptive Control points Pruning (MACP) method to model the deformation of each dynamic 3D Gaussian across varying motions, progressively pruning control points while maintaining dynamic modeling integrity. Additionally, we present a joint optimization strategy for camera parameter estimation and 3D Gaussian attributes, leveraging photometric and geometric consistency. This eliminates the need for Structure-from-Motion preprocessing and enhances SplineGS's robustness in real-world conditions. Experiments show that SplineGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis quality for dynamic scenes from monocular videos, achieving thousands times faster rendering speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengmeng Wang, Teli Ma, Shuo Xin, Xiaojun Hou, Jiazheng Xing, Guang Dai, Jingdong Wang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is an attractive and significant research area in computer vision, which aims to recognize and track specific targets in video sequences where the target objects are arbitrary and class-agnostic. The VOT technology could be applied in various scenarios, processing data of diverse modalities such as RGB, thermal infrared and point cloud. Besides, since no one sensor could handle all the dynamic and varying environments, multi-modal VOT is also investigated. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the recent progress of both single-modal and multi-modal VOT, especially the deep learning methods. Specifically, we first review three types of mainstream single-modal VOT, including RGB, thermal infrared and point cloud tracking. In particular, we conclude four widely-used single-modal frameworks, abstracting their schemas and categorizing the existing inheritors. Then we summarize four kinds of multi-modal VOT, including RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, RGB-LiDAR and RGB-Language. Moreover, the comparison results in plenty of VOT benchmarks of the discussed modalities are presented. Finally, we provide recommendations and insightful observations, inspiring the future development of this fast-growing literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sitong Su, Xiao Cai, Lianli Gao, Pengpeng Zeng, Qinhong Du, Mengqi Li, Heng Tao Shen, Jingkuan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in General Text-to-3D (GT23D) have been significant. However, the lack of a benchmark has hindered systematic evaluation and progress due to issues in datasets and metrics: 1) The largest 3D dataset Objaverse suffers from omitted annotations, disorganization, and low-quality. 2) Existing metrics only evaluate textual-image alignment without considering the 3D-level quality. To this end, we are the first to present a comprehensive benchmark for GT23D called GT23D-Bench consisting of: 1) a 400k high-fidelity and well-organized 3D dataset that curated issues in Objaverse through a systematical annotation-organize-filter pipeline; and 2) comprehensive 3D-aware evaluation metrics which encompass 10 clearly defined metrics thoroughly accounting for multi-dimension of GT23D. Notably, GT23D-Bench features three properties: 1) Multimodal Annotations. Our dataset annotates each 3D object with 64-view depth maps, normal maps, rendered images, and coarse-to-fine captions. 2) Holistic Evaluation Dimensions. Our metrics are dissected into a) Textual-3D Alignment measures textual alignment with multi-granularity visual 3D representations; and b) 3D Visual Quality which considers texture fidelity, multi-view consistency, and geometry correctness. 3) Valuable Insights. We delve into the performance of current GT23D baselines across different evaluation dimensions and provide insightful analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our annotations and metrics are aligned with human preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seon-Ho Lee, Jue Wang, David Fan, Zhikang Zhang, Linda Liu, Xiang Hao, Vimal Bhat, Xinyu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio Description (AD) plays a pivotal role as an application system aimed at guaranteeing accessibility in multimedia content, which provides additional narrations at suitable intervals to describe visual elements, catering specifically to the needs of visually impaired audiences. In this paper, we introduce $\mathrm{CA^3D}$, the pioneering unified Context-Aware Automatic Audio Description system that provides AD event scripts with precise locations in the long cinematic content. Specifically, $\mathrm{CA^3D}$ system consists of: 1) a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module to efficiently capture longer term dependencies, 2) an anchor-based AD event detector with feature suppression module that localizes the AD events and extracts discriminative feature for AD generation, and 3) a self-refinement module that leverages the generated output to tweak AD event boundaries from coarse to fine. Unlike conventional methods which rely on metadata and ground truth AD timestamp for AD detection and generation tasks, the proposed $\mathrm{CA^3D}$ is the first end-to-end trainable system that only uses visual cue. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed $\mathrm{CA^3D}$ improves existing architectures for both AD event detection and script generation metrics, establishing the new state-of-the-art performances in the AD automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Hua Huang, Yan-Pei Cao, Yu-Kun Lai, Ying Shan, Lin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Texture synthesis is a fundamental problem in computer graphics that would benefit various applications. Existing methods are effective in handling 2D image textures. In contrast, many real-world textures contain meso-structure in the 3D geometry space, such as grass, leaves, and fabrics, which cannot be effectively modeled using only 2D image textures. We propose a novel texture synthesis method with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to capture and synthesize textures from given multi-view images. In the proposed NeRF texture representation, a scene with fine geometric details is disentangled into the meso-structure textures and the underlying base shape. This allows textures with meso-structure to be effectively learned as latent features situated on the base shape, which are fed into a NeRF decoder trained simultaneously to represent the rich view-dependent appearance. Using this implicit representation, we can synthesize NeRF-based textures through patch matching of latent features. However, inconsistencies between the metrics of the reconstructed content space and the latent feature space may compromise the synthesis quality. To enhance matching performance, we further regularize the distribution of latent features by incorporating a clustering constraint. In addition to generating NeRF textures over a planar domain, our method can also synthesize NeRF textures over curved surfaces, which are practically useful. Experimental results and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang-Bin Zhang, Yujie Zhong, Kai Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods enhance the training of detection transformers by incorporating an auxiliary one-to-many assignment. In this work, we treat the model as a multi-task framework, simultaneously performing one-to-one and one-to-many predictions. We investigate the roles of each component in the transformer decoder across these two training targets, including self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward network. Our empirical results demonstrate that any independent component in the decoder can effectively learn both targets simultaneously, even when other components are shared. This finding leads us to propose a multi-route training mechanism, featuring a primary route for one-to-one prediction and two auxiliary training routes for one-to-many prediction. We enhance the training mechanism with a novel instructive self-attention that dynamically and flexibly guides object queries for one-to-many prediction. The auxiliary routes are removed during inference, ensuring no impact on model architecture or inference cost. We conduct extensive experiments on various baselines, achieving consistent improvements as shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeyuan Wang, Dehong Gao, Lei Yi, Linbo Jin, Jinxia Zhang, Libin Yang, Xiaoyan Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) methods have achieved remarkable improvements across a variety of vision-language tasks, confirming their effectiveness in capturing coarse-grained semantic correlations. However, their capability for fine-grained understanding, which is critical for many nuanced vision-language applications, remains limited. Prevailing VLP models often overlook the intricate distinctions in expressing different modal features and typically depend on the similarity of holistic features for cross-modal interactions. Moreover, these models directly align and integrate features from different modalities, focusing more on coarse-grained general representations, thus failing to capture the nuanced differences necessary for tasks demanding a more detailed perception. In response to these limitations, we introduce Negative Augmented Samples(NAS), a refined vision-language pretraining model that innovatively incorporates NAS to specifically address the challenge of fine-grained understanding. NAS utilizes a Visual Dictionary(VD) as a semantic bridge between visual and linguistic domains. Additionally, it employs a Negative Visual Augmentation(NVA) method based on the VD to generate challenging negative image samples. These samples deviate from positive samples exclusively at the token level, thereby necessitating that the model discerns the subtle disparities between positive and negative samples with greater precision. Comprehensive experiments validate the efficacy of NAS components and underscore its potential to enhance fine-grained vision-language comprehension.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niclas Popp, Dan Zhang, Jan Hendrik Metzen, Matthias Hein, Lukas Schott</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense prediction tasks such as object detection and segmentation require high-quality labels at pixel level, which are costly to obtain. Recent advances in foundation models have enabled the generation of autolabels, which we find to be competitive but not yet sufficient to fully replace human annotations, especially for more complex datasets. Thus, we consider the challenge of selecting a representative subset of images for labeling from a large pool of unlabeled images under a constrained annotation budget. This task is further complicated by imbalanced class distributions, as rare classes are often underrepresented in selected subsets. We propose object-focused data selection (OFDS) which leverages object-level representations to ensure that the selected image subsets semantically cover the target classes, including rare ones. We validate OFDS on PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that prior methods which employ image-level representations fail to consistently outperform random selection. In contrast, OFDS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantial improvements over all baselines in scenarios with imbalanced class distributions. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-training with autolabels on the full datasets before fine-tuning on human-labeled subsets selected by OFDS further enhances the final performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The multi-modal perception methods are thriving in the autonomous driving field due to their better usage of complementary data from different sensors. Such methods depend on calibration and synchronization between sensors to get accurate environmental information. There have already been studies about space-alignment robustness in autonomous driving object detection process, however, the research for time-alignment is relatively few. As in reality experiments, LiDAR point clouds are more challenging for real-time data transfer, our study used historical frames of LiDAR to better align features when the LiDAR data lags exist. We designed a Timealign module to predict and combine LiDAR features with observation to tackle such time misalignment based on SOTA GraphBEV framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Li, Rui Zhao, Zeyu Wang, Huiying Xu, Xinzhong Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images has emerged as a focal area of research, which presents two significant challenges: i) objects are typically small and dense within vast images; ii) computational resource constraints render most models unsuitable for real-time deployment. Current real-time object detectors are not optimized for UAV images, and complex methods designed for small object detection often lack real-time capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detector, RemDet (Reparameter efficient multiplication Detector). Our contributions are as follows: 1) Rethinking the challenges of existing detectors for small and dense UAV images, and proposing information loss as a design guideline for efficient models. 2) We introduce the ChannelC2f module to enhance small object detection performance, demonstrating that high-dimensional representations can effectively mitigate information loss. 3) We design the GatedFFN module to provide not only strong performance but also low latency, effectively addressing the challenges of real-time detection. Our research reveals that GatedFFN, through the use of multiplication, is more cost-effective than feed-forward networks for high-dimensional representation. 4) We propose the CED module, which combines the advantages of ViT and CNN downsampling to effectively reduce information loss. It specifically enhances context information for small and dense objects. Extensive experiments on large UAV datasets, Visdrone and UAVDT, validate the real-time efficiency and superior performance of our methods. On the challenging UAV dataset VisDrone, our methods not only provided state-of-the-art results, improving detection by more than 3.4%, but also achieve 110 FPS on a single 4090.Codes are available at (this URL)(https://github.com/HZAI-ZJNU/RemDet).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runyi Hu, Jie Zhang, Yiming Li, Jiwei Li, Qing Guo, Han Qiu, Tianwei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's digital landscape, the blending of AI-generated and authentic content has underscored the need for copyright protection and content authentication. Watermarking has become a vital tool to address these challenges, safeguarding both generated and real content. Effective watermarking methods must withstand various distortions and attacks. Current deep watermarking techniques often use an encoder-noise layer-decoder architecture and include distortions to enhance robustness. However, they struggle to balance robustness and fidelity and remain vulnerable to adaptive attacks, despite extensive training. To overcome these limitations, we propose SuperMark, a robust, training-free watermarking framework. Inspired by the parallels between watermark embedding/extraction in watermarking and the denoising/noising processes in diffusion models, SuperMark embeds the watermark into initial Gaussian noise using existing techniques. It then applies pre-trained Super-Resolution (SR) models to denoise the watermarked noise, producing the final watermarked image. For extraction, the process is reversed: the watermarked image is inverted back to the initial watermarked noise via DDIM Inversion, from which the embedded watermark is extracted. This flexible framework supports various noise injection methods and diffusion-based SR models, enabling enhanced customization. The robustness of the DDIM Inversion process against perturbations allows SuperMark to achieve strong resilience to distortions while maintaining high fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that SuperMark achieves fidelity comparable to existing methods while significantly improving robustness. Under standard distortions, it achieves an average watermark extraction accuracy of 99.46%, and 89.29% under adaptive attacks. Moreover, SuperMark shows strong transferability across datasets, SR models, embedding methods, and resolutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Zhao, Zehan Bao, Yi Xie, Hong Chen, Yaohui Chen, Weifu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly advanced the field, achieving both panoptic and interactive segmentation of 3D scenes. However, existing methodologies often overlook the critical need for reconstructing specified targets with complex structures from sparse views. To address this issue, we introduce TSGaussian, a novel framework that combines semantic constraints with depth priors to avoid geometry degradation in challenging novel view synthesis tasks. Our approach prioritizes computational resources on designated targets while minimizing background allocation. Bounding boxes from YOLOv9 serve as prompts for Segment Anything Model to generate 2D mask predictions, ensuring semantic accuracy and cost efficiency. TSGaussian effectively clusters 3D gaussians by introducing a compact identity encoding for each Gaussian ellipsoid and incorporating 3D spatial consistency regularization. Leveraging these modules, we propose a pruning strategy to effectively reduce redundancy in 3D gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSGaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three standard datasets and a new challenging dataset we collected, achieving superior results in novel view synthesis of specific objects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohan Zhang, Zhenyu Sun, Yukui Qiu, Junyan Su, Qi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, 3D rendering for large-scale free camera trajectories, namely, arbitrary input camera trajectories, poses significant challenges: 1) The distribution and observation angles of the cameras are irregular, and various types of scenes are included in the free trajectories; 2) Processing the entire point cloud and all images at once for large-scale scenes requires a substantial amount of GPU memory. This paper presents a Toy-GS method for accurately rendering large-scale free camera trajectories. Specifically, we propose an adaptive spatial division approach for free trajectories to divide cameras and the sparse point cloud of the entire scene into various regions according to camera poses. Training each local Gaussian in parallel for each area enables us to concentrate on texture details and minimize GPU memory usage. Next, we use the multi-view constraint and position-aware point adaptive control (PPAC) to improve the rendering quality of texture details. In addition, our regional fusion approach combines local and global Gaussians to enhance rendering quality with an increasing number of divided areas. Extensive experiments have been carried out to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of Toy-GS, leading to state-of-the-art results on two public large-scale datasets as well as our SCUTic dataset. Our proposal demonstrates an enhancement of 1.19 dB in PSNR and conserves 7 G of GPU memory when compared to various benchmarks.</p>

To this goal, we exhibit a physically-inspired minimal radiance parametrization decoupling angular and spatial contributions, by encoding them with a small number of features stored in two respective volumetric grids of different resolutions. Requiring as little as four parameters per voxel, and a tiny MLP call inside a single fully fused kernel, our approach allows to enhance performance with both surface and image (PSNR) metrics, while providing a significant training speedup and real-time rendering. We show this performance to be consistently achieved on real data over two widely different and popular application fields, generic object and human subject shape reconstruction, using four representative and challenging datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Cao, Songcan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization addresses domain shift in real-world applications. Most approaches adopt a domain angle, seeking invariant representation across domains by aligning their marginal distributions, irrespective of individual classes, naturally leading to insufficient exploration of discriminative information. Switching to a class angle, we find that multiple domain-related peaks or clusters within the same individual classes must emerge due to distribution shift. In other words, marginal alignment does not guarantee conditional alignment, leading to suboptimal generalization. Therefore, we argue that acquiring discriminative generalization between classes within domains is crucial. In contrast to seeking distribution alignment, we endeavor to safeguard domain-related between-class discrimination. To this end, we devise a novel Conjugate Consistent Enhanced Module, namely Con2EM, based on a distribution over domains, i.e., a meta-distribution. Specifically, we employ a novel distribution-level Universum strategy to generate supplementary diverse domain-related class-conditional distributions, thereby enhancing generalization. This allows us to resample from these generated distributions to provide feedback to the primordial instance-level classifier, further improving its adaptability to the target-agnostic. To ensure generation accuracy, we establish an additional distribution-level classifier to regularize these conditional distributions. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness and low computational cost compared to SOTAs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi Yang, Haojin Yang, Soumajit Majumder, Jorge Cardoso, Guillermo Gallego</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that not each sample in a dataset is of equal importance during training. Data pruning aims to remove less important or informative samples while still achieving comparable results as training on the original (untruncated) dataset, thereby reducing storage and training costs. However, the majority of data pruning methods are applied to image classification tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore the feasibility of these pruning methods applied to object re-identification (ReID) tasks, while also presenting a more comprehensive data pruning approach. By fully leveraging the logit history during training, our approach offers a more accurate and comprehensive metric for quantifying sample importance, as well as correcting mislabeled samples and recognizing outliers. Furthermore, our approach is highly efficient, reducing the cost of importance score estimation by 10 times compared to existing methods. Our approach is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic framework that can eliminate/reduce 35%, 30%, and 5% of samples/training time on the VeRi, MSMT17 and Market1501 datasets, respectively, with negligible loss in accuracy (< 0.1%).

<p>Abstract: Recent Anomaly Detection (AD) methods have achieved great success with In-Distribution (ID) data. However, real-world data often exhibits distribution shift, causing huge performance decay on traditional AD methods. From this perspective, few previous work has explored AD with distribution shift, and the distribution-invariant normality learning has been proposed based on the Reverse Distillation (RD) framework. However, we observe the misalignment issue between the teacher and the student network that causes detection failure, thereby propose FiCo, Filter or Compensate, to address the distribution shift issue in AD. FiCo firstly compensates the distribution-specific information to reduce the misalignment between the teacher and student network via the Distribution-Specific Compensation (DiSCo) module, and secondly filters all abnormal information to capture distribution-invariant normality with the Distribution-Invariant Filter (DiIFi) module. Extensive experiments on three different AD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of FiCo, which outperforms all existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, and even achieves better results on the ID scenario compared with RD-based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zican Shi, Jing Hu, Jie Ren, Hengkang Ye, Xuyang Yuan, Yan Ouyang, Jia He, Bo Ji, Junyu Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The introduction of Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) has significantly improved object detection performance. However, substantial challenges remain in detecting tiny objects, as their features occupy only a very small proportion of the feature maps. Although FPN integrates multi-scale features, it does not directly enhance or enrich the features of tiny objects. Furthermore, FPN lacks spatial perception ability. To address these issues, we propose a novel High Frequency and Spatial Perception Feature Pyramid Network (HS-FPN) with two innovative modules. First, we designed a high frequency perception module (HFP) that generates high frequency responses through high pass filters. These high frequency responses are used as mask weights from both spatial and channel perspectives to enrich and highlight the features of tiny objects in the original feature maps. Second, we developed a spatial dependency perception module (SDP) to capture the spatial dependencies that FPN lacks. Our experiments demonstrate that detectors based on HS-FPN exhibit competitive advantages over state-of-the-art models on the AI-TOD dataset for tiny object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Gomez-Villa, Kai Wang, Alejandro C. Parraga, Bartlomiej Twardowski, Jesus Malo, Javier Vazquez-Corral, Joost van de Weijer</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual illusions in humans arise when interpreting out-of-distribution stimuli: if the observer is adapted to certain statistics, perception of outliers deviates from reality. Recent studies have shown that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also be deceived by visual illusions. This revelation raises profound questions about the nature of visual information. Why are two independent systems, both human brains and ANNs, susceptible to the same illusions? Should any ANN be capable of perceiving visual illusions? Are these perceptions a feature or a flaw? In this work, we study how visual illusions are encoded in diffusion models. Remarkably, we show that they present human-like brightness/color shifts in their latent space. We use this fact to demonstrate that diffusion models can predict visual illusions. Furthermore, we also show how to generate new unseen visual illusions in realistic images using text-to-image diffusion models. We validate this ability through psychophysical experiments that show how our model-generated illusions also fool humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonseok Lim, Dongjae Shin, Seohyun Song, Inho Won, Minjun Kim, Junghun Yuk, Haneol Jang, KyungTae Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the VLR-Bench, a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark for evaluating vision language models (VLMs) based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Unlike existing evaluation datasets for external knowledge-based VQA, the proposed VLR-Bench includes five input passages. This allows testing of the ability to determine which passage is useful for answering a given query, a capability lacking in previous research. In this context, we constructed a dataset of 32,000 automatically generated instruction-following examples, which we denote as VLR-IF. This dataset is specifically designed to enhance the RAG capabilities of VLMs by enabling them to learn how to generate appropriate answers based on input passages. We evaluated the validity of the proposed benchmark and training data and verified its performance using the state-of-the-art Llama3-based VLM, the Llava-Llama-3 model. The proposed VLR-Bench and VLR-IF datasets are publicly available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weixiang Zhang, Shuzhao Xie, Chengwei Ren, Siyi Xie, Chen Tang, Shijia Ge, Mingzi Wang, Zhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Umar Khan,  Saifullah, Stefan Agne, Andreas Dengel, Sheraz Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Document classification is considered a critical element in automated document processing systems. In recent years multi-modal approaches have become increasingly popular for document classification. Despite their improvements, these approaches are underutilized in the industry due to their requirement for a tremendous volume of training data and extensive computational power. In this paper, we attempt to address these issues by embedding textual features directly into the visual space, allowing lightweight image-based classifiers to achieve state-of-the-art results using small-scale datasets in document classification. To evaluate the efficacy of the visual features generated from our approach on limited data, we tested on the standard dataset Tobacco-3482. Our experiments show a tremendous improvement in image-based classifiers, achieving an improvement of 4.64% using ResNet50 with no document pre-training. It also sets a new record for the best accuracy of the Tobacco-3482 dataset with a score of 91.14% using the image-based DocXClassifier with no document pre-training. The simplicity of the approach, its resource requirements, and subsequent results provide a good prospect for its use in industrial use cases.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10159">Arbitrary Reading Order Scene Text Spotter with Local Semantics Guidance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Lyu, Wei Wang, Dongbao Yang, Jinwen Zhong, Yu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene text spotting has attracted the enthusiasm of relative researchers in recent years. Most existing scene text spotters follow the detection-then-recognition paradigm, where the vanilla detection module hardly determines the reading order and leads to failure recognition. After rethinking the auto-regressive scene text recognition method, we find that a well-trained recognizer can implicitly perceive the local semantics of all characters in a complete word or a sentence without a character-level detection module. Local semantic knowledge not only includes text content but also spatial information in the right reading order. Motivated by the above analysis, we propose the Local Semantics Guided scene text Spotter (LSGSpotter), which auto-regressively decodes the position and content of characters guided by the local semantics. Specifically, two effective modules are proposed in LSGSpotter. On the one hand, we design a Start Point Localization Module (SPLM) for locating text start points to determine the right reading order. On the other hand, a Multi-scale Adaptive Attention Module (MAAM) is proposed to adaptively aggregate text features in a local area. In conclusion, LSGSpotter achieves the arbitrary reading order spotting task without the limitation of sophisticated detection, while alleviating the cost of computational resources with the grid sampling strategy. Extensive experiment results show LSGSpotter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the InverseText benchmark. Moreover, our spotter demonstrates superior performance on English benchmarks for arbitrary-shaped text, achieving improvements of 0.7\% and 2.5\% on Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500, respectively. These results validate our text spotter is effective for scene texts in arbitrary reading order and shape.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10176">UN-DETR: Promoting Objectness Learning via Joint Supervision for Unknown Object Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haomiao Liu, Hao Xu, Chuhuai Yue, Bo Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Unknown Object Detection (UOD) aims to identify objects of unseen categories, differing from the traditional detection paradigm limited by the closed-world assumption. A key component of UOD is learning a generalized representation, i.e. objectness for both known and unknown categories to distinguish and localize objects from the background in a class-agnostic manner. However, previous methods obtain supervision signals for learning objectness in isolation from either localization or classification information, leading to poor performance for UOD. To address this issue, we propose a transformer-based UOD framework, UN-DETR. Based on this, we craft Instance Presence Score (IPS) to represent the probability of an object's presence. For the purpose of information complementarity, IPS employs a strategy of joint supervised learning, integrating attributes representing general objectness from the positional and the categorical latent space as supervision signals. To enhance IPS learning, we introduce a one-to-many assignment strategy to incorporate more supervision. Then, we propose Unbiased Query Selection to provide premium initial query vectors for the decoder. Additionally, we propose an IPS-guided post-process strategy to filter redundant boxes and correct classification predictions for known and unknown objects. Finally, we pretrain the entire UN-DETR in an unsupervised manner, in order to obtain objectness prior. Our UN-DETR is comprehensively evaluated on multiple UOD and known detection benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hung Nguyen, Quang Qui-Vinh Nguyen, Khoi Nguyen, Rang Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Given an input video of a person and a new garment, the objective of this paper is to synthesize a new video where the person is wearing the specified garment while maintaining spatiotemporal consistency. While significant advances have been made in image-based virtual try-ons, extending these successes to video often results in frame-to-frame inconsistencies. Some approaches have attempted to address this by increasing the overlap of frames across multiple video chunks, but this comes at a steep computational cost due to the repeated processing of the same frames, especially for long video sequence. To address these challenges, we reconceptualize video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, with garments serving as input conditions. Specifically, our approach enhances image diffusion models by incorporating temporal attention layers to improve temporal coherence. To reduce computational overhead, we introduce ShiftCaching, a novel technique that maintains temporal consistency while minimizing redundant computations. Furthermore, we introduce the \dataname~dataset, a new video try-on dataset featuring more complex backgrounds, challenging movements, and higher resolution compared to existing public datasets. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms current baselines, particularly in terms of video consistency and inference speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haopeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation of ultra-high resolution (UHR) images is a critical task with numerous applications, yet it poses significant challenges due to high spatial resolution and rich fine details. Recent approaches adopt a dual-branch architecture, where a global branch learns long-range contextual information and a local branch captures fine details. However, they struggle to handle the conflict between global and local information while adding significant extra computational cost. Inspired by the human visual system's ability to rapidly orient attention to important areas with fine details and filter out irrelevant information, we propose a novel UHR segmentation method called Boundary-enhanced Patch-merging Transformer (BPT). BPT consists of two key components: (1) Patch-Merging Transformer (PMT) for dynamically allocating tokens to informative regions to acquire global and local representations, and (2) Boundary-Enhanced Module (BEM) that leverages boundary information to enrich fine details. Extensive experiments on multiple UHR image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our BPT outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods without introducing extra computational overhead. Codes will be released to facilitate research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10182">Multi-Head Encoding for Extreme Label Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daojun Liang, Haixia Zhang, Dongfeng Yuan, Minggao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The number of categories of instances in the real world is normally huge, and each instance may contain multiple labels. To distinguish these massive labels utilizing machine learning, eXtreme Label Classification (XLC) has been established. However, as the number of categories increases, the number of parameters and nonlinear operations in the classifier also rises. This results in a Classifier Computational Overload Problem (CCOP). To address this, we propose a Multi-Head Encoding (MHE) mechanism, which replaces the vanilla classifier with a multi-head classifier. During the training process, MHE decomposes extreme labels into the product of multiple short local labels, with each head trained on these local labels. During testing, the predicted labels can be directly calculated from the local predictions of each head. This reduces the computational load geometrically. Then, according to the characteristics of different XLC tasks, e.g., single-label, multi-label, and model pretraining tasks, three MHE-based implementations, i.e., Multi-Head Product, Multi-Head Cascade, and Multi-Head Sampling, are proposed to more effectively cope with CCOP. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that MHE can achieve performance approximately equivalent to that of the vanilla classifier by generalizing the low-rank approximation problem from Frobenius-norm to Cross-Entropy. Experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance while significantly streamlining the training and inference processes of XLC tasks.

<p>Abstract: Acquiring, processing, and visualizing geospatial data requires significant computing resources, especially for large spatio-temporal domains. This challenge hinders the rapid discovery of predictive features, which is essential for advancing geospatial modeling. To address this, we developed Similarity Search (Sims), a no-code web tool that allows users to visualize, compare, cluster, and perform similarity search over defined regions of interest using Google Earth Engine as a backend. Sims is designed to complement existing modeling tools by focusing on feature exploration rather than model creation. We demonstrate the utility of Sims through a case study analyzing simulated maize yield data in Rwanda, where we evaluate how different combinations of soil, weather, and agronomic features affect the clustering of yield response zones.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiapeng Tang, Davide Davoli, Tobias Kirschstein, Liam Schoneveld, Matthias Niessner</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for reconstructing animatable 3D Gaussian avatars from monocular videos captured by commodity devices like smartphones. Photorealistic 3D head avatar reconstruction from such recordings is challenging due to limited observations, which leaves unobserved regions under-constrained and can lead to artifacts in novel views. To address this problem, we introduce a multi-view head diffusion model, leveraging its priors to fill in missing regions and ensure view consistency in Gaussian splatting renderings. To enable precise viewpoint control, we use normal maps rendered from FLAME-based head reconstruction, which provides pixel-aligned inductive biases. We also condition the diffusion model on VAE features extracted from the input image to preserve details of facial identity and appearance. For Gaussian avatar reconstruction, we distill multi-view diffusion priors by using iteratively denoised images as pseudo-ground truths, effectively mitigating over-saturation issues. To further improve photorealism, we apply latent upsampling to refine the denoised latent before decoding it into an image. We evaluate our method on the NeRSemble dataset, showing that GAF outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis by a 5.34\% higher SSIM score. Furthermore, we demonstrate higher-fidelity avatar reconstructions from monocular videos captured on commodity devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paula Daud\'en-Oliver, David Agost-Beltran, Emilio Sansano-Sansano, Valero Laparra, Jes\'us Malo, Marina Mart\'inez-Garcia</p>
<p>Abstract: Image quality databases are used to train models for predicting subjective human perception. However, most existing databases focus on distortions commonly found in digital media and not in natural conditions. Affine transformations are particularly relevant to study, as they are among the most commonly encountered by human observers in everyday life. This Data Descriptor presents a set of human responses to suprathreshold affine image transforms (rotation, translation, scaling) and Gaussian noise as convenient reference to compare with previously existing image quality databases. The responses were measured using well established psychophysics: the Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling method. The set contains responses to 864 distorted images. The experiments involved 105 observers and more than 20000 comparisons of quadruples of images. The quality of the dataset is ensured because (a) it reproduces the classical Pi\'eron's law, (b) it reproduces classical absolute detection thresholds, and (c) it is consistent with conventional image quality databases but improves them according to Group-MAD experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolai Warner, Jack Kolb, Meera Hahn, Vighnesh Birodkar, Jonathan Huang, Irfan Essa</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we focus on inserting a given human (specifically, a single image of a person) into a novel scene. Our method, which builds on top of Stable Diffusion, yields natural looking images while being highly controllable with text and pose. To accomplish this we need to train on pairs of images, the first a reference image with the person, the second a "target image" showing the same person (with a different pose and possibly in a different background). Additionally we require a text caption describing the new pose relative to that in the reference image. In this paper we present a novel dataset following this criteria, which we create using pairs of frames from human-centric and action-rich videos and employing a multimodal LLM to automatically summarize the difference in human pose for the text captions. We demonstrate that identity preservation is a more challenging task in scenes "in-the-wild", and especially scenes where there is an interaction between persons and objects. Combining the weak supervision from noisy captions, with robust 2D pose improves the quality of person-object interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interactive segmentation aims to extract objects of interest from an image based on user-provided clicks. In real-world applications, there is often a need to segment a series of images featuring the same target object. However, existing methods typically process one image at a time, failing to consider the sequential nature of the images. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method called Sequence Prompt Transformer (SPT), the first to utilize sequential image information for interactive segmentation. Our model comprises two key components: (1) Sequence Prompt Transformer (SPT) for acquiring information from sequence of images, clicks and masks to improve accurate. (2) Top-k Prompt Selection (TPS) selects precise prompts for SPT to further enhance the segmentation effect. Additionally, we create the ADE20K-Seq benchmark to better evaluate model performance. We evaluate our approach on multiple benchmark datasets and show that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods across all datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently gained traction for its efficient training and real-time rendering. While the vanilla Gaussian Splatting representation is mainly designed for view synthesis, more recent works investigated how to extend it with scene understanding and language features. However, existing methods lack a detailed comprehension of scenes, limiting their ability to segment and interpret complex structures. To this end, We introduce SuperGSeg, a novel approach that fosters cohesive, context-aware scene representation by disentangling segmentation and language field distillation. SuperGSeg first employs neural Gaussians to learn instance and hierarchical segmentation features from multi-view images with the aid of off-the-shelf 2D masks. These features are then leveraged to create a sparse set of what we call Super-Gaussians. Super-Gaussians facilitate the distillation of 2D language features into 3D space. Through Super-Gaussians, our method enables high-dimensional language feature rendering without extreme increases in GPU memory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGSeg outperforms prior works on both open-vocabulary object localization and semantic segmentation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Estimating full-body motion using the tracking signals of head and hands from VR devices holds great potential for various applications. However, the sparsity and unique distribution of observations present a significant challenge, resulting in an ill-posed problem with multiple feasible solutions (i.e., hypotheses). This amplifies uncertainty and ambiguity in full-body motion estimation, especially for the lower-body joints. Therefore, we propose a new method, EnvPoser, that employs a two-stage framework to perform full-body motion estimation using sparse tracking signals and pre-scanned environment from VR devices. EnvPoser models the multi-hypothesis nature of human motion through an uncertainty-aware estimation module in the first stage. In the second stage, we refine these multi-hypothesis estimates by integrating semantic and geometric environmental constraints, ensuring that the final motion estimation aligns realistically with both the environmental context and physical interactions. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting significant improvements in human motion estimation within motion-environment interaction scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuaiting Li, Chengxuan Wang, Juncan Deng, Zeyu Wang, Zewen Ye, Zongsheng Wang, Haibin Shen, Kejie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector quantization(VQ) is a hardware-friendly DNN compression method that can reduce the storage cost and weight-loading datawidth of hardware accelerators. However, conventional VQ techniques lead to significant accuracy loss because the important weights are not well preserved. To tackle this problem, a novel approach called MVQ is proposed, which aims at better approximating important weights with a limited number of codewords. At the algorithm level, our approach removes the less important weights through N:M pruning and then minimizes the vector clustering error between the remaining weights and codewords by the masked k-means algorithm. Only distances between the unpruned weights and the codewords are computed, which are then used to update the codewords. At the architecture level, our accelerator implements vector quantization on an EWS (Enhanced weight stationary) CNN accelerator and proposes a sparse systolic array design to maximize the benefits brought by masked vector quantization.\\ Our algorithm is validated on various models for image classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MVQ not only outperforms conventional vector quantization methods at comparable compression ratios but also reduces FLOPs. Under ASIC evaluation, our MVQ accelerator boosts energy efficiency by 2.3$\times$ and reduces the size of the systolic array by 55\% when compared with the base EWS accelerator. Compared to the previous sparse accelerators, MVQ achieves 1.73$\times$ higher energy efficiency.</p>

We use a pointmap-based geometric representation in a multiview image format to coordinate the generation of multiple target views simultaneously. We facilitate correspondence between views by assuming fixed target camera poses relative to the source camera, and constructing a predictable distribution of geometric features per target. Our modular, geometry-driven approach to novel-view synthesis (called "unPIC") beats SoTA baselines such as CAT3D and One-2-3-45 on held-out objects from ObjaverseXL, as well as real-world objects ranging from Google Scanned Objects, Amazon Berkeley Objects, to the Digital Twin Catalog.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-driven Image to Video Generation (TI2V) aims to generate controllable video given the first frame and corresponding textual description. The primary challenges of this task lie in two parts: (i) how to identify the target objects and ensure the consistency between the movement trajectory and the textual description. (ii) how to improve the subjective quality of generated videos. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a new diffusion-based TI2V framework, termed TIV-Diffusion, via object-centric textual-visual alignment, intending to achieve precise control and high-quality video generation based on textual-described motion for different objects. Concretely, we enable our TIV-Diffuion model to perceive the textual-described objects and their motion trajectory by incorporating the fused textual and visual knowledge through scale-offset modulation. Moreover, to mitigate the problems of object disappearance and misaligned objects and motion, we introduce an object-centric textual-visual alignment module, which reduces the risk of misaligned objects/motion by decoupling the objects in the reference image and aligning textual features with each object individually. Based on the above innovations, our TIV-Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art high-quality video generation compared with existing TI2V methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We tackle the challenge of open-vocabulary segmentation, where we need to identify objects from a wide range of categories in different environments, using text prompts as our input. To overcome this challenge, existing methods often use multi-modal models like CLIP, which combine image and text features in a shared embedding space to bridge the gap between limited and extensive vocabulary recognition, resulting in a two-stage approach: In the first stage, a mask generator takes an input image to generate mask proposals, and the in the second stage the target mask is picked based on the query. However, the expected target mask may not exist in the generated mask proposals, which leads to an unexpected output mask. In our work, we propose a novel approach named Prompt-guided Mask Proposal (PMP) where the mask generator takes the input text prompts and generates masks guided by these prompts. Compared with mask proposals generated without input prompts, masks generated by PMP are better aligned with the input prompts. To realize PMP, we designed a cross-attention mechanism between text tokens and query tokens which is capable of generating prompt-guided mask proposals after each decoding. We combined our PMP with several existing works employing a query-based segmentation backbone and the experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showcasing significant improvements over the current two-stage models (1% ~ 3% absolute performance gain in terms of mIOU). The steady improvement in performance across these benchmarks indicates the effective generalization of our proposed lightweight prompt-aware method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Dahnert, Angela Dai, Norman M\"uller, Matthias Nie{\ss}ner</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel diffusion-based approach for coherent 3D scene reconstruction from a single RGB image. Our method utilizes an image-conditioned 3D scene diffusion model to simultaneously denoise the 3D poses and geometries of all objects within the scene. Motivated by the ill-posed nature of the task and to obtain consistent scene reconstruction results, we learn a generative scene prior by conditioning on all scene objects simultaneously to capture the scene context and by allowing the model to learn inter-object relationships throughout the diffusion process. We further propose an efficient surface alignment loss to facilitate training even in the absence of full ground-truth annotation, which is common in publicly available datasets. This loss leverages an expressive shape representation, which enables direct point sampling from intermediate shape predictions. By framing the task of single RGB image 3D scene reconstruction as a conditional diffusion process, our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12.04% improvement in AP3D on SUN RGB-D and a 13.43% increase in F-Score on Pix3D.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present DeepSeek-VL2, an advanced series of large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Vision-Language Models that significantly improves upon its predecessor, DeepSeek-VL, through two key major upgrades. For the vision component, we incorporate a dynamic tiling vision encoding strategy designed for processing high-resolution images with different aspect ratios. For the language component, we leverage DeepSeekMoE models with the Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism, which compresses Key-Value cache into latent vectors, to enable efficient inference and high throughput. Trained on an improved vision-language dataset, DeepSeek-VL2 demonstrates superior capabilities across various tasks, including but not limited to visual question answering, optical character recognition, document/table/chart understanding, and visual grounding. Our model series is composed of three variants: DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny, DeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2, with 1.0B, 2.8B and 4.5B activated parameters respectively. DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing open-source dense and MoE-based models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Xia, Yunxiang Lu, Rui Song, Oussema Dhaouadi, Jo\~ao F. Henriques, Daniel Cremers</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the problem of localizing the traffic surveillance cameras in cooperative perception. To overcome the lack of large-scale real-world intersection datasets, we introduce Carla Intersection, a new simulated dataset with 75 urban and rural intersections in Carla. Moreover, we introduce a novel neural network, TrafficLoc, localizing traffic cameras within a 3D reference map. TrafficLoc employs a coarse-to-fine matching pipeline. For image-point cloud feature fusion, we propose a novel Geometry-guided Attention Loss to address cross-modal viewpoint inconsistencies. During coarse matching, we propose an Inter-Intra Contrastive Learning to achieve precise alignment while preserving distinctiveness among local intra-features within image patch-point group pairs. Besides, we introduce Dense Training Alignment with a soft-argmax operator to consider additional features when regressing the final position. Extensive experiments show that our TrafficLoc improves the localization accuracy over the state-of-the-art Image-to-point cloud registration methods by a large margin (up to 86%) on Carla Intersection and generalizes well to real-world data. TrafficLoc also achieves new SOTA performance on KITTI and NuScenes datasets, demonstrating strong localization ability across both in-vehicle and traffic cameras.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaowei Li, Yuxuan Bian, Xuan Ju, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ying Shan, Qiang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image editing has advanced significantly with the development of diffusion models using both inversion-based and instruction-based methods. However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzhou Liu, Chengkai Liu, Jiacong Xu, Peng Jiang, Mi Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs), like recent Mamba architectures, are emerging as a promising alternative to CNN and Transformer networks. Existing Mamba-based restoration methods process the visual data by leveraging a flatten-and-scan strategy that converts image patches into a 1D sequence before scanning. However, this scanning paradigm ignores local pixel dependencies and introduces spatial misalignment by positioning distant pixels incorrectly adjacent, which reduces local noise-awareness and degrades image sharpness in low-level vision tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel slice-and-scan strategy that alternates scanning along intra- and inter-slices. We further design a new Vision State Space Module (VSSM) for image deblurring, and tackle the inefficiency challenges of the current Mamba-based vision module. Building upon this, we develop XYScanNet, an SSM architecture integrated with a lightweight feature fusion module for enhanced image deblurring. XYScanNet, maintains competitive distortion metrics and significantly improves perceptual performance. Experimental results show that XYScanNet enhances KID by $17\%$ compared to the nearest competitor. Our code will be released soon.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10339">A Universal Degradation-based Bridging Technique for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangkai Li, Rui Sun, Tianzhu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation often suffers from significant performance degradation when the trained network is applied to a different domain. To address this issue, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been extensively studied. Existing methods introduce the domain bridging techniques to mitigate substantial domain gap, which construct intermediate domains to facilitate the gradual transfer of knowledge across different domains. However, these strategies often require dataset-specific designs and may generate unnatural intermediate distributions that lead to semantic shift. In this paper, we propose DiDA, a universal degradation-based bridging technique formalized as a diffusion forward process. DiDA consists of two key modules: (1) Degradation-based Intermediate Domain Construction, which creates continuous intermediate domains through simple image degradation operations to encourage learning domain-invariant features as domain differences gradually diminish; (2) Semantic Shift Compensation, which leverages a diffusion encoder to encode and compensate for semantic shift information with degraded time-steps, preserving discriminative representations in the intermediate domains. As a plug-and-play solution, DiDA supports various degradation operations and seamlessly integrates with existing UDA methods. Extensive experiments on prevalent synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that DiDA consistently improves performance across different settings and achieves new state-of-the-art results when combined with existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqi Ge, Juncheng Li, Xinglei Pang, Minghe Gao, Kaihang Pan, Wang Lin, Hao Fei, Wenqiao Zhang, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital agents are increasingly employed to automate tasks in interactive digital environments such as web pages, software applications, and operating systems. While text-based agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often require frequent updates due to platform-specific APIs, visual agents leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer enhanced adaptability by interacting directly with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). However, these agents face significant challenges in visual perception, particularly when handling high-resolution, visually complex digital environments. This paper introduces Iris, a foundational visual agent that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: Information-Sensitive Cropping (ISC) and Self-Refining Dual Learning (SRDL). ISC dynamically identifies and prioritizes visually dense regions using a edge detection algorithm, enabling efficient processing by allocating more computational resources to areas with higher information density. SRDL enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks by leveraging a dual-learning loop, where improvements in referring (describing UI elements) reinforce grounding (locating elements) and vice versa, all without requiring additional annotated data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Iris achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with only 850K GUI annotations, outperforming methods using 10x more training data. These improvements further translate to significant gains in both web and OS agent downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Sun, Zhao Zhang, Jorge Ortiz</p>
<p>Abstract: In current multimodal tasks, models typically freeze the encoder and decoder while adapting intermediate layers to task-specific goals, such as region captioning. Region-level visual understanding presents significant challenges for large-scale vision-language models. While limited spatial awareness is a known issue, coarse-grained pretraining, in particular, exacerbates the difficulty of optimizing latent representations for effective encoder-decoder alignment. We propose AlignCap, a framework designed to enhance region-level understanding through fine-grained alignment of latent spaces. Our approach introduces a novel latent feature refinement module that enhances conditioned latent space representations to improve region-level captioning performance. We also propose an innovative alignment strategy, the semantic space alignment module, which boosts the quality of multimodal representations. Additionally, we incorporate contrastive learning in a novel manner within both modules to further enhance region-level captioning performance. To address spatial limitations, we employ a General Object Detection (GOD) method as a data preprocessing pipeline that enhances spatial reasoning at the regional level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves region-level captioning performance across various tasks</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of a novel multi-task vision transformer (ViT) model for the estimation of canopy height models (CHMs) using 4-band National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery across the western United States. We compare the effectiveness of this model in terms of accuracy and precision aggregated across ecoregions and class heights versus three other benchmark peer-reviewed models. Key findings suggest that, while other benchmark models can provide high precision in localized areas, the VibrantVS model has substantial advantages across a broad reach of ecoregions in the western United States with higher accuracy, higher precision, the ability to generate updated inference at a cadence of three years or less, and high spatial resolution. The VibrantVS model provides significant value for ecological monitoring and land management decisions for wildfire mitigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Villani, Igor Maljkovic, Dario Lazzaro, Angelo Sotgiu, Antonio Emanuele Cin\`a, Fabio Roli</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., carefully crafted input samples that can cause models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, adversarial training and detection-based defenses have been proposed to strengthen models in advance. However, most of these approaches focus on a single data modality, overlooking the relationships between visual patterns and textual descriptions of the input. In this paper, we propose a novel defense, Multi-Shield, designed to combine and complement these defenses with multi-modal information to further enhance their robustness. Multi-Shield leverages multi-modal large language models to detect adversarial examples and abstain from uncertain classifications when there is no alignment between textual and visual representations of the input. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, using robust and non-robust image classification models, demonstrate that Multi-Shield can be easily integrated to detect and reject adversarial examples, outperforming the original defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Orr Zohar, Xiaohan Wang, Yann Dubois, Nikhil Mehta, Tong Xiao, Philippe Hansen-Estruch, Licheng Yu, Xiaofang Wang, Felix Juefei-Xu, Ning Zhang, Serena Yeung-Levy, Xide Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the rapid integration of video perception capabilities into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), the underlying mechanisms driving their video understanding remain poorly understood. Consequently, many design decisions in this domain are made without proper justification or analysis. The high computational cost of training and evaluating such models, coupled with limited open research, hinders the development of video-LMMs. To address this, we present a comprehensive study that helps uncover what effectively drives video understanding in LMMs.
  We begin by critically examining the primary contributors to the high computational requirements associated with video-LMM research and discover Scaling Consistency, wherein design and training decisions made on smaller models and datasets (up to a critical size) effectively transfer to larger models. Leveraging these insights, we explored many video-specific aspects of video-LMMs, including video sampling, architectures, data composition, training schedules, and more. For example, we demonstrated that fps sampling during training is vastly preferable to uniform frame sampling and which vision encoders are the best for video representation.
  Guided by these findings, we introduce Apollo, a state-of-the-art family of LMMs that achieve superior performance across different model sizes. Our models can perceive hour-long videos efficiently, with Apollo-3B outperforming most existing $7$B models with an impressive 55.1 on LongVideoBench. Apollo-7B is state-of-the-art compared to 7B LMMs with a 70.9 on MLVU, and 63.3 on Video-MME.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-based autonomous driving shows great potential due to its satisfactory performance and low costs. Most existing methods adopt dense representations (e.g., bird's eye view) or sparse representations (e.g., instance boxes) for decision-making, which suffer from the trade-off between comprehensiveness and efficiency. This paper explores a Gaussian-centric end-to-end autonomous driving (GaussianAD) framework and exploits 3D semantic Gaussians to extensively yet sparsely describe the scene. We initialize the scene with uniform 3D Gaussians and use surrounding-view images to progressively refine them to obtain the 3D Gaussian scene representation. We then use sparse convolutions to efficiently perform 3D perception (e.g., 3D detection, semantic map construction). We predict 3D flows for the Gaussians with dynamic semantics and plan the ego trajectory accordingly with an objective of future scene forecasting. Our GaussianAD can be trained in an end-to-end manner with optional perception labels when available. Extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes dataset verify the effectiveness of our end-to-end GaussianAD on various tasks including motion planning, 3D occupancy prediction, and 4D occupancy forecasting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Uzair Khattak, Shahina Kunhimon, Muzammal Naseer, Salman Khan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained via contrastive learning have achieved notable success in natural image tasks. However, their application in the medical domain remains limited due to the scarcity of openly accessible, large-scale medical image-text datasets. Existing medical VLMs either train on closed-source proprietary or relatively small open-source datasets that do not generalize well. Similarly, most models remain specific to a single or limited number of medical imaging domains, again restricting their applicability to other modalities. To address this gap, we introduce UniMed, a large-scale, open-source multi-modal medical dataset comprising over 5.3 million image-text pairs across six diverse imaging modalities: X-ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound, Pathology, and Fundus. UniMed is developed using a data-collection framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform modality-specific classification datasets into image-text formats while incorporating existing image-text data from the medical domain, facilitating scalable VLM pretraining. Using UniMed, we trained UniMed-CLIP, a unified VLM for six modalities that significantly outperforms existing generalist VLMs and matches modality-specific medical VLMs, achieving notable gains in zero-shot evaluations. For instance, UniMed-CLIP improves over BiomedCLIP (trained on proprietary data) by an absolute gain of +12.61, averaged over 21 datasets, while using 3x less training data. To facilitate future research, we release UniMed dataset, training codes, and models at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/UniMed-CLIP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Zuo, Wenzhao Zheng, Yuanhui Huang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is important for autonomous driving due to its comprehensive perception of the surroundings. To incorporate sequential inputs, most existing methods fuse representations from previous frames to infer the current 3D occupancy. However, they fail to consider the continuity of driving scenarios and ignore the strong prior provided by the evolution of 3D scenes (e.g., only dynamic objects move). In this paper, we propose a world-model-based framework to exploit the scene evolution for perception. We reformulate 3D occupancy prediction as a 4D occupancy forecasting problem conditioned on the current sensor input. We decompose the scene evolution into three factors: 1) ego motion alignment of static scenes; 2) local movements of dynamic objects; and 3) completion of newly-observed scenes. We then employ a Gaussian world model (GaussianWorld) to explicitly exploit these priors and infer the scene evolution in the 3D Gaussian space considering the current RGB observation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on the widely used nuScenes dataset. Our GaussianWorld improves the performance of the single-frame counterpart by over 2% in mIoU without introducing additional computations. Code: https://github.com/zuosc19/GaussianWorld.</p>

<p>Abstract: An exercise in implementing Scale Invariant Feature Transform using CKKS Fully Homomorphic encryption quickly reveals some glaring limitations in the current FHE paradigm. These limitations include the lack of a standard comparison operator and certain operations that depend on it (like array max, histogram binning etc). We also observe that the existing solutions are either too low level or do not have proper abstractions to implement algorithms like SIFT. In this work, we demonstrate: 1. Methods of adapting regular code to the FHE setting. 2. Alternate implementations of standard algorithms (like array max, histogram binning, etc.) to reduce the multiplicative depth. 3. A novel method of using deferred computations to avoid performing expensive operations such as comparisons in the encrypted domain. Through this exercise, we hope this work acts as a practical guide on how one can adapt algorithms to FHE</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuhan Sheng, Runyi Li, Bin Chen, Weiqi Li, Xu Jiang, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Omnidirectional image super-resolution (ODISR) aims to upscale low-resolution (LR) omnidirectional images (ODIs) to high-resolution (HR), addressing the growing demand for detailed visual content across a $180^{\circ}\times360^{\circ}$ viewport. Existing methods are limited by simple degradation assumptions (e.g., bicubic downsampling), which fail to capture the complex, unknown real-world degradation processes. Recent diffusion-based approaches suffer from slow inference due to their hundreds of sampling steps and frequent pixel-latent space conversions. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose RealOSR, a novel diffusion-based approach for real-world ODISR (Real-ODISR) with single-step diffusion denoising. To sufficiently exploit the input information, RealOSR introduces a lightweight domain alignment module, which facilitates the efficient injection of LR ODI into the single-step latent denoising. Additionally, to better utilize the rich semantic and multi-scale feature modeling ability of denoising UNet, we develop a latent unfolding module that simulates the gradient descent process directly in latent space. Experimental results demonstrate that RealOSR outperforms previous methods in both ODI recovery quality and efficiency. Compared to the recent state-of-the-art diffusion-based ODISR method, OmniSSR, RealOSR achieves significant improvements in visual quality and over \textbf{200$\times$} inference acceleration. Our code and models will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junqi You, Xiaosong Jia, Zhiyuan Zhang, Yutao Zhu, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: For end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD), the evaluation system remains an open problem. Existing closed-loop evaluation protocols usually rely on simulators like CARLA being less realistic; while NAVSIM using real-world vision data, yet is limited to fixed planning trajectories in short horizon and assumes other agents are not reactive.
  We introduce Bench2Drive-R, a generative framework that enables reactive closed-loop evaluation. Unlike existing video generative models for AD, the proposed designs are tailored for interactive simulation, where sensor rendering and behavior rollout are decoupled by applying a separate behavioral controller to simulate the reactions of surrounding agents. As a result, the renderer could focus on image fidelity, control adherence, and spatial-temporal coherence. For temporal consistency, due to the step-wise interaction nature of simulation, we design a noise modulating temporal encoder with Gaussian blurring to encourage long-horizon autoregressive rollout of image sequences without deteriorating distribution shifts. For spatial consistency, a retrieval mechanism, which takes the spatially nearest images as references, is introduced to to ensure scene-level rendering fidelity during the generation process. The spatial relations between target and reference are explicitly modeled with 3D relative position encodings and the potential over-reliance of reference images is mitigated with hierarchical sampling and classifier-free guidance.
  We compare the generation quality of Bench2Drive-R with existing generative models and achieve state-of-the-art performance. We further integrate Bench2Drive-R into nuPlan and evaluate the generative qualities with closed-loop simulation results. We will open source our code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Miao, Harsh Agrawal, Qihang Zhang, Federico Semeraro, Marco Cavallo, Jiatao Gu, Alexander Toshev</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D content requires models capable of learning robust distributions of complex scenes and the real-world objects within them. Recent Gaussian-based 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved impressive results in recovering high-fidelity 3D assets from sparse input images by predicting 3D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. However, these techniques often lack the extensive priors and expressiveness offered by Diffusion Models. On the other hand, 2D Diffusion Models, which have been successfully applied to denoise multiview images, show potential for generating a wide range of photorealistic 3D outputs but still fall short on explicit 3D priors and consistency. In this work, we aim to bridge these two approaches by introducing DSplats, a novel method that directly denoises multiview images using Gaussian Splat-based Reconstructors to produce a diverse array of realistic 3D assets. To harness the extensive priors of 2D Diffusion Models, we incorporate a pretrained Latent Diffusion Model into the reconstructor backbone to predict a set of 3D Gaussians. Additionally, the explicit 3D representation embedded in the denoising network provides a strong inductive bias, ensuring geometrically consistent novel view generation. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DSplats not only produces high-quality, spatially consistent outputs, but also sets a new standard in single-image to 3D reconstruction. When evaluated on the Google Scanned Objects dataset, DSplats achieves a PSNR of 20.38, an SSIM of 0.842, and an LPIPS of 0.109.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Hu, Paul Henderson, Jos\'e Cano</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization of Deep Neural Network (DNN) activations is a commonly used technique to reduce compute and memory demands during DNN inference, which can be particularly beneficial on resource-constrained devices. To achieve high accuracy, existing methods for quantizing activations rely on complex mathematical computations or perform extensive searches for the best hyper-parameters. However, these expensive operations are impractical on devices with limited computation capabilities, memory capacities, and energy budgets. Furthermore, many existing methods do not focus on sub-6-bit (or deep) quantization.
  To fill these gaps, in this paper we propose DQA (Deep Quantization of DNN Activations), a new method that focuses on sub-6-bit quantization of activations and leverages simple shifting-based operations and Huffman coding to be efficient and achieve high accuracy. We evaluate DQA with 3, 4, and 5-bit quantization levels and three different DNN models for two different tasks, image classification and image segmentation, on two different datasets. DQA shows significantly better accuracy (up to 29.28%) compared to the direct quantization method and the state-of-the-art NoisyQuant for sub-6-bit quantization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binxu Wang, John J. Vastola</p>
<p>Abstract: By learning the gradient of smoothed data distributions, diffusion models can iteratively generate samples from complex distributions. The learned score function enables their generalization capabilities, but how the learned score relates to the score of the underlying data manifold remains largely unclear. Here, we aim to elucidate this relationship by comparing learned neural scores to the scores of two kinds of analytically tractable distributions: Gaussians and Gaussian mixtures. The simplicity of the Gaussian model makes it theoretically attractive, and we show that it admits a closed-form solution and predicts many qualitative aspects of sample generation dynamics. We claim that the learned neural score is dominated by its linear (Gaussian) approximation for moderate to high noise scales, and supply both theoretical and empirical arguments to support this claim. Moreover, the Gaussian approximation empirically works for a larger range of noise scales than naive theory suggests it should, and is preferentially learned early in training. At smaller noise scales, we observe that learned scores are better described by a coarse-grained (Gaussian mixture) approximation of training data than by the score of the training distribution, a finding consistent with generalization. Our findings enable us to precisely predict the initial phase of trained models' sampling trajectories through their Gaussian approximations. We show that this allows the skipping of the first 15-30% of sampling steps while maintaining high sample quality (with a near state-of-the-art FID score of 1.93 on CIFAR-10 unconditional generation). This forms the foundation of a novel hybrid sampling method, termed analytical teleportation, which can seamlessly integrate with and accelerate existing samplers, including DPM-Solver-v3 and UniPC. Our findings suggest ways to improve the design and training of diffusion models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Correlative computational microscopy is accelerating the mapping of dynamic biological systems by integrating morphological and molecular measurements across spatial scales, from organelles to entire organisms. Visualization, measurement, and prediction of interactions among the components of biological systems can be accelerated by generalist computational imaging frameworks that relax the trade-offs imposed by multiplex dynamic imaging. This work reports a generalist framework for wave optical imaging of the architectural order (waveOrder) among biomolecules for encoding and decoding multiple specimen properties from a minimal set of acquired channels, with or without fluorescent labels. waveOrder expresses material properties in terms of elegant physically motivated basis vectors directly interpretable as phase, absorption, birefringence, diattenuation, and fluorophore density; and it expresses image data in terms of directly measurable Stokes parameters. We report a corresponding multi-channel reconstruction algorithm to recover specimen properties in multiple contrast modes. With this framework, we implement multiple 3D computational microscopy methods, including quantitative phase imaging, quantitative label-free imaging with phase and polarization, and fluorescence deconvolution imaging, across scales ranging from organelles to whole zebrafish. These advances are available via an extensible open-source computational imaging library, waveOrder, and a napari plugin, recOrder.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing interest in autonomous driving calls for realistic simulation platforms capable of accurately simulating cooperative perception process in realistic traffic scenarios. Existing studies for cooperative perception often have not accounted for transmission latency and errors in real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce EI-Drive, an edge-AI based autonomous driving simulation platform that integrates advanced cooperative perception with more realistic communication models. Built on the CARLA framework, EI-Drive features new modules for cooperative perception while taking into account transmission latency and errors, providing a more realistic platform for evaluating cooperative perception algorithms. In particular, the platform enables vehicles to fuse data from multiple sources, improving situational awareness and safety in complex environments. With its modular design, EI-Drive allows for detailed exploration of sensing, perception, planning, and control in various cooperative driving scenarios. Experiments using EI-Drive demonstrate significant improvements in vehicle safety and performance, particularly in scenarios with complex traffic flow and network conditions.

<p>Abstract: Determining the robustness of deep learning models is an established and ongoing challenge within automated decision-making systems. With the advent and success of techniques that enable advanced deep learning (DL), these models are being used in widespread applications, including high-stake ones like healthcare, education, border-control. Therefore, it is critical to understand the limitations of these models and predict their regions of failures, in order to create the necessary guardrails for their successful and safe deployment. In this work, we revisit robustness, specifically investigating the sufficiency of robust accuracy (RA), within the context of deepfake detection. We present robust ratio (RR) as a complementary metric, that can quantify the changes to the normalized or probability outcomes under input perturbation. We present a comparison of RA and RR and demonstrate that despite similar RA between models, the models show varying RR under different tolerance (perturbation) levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changqun Li, Chaofan Ding, Kexin Luan, Xinhan Di</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. LoRA is one of the most widely used methods, which assumes that the optimization process is essentially low dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, there remains a significant performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning when learning new tasks. In this work, we propose Low-Rank Adaptation with Task-Relevant Feature Enhancement(LoRATRF) for enhancing task-relevant features from the perspective of editing neural network representations. To prioritize task-relevant features, a task-aware filter that selectively extracts valuable knowledge from hidden representations for the target or current task is designed. As the experiments on a vareity of datasets including NLU, commonsense reasoning and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrates, our method reduces 33.71% parameters and achieves better performance on a variety of datasets in comparison with SOTA low-rank methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Choi, Jinseong Park, Junyoung Byun, Jaewook Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Programmatically generated synthetic data has been used in differential private training for classification to enhance performance without privacy leakage. However, as the synthetic data is generated from a random process, the distribution of real data and the synthetic data are distinguishable and difficult to transfer. Therefore, the model trained with the synthetic data generates unrealistic random images, raising challenges to adapt the synthetic data for generative models. In this work, we propose DP-SynGen, which leverages programmatically generated synthetic data in diffusion models to address this challenge. By exploiting the three stages of diffusion models(coarse, context, and cleaning) we identify stages where synthetic data can be effectively utilized. We theoretically and empirically verified that cleaning and coarse stages can be trained without private data, replacing them with synthetic data to reduce the privacy budget. The experimental results show that DP-SynGen improves the quality of generative data by mitigating the negative impact of privacy-induced noise on the generation process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Sun, Qiangqiang Yuan, Huanfeng Shen, Jie Li, Liangpei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The objective of image super-resolution is to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image with the prior knowledge from one or several low-resolution (LR) images. However, in the real world, due to the limited complementary information, the performance of both single-frame and multi-frame super-resolution reconstruction degrades rapidly as the magnification increases. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step image super resolution method concatenating multi-frame super-resolution (MFSR) with single-frame super-resolution (SFSR), to progressively upsample images to the desired resolution. The proposed method consisting of an L0-norm constrained reconstruction scheme and an enhanced residual back-projection network, integrating the flexibility of the variational modelbased method and the feature learning capacity of the deep learning-based method. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments with both simulated and real world sequences were implemented. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields superior performance in both objective and perceptual quality measurements. The average PSNRs of the cascade model in set5 and set14 are 33.413 dB and 29.658 dB respectively, which are 0.76 dB and 0.621 dB more than the baseline method. In addition, the experiment indicates that this cascade model can be robustly applied to different SFSR and MFSR methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lizhi Bai, Chunqi Tian, Jun Yang, Siyu Zhang, Masanori Suganuma, Takayuki Okatani</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising technique for high-quality 3D rendering, leading to increasing interest in integrating 3DGS into realism SLAM systems. However, existing methods face challenges such as Gaussian primitives redundancy, forgetting problem during continuous optimization, and difficulty in initializing primitives in monocular case due to lack of depth information. In order to achieve efficient and photorealistic mapping, we propose RP-SLAM, a 3D Gaussian splatting-based vision SLAM method for monocular and RGB-D cameras. RP-SLAM decouples camera poses estimation from Gaussian primitives optimization and consists of three key components. Firstly, we propose an efficient incremental mapping approach to achieve a compact and accurate representation of the scene through adaptive sampling and Gaussian primitives filtering. Secondly, a dynamic window optimization method is proposed to mitigate the forgetting problem and improve map consistency. Finally, for the monocular case, a monocular keyframe initialization method based on sparse point cloud is proposed to improve the initialization accuracy of Gaussian primitives, which provides a geometric basis for subsequent optimization. The results of numerous experiments demonstrate that RP-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art map rendering accuracy while ensuring real-time performance and model compactness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Discretized techniques for vector tomographic reconstructions are prone to producing artifacts in the reconstructions. The quality of these reconstructions may further deteriorate as the amount of noise increases. In this work, we instead model the underlying vector fields using smooth neural fields. Owing to the fact that the activation functions in the neural network may be chosen to be smooth and the domain is no longer pixelated, the model results in high-quality reconstructions, even under presence of noise. In the case where we have underlying global continuous symmetry, we find that the neural network substantially improves the accuracy of the reconstruction over the existing techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Song, Yicheng Wu, Minhao Hu, Xiangde Luo, Guoting Luo, Guotai Wang, Yi Guo, Feng Xu, Shaoting Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accelerated MRI reconstruction techniques aim to reduce examination time while maintaining high image fidelity, which is highly desirable in clinical settings for improving patient comfort and hospital efficiency. Existing deep learning methods typically reconstruct images from under-sampled data with traditional reconstruction approaches, but they still struggle to provide high-fidelity results. Diffusion models show great potential to improve fidelity of generated images in recent years. However, their inference process starting with a random Gaussian noise introduces instability into the results and usually requires thousands of sampling steps, resulting in sub-optimal reconstruction quality and low efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Cycle-Consistent Bridge Diffusion Model (CBDM). CBDM employs two bridge diffusion models to construct a cycle-consistent diffusion process with a consistency loss, enhancing the fine-grained details of reconstructed images and reducing the number of diffusion steps. Moreover, CBDM incorporates a Contourlet Decomposition Embedding Module (CDEM) which captures multi-scale structural texture knowledge in images through frequency domain decomposition pyramids and directional filter banks to improve structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model by higher reconstruction quality and fewer training iterations, achieving a new state of the art for accelerated MRI reconstruction in both fastMRI and IXI datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy has significantly advanced biological research by visualizing detailed cellular structures and biological processes. However, such image denoising task often faces challenges due to difficulty in precisely modeling the inherent noise and acquiring clean images for training, which constrains most existing methods. In this paper, we propose an efficient self-supervised denoiser Fluorescence Micrograph to Self (FM2S), enabling a high-quality denoised result with a single noisy image. Our method introduces an adaptive global-local Noise Addition module for data augmentation, addressing generalization problems caused by discrepancies between synthetic and real-world noise. We then train a two-layer neural network to learn the mapping from the noise-added image to the filtered image, achieving a balance between noise removal and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that FM2S excels in various microscope types and noise levels in terms of denoising effects and time consumption, obtaining an average PSNR improvement of around 6 dB over the original noisy image in a few seconds.

<p>Abstract: Visual actionable affordance has emerged as a transformative approach in robotics, focusing on perceiving interaction areas prior to manipulation. Traditional methods rely on pixel sampling to identify successful interaction samples or processing pointclouds for affordance mapping. However, these approaches are computationally intensive and struggle to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments. This paper introduces ManipGPT, a framework designed to predict optimal interaction areas for articulated objects using a large pre-trained vision transformer (ViT). We created a dataset of 9.9k simulated and real images to bridge the sim-to-real gap and enhance real-world applicability. By fine-tuning the vision transformer on this small dataset, we significantly improved part-level affordance segmentation, adapting the model's in-context segmentation capabilities to robot manipulation scenarios. This enables effective manipulation across simulated and real-world environments by generating part-level affordance masks, paired with an impedance adaptation policy, sufficiently eliminating the need for complex datasets or perception systems.</p>

Current clinical detection techniques face limitations in accuracy and efficiency, necessitating improved automated diagnostic solutions. This study introduces a novel Cascaded Atrous Group Attention (CAGA) module, specifically designed to enhance multi-scale feature representation while optimizing computational efficiency. By integrating CAGA with EfficientViT-L1 as the backbone architecture, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a score of 0.98% on the MCSI dataset, while reducing model parameters by 37.5% compared to the original EfficientViT-L1. This reduction in computational complexity maintains diagnostic accuracy while enabling broader deployment across resource-constrained healthcare settings. Extensive validation across two other benchmark datasets, including MSID and MSLD, demonstrate the model's robustness, consistently outperforming existing approaches. Our findings suggest that CAGA's efficient feature extraction mechanism could be adapted for other medical imaging tasks requiring fine-grained visual discrimination.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address the task of Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) under the zero-shot setting. Zero-shot VLN-CE is particularly challenging due to the absence of expert demonstrations for training and minimal environment structural prior to guide navigation. To confront these challenges, we propose a Constraint-Aware Navigator (CA-Nav), which reframes zero-shot VLN-CE as a sequential, constraint-aware sub-instruction completion process. CA-Nav continuously translates sub-instructions into navigation plans using two core modules: the Constraint-Aware Sub-instruction Manager (CSM) and the Constraint-Aware Value Mapper (CVM). CSM defines the completion criteria for decomposed sub-instructions as constraints and tracks navigation progress by switching sub-instructions in a constraint-aware manner. CVM, guided by CSM's constraints, generates a value map on the fly and refines it using superpixel clustering to improve navigation stability. CA-Nav achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two VLN-CE benchmarks, surpassing the previous best method by 12 percent and 13 percent in Success Rate on the validation unseen splits of R2R-CE and RxR-CE, respectively. Moreover, CA-Nav demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world robot deployments across various indoor scenes and instructions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper studies generalization capabilities of neural networks (NNs) using new and improved PyTorch library Loss Landscape Analysis (LLA). LLA facilitates visualization and analysis of loss landscapes along with the properties of NN Hessian. Different approaches to NN loss landscape plotting are discussed with particular focus on normalization techniques showing that conventional methods cannot always ensure correct visualization when batch normalization layers are present in NN architecture. The use of Hessian axes is shown to be able to mitigate this effect, and methods for choosing Hessian axes are proposed. In addition, spectra of Hessian eigendecomposition are studied and it is shown that typical spectra exist for a wide range of NNs. This allows to propose quantitative criteria for Hessian analysis that can be applied to evaluate NN performance and assess its generalization capabilities. Generalization experiments are conducted using ImageNet-1K pre-trained models along with several models trained as part of this study. The experiment include training models on one dataset and testing on another one to maximize experiment similarity to model performance in the Wild. It is shown that when datasets change, the changes in criteria correlate with the changes in accuracy, making the proposed criteria a computationally efficient estimate of generalization ability, which is especially useful for extremely large datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: With increasing revelations of academic fraud, detecting forged experimental images in the biomedical field has become a public concern. The challenge lies in the fact that copy-move targets can include background tissue, small foreground objects, or both, which may be out of the training domain and subject to unseen attacks, rendering standard object-detection-based approaches less effective. To address this, we reformulate the problem of detecting biomedical copy-move forgery regions as an intra-image co-saliency detection task and propose CMSeg-Net, a copy-move forgery segmentation network capable of identifying unseen duplicated areas. Built on a multi-resolution encoder-decoder architecture, CMSeg-Net incorporates self-correlation and correlation-assisted spatial-attention modules to detect intra-image regional similarities within feature tensors at each observation scale. This design helps distinguish even small copy-move targets in complex microscopic images from other similar objects. Furthermore, we created a copy-move forgery dataset of optical microscopic images, named FakeParaEgg, using open data from the ICIP 2022 Challenge to support CMSeg-Net's development and verify its performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on the FakeParaEgg dataset and other open copy-move detection datasets, including CASIA-CMFD, CoMoFoD, and CMF.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Talha Sultan, Eric Brandt, Khadijeh Masumnia-Bisheh, Simone Riccardo, Pavel Polynkin, Alberto Tosi, Andreas Velten</p>
<p>Abstract: Active imaging systems sample the Transient Light Transport Matrix (TLTM) for a scene by sequentially illuminating various positions in this scene using a controllable light source, and then measuring the resulting spatiotemporal light transport with time of flight (ToF) sensors. Time-resolved Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging employs an active imaging system that measures part of the TLTM of an intermediary relay surface, and uses the indirect reflections of light encoded within this TLTM to "see around corners". Such imaging systems have applications in diverse areas such as disaster response, remote surveillance, and autonomous navigation. While existing NLOS imaging systems usually measure a subset of the full TLTM, development of customized gated Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) arrays \cite{riccardo_fast-gated_2022} has made it feasible to probe the full measurement space. In this work, we demonstrate that the full TLTM on the relay surface can be processed with efficient algorithms to computationally focus and detect our illumination in different parts of the hidden scene, turning the relay surface into a second-order active imaging system. These algorithms allow us to iterate on the measured, first-order TLTM, and extract a \textbf{second order TLTM for surfaces in the hidden scene}. We showcase three applications of TLTMs in NLOS imaging: (1) Scene Relighting with novel illumination, (2) Separation of direct and indirect components of light transport in the hidden scene, and (3) Dual Photography. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that SPAD arrays enable parallel acquisition of photons, effectively mitigating long acquisition times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lai Wei, Jiahua Ma, Yibo Hu, Ruimao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In dynamic environments, robots often encounter constrained movement trajectories when manipulating objects with specific properties, such as doors. Therefore, applying the appropriate force is crucial to prevent damage to both the robots and the objects. However, current vision-guided robot state generation methods often falter in this regard, as they lack the integration of tactile perception. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a novel state diffusion framework termed SafeDiff. It generates a prospective state sequence from the current robot state and visual context observation while incorporating real-time tactile feedback to refine the sequence. As far as we know, this is the first study specifically focused on ensuring force safety in robotic manipulation. It significantly enhances the rationality of state planning, and the safe action trajectory is derived from inverse dynamics based on this refined planning. In practice, unlike previous approaches that concatenate visual and tactile data to generate future robot state sequences, our method employs tactile data as a calibration signal to adjust the robot's state within the state space implicitly. Additionally, we've developed a large-scale simulation dataset called SafeDoorManip50k, offering extensive multimodal data to train and evaluate the proposed method. Extensive experiments show that our visual-tactile model substantially mitigates the risk of harmful forces in the door opening, across both simulated and real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Teterwak, Kate Saenko, Bryan A. Plummer, Ser-Nam Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adapters enable fine-tuning of large models with only a small number of parameters, thus reducing storage costs and minimizing the risk of catastrophic forgetting. However, they often pose optimization challenges, with poor convergence. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an over-parameterized approach that accelerates training without increasing inference costs. This method reparameterizes low-rank adaptation by employing a separate MLP and learned embedding for each layer. The learned embedding is input to the MLP, which generates the adapter parameters. Such overparamaterization has been shown to implicitly function as an adaptive learning rate and momentum, accelerating optimization. At inference time, the MLP can be discarded, leaving behind a standard low-rank adapter. To study the effect of MLP overparameterization on a small yet difficult proxy task, we implement it for matrix factorization, and find it achieves faster convergence and lower final loss. Extending this approach to larger-scale tasks, we observe consistent performance gains across domains. We achieve improvements in vision-language tasks and especially notable increases in image generation, with CMMD scores improving by up to 15 points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Coleman Haley, Sharon Goldwater, Edoardo Ponti</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a grounded approach to meaning in language typology. We treat data from perceptual modalities, such as images, as a language-agnostic representation of meaning. Hence, we can quantify the function--form relationship between images and captions across languages. Inspired by information theory, we define "groundedness", an empirical measure of contextual semantic contentfulness (formulated as a difference in surprisal) which can be computed with multilingual multimodal language models. As a proof of concept, we apply this measure to the typology of word classes. Our measure captures the contentfulness asymmetry between functional (grammatical) and lexical (content) classes across languages, but contradicts the view that functional classes do not convey content. Moreover, we find universal trends in the hierarchy of groundedness (e.g., nouns > adjectives > verbs), and show that our measure partly correlates with psycholinguistic concreteness norms in English. We release a dataset of groundedness scores for 30 languages. Our results suggest that the grounded typology approach can provide quantitative evidence about semantic function in language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bonan Li, Zicheng Zhang, Xuecheng Nie, Congying Han, Yinhan Hu, Xinmin Qiu, Tiande Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on face stylization with a single artistic target. Existing works for this task often fail to retain the source content while achieving geometry variation. Here, we present a novel StyO model, ie. Stylize the face in only One-shot, to solve the above problem. In particular, StyO exploits a disentanglement and recombination strategy. It first disentangles the content and style of source and target images into identifiers, which are then recombined in a cross manner to derive the stylized face image. In this way, StyO decomposes complex images into independent and specific attributes, and simplifies one-shot face stylization as the combination of different attributes from input images, thus producing results better matching face geometry of target image and content of source one. StyO is implemented with latent diffusion models (LDM) and composed of two key modules: 1) Identifier Disentanglement Learner (IDL) for disentanglement phase. It represents identifiers as contrastive text prompts, ie. positive and negative descriptions. And it introduces a novel triple reconstruction loss to fine-tune the pre-trained LDM for encoding style and content into corresponding identifiers; 2) Fine-grained Content Controller (FCC) for the recombination phase. It recombines disentangled identifiers from IDL to form an augmented text prompt for generating stylized faces. In addition, FCC also constrains the cross-attention maps of latent and text features to preserve source face details in results. The extensive evaluation shows that StyO produces high-quality images on numerous paintings of various styles and outperforms the current state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chan-Yun Yang, Nilantha Premakumara, Hooman Samani, Chinthaka Premachandra</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to identifying patients with insomnia using a single EEG channel, without the need for sleep stage annotation. Data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification techniques are used to automatically detect insomnia based on features extracted from spectral and temporal domains, including relative power in the delta, sigma, beta and gamma bands, total power, absolute slow wave power, power ratios, mean, zero crossing rate, mobility, and complexity. A Pearson correlation coefficient, t-test, p-value, and two rules are used to select the optimal set of features for accurately classifying insomnia patients and rejecting negatively affecting features. Classification schemes including a general artificial neural network, convolutional neural network, and support vector machine are applied to the optimal feature set to distinguish between insomnia patients and healthy subjects. The performance of the model is validated using 50 insomnia patients and 50 healthy subjects, with the Fp2 channel and 1D-CNN classifier achieving the highest accuracy and Cohen's kappa coefficient at 97.85% and 94.15%, respectively. The developed model has the potential to simplify current sleep monitoring systems and enable in-home ambulatory monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeongjae Cho, Taehee Kim, Heejun Shin, Sungzoon Cho, Dongmyung Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Difference visual question answering (diff-VQA) is a challenging task that requires answering complex questions based on differences between a pair of images. This task is particularly important in reading chest X-ray images because radiologists often compare multiple images of the same patient taken at different times to track disease progression and changes in its severity in their clinical practice. However, previous works focused on designing specific network architectures for the diff-VQA task, missing opportunities to enhance the model's performance using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Here, we introduce a novel VLM called PLURAL, which is pretrained on natural and longitudinal chest X-ray data for the diff-VQA task. The model is developed using a step-by-step approach, starting with being pretrained on natural images and texts, followed by being trained using longitudinal chest X-ray data. The longitudinal data consist of pairs of X-ray images, along with question-answer sets and radiologist's reports that describe the changes in lung abnormalities and diseases over time. Our experimental results show that the PLURAL model outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only in diff-VQA for longitudinal X-rays but also in conventional VQA for a single X-ray image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VLM architecture and pretraining method in improving the model's performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piero Fraternali, Luca Morandini, Sergio Luis Herrera Gonz\'alez</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection and characterization of illegal solid waste disposal sites are essential for environmental protection, particularly for mitigating pollution and health hazards. Improperly managed landfills contaminate soil and groundwater via rainwater infiltration, posing threats to both animals and humans. Traditional landfill identification approaches, such as on-site inspections, are time-consuming and expensive. Remote sensing is a cost-effective solution for the identification and monitoring of solid waste disposal sites that enables broad coverage and repeated acquisitions over time. Earth Observation (EO) satellites, equipped with an array of sensors and imaging capabilities, have been providing high-resolution data for several decades. Researchers proposed specialized techniques that leverage remote sensing imagery to perform a range of tasks such as waste site detection, dumping site monitoring, and assessment of suitable locations for new landfills. This review aims to provide a detailed illustration of the most relevant proposals for the detection and monitoring of solid waste sites by describing and comparing the approaches, the implemented techniques, and the employed data. Furthermore, since the data sources are of the utmost importance for developing an effective solid waste detection model, a comprehensive overview of the satellites and publicly available data sets is presented. Finally, this paper identifies the open issues in the state-of-the-art and discusses the relevant research directions for reducing the costs and improving the effectiveness of novel solid waste detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faith Johnson, Bryan Bo Cao, Ashwin Ashok, Shubham Jain, Kristin Dana</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual navigation follows the intuition that humans can navigate without detailed maps. A common approach is interactive exploration while building a topological graph with images at nodes that can be used for planning. Recent variations learn from passive videos and can navigate using complex social and semantic cues. However, a significant number of training videos are needed, large graphs are utilized, and scenes are not unseen since odometry is utilized. We introduce a new approach to visual navigation using feudal learning, which employs a hierarchical structure consisting of a worker agent, a mid-level manager, and a high-level manager. Key to the feudal learning paradigm, agents at each level see a different aspect of the task and operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Two unique modules are developed in this framework. For the high-level manager, we learn a memory proxy map in a self supervised manner to record prior observations in a learned latent space and avoid the use of graphs and odometry. For the mid-level manager, we develop a waypoint network that outputs intermediate subgoals imitating human waypoint selection during local navigation. This waypoint network is pre-trained using a new, small set of teleoperation videos that we make publicly available, with training environments different from testing environments. The resulting feudal navigation network achieves near SOTA performance, while providing a novel no-RL, no-graph, no-odometry, no-metric map approach to the image goal navigation task.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10210">MK-SGN: A Spiking Graph Convolutional Network with Multimodal Fusion and Knowledge Distillation for Skeleton-based Action Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Naichuan Zheng, Hailun Xia, Zeyu Liang, Yuchen Du</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, multimodal Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved remarkable performance in skeleton-based action recognition. The reliance on high-energy-consuming continuous floating-point operations inherent in GCN-based methods poses significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained, battery-powered edge devices. To address these limitations, MK-SGN, a Spiking Graph Convolutional Network with Multimodal Fusion and Knowledge Distillation, is proposed to leverage the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for skeleton-based action recognition for the first time. By integrating the energy-saving properties of SNNs with the graph representation capabilities of GCNs, MK-SGN achieves significant reductions in energy consumption while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy. Firstly, we formulate a Spiking Multimodal Fusion (SMF) module to effectively fuse multimodal skeleton data represented as spike-form features. Secondly, we propose the Self-Attention Spiking Graph Convolution (SA-SGC) module and the Spiking Temporal Convolution (STC) module, to capture spatial relationships and temporal dynamics of spike-form features. Finally, we propose an integrated knowledge distillation strategy to transfer information from the multimodal GCN to the SGN, incorporating both intermediate-layer distillation and soft-label distillation to enhance the performance of the SGN. MK-SGN exhibits substantial advantages, surpassing state-of-the-art GCN frameworks in energy efficiency and outperforming state-of-the-art SNN frameworks in recognition accuracy. The proposed method achieves a remarkable reduction in energy consumption, exceeding 98\% compared to conventional GCN-based approaches. This research establishes a robust baseline for developing high-performance, energy-efficient SNN-based models for skeleton-based action recognition</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuxiao Ding, Lukas Schneider, Marius Cordts, Juergen Gall</p>
<p>Abstract: Many query-based approaches for 3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) adopt the tracking-by-attention paradigm, utilizing track queries for identity-consistent detection and object queries for identity-agnostic track spawning. Tracking-by-attention, however, entangles detection and tracking queries in one embedding for both the detection and tracking task, which is sub-optimal. Other approaches resemble the tracking-by-detection paradigm and detect objects using decoupled track and detection queries followed by a subsequent association. These methods, however, do not leverage synergies between the detection and association task. Combining the strengths of both paradigms, we introduce ADA-Track++, a novel end-to-end framework for 3D MOT from multi-view cameras. We introduce a learnable data association module based on edge-augmented cross-attention, leveraging appearance and geometric features. We also propose an auxiliary token in this attention-based association module, which helps mitigate disproportionately high attention to incorrect association targets caused by attention normalization. Furthermore, we integrate this association module into the decoder layer of a DETR-based 3D detector, enabling simultaneous DETR-like query-to-image cross-attention for detection and query-to-query cross-attention for data association. By stacking these decoder layers, queries are refined for the detection and association task alternately, effectively harnessing the task dependencies. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the advantage of our approach compared to the two previous paradigms.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07828">Spatial Annealing for Efficient Few-shot Neural Rendering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuru Xiao, Deming Zhai, Wenbo Zhao, Kui Jiang, Junjun Jiang, Xianming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with hybrid representations have shown impressive capabilities for novel view synthesis, delivering high efficiency. Nonetheless, their performance significantly drops with sparse input views. Various regularization strategies have been devised to address these challenges. However, these strategies either require additional rendering costs or involve complex pipeline designs, leading to a loss of training efficiency. Although FreeNeRF has introduced an efficient frequency annealing strategy, its operation on frequency positional encoding is incompatible with the efficient hybrid representations. In this paper, we introduce an accurate and efficient few-shot neural rendering method named \textbf{S}patial \textbf{A}nnealing regularized \textbf{NeRF} (\textbf{SANeRF}), which adopts the pre-filtering design of a hybrid representation. We initially establish the analytical formulation of the frequency band limit for a hybrid architecture by deducing its filtering process. Based on this analysis, we propose a universal form of frequency annealing in the spatial domain, which can be implemented by modulating the sampling kernel to exponentially shrink from an initial one with a narrow grid tangent kernel spectrum. This methodology is crucial for stabilizing the early stages of the training phase and significantly contributes to enhancing the subsequent process of detail refinement. Our extensive experiments reveal that, by adding merely one line of code, SANeRF delivers superior rendering quality and much faster reconstruction speed compared to current few-shot neural rendering methods. Notably, SANeRF outperforms FreeNeRF on the Blender dataset, achieving 700$\times$ faster reconstruction speed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Limited accessibility to neurological care leads to underdiagnosed Parkinson's Disease (PD), preventing early intervention. Existing AI-based PD detection methods primarily focus on unimodal analysis of motor or speech tasks, overlooking the multifaceted nature of the disease. To address this, we introduce a large-scale, multi-task video dataset consisting of 1102 sessions (each containing videos of finger tapping, facial expression, and speech tasks captured via webcam) from 845 participants (272 with PD). We propose a novel Uncertainty-calibrated Fusion Network (UFNet) that leverages this multimodal data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. UFNet employs independent task-specific networks, trained with Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification, followed by self-attended fusion of features, with attention weights dynamically adjusted based on task-specific uncertainties. To ensure patient-centered evaluation, the participants were randomly split into three sets: 60% for training, 20% for model selection, and 20% for final performance evaluation. UFNet significantly outperformed single-task models in terms of accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUROC), and sensitivity while maintaining non-inferior specificity. Withholding uncertain predictions further boosted the performance, achieving 88.0+-0.3%$ accuracy, 93.0+-0.2% AUROC, 79.3+-0.9% sensitivity, and 92.6+-0.3% specificity, at the expense of not being able to predict for 2.3+-0.3% data (+- denotes 95% confidence interval). Further analysis suggests that the trained model does not exhibit any detectable bias across sex and ethnic subgroups and is most effective for individuals aged between 50 and 80. Requiring only a webcam and microphone, our approach facilitates accessible home-based PD screening, especially in regions with limited healthcare resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parsa Rahimi, Behrooz Razeghi, Sebastien Marcel</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the potential of image-to-image translation (I2I) techniques for transferring realism to 3D-rendered facial images in the context of Face Recognition (FR) systems. The primary motivation for using 3D-rendered facial images lies in their ability to circumvent the challenges associated with collecting large real face datasets for training FR systems. These images are generated entirely by 3D rendering engines, facilitating the generation of synthetic identities. However, it has been observed that FR systems trained on such synthetic datasets underperform when compared to those trained on real datasets, on various FR benchmarks. In this work, we demonstrate that by transferring the realism to 3D-rendered images (i.e., making the 3D-rendered images look more real), we can boost the performance of FR systems trained on these more photorealistic images. This improvement is evident when these systems are evaluated against FR benchmarks utilizing real-world data, thereby paving new pathways for employing synthetic data in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) mark a revolutionary advance in neural networks with their token mixer's powerful global context capability. However, the pairwise token affinity and complex matrix operations limit its deployment on resource-constrained scenarios and real-time applications, such as mobile devices, although considerable efforts have been made in previous works. In this paper, we introduce CAS-ViT: Convolutional Additive Self-attention Vision Transformers, to achieve a balance between efficiency and performance in mobile applications. Firstly, we argue that the capability of token mixers to obtain global contextual information hinges on multiple information interactions, such as spatial and channel domains. Subsequently, we propose Convolutional Additive Token Mixer (CATM) employing underlying spatial and channel attention as novel interaction forms. This module eliminates troublesome complex operations such as matrix multiplication and Softmax. We introduce Convolutional Additive Self-attention(CAS) block hybrid architecture and utilize CATM for each block. And further, we build a family of lightweight networks, which can be easily extended to various downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate CAS-ViT across a variety of vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Our M and T model achieves 83.0\%/84.1\% top-1 with only 12M/21M parameters on ImageNet-1K. Meanwhile, throughput evaluations on GPUs, ONNX, and iPhones also demonstrate superior results compared to other state-of-the-art backbones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a better balance of performance, efficient inference and easy-to-deploy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazi Hasan Ibn Arif, JinYi Yoon, Dimitrios S. Nikolopoulos, Hans Vandierendonck, Deepu John, Bo Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in multimodal tasks to enhance accuracy by preserving detailed image information. However, these models often generate excessive visual tokens due to encoding multiple partitions of the input image. Processing these excessive visual tokens is computationally challenging, especially in resource-constrained environments with commodity GPUs. To support high-resolution images while meeting resource constraints, we propose High-Resolution Early Dropping (HiRED), a token-dropping scheme that operates within a fixed token budget before the Large Language Model (LLM) stage. HiRED can be integrated with existing high-resolution VLMs in a plug-and-play manner, as it requires no additional training while still maintaining superior accuracy. We strategically use the vision encoder's attention in the initial layers to assess the visual content of each image partition and allocate the token budget accordingly. Then, using the attention in the final layer, we select the most important visual tokens from each partition within the allocated budget, dropping the rest. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-Next-7B on NVIDIA TESLA P40 GPU, HiRED with a 20% token budget increases token generation throughput by 4.7, reduces first-token generation latency by 15 seconds, and saves 2.3 GB of GPU memory for a single inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khanh-Binh Nguyen, Chae Jung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a technique in self-supervised learning that focuses on acquiring detailed visual representations from unlabeled images by estimating the missing pixels in randomly masked sections. It has proven to be a powerful tool for the preliminary training of Vision Transformers (ViTs), yielding impressive results across various tasks. Nevertheless, most MIM methods heavily depend on the random masking strategy to formulate the pretext task. This strategy necessitates numerous trials to ascertain the optimal dropping ratio, which can be resource-intensive, requiring the model to be pre-trained for anywhere between 800 to 1600 epochs. Furthermore, this approach may not be suitable for all datasets. In this work, we propose a new masking strategy that effectively helps the model capture global and local features. Based on this masking strategy, SymMIM, our proposed training pipeline for MIM is introduced. SymMIM achieves a new SOTA accuracy of 85.9\% on ImageNet using ViT-Large and surpasses previous SOTA across downstream tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation tasks, and so on.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojian Huang, Chuanyu Qin, Zhe Liu, Kaijing Ma, Jin Chen, Han Fang, Chao Ban, Hao Sun, Zhongjiang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view classification (MVC) faces inherent challenges due to domain gaps and inconsistencies across different views, often resulting in uncertainties during the fusion process. While Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) has been effective in addressing view uncertainty, existing methods predominantly rely on the Dempster-Shafer combination rule, which is sensitive to conflicting evidence and often neglects the critical role of neighborhood structures within multi-view data. To address these limitations, we propose a Trusted Unified Feature-NEighborhood Dynamics (TUNED) model for robust MVC. This method effectively integrates local and global feature-neighborhood (F-N) structures for robust decision-making. Specifically, we begin by extracting local F-N structures within each view. To further mitigate potential uncertainties and conflicts in multi-view fusion, we employ a selective Markov random field that adaptively manages cross-view neighborhood dependencies. Additionally, we employ a shared parameterized evidence extractor that learns global consensus conditioned on local F-N structures, thereby enhancing the global integration of multi-view features. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves accuracy and robustness over existing approaches, particularly in scenarios with high uncertainty and conflicting views. The code will be made available at https://github.com/JethroJames/TUNED.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianmin Chen, Peiliang Huang, Xiaoxu Feng, Dingwen Zhang, Longfei Han, Junwei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-light image enhancement, particularly in cross-domain tasks such as mapping from the raw domain to the sRGB domain, remains a significant challenge. Many deep learning-based methods have been developed to address this issue and have shown promising results in recent years. However, single-stage methods, which attempt to unify the complex mapping across both domains, leading to limited denoising performance. In contrast, two-stage approaches typically decompose a raw image with color filter arrays (CFA) into a four-channel RGGB format before feeding it into a neural network. However, this strategy overlooks the critical role of demosaicing within the Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, leading to color distortions under varying lighting conditions, especially in low-light scenarios. To address these issues, we design a novel Mamba scanning mechanism, called RAWMamba, to effectively handle raw images with different CFAs. Furthermore, we present a Retinex Decomposition Module (RDM) grounded in Retinex prior, which decouples illumination from reflectance to facilitate more effective denoising and automatic non-linear exposure correction. By bridging demosaicing and denoising, better raw image enhancement is achieved. Experimental evaluations conducted on public datasets SID and MCR demonstrate that our proposed RAWMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain mapping.</p>

<p>Abstract: As human eyes serve as conduits of rich information, unveiling emotions, intentions, and even aspects of an individual's health and overall well-being, gaze tracking also enables various human-computer interaction applications, as well as insights in psychological and medical research. However, existing gaze tracking solutions fall short at handling free user movement, and also require laborious user effort in system calibration. We introduce Tri-Cam, a practical deep learning-based gaze tracking system using three affordable RGB webcams. It features a split network structure for efficient training, as well as designated network designs to handle the separated gaze tracking tasks. Tri-Cam is also equipped with an implicit calibration module, which makes use of mouse click opportunities to reduce calibration overhead on the user's end. We evaluate Tri-Cam against Tobii, the state-of-the-art commercial eye tracker, achieving comparable accuracy, while supporting a wider free movement area. In conclusion, Tri-Cam provides a user-friendly, affordable, and robust gaze tracking solution that could practically enable various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faith Johnson, Bryan Bo Cao, Ashwin Ashok, Shubham Jain, Kristin Dana</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual navigation takes inspiration from humans, who navigate in previously unseen environments using vision without detailed environment maps. Inspired by this, we introduce a novel no-RL, no-graph, no-odometry approach to visual navigation using feudal learning to build a three tiered agent. Key to our approach is a memory proxy map (MPM), an intermediate representation of the environment learned in a self-supervised manner by the high-level manager agent that serves as a simplified memory, approximating what the agent has seen. We demonstrate that recording observations in this learned latent space is an effective and efficient memory proxy that can remove the need for graphs and odometry in visual navigation tasks. For the mid-level manager agent, we develop a waypoint network (WayNet) that outputs intermediate subgoals, or waypoints, imitating human waypoint selection during local navigation. For the low-level worker agent, we learn a classifier over a discrete action space that avoids local obstacles and moves the agent towards the WayNet waypoint. The resulting feudal navigation network offers a novel approach with no RL, no graph, no odometry, and no metric map; all while achieving SOTA results on the image goal navigation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Xiang, Zhili Liu, Zihao Jiang, Yunshuang Nie, Runhui Huang, Haoxiang Fan, Hanhui Li, Weiran Huang, Yihan Zeng, Jianhua Han, Lanqing Hong, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging task of multimodal mathematical reasoning by incorporating the ability of ``slow thinking" into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Contrary to existing methods that rely on direct or fast thinking, our key idea is to construct long chains of thought (CoT) consisting of atomic actions in a step-by-step manner, guiding MLLMs to perform complex reasoning. To this end, we design a novel AtomThink framework composed of three key modules: (i) a CoT annotation engine that automatically generates high-quality CoT annotations to address the lack of high-quality visual mathematical data; (ii) an atomic step fine-tuning strategy that jointly optimizes an MLLM and a policy reward model (PRM) for step-wise reasoning; and (iii) four different search strategies that can be applied with the PRM to complete reasoning. Additionally, we propose AtomMATH, a large-scale multimodal dataset of long CoTs, and an atomic capability evaluation metric for mathematical tasks. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed AtomThink significantly improves the performance of baseline MLLMs, achieving approximately 50\% relative accuracy gains on MathVista and 120\% on MathVerse. To support the advancement of multimodal slow-thinking models, we will make our code and dataset publicly available on https://github.com/Quinn777/AtomThink.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16946">Lens Distortion Encoding System Version 1.0</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakub Maksymilian Fober</p>
<p>Abstract: Lens Distortion Encoding System (LDES) allows for a distortion-accurate workflow, with a seamless interchange of high quality motion picture images regardless of the lens source. This system is similar in a concept to the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES), but for distortion. Presented solution is fully compatible with existing software/plug-in tools for STMapping found in popular production software like Adobe After Effects or DaVinci Resolve. LDES utilizes common distortion space and produces single high-quality, animatable STMap used for direct transformation of one view to another, neglecting the need of lens-swapping for each shoot. The LDES profile of a lens consist of two elements; View Map texture, and Footage Map texture, each labeled with the FOV value. Direct distortion mapping is produced by sampling of the Footage Map through the View Map. The result; animatable mapping texture, is then used to sample the footage to a desired distortion. While the Footage Map is specific to a footage, View Maps can be freely combined/transitioned and animated, allowing for effects like smooth shift from anamorphic to spherical distortion, previously impossible to achieve in practice. Presented LDES Version 1.0 uses common 32-bit STMap format for encoding, supported by most compositing software, directly or via plug-ins. The difference between standard STMap workflow and LDES is that it encodes absolute pixel position in the spherical image model. The main benefit of this approach is the ability to achieve a similar look of a highly expensive lens using some less expensive equipment in terms of distortion. It also provides greater artistic control and never seen before manipulation of footage.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17832">SVGDreamer++: Advancing Editability and Diversity in Text-Guided SVG Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Xing, Qian Yu, Chuang Wang, Haitao Zhou, Jing Zhang, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, text-guided scalable vector graphics (SVG) synthesis has demonstrated significant potential in domains such as iconography and sketching. However, SVGs generated from existing Text-to-SVG methods often lack editability and exhibit deficiencies in visual quality and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel text-guided vector graphics synthesis method to address these limitations. To enhance the editability of output SVGs, we introduce a Hierarchical Image VEctorization (HIVE) framework that operates at the semantic object level and supervises the optimization of components within the vector object. This approach facilitates the decoupling of vector graphics into distinct objects and component levels. Our proposed HIVE algorithm, informed by image segmentation priors, not only ensures a more precise representation of vector graphics but also enables fine-grained editing capabilities within vector objects. To improve the diversity of output SVGs, we present a Vectorized Particle-based Score Distillation (VPSD) approach. VPSD addresses over-saturation issues in existing methods and enhances sample diversity. A pre-trained reward model is incorporated to re-weight vector particles, improving aesthetic appeal and enabling faster convergence. Additionally, we design a novel adaptive vector primitives control strategy, which allows for the dynamic adjustment of the number of primitives, thereby enhancing the presentation of graphic details. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods in terms of editability, visual quality, and diversity. We also show that our new method supports up to six distinct vector styles, capable of generating high-quality vector assets suitable for stylized vector design and poster design.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenggang Yang, Yuang Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstract representations of 3D scenes play a crucial role in computer vision, enabling a wide range of applications such as mapping, localization, surface reconstruction, and even advanced tasks like SLAM and rendering. Among these representations, line segments are widely used because of their ability to succinctly capture the structural features of a scene. However, existing 3D reconstruction methods often face significant challenges. Methods relying on 2D projections suffer from instability caused by errors in multi-view matching and occlusions, while direct 3D approaches are hampered by noise and sparsity in 3D point cloud data. This paper introduces LineGS, a novel method that combines geometry-guided 3D line reconstruction with a 3D Gaussian splatting model to address these challenges and improve representation ability. The method leverages the high-density Gaussian point distributions along the edge of the scene to refine and optimize initial line segments generated from traditional geometric approaches. By aligning these segments with the underlying geometric features of the scene, LineGS achieves a more precise and reliable representation of 3D structures. The results show significant improvements in both geometric accuracy and model compactness compared to baseline methods.</p>

These virtual cues can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D trackers, yielding substantial performance gains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxi Yu, Tomohiro Fukuda, Nobuyoshi Yabuki</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-flood building damage assessment is critical for rapid response and post-disaster reconstruction planning. Current research fails to consider the distinct requirements of disaster assessment (DA) from change detection (CD) in neural network design. This paper focuses on two key differences: 1) building change features in DA satellite images are more subtle than in CD; 2) DA datasets face more severe data scarcity and label imbalance. To address these issues, in terms of model architecture, the research explores the benchmark performance of attention mechanisms in post-flood DA tasks and introduces Simple Prior Attention UNet (SPAUNet) to enhance the model's ability to recognize subtle changes, in terms of semi-supervised learning (SSL) strategies, the paper constructs four different combinations of image-level label category reference distributions for consistent training. Experimental results on flood events of xBD dataset show that SPAUNet performs exceptionally well in supervised learning experiments, achieving a recall of 79.10% and an F1 score of 71.32% for damaged classification, outperforming CD methods. The results indicate the necessity of DA task-oriented model design. SSL experiments demonstrate the positive impact of image-level consistency regularization on the model. Using pseudo-labels to form the reference distribution for consistency training yields the best results, proving the potential of using the category distribution of a large amount of unlabeled data for SSL. This paper clarifies the differences between DA and CD tasks. It preliminarily explores model design strategies utilizing prior attention mechanisms and image-level consistency regularization, establishing new post-flood DA task benchmark methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: 6D Object pose estimation is a fundamental component in robotics enabling efficient interaction with the environment. It is particularly challenging in bin-picking applications, where objects may be textureless and in difficult poses, and occlusion between objects of the same type may cause confusion even in well-trained models. We propose a novel method of hard example synthesis that is model-agnostic, using existing simulators and the modeling of pose error in both the camera-to-object viewsphere and occlusion space. Through evaluation of the model performance with respect to the distribution of object poses and occlusions, we discover regions of high error and generate realistic training samples to specifically target these regions. With our training approach, we demonstrate an improvement in correct detection rate of up to 20% across several ROBI-dataset objects using state-of-the-art pose estimation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) is essential for the early detection of infrastructure defects, such as cracks in concrete bridge pier. but often faces challenges in efficiency and accuracy in complex environments. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) achieves excellent segmentation performance, its computational demands limit its suitability for real-time applications on edge devices. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Crack-EdgeSAM, a self-prompting crack segmentation system that integrates YOLOv8 for generating prompt boxes and a fine-tuned EdgeSAM model for crack segmentation. To ensure computational efficiency, the method employs ConvLoRA, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique, along with DiceFocalLoss to fine-tune the EdgeSAM model. Our experimental results on public datasets and the climbing robot automatic inspections demonstrate that the system achieves high segmentation accuracy and significantly enhanced inference speed compared to the most recent methods.

<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated exceptional comprehension and interpretation capabilities in Autonomous Driving (AD) by incorporating large language models. Despite the advancements, current data-driven AD approaches tend to concentrate on a single dataset and specific tasks, neglecting their overall capabilities and ability to generalize. To bridge these gaps, we propose DriveMM, a general large multimodal model designed to process diverse data inputs, such as images and multi-view videos, while performing a broad spectrum of AD tasks, including perception, prediction, and planning. Initially, the model undergoes curriculum pre-training to process varied visual signals and perform basic visual comprehension and perception tasks. Subsequently, we augment and standardize various AD-related datasets to fine-tune the model, resulting in an all-in-one LMM for autonomous driving. To assess the general capabilities and generalization ability, we conduct evaluations on six public benchmarks and undertake zero-shot transfer on an unseen dataset, where DriveMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. We hope DriveMM as a promising solution for future end-to-end autonomous driving applications in the real world. Project page with code: https://github.com/zhijian11/DriveMM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Hamara, Benjamin Kilpatrick, Alex Baratta, Brendon Kofink, Andrew C. Freeman</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed the rise of novel ``event-based'' camera sensors for high-speed, low-power video capture. Rather than recording discrete image frames, these sensors output asynchronous ``event'' tuples with microsecond precision, only when the brightness change of a given pixel exceeds a certain threshold. Although these sensors have enabled compelling new computer vision applications, these applications often require expensive, power-hungry GPU systems, rendering them incompatible for deployment on the low-power devices for which event cameras are optimized. Whereas receiver-driven rate adaptation is a crucial feature of modern video streaming solutions, this topic is underexplored in the realm of event-based vision systems. On a real-world event camera dataset, we first demonstrate that a state-of-the-art object detection application is resilient to dramatic data loss, and that this loss may be weighted towards the end of each temporal window. We then propose a scalable streaming method for event-based data based on Media Over QUIC, prioritizing object detection performance and low latency. The application server can receive complementary event data across several streams simultaneously, and drop streams as needed to maintain a certain latency. With a latency target of 5 ms for end-to-end transmission across a small network, we observe an average reduction in detection mAP as low as 0.36. With a more relaxed latency target of 50 ms, we observe an average mAP reduction as low as 0.19.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiding Zhu, Wenhui Dong, Jun Song, Yingbo Wang, Yanan Guo, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to process high-resolution images. A common approach currently involves dynamically cropping the original high-resolution image into smaller sub-images, which are then fed into a vision encoder that was pre-trained on lower-resolution images. However, this cropping approach often truncates objects and connected areas in the original image, causing semantic breaks. To address this limitation, we introduce HyViLM, designed to process images of any resolution while retaining the overall context during encoding. Specifically, we: (i) Design a new visual encoder called Hybrid Encoder that not only encodes individual sub-images but also interacts with detailed global visual features, significantly improving the model's ability to encode high-resolution images. (ii) Propose an optimal feature fusion strategy for the dynamic cropping approach, effectively leveraging information from different layers of the vision encoder.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoran Yang, Xi Guo, Chenjing Ding, Chiyu Wang, Wei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving requires robust perception models trained on high-quality, large-scale multi-view driving videos for tasks like 3D object detection, segmentation and trajectory prediction. While world models provide a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving videos, challenges remain in ensuring these videos adhere to fundamental physical principles, such as relative and absolute motion, spatial relationship like occlusion and spatial consistency, and temporal consistency. To address these, we propose DrivePhysica, an innovative model designed to generate realistic multi-view driving videos that accurately adhere to essential physical principles through three key advancements: (1) a Coordinate System Aligner module that integrates relative and absolute motion features to enhance motion interpretation, (2) an Instance Flow Guidance module that ensures precise temporal consistency via efficient 3D flow extraction, and (3) a Box Coordinate Guidance module that improves spatial relationship understanding and accurately resolves occlusion hierarchies. Grounded in physical principles, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in driving video generation quality (3.96 FID and 38.06 FVD on the Nuscenes dataset) and downstream perception tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zejian Li, Chenye Meng, Yize Li, Ling Yang, Shengyuan Zhang, Jiarui Ma, Jiayi Li, Guang Yang, Changyuan Yang, Zhiyuan Yang, Jinxiong Chang, Lingyun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have shown remarkable success in producing high-quality images from text. However, existing T2I models show decayed performance in compositional image generation involving multiple objects and intricate relationships. We attribute this problem to limitations in existing datasets of image-text pairs, which lack precise inter-object relationship annotations with prompts only. To address this problem, we construct LAION-SG, a large-scale dataset with high-quality structural annotations of scene graphs (SG), which precisely describe attributes and relationships of multiple objects, effectively representing the semantic structure in complex scenes. Based on LAION-SG, we train a new foundation model SDXL-SG to incorporate structural annotation information into the generation process. Extensive experiments show advanced models trained on our LAION-SG boast significant performance improvements in complex scene generation over models on existing datasets. We also introduce CompSG-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates models on compositional image generation, establishing a new standard for this domain. Our annotations with the associated processing code, the foundation model and the benchmark protocol are publicly available at https://github.com/mengcye/LAION-SG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelrahman Elnenaey, Marwan Torki</p>
<p>Abstract: Image reflection removal is crucial for restoring image quality. Distorted images can negatively impact tasks like object detection and image segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel approach for image reflection removal using a single image. Instead of focusing on model architecture, we introduce a new training technique that can be generalized to image-to-image problems, with input and output being similar in nature. This technique is embodied in our multi-step loss mechanism, which has proven effective in the reflection removal task. Additionally, we address the scarcity of reflection removal training data by synthesizing a high-quality, non-linear synthetic dataset called RefGAN using Pix2Pix GAN. This dataset significantly enhances the model's ability to learn better patterns for reflection removal. We also utilize a ranged depth map, extracted from the depth estimation of the ambient image, as an auxiliary feature, leveraging its property of lacking depth estimations for reflections. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on the SIR^2 benchmark and other real-world datasets, proving its effectiveness by outperforming other state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunxiao Li, Xiaoxiao Wang, Boming Miao, Chuanlong Xie, Zizhe Wang, Yao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image classification serves as the cornerstone of computer vision, traditionally achieved through discriminative models based on deep neural networks. Recent advancements have introduced classification methods derived from generative models, which offer the advantage of zero-shot classification. However, these methods suffer from two main drawbacks: high computational overhead and inferior performance compared to discriminative models. Inspired by the coordinated cognitive processes of rapid-slow pathway interactions in the human brain during visual signal recognition, we propose the Diffusion-Based Discriminative Model Enhancement Framework (DBMEF). This framework seamlessly integrates discriminative and generative models in a training-free manner, leveraging discriminative models for initial predictions and endowing deep neural networks with rethinking capabilities via diffusion models. Consequently, DBMEF can effectively enhance the classification accuracy and generalization capability of discriminative models in a plug-and-play manner. We have conducted extensive experiments across 17 prevalent deep model architectures with different training methods, including both CNN-based models such as ResNet and Transformer-based models like ViT, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DBMEF. Specifically, the framework yields a 1.51\% performance improvement for ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset and 3.02\% on the ImageNet-A dataset. In conclusion, our research introduces a novel paradigm for image classification, demonstrating stable improvements across different datasets and neural networks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiwen Gu, Xufei Wang, Fenglin Zhang, Junqiao Zhao, Siyue Tao, Chen Ye, Tiantian Feng, Changjun Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to robustly identify locations by leveraging image retrieval based on descriptors encoded from environmental images. However, drastic appearance changes of images captured from different viewpoints at the same location pose incoherent supervision signals for descriptor learning, which severely hinder the performance of VPR. Previous work proposes classifying images based on manually defined rules or ground truth labels for viewpoints, followed by descriptor training based on the classification results. However, not all datasets have ground truth labels of viewpoints and manually defined rules may be suboptimal, leading to degraded descriptor performance.To address these challenges, we introduce the mutual learning of viewpoint self-classification and VPR. Starting from coarse classification based on geographical coordinates, we progress to finer classification of viewpoints using simple clustering techniques. The dataset is partitioned in an unsupervised manner while simultaneously training a descriptor extractor for place recognition. Experimental results show that this approach almost perfectly partitions the dataset based on viewpoints, thus achieving mutually reinforcing effects. Our method even excels state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that partition datasets using ground truth labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Li, Di Liu, Jun Kong, Sen Li, Hui Xu, Jianzhong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal action localization (TAL) involves dual tasks to classify and localize actions within untrimmed videos. However, the two tasks often have conflicting requirements for features. Existing methods typically employ separate heads for classification and localization tasks but share the same input feature, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel TAL method with Cross Layer Task Decoupling and Refinement (CLTDR). Based on the feature pyramid of video, CLTDR strategy integrates semantically strong features from higher pyramid layers and detailed boundary-aware boundary features from lower pyramid layers to effectively disentangle the action classification and localization tasks. Moreover, the multiple features from cross layers are also employed to refine and align the disentangled classification and regression results. At last, a lightweight Gated Multi-Granularity (GMG) module is proposed to comprehensively extract and aggregate video features at instant, local, and global temporal granularities. Benefiting from the CLTDR and GMG modules, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging benchmarks: THUMOS14, MultiTHUMOS, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS.

<p>Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation necessitates seamless integration of audio and visual data amidst the challenges posed by diverse input portraits and intricate correlations between audio and facial motions. In response, we propose a robust framework GoHD designed to produce highly realistic, expressive, and controllable portrait videos from any reference identity with any motion. GoHD innovates with three key modules: Firstly, an animation module utilizing latent navigation is introduced to improve the generalization ability across unseen input styles. This module achieves high disentanglement of motion and identity, and it also incorporates gaze orientation to rectify unnatural eye movements that were previously overlooked. Secondly, a conformer-structured conditional diffusion model is designed to guarantee head poses that are aware of prosody. Thirdly, to estimate lip-synchronized and realistic expressions from the input audio within limited training data, a two-stage training strategy is devised to decouple frequent and frame-wise lip motion distillation from the generation of other more temporally dependent but less audio-related motions, e.g., blinks and frowns. Extensive experiments validate GoHD's advanced generalization capabilities, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating realistic talking face results on arbitrary subjects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunchen Yuan, Junyuan Xiao, Xinjie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in image restoration increasingly employ conditional latent diffusion models (CLDMs). While these models have demonstrated notable performance improvements in recent years, this work questions their suitability for IR tasks. CLDMs excel in capturing high-level semantic correlations, making them effective for tasks like text-to-image generation with spatial conditioning. However, in IR, where the goal is to enhance image perceptual quality, these models face difficulty of modeling the relationship between degraded images and ground truth images using a low-level representation. To support our claims, we compare state-of-the-art CLDMs with traditional image restoration models through extensive experiments. Results reveal that despite the scaling advantages of CLDMs, they suffer from high distortion and semantic deviation, especially in cases with minimal degradation, where traditional methods outperform them. Additionally, we perform empirical studies to examine the impact of various CLDM design elements on their restoration performance. We hope this finding inspires a reexamination of current CLDM-based IR solutions, opening up more opportunities in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxiang Li, Yaowei Li, Yuhang Yang, Junjie Cao, Zhihong Zhu, Xuxin Cheng, Long Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Controllable human image animation aims to generate videos from reference images using driving videos. Due to the limited control signals provided by sparse guidance (e.g., skeleton pose), recent works have attempted to introduce additional dense conditions (e.g., depth map) to ensure motion alignment. However, such strict dense guidance impairs the quality of the generated video when the body shape of the reference character differs significantly from that of the driving video. In this paper, we present DisPose to mine more generalizable and effective control signals without additional dense input, which disentangles the sparse skeleton pose in human image animation into motion field guidance and keypoint correspondence. Specifically, we generate a dense motion field from a sparse motion field and the reference image, which provides region-level dense guidance while maintaining the generalization of the sparse pose control. We also extract diffusion features corresponding to pose keypoints from the reference image, and then these point features are transferred to the target pose to provide distinct identity information. To seamlessly integrate into existing models, we propose a plug-and-play hybrid ControlNet that improves the quality and consistency of generated videos while freezing the existing model parameters. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of DisPose compared to current methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Zimmerlin, Jens Bei{\ss}wenger, Bernhard Jaeger, Andreas Geiger, Kashyap Chitta</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end driving systems have made rapid progress, but have so far not been applied to the challenging new CARLA Leaderboard 2.0. Further, while there is a large body of literature on end-to-end architectures and training strategies, the impact of the training dataset is often overlooked. In this work, we make a first attempt at end-to-end driving for Leaderboard 2.0. Instead of investigating architectures, we systematically analyze the training dataset, leading to new insights: (1) Expert style significantly affects downstream policy performance. (2) In complex data sets, the frames should not be weighted on the basis of simplistic criteria such as class frequencies. (3) Instead, estimating whether a frame changes the target labels compared to previous frames can reduce the size of the dataset without removing important information. By incorporating these findings, our model ranks first and second respectively on the map and sensors tracks of the 2024 CARLA Challenge, and sets a new state-of-the-art on the Bench2Drive test routes. Finally, we uncover a design flaw in the current evaluation metrics and propose a modification for future challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junqi Ge, Ziyi Chen, Jintao Lin, Jinguo Zhu, Xihui Liu, Jifeng Dai, Xizhou Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising capabilities in handling various multimodal tasks, yet they struggle in long-context scenarios, particularly in tasks involving videos, high-resolution images, or lengthy image-text documents. In our work, we first conduct an empirical analysis of the long-context capabilities of VLMs using our augmented long-context multimodal datasets. Our findings reveal that directly applying the positional encoding mechanism used for textual tokens to visual tokens is suboptimal, and VLM performance degrades sharply when the position encoding exceeds the model's context window. To address this, we propose Variable Visual Position Encoding (V2PE), a novel positional encoding approach that employs variable and smaller increments for visual tokens, enabling more efficient management of long multimodal sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of V2PE to enhances VLMs' ability to effectively understand and reason over long multimodal contexts. We further integrate V2PE with our augmented long-context multimodal datasets to fine-tune the open-source VLM, InternVL2. The fine-tuned model achieves strong performance on both standard and long-context multimodal tasks. Notably, when the sequence length of the training dataset is increased to 256K tokens, the model is capable of processing multimodal sequences up to 1M tokens, highlighting its potential for real-world long-context applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shitong Shao, Xu Dai, Lujun Li, Huanran Chen, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probability Models (DPMs) have made impressive advancements in various machine learning domains. However, achieving high-quality synthetic samples typically involves performing a large number of sampling steps, which impedes the possibility of real-time sample synthesis. Traditional accelerated sampling algorithms via knowledge distillation rely on pre-trained model weights and discrete time step scenarios, necessitating additional training sessions to achieve their goals. To address these issues, we propose the Catch-Up Distillation (CUD), which encourages the current moment output of the velocity estimation model ``catch up'' with its previous moment output. Specifically, CUD adjusts the original Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) training objective to align the current moment output with both the ground truth label and the previous moment output, utilizing Runge-Kutta-based multi-step alignment distillation for precise ODE estimation while preventing asynchronous updates. Furthermore, we investigate the design space for CUDs under continuous time-step scenarios and analyze how to determine the suitable strategies. To demonstrate CUD's effectiveness, we conduct thorough ablation and comparison experiments on CIFAR-10, MNIST, and ImageNet-64. On CIFAR-10, we obtain a FID of 2.80 by sampling in 15 steps under one-session training and the new state-of-the-art FID of 3.37 by sampling in one step with additional training. This latter result necessitated only 620k iterations with a batch size of 128, in contrast to Consistency Distillation, which demanded 2100k iterations with a larger batch size of 256.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Selig, Thomas M\"arz, Martin Storath, Andreas Weinmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Computed tomography from a low radiation dose (LDCT) is challenging due to high noise in the projection data. Popular approaches for LDCT image reconstruction are two-stage methods, typically consisting of the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm followed by a neural network for LDCT image enhancement. Two-stage methods are attractive for their simplicity and potential for computational efficiency, typically requiring only a single FBP and a neural network forward pass for inference. However, the best reconstruction quality is currently achieved by unrolled iterative methods (Learned Primal-Dual and ItNet), which are more complex and thus have a higher computational cost for training and inference. We propose a method combining the simplicity and efficiency of two-stage methods with state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Our strategy utilizes a neural network pretrained for Gaussian noise removal from natural grayscale images, fine-tuned for LDCT image enhancement. We call this method FBP-DTSGD (Domain and Task Shifted Gaussian Denoisers) as the fine-tuning is a task shift from Gaussian denoising to enhancing LDCT images and a domain shift from natural grayscale to LDCT images. An ablation study with three different pretrained Gaussian denoisers indicates that the performance of FBP-DTSGD does not depend on a specific denoising architecture, suggesting future advancements in Gaussian denoising could benefit the method. The study also shows that pretraining on natural images enhances LDCT reconstruction quality, especially with limited training data. Notably, pretraining involves no additional cost, as existing pretrained models are used. The proposed method currently holds the top mean position in the LoDoPaB-CT challenge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pathology plays an important role in disease diagnosis, treatment decision-making and drug development. Previous works on interpretability for machine learning models on pathology images have revolved around methods such as attention value visualization and deriving human-interpretable features from model heatmaps. Mechanistic interpretability is an emerging area of model interpretability that focuses on reverse-engineering neural networks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising direction in terms of extracting monosemantic features from polysemantic model activations. In this work, we trained a Sparse Autoencoder on the embeddings of a pathology pretrained foundation model. We found that Sparse Autoencoder features represent interpretable and monosemantic biological concepts. In particular, individual SAE dimensions showed strong correlations with cell type counts such as plasma cells and lymphocytes. These biological representations were unique to the pathology pretrained model and were not found in a self-supervised model pretrained on natural images. We demonstrated that such biologically-grounded monosemantic representations evolved across the model's depth, and the pathology foundation model eventually gained robustness to non-biological factors such as scanner type. The emergence of biologically relevant SAE features was generalizable to an out-of-domain dataset. Our work paved the way for further exploration around interpretable feature dimensions and their utility for medical and clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> An Vuong, Thinh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiplicative noise, also known as speckle or pepper noise, commonly affects images produced by synthetic aperture radar (SAR), lasers, or optical lenses. Unlike additive noise, which typically arises from thermal processes or external factors, multiplicative noise is inherent to the system, originating from the fluctuation in diffuse reflections. These fluctuations result in multiple copies of the same signal with varying magnitudes being combined. Consequently, despeckling, or removing multiplicative noise, necessitates different techniques compared to those used for additive noise removal.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach using Stochastic Differential Equations based diffusion models to address multiplicative noise. We demonstrate that multiplicative noise can be effectively modeled as a Geometric Brownian Motion process in the logarithmic domain. Utilizing the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive the corresponding reverse process for image denoising. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on two different datasets, comparing our approach to both classical signal processing techniques and contemporary CNN-based noise removal models. Our results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods on perception-based metrics such as FID and LPIPS, while maintaining competitive performance on traditional metrics like PSNR and SSIM.</p>

However, the gap between gaze tracking accuracy (2-3 cm) and text line spacing (3-5 mm) makes direct application impractical. Existing methods leverage the linear reading pattern but fail during jump reading. This paper presents a reading tracking and highlighting system that supports both linear and jump reading. Based on experimental insights from the gaze nature study of 16 users, two gaze error models are designed to enable both jump reading detection and relocation. The system further leverages the large language model's contextual perception capability in aiding reading tracking. A reading tracking domain-specific line-gaze alignment opportunity is also exploited to enable dynamic and frequent calibration of the gaze results. Controlled experiments demonstrate reliable linear reading tracking, as well as 84% accuracy in tracking jump reading. Furthermore, real field tests with 18 volunteers demonstrated the system's effectiveness in tracking and highlighting read paragraphs, improving reading efficiency, and enhancing user experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sedjro Salomon Hotegni, Sebastian Peitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Extensive research has shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to slight adversarial perturbations$-$small changes to the input data that appear insignificant but cause the model to produce drastically different outputs. In addition to augmenting training data with adversarial examples generated from a specific attack method, most of the current defense strategies necessitate modifying the original model architecture components to improve robustness or performing test-time data purification to handle adversarial attacks. In this work, we demonstrate that strong feature representation learning during training can significantly enhance the original model's robustness. We propose MOREL, a multi-objective feature representation learning approach, encouraging classification models to produce similar features for inputs within the same class, despite perturbations. Our training method involves an embedding space where cosine similarity loss and multi-positive contrastive loss are used to align natural and adversarial features from the model encoder and ensure tight clustering. Concurrently, the classifier is motivated to achieve accurate predictions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of DNNs against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks, outperforming other methods that similarly require no architectural changes or test-time data purification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> De-Xing Huang, Xiao-Hu Zhou, Mei-Jiang Gui, Xiao-Liang Xie, Shi-Qi Liu, Shuang-Yi Wang, Hao Li, Tian-Yu Xiang, Zeng-Guang Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Iodinated contrast agents are widely utilized in numerous interventional procedures, yet posing substantial health risks to patients. This paper presents CAS-GAN, a novel GAN framework that serves as a "virtual contrast agent" to synthesize X-ray angiographies via disentanglement representation learning and vessel semantic guidance, thereby reducing the reliance on iodinated contrast agents during interventional procedures. Specifically, our approach disentangles X-ray angiographies into background and vessel components, leveraging medical prior knowledge. A specialized predictor then learns to map the interrelationships between these components. Additionally, a vessel semantic-guided generator and a corresponding loss function are introduced to enhance the visual fidelity of generated images. Experimental results on the XCAD dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our CAS-GAN, achieving a FID of 5.87 and a MMD of 0.016. These promising results highlight CAS-GAN's potential for clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sikai Yang, Kang Yang, Yuning Chen, Fan Zhao, Wan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents ARD2, a framework that enables real-time through-wall surveillance using two aerial drones and an augmented reality (AR) device. ARD2 consists of two main steps: target direction estimation and contour reconstruction. In the first stage, ARD2 leverages geometric relationships between the drones, the user, and the target to project the target's direction onto the user's AR display. In the second stage, images from the drones are synthesized to reconstruct the target's contour, allowing the user to visualize the target behind walls. Experimental results demonstrate the system's accuracy in both direction estimation and contour reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anoop Cherian, Radu Corcodel, Siddarth Jain, Diego Romeres</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical reasoning is an important skill needed for robotic agents when operating in the real world. However, solving such reasoning problems often involves hypothesizing and reflecting over complex multi-body interactions under the effect of a multitude of physical forces and thus learning all such interactions poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, including large language models (LLMs). To study this problem, we propose a new physical reasoning task and a dataset, dubbed TraySim. Our task involves predicting the dynamics of several objects on a tray that is given an external impact -- the domino effect of the ensued object interactions and their dynamics thus offering a challenging yet controlled setup, with the goal of reasoning being to infer the stability of the objects after the impact. To solve this complex physical reasoning task, we present LLMPhy, a zero-shot black-box optimization framework that leverages the physics knowledge and program synthesis abilities of LLMs, and synergizes these abilities with the world models built into modern physics engines. Specifically, LLMPhy uses an LLM to generate code to iteratively estimate the physical hyperparameters of the system (friction, damping, layout, etc.) via an implicit analysis-by-synthesis approach using a (non-differentiable) simulator in the loop and uses the inferred parameters to imagine the dynamics of the scene towards solving the reasoning task. To show the effectiveness of LLMPhy, we present experiments on our TraySim dataset to predict the steady-state poses of the objects. Our results show that the combination of the LLM and the physics engine leads to state-of-the-art zero-shot physical reasoning performance, while demonstrating superior convergence against standard black-box optimization methods and better estimation of the physical parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhou, Xingxing Li, Shengyu Li, Chunxi Xia, Xuanbin Wang, Shaoquan Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: For high-level geo-spatial applications and intelligent robotics, accurate global pose information is of crucial importance. Map-aided localization is a universal approach to overcome the limitations of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) in challenging environments. However, current solutions face challenges in terms of mapping flexibility, storage burden and re-localization performance. In this work, we present SF-Loc, a lightweight visual mapping and map-aided localization system, whose core idea is the map representation based on sparse frames with dense but compact depth, termed as visual structure frames. In the mapping phase, multi-sensor dense bundle adjustment (MS-DBA) is applied to construct geo-referenced visual structure frames. The local co-visbility is checked to keep the map sparsity and achieve incremental mapping. In the localization phase, coarse-to-fine vision-based localization is performed, in which multi-frame information and the map distribution are fully integrated. To be specific, the concept of spatially smoothed similarity (SSS) is proposed to overcome the place ambiguity, and pairwise frame matching is applied for efficient and robust pose estimation. Experimental results on the cross-season dataset verify the effectiveness of the system. In complex urban road scenarios, the map size is down to 3 MB per kilometer and stable decimeter-level re-localization can be achieved. The code will be made open-source soon (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/SF-Loc).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifan Jiang, Daniel Capell\'an-Mart\'in, Abhijeet Parida, Austin Tapp, Xinyang Liu, Mar\'ia J. Ledesma-Carbayo, Syed Muhammad Anwar, Marius George Linguraru</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and automatic segmentation of brain tumors in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is essential for quantitative measurements, which play an increasingly important role in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. The International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2024 offers a unique benchmarking opportunity, including various types of brain tumors in both adult and pediatric populations, such as pediatric brain tumors (PED), meningiomas (MEN-RT) and brain metastases (MET), among others. Compared to previous editions, BraTS 2024 has implemented changes to substantially increase clinical relevance, such as refined tumor regions for evaluation. We propose a deep learning-based ensemble approach that integrates state-of-the-art segmentation models. Additionally, we introduce innovative, adaptive pre- and post-processing techniques that employ MRI-based radiomic analyses to differentiate tumor subtypes. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tumors present in the BraTS datasets, this approach enhances the precision and generalizability of segmentation models. On the final testing sets, our method achieved mean lesion-wise Dice similarity coefficients of 0.926, 0.801, and 0.688 for the whole tumor in PED, MEN-RT, and MET, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving segmentation performance and generalizability for various brain tumor types.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huafeng Li, Dayong Su, Qing Cai, Yafei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: If unaligned multimodal medical images can be simultaneously aligned and fused using a single-stage approach within a unified processing framework, it will not only achieve mutual promotion of dual tasks but also help reduce the complexity of the model. However, the design of this model faces the challenge of incompatible requirements for feature fusion and alignment; specifically, feature alignment requires consistency among corresponding features, whereas feature fusion requires the features to be complementary to each other. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an unaligned medical image fusion method called Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment and Fusion (BSFA-F) strategy. To reduce the negative impact of modality differences on cross-modal feature matching, we incorporate the Modal Discrepancy-Free Feature Representation (MDF-FR) method into BSFA-F. MDF-FR utilizes a Modality Feature Representation Head (MFRH) to integrate the global information of the input image. By injecting the information contained in MFRH of the current image into other modality images, it effectively reduces the impact of modality differences on feature alignment while preserving the complementary information carried by different images. In terms of feature alignment, BSFA-F employs a bidirectional stepwise alignment deformation field prediction strategy based on the path independence of vector displacement between two points. This strategy solves the problem of large spans and inaccurate deformation field prediction in single-step alignment. Finally, Multi-Modal Feature Fusion block achieves the fusion of aligned features. The experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
