<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Sun, Jason Li, Hongyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent surge in artificial intelligence (AI), characterized by the prominence of large language models (LLMs), has ushered in fundamental transformations across the globe. However, alongside these advancements, concerns surrounding the legitimacy of LLMs have grown, posing legal challenges to their extensive applications. Compounding these concerns, the parameters of LLMs are often treated as intellectual property, restricting direct investigations.
  In this study, we address a fundamental challenge within the realm of AI legislation: the need to establish the authenticity of outputs generated by LLMs. To tackle this issue, we present zkLLM, which stands as the inaugural specialized zero-knowledge proof tailored for LLMs to the best of our knowledge. Addressing the persistent challenge of non-arithmetic operations in deep learning, we introduce tlookup, a parallelized lookup argument designed for non-arithmetic tensor operations in deep learning, offering a solution with no asymptotic overhead. Furthermore, leveraging the foundation of tlookup, we introduce zkAttn, a specialized zero-knowledge proof crafted for the attention mechanism, carefully balancing considerations of running time, memory usage, and accuracy.
  Empowered by our fully parallelized CUDA implementation, zkLLM emerges as a significant stride towards achieving efficient zero-knowledge verifiable computations over LLMs. Remarkably, for LLMs boasting 13 billion parameters, our approach enables the generation of a correctness proof for the entire inference process in under 15 minutes. The resulting proof, compactly sized at less than 200 kB, is designed to uphold the privacy of the model parameters, ensuring no inadvertent information leakage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Badri Narayana Patro, Vijay Srinivas Agneeswaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequence modeling is a crucial area across various domains, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series forecasting, music generation, and bioinformatics. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have historically dominated sequence modeling tasks like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), etc. However, the advancement of transformers has led to a shift in this paradigm, given their superior performance. Yet, transformers suffer from $O(N^2)$ attention complexity and challenges in handling inductive bias. Several variations have been proposed to address these issues which use spectral networks or convolutions and have performed well on a range of tasks. However, they still have difficulty in dealing with long sequences. State Space Models(SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context, especially with the advent of S4 and its variants, such as S4nd, Hippo, Hyena, Diagnol State Spaces (DSS), Gated State Spaces (GSS), Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU), Liquid-S4, Mamba, etc. In this survey, we categorize the foundational SSMs based on three paradigms namely, Gating architectures, Structural architectures, and Recurrent architectures. This survey also highlights diverse applications of SSMs across domains such as vision, video, audio, speech, language (especially long sequence modeling), medical (including genomics), chemical (like drug design), recommendation systems, and time series analysis, including tabular data. Moreover, we consolidate the performance of SSMs on benchmark datasets like Long Range Arena (LRA), WikiText, Glue, Pile, ImageNet, Kinetics-400, sstv2, as well as video datasets such as Breakfast, COIN, LVU, and various time series datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elena Albu, Shan Gao, Pieter Stijnen, Frank Rademakers, Christel Janssens, Veerle Cossey, Yves Debaveye, Laure Wynants, Ben Van Calster</p>
<p>Abstract: Prognostic outcomes related to hospital admissions typically do not suffer from censoring, and can be modeled either categorically or as time-to-event. Competing events are common but often ignored. We compared the performance of random forest (RF) models to predict the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) using different outcome operationalizations. We included data from 27478 admissions to the University Hospitals Leuven, covering 30862 catheter episodes (970 CLABSI, 1466 deaths and 28426 discharges) to build static and dynamic RF models for binary (CLABSI vs no CLABSI), multinomial (CLABSI, discharge, death or no event), survival (time to CLABSI) and competing risks (time to CLABSI, discharge or death) outcomes to predict the 7-day CLABSI risk. We evaluated model performance across 100 train/test splits. Performance of binary, multinomial and competing risks models was similar: AUROC was 0.74 for baseline predictions, rose to 0.78 for predictions at day 5 in the catheter episode, and decreased thereafter. Survival models overestimated the risk of CLABSI (E:O ratios between 1.2 and 1.6), and had AUROCs about 0.01 lower than other models. Binary and multinomial models had lowest computation times. Models including multiple outcome events (multinomial and competing risks) display a different internal structure compared to binary and survival models. In the absence of censoring, complex modelling choices do not considerably improve the predictive performance compared to a binary model for CLABSI prediction in our studied settings. Survival models censoring the competing events at their time of occurrence should be avoided.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16154">A Comparative Analysis of Adversarial Robustness for Quantum and Classical Machine Learning Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Wendlinger, Kilian Tscharke, Pascal Debus</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) continues to be an area of tremendous interest from research and industry. While QML models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks much in the same manner as classical machine learning models, it is still largely unknown how to compare adversarial attacks on quantum versus classical models. In this paper, we show how to systematically investigate the similarities and differences in adversarial robustness of classical and quantum models using transfer attacks, perturbation patterns and Lipschitz bounds. More specifically, we focus on classification tasks on a handcrafted dataset that allows quantitative analysis for feature attribution. This enables us to get insight, both theoretically and experimentally, on the robustness of classification networks. We start by comparing typical QML model architectures such as amplitude and re-upload encoding circuits with variational parameters to a classical ConvNet architecture. Next, we introduce a classical approximation of QML circuits (originally obtained with Random Fourier Features sampling but adapted in this work to fit a trainable encoding) and evaluate this model, denoted Fourier network, in comparison to other architectures. Our findings show that this Fourier network can be seen as a "middle ground" on the quantum-classical boundary. While adversarial attacks successfully transfer across this boundary in both directions, we also show that regularization helps quantum networks to be more robust, which has direct impact on Lipschitz bounds and transfer attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Perrin-Gilbert</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents AFU, an off-policy deep RL algorithm addressing in a new way the challenging "max-Q problem" in Q-learning for continuous action spaces, with a solution based on regression and conditional gradient scaling. AFU has an actor but its critic updates are entirely independent from it. As a consequence, the actor can be chosen freely. In the initial version, AFU-alpha, we employ the same stochastic actor as in Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), but we then study a simple failure mode of SAC and show how AFU can be modified to make actor updates less likely to become trapped in local optima, resulting in a second version of the algorithm, AFU-beta. Experimental results demonstrate the sample efficiency of both versions of AFU, marking it as the first model-free off-policy algorithm competitive with state-of-the-art actor-critic methods while departing from the actor-critic perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fin Amin, Jung-Eun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: When neural networks are confronted with unfamiliar data that deviate from their training set, this signifies a domain shift. While these networks output predictions on their inputs, they typically fail to account for their level of familiarity with these novel observations. This challenge becomes even more pronounced in resource-constrained settings, such as embedded systems or edge devices. To address such challenges, we aim to recalibrate a neural network's decision boundaries in relation to its cognizance of the data it observes, introducing an approach we coin as certainty distillation. While prevailing works navigate unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with the goal of curtailing model entropy, they unintentionally birth models that grapple with calibration inaccuracies - a dilemma we term the over-certainty phenomenon. In this paper, we probe the drawbacks of this traditional learning model. As a solution to the issue, we propose a UDA algorithm that not only augments accuracy but also assures model calibration, all while maintaining suitability for environments with limited computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarala Naidu, Ning Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in industrial settings, particularly in maintaining the reliability and optimal performance of cooling systems. Traditional anomaly detection methods often face challenges in handling diverse data characteristics and variations in noise levels, resulting in limited effectiveness. And yet traditional anomaly detection often relies on application of single models. This work proposes a novel, robust approach using five heterogeneous independent models combined with a dual ensemble fusion of voting techniques. Diverse models capture various system behaviors, while the fusion strategy maximizes detection effectiveness and minimizes false alarms. Each base autoencoder model learns a unique representation of the data, leveraging their complementary strengths to improve anomaly detection performance. To increase the effectiveness and reliability of final anomaly prediction, dual ensemble technique is applied. This approach outperforms in maximizing the coverage of identifying anomalies. Experimental results on a real-world dataset of industrial cooling system data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This approach can be extended to other industrial applications where anomaly detection is critical for ensuring system reliability and preventing potential malfunctions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning is an emerging machine learning approach that allows the construction of a model between several participants who hold their own private data. This method is secure and privacy-preserving, suitable for training a machine learning model using sensitive data from different sources, such as hospitals. In this paper, the authors propose two innovative methodologies for Particle Swarm Optimisation-based federated learning of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps in a privacy-preserving way. In addition, one relevant contribution this research includes is the lack of an initial model in the federated learning process, making it effectively blind. This proposal is tested with several open datasets, improving both accuracy and precision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarala Naidu, Ning Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection in industrial systems is crucial for preventing equipment failures, ensuring risk identification, and maintaining overall system efficiency. Traditional monitoring methods often rely on fixed thresholds and empirical rules, which may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle changes in system health and predict impending failures. To address this limitation, this paper proposes, a novel Attention-based convolutional autoencoder (ABCD) for risk detection and map the risk value derive to the maintenance planning. ABCD learns the normal behavior of conductivity from historical data of a real-world industrial cooling system and reconstructs the input data, identifying anomalies that deviate from the expected patterns. The framework also employs calibration techniques to ensure the reliability of its predictions. Evaluation results demonstrate that with the attention mechanism in ABCD a 57.4% increase in performance and a reduction of false alarms by 9.37% is seen compared to without attention. The approach can effectively detect risks, the risk priority rank mapped to maintenance, providing valuable insights for cooling system designers and service personnel. Calibration error of 0.03% indicates that the model is well-calibrated and enhances model's trustworthiness, enabling informed decisions about maintenance strategies</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16188">Pearls from Pebbles: Improved Confidence Functions for Auto-labeling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harit Vishwakarma (Yi),  Reid (Yi),  Chen, Sui Jiet Tay, Satya Sai Srinath Namburi, Frederic Sala, Ramya Korlakai Vinayak</p>
<p>Abstract: Auto-labeling is an important family of techniques that produce labeled training sets with minimum manual labeling. A prominent variant, threshold-based auto-labeling (TBAL), works by finding a threshold on a model's confidence scores above which it can accurately label unlabeled data points. However, many models are known to produce overconfident scores, leading to poor TBAL performance. While a natural idea is to apply off-the-shelf calibration methods to alleviate the overconfidence issue, such methods still fall short. Rather than experimenting with ad-hoc choices of confidence functions, we propose a framework for studying the \emph{optimal} TBAL confidence function. We develop a tractable version of the framework to obtain \texttt{Colander} (Confidence functions for Efficient and Reliable Auto-labeling), a new post-hoc method specifically designed to maximize performance in TBAL systems. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of our method \texttt{Colander} and compare it against methods designed for calibration. \texttt{Colander} achieves up to 60\% improvements on coverage over the baselines while maintaining auto-labeling error below $5\%$ and using the same amount of labeled data as the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olawale Salaudeen, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a causal graph representing the data-generating process shared across different domains/distributions, enforcing sufficient graph-implied conditional independencies can identify domain-general (non-spurious) feature representations. For the standard input-output predictive setting, we categorize the set of graphs considered in the literature into two distinct groups: (i) those in which the empirical risk minimizer across training domains gives domain-general representations and (ii) those where it does not. For the latter case (ii), we propose a novel framework with regularizations, which we demonstrate are sufficient for identifying domain-general feature representations without a priori knowledge (or proxies) of the spurious features. Empirically, our proposed method is effective for both (semi) synthetic and real-world data, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in average and worst-domain transfer accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models contain a wealth of information from their vast number of training samples. However, most prior arts fail to extract this information in a precise and efficient way for small sample sizes. In this work, we propose a framework utilizing reinforcement learning as a control for foundation models, allowing for the granular generation of small, focused synthetic support sets to augment the performance of neural network models on real data classification tasks. We first allow a reinforcement learning agent access to a novel context based dictionary; the agent then uses this dictionary with a novel prompt structure to form and optimize prompts as inputs to generative models, receiving feedback based on a reward function combining the change in validation accuracy and entropy. A support set is formed this way over several exploration steps. Our framework produced excellent results, increasing classification accuracy by significant margins for no additional labelling or data cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoling Zhou, Wei Ye, Zhemg Lee, Rui Xie, Shikun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation plays a pivotal role in enhancing and diversifying training data. Nonetheless, consistently improving model performance in varied learning scenarios, especially those with inherent data biases, remains challenging. To address this, we propose to augment the deep features of samples by incorporating their adversarial and anti-adversarial perturbation distributions, enabling adaptive adjustment in the learning difficulty tailored to each sample's specific characteristics. We then theoretically reveal that our augmentation process approximates the optimization of a surrogate loss function as the number of augmented copies increases indefinitely. This insight leads us to develop a meta-learning-based framework for optimizing classifiers with this novel loss, introducing the effects of augmentation while bypassing the explicit augmentation process. We conduct extensive experiments across four common biased learning scenarios: long-tail learning, generalized long-tail learning, noisy label learning, and subpopulation shift learning. The empirical results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahmat Adesunkanmi, Balaji Sesha Srikanth Pokuri, Ratnesh Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: In many real-world applications where the system dynamics has an underlying interdependency among its variables (such as power grid, economics, neuroscience, omics networks, environmental ecosystems, and others), one is often interested in knowing whether the past values of one time series influences the future of another, known as Granger causality, and the associated underlying dynamics. This paper introduces a Koopman-inspired framework that leverages neural networks for data-driven learning of the Koopman bases, termed NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery (NKDCD), for reliably inferring the Granger causality along with the underlying nonlinear dynamics. NKDCD employs an autoencoder architecture that lifts the nonlinear dynamics to a higher dimension using data-learned bases, where the lifted time series can be reliably modeled linearly. The lifting function, the linear Granger causality lag matrices, and the projection function (from lifted space to base space) are all represented as multilayer perceptrons and are all learned simultaneously in one go. NKDCD also utilizes sparsity-inducing penalties on the weights of the lag matrices, encouraging the model to select only the needed causal dependencies within the data. Through extensive testing on practically applicable datasets, it is shown that the NKDCD outperforms the existing nonlinear Granger causality discovery approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: The unique artistic style is crucial to artists' occupational competitiveness, yet prevailing Art Commission Platforms rarely support style-based retrieval. Meanwhile, the fast-growing generative AI techniques aggravate artists' concerns about releasing personal artworks to public platforms. To achieve artistic style-based retrieval without exposing personal artworks, we propose FedStyle, a style-based federated learning crowdsourcing framework. It allows artists to train local style models and share model parameters rather than artworks for collaboration. However, most artists possess a unique artistic style, resulting in severe model drift among them. FedStyle addresses such extreme data heterogeneity by having artists learn their abstract style representations and align with the server, rather than merely aggregating model parameters lacking semantics. Besides, we introduce contrastive learning to meticulously construct the style representation space, pulling artworks with similar styles closer and keeping different ones apart in the embedding space. Extensive experiments on the proposed datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedStyle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ou Deng, Shoji Nishimura, Atsushi Ogihara, Qun Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes Evolutionary Causal Discovery (ECD) for causal discovery that tailors response variables, predictor variables, and corresponding operators to research datasets. Utilizing genetic programming for variable relationship parsing, the method proceeds with the Relative Impact Stratification (RIS) algorithm to assess the relative impact of predictor variables on the response variable, facilitating expression simplification and enhancing the interpretability of variable relationships. ECD proposes an expression tree to visualize the RIS results, offering a differentiated depiction of unknown causal relationships compared to conventional causal discovery. The ECD method represents an evolution and augmentation of existing causal discovery methods, providing an interpretable approach for analyzing variable relationships in complex systems, particularly in healthcare settings with Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world EHR datasets demonstrate the efficacy of ECD in uncovering patterns and mechanisms among variables, maintaining high accuracy and stability across different noise levels. On the real-world EHR dataset, ECD reveals the intricate relationships between the response variable and other predictive variables, aligning with the results of structural equation modeling and shapley additive explanations analyses.</p>

This is motivated by the hypothesis that nodes in the graph tend to exhibit consistent behaviors with their neighborhoods. However, such consistency can be disrupted by graph anomalies in multiple ways. Most existing methods directly employ GNNs to learn representations, disregarding the negative impact of graph anomalies on GNNs, resulting in sub-optimal node representations and anomaly detection performance. While a few recent approaches have redesigned GNNs for graph anomaly detection under semi-supervised label guidance, how to address the adverse effects of graph anomalies on GNNs in unsupervised scenarios and learn effective representations for anomaly detection are still under-explored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection (G3AD). Specifically, G3AD introduces two auxiliary networks along with correlation constraints to guard the GNNs from inconsistent information encoding. Furthermore, G3AD introduces an adaptive caching module to guard the GNNs from solely reconstructing the observed data that contains anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed G3AD can outperform seventeen state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Padmanaba Srinivasan, William Knottenbelt</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are applied to learn performant, well-generalizing policies when provided with a static dataset of interactions. Many recent approaches to offline RL have seen substantial success, but with one key caveat: they demand substantial per-dataset hyperparameter tuning to achieve reported performance, which requires policy rollouts in the environment to evaluate; this can rapidly become cumbersome. Furthermore, substantial tuning requirements can hamper the adoption of these algorithms in practical domains. In this paper, we present TD3 with Behavioral Supervisor Tuning (TD3-BST), an algorithm that trains an uncertainty model and uses it to guide the policy to select actions within the dataset support. TD3-BST can learn more effective policies from offline datasets compared to previous methods and achieves the best performance across challenging benchmarks without requiring per-dataset tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weizhen Li, Rui Carvalho</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) from data is crucial for understanding the governing mechanisms of natural phenomena, yet it remains a challenging task. We present an extension to the ARGOS framework, ARGOS-RAL, which leverages sparse regression with the recurrent adaptive lasso to identify PDEs from limited prior knowledge automatically. Our method automates calculating partial derivatives, constructing a candidate library, and estimating a sparse model. We rigorously evaluate the performance of ARGOS-RAL in identifying canonical PDEs under various noise levels and sample sizes, demonstrating its robustness in handling noisy and non-uniformly distributed data. We also test the algorithm's performance on datasets consisting solely of random noise to simulate scenarios with severely compromised data quality. Our results show that ARGOS-RAL effectively and reliably identifies the underlying PDEs from data, outperforming the sequential threshold ridge regression method in most cases. We highlight the potential of combining statistical methods, machine learning, and dynamical systems theory to automatically discover governing equations from collected data, streamlining the scientific modeling process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bram De Cooman, Johan Suykens</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning methods lack an inherent mechanism to impose behavioural constraints on the trained policies. While certain extensions exist, they remain limited to specific types of constraints, such as value constraints with additional reward signals or visitation density constraints. In this work we try to unify these existing techniques and bridge the gap with classical optimization and control theory, using a generic primal-dual framework for value-based and actor-critic reinforcement learning methods. The obtained dual formulations turn out to be especially useful for imposing additional constraints on the learned policy, as an intrinsic relationship between such dual constraints (or regularization terms) and reward modifications in the primal is reveiled. Furthermore, using this framework, we are able to introduce some novel types of constraints, allowing to impose bounds on the policy's action density or on costs associated with transitions between consecutive states and actions. From the adjusted primal-dual optimization problems, a practical algorithm is derived that supports various combinations of policy constraints that are automatically handled throughout training using trainable reward modifications. The resulting $\texttt{DualCRL}$ method is examined in more detail and evaluated under different (combinations of) constraints on two interpretable environments. The results highlight the efficacy of the method, which ultimately provides the designer of such systems with a versatile toolbox of possible policy constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evandro S. Ortigossa, F\'abio F. Dias, Brian Barr, Claudio T. Silva, Luis Gustavo Nonato</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of machine learning applications has increased significantly in recent years, motivated by the remarkable ability of learning-powered systems to discover and generalize intricate patterns hidden in massive datasets. Modern learning models, while powerful, often exhibit a level of complexity that renders them opaque black boxes, resulting in a notable lack of transparency that hinders our ability to decipher their decision-making processes. Opacity challenges the interpretability and practical application of machine learning, especially in critical domains where understanding the underlying reasons is essential for informed decision-making. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) rises to meet that challenge, unraveling the complexity of black boxes by providing elucidating explanations. Among the various XAI approaches, feature attribution/importance XAI stands out for its capacity to delineate the significance of input features in the prediction process. However, most existing attribution methods have limitations, such as instability, when divergent explanations may result from similar or even the same instance. In this work, we introduce T-Explainer, a novel local additive attribution explainer based on Taylor expansion endowed with desirable properties, such as local accuracy and consistency, while stable over multiple runs. We demonstrate T-Explainer's effectiveness through benchmark experiments with well-known attribution methods. In addition, T-Explainer is developed as a comprehensive XAI framework comprising quantitative metrics to assess and visualize attribution explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Fiocchi, Domna Ladopoulou, Petros Dellaportas</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide a condition monitoring system for wind farms, based on normal behaviour modelling using a probabilistic multi-layer perceptron with transfer learning via fine-tuning. The model predicts the output power of the wind turbine under normal behaviour based on features retrieved from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Its advantages are that (i) it can be trained with SCADA data of at least a few years, (ii) it can incorporate all SCADA data of all wind turbines in a wind farm as features, (iii) it assumes that the output power follows a normal density with heteroscedastic variance and (iv) it can predict the output of one wind turbine by borrowing strength from the data of all other wind turbines in a farm. Probabilistic guidelines for condition monitoring are given via a CUSUM control chart. We illustrate the performance of our model in a real SCADA data example which provides evidence that it outperforms other probabilistic prediction models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathana\"el Perraudin, Adrien Teutrie, C\'ecile H\'ebert, Guillaume Obozinski</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of regularized Poisson Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) problem, encompassing various regularization terms such as Lipschitz and relatively smooth functions, alongside linear constraints. This problem holds significant relevance in numerous Machine Learning applications, particularly within the domain of physical linear unmixing problems. A notable challenge arises from the main loss term in the Poisson NMF problem being a KL divergence, which is non-Lipschitz, rendering traditional gradient descent-based approaches inefficient. In this contribution, we explore the utilization of Block Successive Upper Minimization (BSUM) to overcome this challenge. We build approriate majorizing function for Lipschitz and relatively smooth functions, and show how to introduce linear constraints into the problem. This results in the development of two novel algorithms for regularized Poisson NMF. We conduct numerical simulations to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Teufel, Pascal Friederich</p>
<p>Abstract: Beyond improving trust and validating model fairness, xAI practices also have the potential to recover valuable scientific insights in application domains where little to no prior human intuition exists. To that end, we propose a method to extract global concept explanations from the predictions of graph neural networks to develop a deeper understanding of the tasks underlying structure-property relationships. We identify concept explanations as dense clusters in the self-explaining Megan models subgraph latent space. For each concept, we optimize a representative prototype graph and optionally use GPT-4 to provide hypotheses about why each structure has a certain effect on the prediction. We conduct computational experiments on synthetic and real-world graph property prediction tasks. For the synthetic tasks we find that our method correctly reproduces the structural rules by which they were created. For real-world molecular property regression and classification tasks, we find that our method rediscovers established rules of thumb. More specifically, our results for molecular mutagenicity prediction indicate more fine-grained resolution of structural details than existing explainability methods, consistent with previous results from chemistry literature. Overall, our results show promising capability to extract the underlying structure-property relationships for complex graph property prediction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tahrima Hashem, Negin Yousefpour</p>
<p>Abstract: Scour around bridge piers is a critical challenge for infrastructures around the world. In the absence of analytical models and due to the complexity of the scour process, it is difficult for current empirical methods to achieve accurate predictions. In this paper, we exploit the power of deep learning algorithms to forecast the scour depth variations around bridge piers based on historical sensor monitoring data, including riverbed elevation, flow elevation, and flow velocity. We investigated the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for real-time scour forecasting using data collected from bridges in Alaska and Oregon from 2006 to 2021. The LSTM models achieved mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.1m to 0.5m for predicting bed level variations a week in advance, showing a reasonable performance. The Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) variant of CNN outperformed other CNN configurations, showing a comparable performance to LSTMs with significantly lower computational costs. We explored various innovative random-search heuristics for hyperparameter tuning and model optimisation which resulted in reduced computational cost compared to grid-search method. The impact of different combinations of sensor features on scour prediction showed the significance of the historical time series of scour for predicting upcoming events. Overall, this study provides a greater understanding of the potential of Deep Learning (DL) for real-time scour forecasting and early warning in bridges with diverse scour and flow characteristics including riverine and tidal/coastal bridges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriela Kadlecov\'a, Jovita Lukasik, Martin Pil\'at, Petra Vidnerov\'a, Mahmoud Safari, Roman Neruda, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Performance prediction has been a key part of the neural architecture search (NAS) process, allowing to speed up NAS algorithms by avoiding resource-consuming network training. Although many performance predictors correlate well with ground truth performance, they require training data in the form of trained networks. Recently, zero-cost proxies have been proposed as an efficient method to estimate network performance without any training. However, they are still poorly understood, exhibit biases with network properties, and their performance is limited. Inspired by the drawbacks of zero-cost proxies, we propose neural graph features (GRAF), simple to compute properties of architectural graphs. GRAF offers fast and interpretable performance prediction while outperforming zero-cost proxies and other common encodings. In combination with other zero-cost proxies, GRAF outperforms most existing performance predictors at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haorui Xiang, Zhichang Wu, Guoxu Li, Rong Wang, Feiping Nie, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Ordinal regression is a specialized supervised problem where the labels show an inherent order. The order distinguishes it from normal multi-class problem. Support Vector Ordinal Regression, as an outstanding ordinal regression model, is widely used in many ordinal regression tasks. However, like most supervised learning algorithms, the design of SVOR is based on the assumption that the training data are real and reliable, which is difficult to satisfy in real-world data. In many practical applications, outliers are frequently present in the training set, potentially leading to misguide the learning process, such that the performance is non-optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel capped $\ell_{p}$-norm loss function that is theoretically robust to both light and heavy outliers. The capped $\ell_{p}$-norm loss can help the model detect and eliminate outliers during training process. Adhering to this concept, we introduce a new model, Capped $\ell_{p}$-Norm Support Vector Ordinal Regression(CSVOR), that is robust to outliers. CSVOR uses a weight matrix to detect and eliminate outliers during the training process to improve the robustness to outliers. Moreover, a Re-Weighted algorithm algorithm which is illustrated convergence by our theoretical results is proposed to effectively minimize the corresponding problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods, particularly in the presence of outliers.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare promises to transform medical diagnostics, research, and patient care. Yet, the progression of medical LLMs faces obstacles such as complex training requirements, rigorous evaluation demands, and the dominance of proprietary models that restrict academic exploration. Transparent, comprehensive access to LLM resources is essential for advancing the field, fostering reproducibility, and encouraging innovation in healthcare AI. We present Hippocrates, an open-source LLM framework specifically developed for the medical domain. In stark contrast to previous efforts, it offers unrestricted access to its training datasets, codebase, checkpoints, and evaluation protocols. This open approach is designed to stimulate collaborative research, allowing the community to build upon, refine, and rigorously evaluate medical LLMs within a transparent ecosystem. Also, we introduce Hippo, a family of 7B models tailored for the medical domain, fine-tuned from Mistral and LLaMA2 through continual pre-training, instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback. Our models outperform existing open medical LLMs models by a large-margin, even surpassing models with 70B parameters. Through Hippocrates, we aspire to unlock the full potential of LLMs not just to advance medical knowledge and patient care but also to democratize the benefits of AI research in healthcare, making them available across the globe.</p>

The detection of sepsis is a critical challenge in clinical practice due to its rapid progression and potentially life-threatening consequences. Moreover, we emphasize the benefits of KDE-KNN compared to current synthetic data generation methodologies. Additionally, our study examines the effects of incorporating synthetic data into model training procedures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebasti\'an Basterrech, Line Clemmensen, Gerardo Rubino</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling non-stationary data is a challenging problem in the field of continual learning, and data distribution shifts may result in negative consequences on the performance of a machine learning model. Classic learning tools are often vulnerable to perturbations of the input covariates, and are sensitive to outliers and noise, and some tools are based on rigid algebraic assumptions. Distribution shifts are frequently occurring due to changes in raw materials for production, seasonality, a different user base, or even adversarial attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more effective distribution shift detection techniques.
  In this work, we propose a continual learning framework for monitoring and detecting distribution changes. We explore the problem in a latent space generated by a bio-inspired self-organizing clustering and statistical aspects of the latent space. In particular, we investigate the projections made by two topology-preserving maps: the Self-Organizing Map and the Scale Invariant Map. Our method can be applied in both a supervised and an unsupervised context. We construct the assessment of changes in the data distribution as a comparison of Gaussian signals, making the proposed method fast and robust. We compare it to other unsupervised techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel-PCA. Our comparison involves conducting experiments using sequences of images (based on MNIST and injected shifts with adversarial samples), chemical sensor measurements, and the environmental variable related to ozone levels. The empirical study reveals the potential of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: The risk of reinforcing or exacerbating societal biases and inequalities is growing as generative AI increasingly produces content that resembles human output, from text to images and beyond. Here we formally characterize the notion of fairness for generative AI as a basis for monitoring and enforcing fairness. We define two levels of fairness utilizing the concept of infinite words. The first is the fairness demonstrated on the generated sequences, which is only evaluated on the outputs while agnostic to the prompts/models used. The second is the inherent fairness of the generative AI model, which requires that fairness be manifested when input prompts are neutral, that is, they do not explicitly instruct the generative AI to produce a particular type of output. We also study relative intersectional fairness to counteract the combinatorial explosion of fairness when considering multiple categories together with lazy fairness enforcement. Our implemented specification monitoring and enforcement tool shows interesting results when tested against several generative AI models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) Forecasting aims at predicting links in Knowledge Graphs for future timesteps based on a history of Knowledge Graphs. To this day, standardized evaluation protocols and rigorous comparison across TKG models are available, but the importance of simple baselines is often neglected in the evaluation, which prevents researchers from discerning actual and fictitious progress. We propose to close this gap by designing an intuitive baseline for TKG Forecasting based on predicting recurring facts. Compared to most TKG models, it requires little hyperparameter tuning and no iterative training. Further, it can help to identify failure modes in existing approaches. The empirical findings are quite unexpected: compared to 11 methods on five datasets, our baseline ranks first or third in three of them, painting a radically different picture of the predictive quality of the state of the art.</p>

<p>Abstract: While originally developed for continuous control problems, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as the work-horse of a variety of reinforcement learning (RL) applications including the fine-tuning of generative models. Unfortunately, PPO requires multiple heuristics to enable stable convergence (e.g. value networks, clipping) and is notorious for its sensitivity to the precise implementation of these components. In response, we take a step back and ask what a minimalist RL algorithm for the era of generative models would look like. We propose REBEL, an algorithm that cleanly reduces the problem of policy optimization to regressing the relative rewards via a direct policy parameterization between two completions to a prompt, enabling strikingly lightweight implementation. In theory, we prove that fundamental RL algorithms like Natural Policy Gradient can be seen as variants of REBEL, which allows us to match the strongest known theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence and sample complexity in the RL literature. REBEL can also cleanly incorporate offline data and handle the intransitive preferences we frequently see in practice. Empirically, we find that REBEL provides a unified approach to language modeling and image generation with stronger or similar performance as PPO and DPO, all while being simpler to implement and more computationally tractable than PPO.</p>

<p>Abstract: The success of many RL techniques heavily relies on human-engineered dense rewards, which typically demand substantial domain expertise and extensive trial and error. In our work, we propose DrS (Dense reward learning from Stages), a novel approach for learning reusable dense rewards for multi-stage tasks in a data-driven manner. By leveraging the stage structures of the task, DrS learns a high-quality dense reward from sparse rewards and demonstrations if given. The learned rewards can be \textit{reused} in unseen tasks, thus reducing the human effort for reward engineering. Extensive experiments on three physical robot manipulation task families with 1000+ task variants demonstrate that our learned rewards can be reused in unseen tasks, resulting in improved performance and sample efficiency of RL algorithms. The learned rewards even achieve comparable performance to human-engineered rewards on some tasks. See our project page (https://sites.google.com/view/iclr24drs) for more details.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haizhou Shi, Zihao Xu, Hengyi Wang, Weiyi Qin, Wenyuan Wang, Yibin Wang, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) trained on static, pre-collected, general datasets has sparked numerous research directions and applications. One such direction addresses the non-trivial challenge of integrating pre-trained LLMs into dynamic data distributions, task structures, and user preferences. Pre-trained LLMs, when tailored for specific needs, often experience significant performance degradation in previous knowledge domains -- a phenomenon known as "catastrophic forgetting". While extensively studied in the continual learning (CL) community, it presents new manifestations in the realm of LLMs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress on LLMs within the context of CL. This survey is structured into four main sections: we first describe an overview of continually learning LLMs, consisting of two directions of continuity: vertical continuity (or vertical continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation from general to specific capabilities, and horizontal continuity (or horizontal continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation across time and domains (Section 3). We then summarize three stages of learning LLMs in the context of modern CL: Continual Pre-Training (CPT), Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP), and Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) (Section 4). Then we provide an overview of evaluation protocols for continual learning with LLMs, along with the current available data sources (Section 5). Finally, we discuss intriguing questions pertaining to continual learning for LLMs (Section 6).

<p>Abstract: Although the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) ideally scale up with increasing data and compute, they are inevitably constrained by limited resources in reality. Suppose we have a moderately trained LLM (e.g., trained to align with human preference) in hand, can we further exploit its potential and cheaply acquire a stronger model? In this paper, we propose a simple method called ExPO to boost LLMs' alignment with human preference. ExPO assumes that a medium-aligned model can be interpolated between a less-aligned (weaker) model, e.g., the initial SFT model, and a better-aligned (stronger) one, thereby directly obtaining this stronger model by extrapolating from the weights of the former two relatively weaker models. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, we show that ExPO pushes models trained with less preference data (e.g., 10% or 20%) to reach and even surpass the fully-trained one, without any additional training. Furthermore, ExPO also significantly improves off-the-shelf DPO/RLHF models and exhibits decent scalability across model sizes from 7B to 70B. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of model extrapolation in exploiting LLMs' capabilities, suggesting a promising direction that deserves future exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Herilalaina Rakotoarison, Steven Adriaensen, Neeratyoy Mallik, Samir Garibov, Edward Bergman, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing computational costs associated with deep learning, automated hyperparameter optimization methods, strongly relying on black-box Bayesian optimization (BO), face limitations. Freeze-thaw BO offers a promising grey-box alternative, strategically allocating scarce resources incrementally to different configurations. However, the frequent surrogate model updates inherent to this approach pose challenges for existing methods, requiring retraining or fine-tuning their neural network surrogates online, introducing overhead, instability, and hyper-hyperparameters. In this work, we propose FT-PFN, a novel surrogate for Freeze-thaw style BO. FT-PFN is a prior-data fitted network (PFN) that leverages the transformers' in-context learning ability to efficiently and reliably do Bayesian learning curve extrapolation in a single forward pass. Our empirical analysis across three benchmark suites shows that the predictions made by FT-PFN are more accurate and 10-100 times faster than those of the deep Gaussian process and deep ensemble surrogates used in previous work. Furthermore, we show that, when combined with our novel acquisition mechanism (MFPI-random), the resulting in-context freeze-thaw BO method (ifBO), yields new state-of-the-art performance in the same three families of deep learning HPO benchmarks considered in prior work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theo Lepage, Reda Dehak</p>
<p>Abstract: Most state-of-the-art self-supervised speaker verification systems rely on a contrastive-based objective function to learn speaker representations from unlabeled speech data. We explore different ways to improve the performance of these methods by: (1) revisiting how positive and negative pairs are sampled through a "symmetric" formulation of the contrastive loss; (2) introducing margins similar to AM-Softmax and AAM-Softmax that have been widely adopted in the supervised setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the symmetric contrastive loss which provides more supervision for the self-supervised task. Moreover, we show that Additive Margin and Additive Angular Margin allow reducing the overall number of false negatives and false positives by improving speaker separability. Finally, by combining both techniques and training a larger model we achieve 7.50% EER and 0.5804 minDCF on the VoxCeleb1 test set, which outperforms other contrastive self supervised methods on speaker verification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Xiong, Xun Zhu, Ming Wu, Weiqing Li, Fanbin Mo, Chuang Zhang, Bin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse meteorological forecasting is indispensable for fine-grained weather forecasting and deserves extensive attention. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs) in predicting numerical data from ground weather stations. However, as one of the highest fidelity and lowest latency data, the application of the vision data from satellites in ST-GCNs remains unexplored. There are few studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the above multi-modal data for sparse meteorological forecasting. Towards this objective, we introduce Vision-Numerical Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (VN-Net), which mainly utilizes: 1) Numerical-GCN (N-GCN) to adaptively model the static and dynamic patterns of spatio-temporal numerical data; 2) Vision-LSTM Network (V-LSTM) to capture multi-scale joint channel and spatial features from time series satellite images; 4) a GCN-based decoder to generate hourly predictions of specified meteorological factors. As far as we know, VN-Net is the first attempt to introduce GCN method to utilize multi-modal data for better handling sparse spatio-temporal meteorological forecasting. Our experiments on Weather2k dataset show VN-Net outperforms state-of-the-art by a significant margin on mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for temperature, relative humidity, and visibility forecasting. Furthermore, we conduct interpretation analysis and design quantitative evaluation metrics to assess the impact of incorporating vision data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordi Armengol-Estap\'e, Rodrigo C. O. Rocha, Jackson Woodruff, Pasquale Minervini, Michael F. P. O'Boyle</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating demand to migrate legacy software across different Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) has driven the development of assembly-to-assembly translators to map between their respective assembly languages. However, the development of these tools requires substantial engineering effort. State-of-the-art approaches use lifting, a technique where source assembly code is translated to an architecture-independent intermediate representation (IR) (for example, the LLVM IR) and use a pre-existing compiler to recompile the IR to the target ISA. However, the hand-written rules these lifters employ are sensitive to the particular compiler and optimization level used to generate the code and require significant engineering effort to support each new ISA. We propose Forklift, the first neural lifter that learns how to translate assembly to LLVM IR using a token-level encoder-decoder Transformer. We show how to incrementally add support to new ISAs by fine tuning the assembly encoder and freezing the IR decoder, improving the overall accuracy and efficiency. We collect millions of parallel LLVM IR, x86, ARM, and RISC-V programs across compilers and optimization levels to train Forklift and set up an input/output-based accuracy harness. We evaluate Forklift on two challenging benchmark suites and translate 2.5x more x86 programs than a state-of-the-art hand-written lifter and 4.4x more x86 programs than GPT-4 as well as enabling translation from new ISAs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felipe M. Dias, Diego A. C. Cardenas, Marcelo A. F. Toledo, Filipe A. C. Oliveira, Estela Ribeiro, Jose E. Krieger, Marco A. Gutierrez</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypertension, a leading contributor to cardiovascular morbidity, underscores the need for accurate and continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) presents a promising approach to this end. However, the precision of BP estimates derived from PPG signals has been the subject of ongoing debate, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness and constraints. We developed a calibration-based Siamese ResNet model for BP estimation, using a signal input paired with a reference BP reading. We compared the use of normalized PPG (N-PPG) against the normalized Invasive Arterial Blood Pressure (N-IABP) signals as input. The N-IABP signals do not directly present systolic and diastolic values but theoretically provide a more accurate BP measure than PPG signals since it is a direct pressure sensor inside the body. Our strategy establishes a critical benchmark for PPG performance, realistically calibrating expectations for PPG's BP estimation capabilities. Nonetheless, we compared the performance of our models using different signal-filtering conditions to evaluate the impact of filtering on the results. We evaluated our method using the AAMI and the BHS standards employing the VitalDB dataset. The N-IABP signals meet with AAMI standards for both Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), with errors of 1.29+-6.33mmHg for systolic pressure and 1.17+-5.78mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure respectively for the raw N-IABP signal. In contrast, N-PPG signals, in their best setup, exhibited inferior performance than N-IABP, presenting 1.49+-11.82mmHg and 0.89+-7.27mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure respectively. Our findings highlight the potential and limitations of employing PPG for BP estimation, showing that these signals contain information correlated to BP but may not be sufficient for predicting it accurately.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given the sheer volume of surgical procedures and the significant rate of postoperative fatalities, assessing and managing surgical complications has become a critical public health concern. Existing artificial intelligence (AI) tools for risk surveillance and diagnosis often lack adequate interpretability, fairness, and reproducibility. To address this, we proposed an Explainable AI (XAI) framework designed to answer five critical questions: why, why not, how, what if, and what else, with the goal of enhancing the explainability and transparency of AI models. We incorporated various techniques such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), counterfactual explanations, model cards, an interactive feature manipulation interface, and the identification of similar patients to address these questions. We showcased an XAI interface prototype that adheres to this framework for predicting major postoperative complications. This initial implementation has provided valuable insights into the vast explanatory potential of our XAI framework and represents an initial step towards its clinical adoption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heinrich Peters, Joseph B. Bayer, Sandra C. Matz, Yikun Chi, Sumer S. Vaid, Gabriella M. Harari</p>
<p>Abstract: The present paper introduces a novel approach to studying social media habits through predictive modeling of sequential smartphone user behaviors. While much of the literature on media and technology habits has relied on self-report questionnaires and simple behavioral frequency measures, we examine an important yet understudied aspect of media and technology habits: their embeddedness in repetitive behavioral sequences. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and transformer neural networks, we show that (i) social media use is predictable at the within and between-person level and that (ii) there are robust individual differences in the predictability of social media use. We examine the performance of several modeling approaches, including (i) global models trained on the pooled data from all participants, (ii) idiographic person-specific models, and (iii) global models fine-tuned on person-specific data. Neither person-specific modeling nor fine-tuning on person-specific data substantially outperformed the global models, indicating that the global models were able to represent a variety of idiosyncratic behavioral patterns. Additionally, our analyses reveal that the person-level predictability of social media use is not substantially related to the frequency of smartphone use in general or the frequency of social media use, indicating that our approach captures an aspect of habits that is distinct from behavioral frequency. Implications for habit modeling and theoretical development are discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Jiang, Filip Ilievski, Kaixin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: While vertical thinking relies on logical and commonsense reasoning, lateral thinking requires systems to defy commonsense associations and overwrite them through unconventional thinking. Lateral thinking has been shown to be challenging for current models but has received little attention. A recent benchmark, BRAINTEASER, aims to evaluate current models' lateral thinking ability in a zero-shot setting. In this paper, we split the original benchmark to also support fine-tuning setting and present SemEval Task 9: BRAIN-TEASER(S), the first task at this competition designed to test the system's reasoning and lateral thinking ability. As a popular task, BRAINTEASER(S)'s two subtasks receive 483 team submissions from 182 participants during the competition. This paper provides a fine-grained system analysis of the competition results, together with a reflection on what this means for the ability of the systems to reason laterally. We hope that the BRAINTEASER(S) subtasks and findings in this paper can stimulate future work on lateral thinking and robust reasoning by computational models.</p>

We evaluate the performance of our algorithm across a selection of board games, where it consistently demonstrates an increased winning ratio against baseline opponents. A key result of this study is that the PROBS algorithm operates effectively, even when the beam search size is considerably smaller than the average number of turns in the game.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Tao, Liang Wang, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the rapid spread of rumors on social media, rumor detection has become an extremely important challenge. Recently, numerous rumor detection models which utilize textual information and the propagation structure of events have been proposed. However, these methods overlook the importance of semantic evolvement information of event in propagation process, which is often challenging to be truly learned in supervised training paradigms and traditional rumor detection methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic evolvement enhanced Graph Autoencoder for Rumor Detection (GARD) model in this paper. The model learns semantic evolvement information of events by capturing local semantic changes and global semantic evolvement information through specific graph autoencoder and reconstruction strategies. By combining semantic evolvement information and propagation structure information, the model achieves a comprehensive understanding of event propagation and perform accurate and robust detection, while also detecting rumors earlier by capturing semantic evolvement information in the early stages. Moreover, in order to enhance the model's ability to learn the distinct patterns of rumors and non-rumors, we introduce a uniformity regularizer to further improve the model's performance. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets confirm the superiority of our GARD method over the state-of-the-art approaches in both overall performance and early rumor detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective code optimization in compilers plays a central role in computer and software engineering. While compilers can be made to automatically search the optimization space without the need for user interventions, this is not a standard practice since the search is slow and cumbersome. Here we present CodeZero, an artificial intelligence agent trained extensively on large data to produce effective optimization strategies instantly for each program in a single trial of the agent. To overcome the huge range of possible test programs, we prepare a large dataset of training programs that emphasize quality, naturalness, and diversity. To tackle the vast space of possible optimizations, we adapt deep reinforcement learning to train the agent in a sample-efficient manner through interacting with a world model of the compiler environment. Evaluation on both benchmark suites and production-level code optimization problems demonstrates our agent's supercompiler performances and zero-shot generalization abilities, outperforming built-in optimization options designed by compiler experts. Our methodology kindles the great potential of artificial intelligence for engineering and paves the way for scaling machine learning techniques in the realm of code optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaisakh Shaj</p>
<p>Abstract: Machines that can replicate human intelligence with type 2 reasoning capabilities should be able to reason at multiple levels of spatio-temporal abstractions and scales using internal world models. Devising formalisms to develop such internal world models, which accurately reflect the causal hierarchies inherent in the dynamics of the real world, is a critical research challenge in the domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This thesis identifies several limitations with the prevalent use of state space models (SSMs) as internal world models and propose two new probabilistic formalisms namely Hidden-Parameter SSMs and Multi-Time Scale SSMs to address these drawbacks. The structure of graphical models in both formalisms facilitates scalable exact probabilistic inference using belief propagation, as well as end-to-end learning via backpropagation through time. This approach permits the development of scalable, adaptive hierarchical world models capable of representing nonstationary dynamics across multiple temporal abstractions and scales. Moreover, these probabilistic formalisms integrate the concept of uncertainty in world states, thus improving the system's capacity to emulate the stochastic nature of the real world and quantify the confidence in its predictions. The thesis also discuss how these formalisms are in line with related neuroscience literature on Bayesian brain hypothesis and predicitive processing. Our experiments on various real and simulated robots demonstrate that our formalisms can match and in many cases exceed the performance of contemporary transformer variants in making long-range future predictions. We conclude the thesis by reflecting on the limitations of our current models and suggesting directions for future research.</p>

We first provide a tighter analysis of two previous approximation algorithms, improving their approximation guarantees from 4 to 3. Moreover, we show that both algorithms can be derandomized in a surprisingly simple way, by greedily taking a vertex of maximum degree in an auxiliary graph and forming a cluster around it. One of these algorithms relies on solving a linear program. Our final contribution is to design a new and purely combinatorial approach for doing so that is far more scalable in theory and practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rashadul Hasan Badhon, Atalie Carina Thompson, Jennifer I. Lim, Theodore Leng, Minhaj Nur Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: This study explores the feasibility of using generative machine learning (ML) to translate Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images into Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images, potentially bypassing the need for specialized OCTA hardware. Methods: The method involved implementing a generative adversarial network framework that includes a 2D vascular segmentation model and a 2D OCTA image translation model. The study utilizes a public dataset of 500 patients, divided into subsets based on resolution and disease status, to validate the quality of TR-OCTA images. The validation employs several quality and quantitative metrics to compare the translated images with ground truth OCTAs (GT-OCTA). We then quantitatively characterize vascular features generated in TR-OCTAs with GT-OCTAs to assess the feasibility of using TR-OCTA for objective disease diagnosis. Result: TR-OCTAs showed high image quality in both 3 and 6 mm datasets (high-resolution, moderate structural similarity and contrast quality compared to GT-OCTAs). There were slight discrepancies in vascular metrics, especially in diseased patients. Blood vessel features like tortuosity and vessel perimeter index showed a better trend compared to density features which are affected by local vascular distortions. Conclusion: This study presents a promising solution to the limitations of OCTA adoption in clinical practice by using vascular features from TR-OCTA for disease detection. Translation relevance: This study has the potential to significantly enhance the diagnostic process for retinal diseases by making detailed vascular imaging more widely available and reducing dependency on costly OCTA equipment.</p>

We propose a flow-free model based on graph neural networks that predicts grid states at every generation of a cascade process given an initial contingency and power injection values. We train the proposed model using a cascade sequence data pool generated from simulations. We then evaluate our model at various levels of granularity. We present several error metrics that gauge the model's ability to predict the failure size, the final grid state, and the failure time steps of each branch within the cascade. We benchmark the graph neural network model against influence models. We show that, in addition to being generic over randomly scaled power injection values, the graph neural network model outperforms multiple influence models that are built specifically for their corresponding loading profiles. Finally, we show that the proposed model reduces the computational time by almost two orders of magnitude.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabrizio Carpi, Soheil Rostami, Joonyoung Cho, Siddharth Garg, Elza Erkip, Charlie Jianzhong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: High peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is one of the main factors limiting cell coverage for cellular systems, especially in the uplink direction. Discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency-domain multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) with spectrally-extended frequency-domain spectrum shaping (FDSS) is one of the efficient techniques deployed to lower the PAPR of the uplink waveforms. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based framework to determine the FDSS filter, optimizing a tradeoff between the symbol error rate (SER), the PAPR, and the spectral flatness requirements. Our end-to-end optimization framework considers multiple important design constraints, including the Nyquist zero-ISI (inter-symbol interference) condition. The numerical results show that learned FDSS filters lower the PAPR compared to conventional baselines, with minimal SER degradation. Tuning the parameters of the optimization also helps us understand the fundamental limitations and characteristics of the FDSS filters for PAPR reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muralikrishnan Gopalakrishnan Meena, Demetri Liousas, Andrew D. Simin, Aditya Kashi, Wesley H. Brewer, James J. Riley, Stephen M. de Bruyn Kops</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop time-series machine learning (ML) methods for closure modeling of the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) equations applied to stably stratified turbulence (SST). SST is strongly affected by fine balances between forces and becomes more anisotropic in time for decaying cases. Moreover, there is a limited understanding of the physical phenomena described by some of the terms in the URANS equations. Rather than attempting to model each term separately, it is attractive to explore the capability of machine learning to model groups of terms, i.e., to directly model the force balances. We consider decaying SST which are homogeneous and stably stratified by a uniform density gradient, enabling dimensionality reduction. We consider two time-series ML models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE). Both models perform accurately and are numerically stable in a posteriori tests. Furthermore, we explore the data requirements of the ML models by extracting physically relevant timescales of the complex system. We find that the ratio of the timescales of the minimum information required by the ML models to accurately capture the dynamics of the SST corresponds to the Reynolds number of the flow. The current framework provides the backbone to explore the capability of such models to capture the dynamics of higher-dimensional complex SST flows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Archisman Ghosh, Debarshi Kundu, Avimita Chatterjee, Swaroop Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) are at the forefront of image-generating quantum machine learning models. To accommodate the growing demand for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to train and infer quantum machine learning models, the number of third-party vendors offering quantum hardware as a service is expected to rise. This expansion introduces the risk of untrusted vendors potentially stealing proprietary information from the quantum machine learning models. To address this concern we propose a novel watermarking technique that exploits the noise signature embedded during the training phase of qGANs as a non-invasive watermark. The watermark is identifiable in the images generated by the qGAN allowing us to trace the specific quantum hardware used during training hence providing strong proof of ownership. To further enhance the security robustness, we propose the training of qGANs on a sequence of multiple quantum hardware, embedding a complex watermark comprising the noise signatures of all the training hardware that is difficult for adversaries to replicate. We also develop a machine learning classifier to extract this watermark robustly, thereby identifying the training hardware (or the suite of hardware) from the images generated by the qGAN validating the authenticity of the model. We note that the watermark signature is robust against inferencing on hardware different than the hardware that was used for training. We obtain watermark extraction accuracy of 100% and ~90% for training the qGAN on individual and multiple quantum hardware setups (and inferencing on different hardware), respectively. Since parameter evolution during training is strongly modulated by quantum noise, the proposed watermark can be extended to other quantum machine learning models as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Gao, Juan Camilo Vega, Paul Chow</p>
<p>Abstract: FPGAs are rarely mentioned when discussing the implementation of large machine learning applications, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), in the data center. There has been much evidence showing that single FPGAs can be competitive with GPUs in performance for some computations, especially for low latency, and often much more efficient when power is considered. This suggests that there is merit to exploring the use of multiple FPGAs for large machine learning applications. The challenge with using multiple FPGAs is that there is no commonly-accepted flow for developing and deploying multi-FPGA applications, i.e., there are no tools to describe a large application, map it to multiple FPGAs and then deploy the application on a multi-FPGA platform. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of implementing large transformers using multiple FPGAs by developing a scalable multi-FPGA platform and some tools to map large applications to the platform. We validate our approach by designing an efficient multi-FPGA version of the I-BERT transformer and implement one encoder using six FPGAs as a working proof-of-concept to show that our platform and tools work. Based on our proof-of-concept prototype and the estimations of performance using the latest FPGAs compared to GPUs, we conclude that there can be a place for FPGAs in the world of large machine learning applications. We demonstrate a promising first step that shows that with the right infrastructure and tools it is reasonable to continue to explore the possible benefits of using FPGAs for applications such as LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqing Yuan, Lin Pan, Chung-Wei Hang, Jiang Guo, Jiarong Jiang, Bonan Min, Patrick Ng, Zhiguo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on a variety of NLP tasks, and are being rapidly adopted in a wide range of use cases. It is therefore of vital importance to holistically evaluate the factuality of their generated outputs, as hallucinations remain a challenging issue.
  In this work, we focus on assessing LLMs' ability to recall factual knowledge learned from pretraining, and the factors that affect this ability. To that end, we construct FACT-BENCH, a representative benchmark covering 20 domains, 134 property types, 3 answer types, and different knowledge popularity levels. We benchmark 31 models from 10 model families and provide a holistic assessment of their strengths and weaknesses. We observe that instruction-tuning hurts knowledge recall, as pretraining-only models consistently outperform their instruction-tuned counterparts, and positive effects of model scaling, as larger models outperform smaller ones for all model families. However, the best performance from GPT-4 still represents a large gap with the upper-bound. We additionally study the role of in-context exemplars using counterfactual demonstrations, which lead to significant degradation of factual knowledge recall for large models. By further decoupling model known and unknown knowledge, we find the degradation is attributed to exemplars that contradict a model's known knowledge, as well as the number of such exemplars. Lastly, we fine-tune LLaMA-7B in different settings of known and unknown knowledge. In particular, fine-tuning on a model's known knowledge is beneficial, and consistently outperforms fine-tuning on unknown and mixed knowledge. We will make our benchmark publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grace Guo, Lifu Deng, Animesh Tandon, Alex Endert, Bum Chul Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent prevalence of publicly accessible, large medical imaging datasets has led to a proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) models for cardiovascular image classification and analysis. At the same time, the potentially significant impacts of these models have motivated the development of a range of explainable AI (XAI) methods that aim to explain model predictions given certain image inputs. However, many of these methods are not developed or evaluated with domain experts, and explanations are not contextualized in terms of medical expertise or domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework and python library, MiMICRI, that provides domain-centered counterfactual explanations of cardiovascular image classification models. MiMICRI helps users interactively select and replace segments of medical images that correspond to morphological structures. From the counterfactuals generated, users can then assess the influence of each segment on model predictions, and validate the model against known medical facts. We evaluate this library with two medical experts. Our evaluation demonstrates that a domain-centered XAI approach can enhance the interpretability of model explanations, and help experts reason about models in terms of relevant domain knowledge. However, concerns were also surfaced about the clinical plausibility of the counterfactuals generated. We conclude with a discussion on the generalizability and trustworthiness of the MiMICRI framework, as well as the implications of our findings on the development of domain-centered XAI methods for model interpretability in healthcare contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Considering the premise that the number of products offered grow in an exponential fashion and the amount of data that a user can assimilate before making a decision is relatively small, recommender systems help in categorizing content according to user preferences. Collaborative filtering is a widely used method for computing recommendations due to its good performance. But, this method makes the system vulnerable to attacks which try to bias the recommendations. These attacks, known as 'shilling attacks' are performed to push an item or nuke an item in the system. This paper proposes an algorithm to detect such shilling profiles in the system accurately and also study the effects of such profiles on the recommendations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samyak Rawlekar, Shubhang Bhatnagar, Vishnuvardhan Pogunulu Srinivasulu, Narendra Ahuja</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-label Recognition (MLR) involves the identification of multiple objects within an image. To address the additional complexity of this problem, recent works have leveraged information from vision-language models (VLMs) trained on large text-images datasets for the task. These methods learn an independent classifier for each object (class), overlooking correlations in their occurrences. Such co-occurrences can be captured from the training data as conditional probabilities between a pair of classes. We propose a framework to extend the independent classifiers by incorporating the co-occurrence information for object pairs to improve the performance of independent classifiers. We use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to enforce the conditional probabilities between classes, by refining the initial estimates derived from image and text sources obtained using VLMs. We validate our method on four MLR datasets, where our approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The global decline in bee populations poses significant risks to agriculture, biodiversity, and environmental stability. To bridge the gap in existing data, we introduce ApisTox, a comprehensive dataset focusing on the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). This dataset combines and leverages data from existing sources such as ECOTOX and PPDB, providing an extensive, consistent, and curated collection that surpasses the previous datasets. ApisTox incorporates a wide array of data, including toxicity levels for chemicals, details such as time of their publication in literature, and identifiers linking them to external chemical databases. This dataset may serve as an important tool for environmental and agricultural research, but also can support the development of policies and practices aimed at minimizing harm to bee populations. Finally, ApisTox offers a unique resource for benchmarking molecular property prediction methods on agrochemical compounds, facilitating advancements in both environmental science and cheminformatics. This makes it a valuable tool for both academic research and practical applications in bee conservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sifat Muhammad Abdullah, Aravind Cheruvu, Shravya Kanchi, Taejoong Chung, Peng Gao, Murtuza Jadliwala, Bimal Viswanath</p>
<p>Abstract: Deepfake or synthetic images produced using deep generative models pose serious risks to online platforms. This has triggered several research efforts to accurately detect deepfake images, achieving excellent performance on publicly available deepfake datasets. In this work, we study 8 state-of-the-art detectors and argue that they are far from being ready for deployment due to two recent developments. First, the emergence of lightweight methods to customize large generative models, can enable an attacker to create many customized generators (to create deepfakes), thereby substantially increasing the threat surface. We show that existing defenses fail to generalize well to such \emph{user-customized generative models} that are publicly available today. We discuss new machine learning approaches based on content-agnostic features, and ensemble modeling to improve generalization performance against user-customized models. Second, the emergence of \textit{vision foundation models} -- machine learning models trained on broad data that can be easily adapted to several downstream tasks -- can be misused by attackers to craft adversarial deepfakes that can evade existing defenses. We propose a simple adversarial attack that leverages existing foundation models to craft adversarial samples \textit{without adding any adversarial noise}, through careful semantic manipulation of the image content. We highlight the vulnerabilities of several defenses against our attack, and explore directions leveraging advanced foundation models and adversarial training to defend against this new threat.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Neumeyer, Julian Stier, Michael Granitzer</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a challenging problem. Hierarchical search spaces allow for cheap evaluations of neural network sub modules to serve as surrogate for architecture evaluations. Yet, sometimes the hierarchy is too restrictive or the surrogate fails to generalize. We present FaDE which uses differentiable architecture search to obtain relative performance predictions on finite regions of a hierarchical NAS space. The relative nature of these ranks calls for a memory-less, batch-wise outer search algorithm for which we use an evolutionary algorithm with pseudo-gradient descent. FaDE is especially suited on deep hierarchical, respectively multi-cell search spaces, which it can explore by linear instead of exponential cost and therefore eliminates the need for a proxy search space.
  Our experiments show that firstly, FaDE-ranks on finite regions of the search space correlate with corresponding architecture performances and secondly, the ranks can empower a pseudo-gradient evolutionary search on the complete neural architecture search space.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present OmniSearchSage, a versatile and scalable system for understanding search queries, pins, and products for Pinterest search. We jointly learn a unified query embedding coupled with pin and product embeddings, leading to an improvement of $>8\%$ relevance, $>7\%$ engagement, and $>5\%$ ads CTR in Pinterest's production search system. The main contributors to these gains are improved content understanding, better multi-task learning, and real-time serving. We enrich our entity representations using diverse text derived from image captions from a generative LLM, historical engagement, and user-curated boards. Our multitask learning setup produces a single search query embedding in the same space as pin and product embeddings and compatible with pre-existing pin and product embeddings. We show the value of each feature through ablation studies, and show the effectiveness of a unified model compared to standalone counterparts. Finally, we share how these embeddings have been deployed across the Pinterest search stack, from retrieval to ranking, scaling to serve $300k$ requests per second at low latency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sichen Tao, Ruihan Zhao, Kaiyu Wang, Shangce Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex single-objective bounded problems are often difficult to solve. In evolutionary computation methods, since the proposal of differential evolution algorithm in 1997, it has been widely studied and developed due to its simplicity and efficiency. These developments include various adaptive strategies, operator improvements, and the introduction of other search methods. After 2014, research based on LSHADE has also been widely studied by researchers. However, although recently proposed improvement strategies have shown superiority over their previous generation's first performance, adding all new strategies may not necessarily bring the strongest performance. Therefore, we recombine some effective advances based on advanced differential evolution variants in recent years and finally determine an effective combination scheme to further promote the performance of differential evolution. In this paper, we propose a strategy recombination and reconstruction differential evolution algorithm called reconstructed differential evolution (RDE) to solve single-objective bounded optimization problems. Based on the benchmark suite of the 2024 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC2024), we tested RDE and several other advanced differential evolution variants. The experimental results show that RDE has superior performance in solving complex optimization problems.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16281">Timely Communications for Remote Inference</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Kamran Chowdhury Shisher, Yin Sun, I-Hong Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the impact of data freshness on remote inference systems, where a pre-trained neural network infers a time-varying target (e.g., the locations of vehicles and pedestrians) based on features (e.g., video frames) observed at a sensing node (e.g., a camera). One might expect that the performance of a remote inference system degrades monotonically as the feature becomes stale. Using an information-theoretic analysis, we show that this is true if the feature and target data sequence can be closely approximated as a Markov chain, whereas it is not true if the data sequence is far from Markovian. Hence, the inference error is a function of Age of Information (AoI), where the function could be non-monotonic. To minimize the inference error in real-time, we propose a new "selection-from-buffer" model for sending the features, which is more general than the "generate-at-will" model used in earlier studies. In addition, we design low-complexity scheduling policies to improve inference performance. For single-source, single-channel systems, we provide an optimal scheduling policy. In multi-source, multi-channel systems, the scheduling problem becomes a multi-action restless multi-armed bandit problem. For this setting, we design a new scheduling policy by integrating Whittle index-based source selection and duality-based feature selection-from-buffer algorithms. This new scheduling policy is proven to be asymptotically optimal. These scheduling results hold for minimizing general AoI functions (monotonic or non-monotonic). Data-driven evaluations demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed scheduling policies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed text-based services, enabling capabilities ranging from real-time translation to AI-driven chatbots. However, existing serving systems primarily focus on optimizing server-side aggregate metrics like token generation throughput, ignoring individual user experience with streamed text. As a result, under high and/or bursty load, a significant number of users can receive unfavorable service quality or poor Quality-of-Experience (QoE). In this paper, we first formally define QoE of text streaming services, where text is delivered incrementally and interactively to users, by considering the end-to-end token delivery process throughout the entire interaction with the user. Thereafter, we propose Andes, a QoE-aware serving system that enhances user experience for LLM-enabled text streaming services. At its core, Andes strategically allocates contended GPU resources among multiple requests over time to optimize their QoE. Our evaluations demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art LLM serving systems like vLLM, Andes improves the average QoE by up to 3.2$\times$ under high request rate, or alternatively, it attains up to 1.6$\times$ higher request rate while preserving high QoE.</p>

This paper investigates the challenges of high-dimensional estimation and inference under the constraints of differential privacy. First, we study scenarios involving an untrusted central server, demonstrating the inherent difficulties of accurate estimation in high-dimensional problems. Our findings indicate that the tight minimax rates depends on the high-dimensionality of the data even with sparsity assumptions. Second, we consider a scenario with a trusted central server and introduce a novel federated estimation algorithm tailored for linear regression models. This algorithm effectively handles the slight variations among models distributed across different machines. We also propose methods for statistical inference, including coordinate-wise confidence intervals for individual parameters and strategies for simultaneous inference. Extensive simulation experiments support our theoretical advances, underscoring the efficacy and reliability of our approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Procedural noise is a fundamental component of computer graphics pipelines, offering a flexible way to generate textures that exhibit "natural" random variation. Many different types of noise exist, each produced by a separate algorithm. In this paper, we present a single generative model which can learn to generate multiple types of noise as well as blend between them. In addition, it is capable of producing spatially-varying noise blends despite not having access to such data for training. These features are enabled by training a denoising diffusion model using a novel combination of data augmentation and network conditioning techniques. Like procedural noise generators, the model's behavior is controllable via interpretable parameters and a source of randomness. We use our model to produce a variety of visually compelling noise textures. We also present an application of our model to improving inverse procedural material design; using our model in place of fixed-type noise nodes in a procedural material graph results in higher-fidelity material reconstructions without needing to know the type of noise in advance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning techniques have shown significant potential in many applications through recent years. The achieved results often outperform traditional techniques. However, the quality of a neural network highly depends on the used training data. Noisy, insufficient, or biased training data leads to suboptimal results.
  We present a hybrid method that combines deep learning with iterated graph Laplacian and show its application in acoustic impedance inversion which is a routine procedure in seismic explorations. A neural network is used to obtain a first approximation of the underlying acoustic impedance and construct a graph Laplacian matrix from this approximation. Afterwards, we use a Tikhonov-like variational method to solve the impedance inversion problem where the regularizer is based on the constructed graph Laplacian. The obtained solution can be shown to be more accurate and stable with respect to noise than the initial guess obtained by the neural network. This process can be iterated several times, each time constructing a new graph Laplacian matrix from the most recent reconstruction. The method converges after only a few iterations returning a much more accurate reconstruction.
  We demonstrate the potential of our method on two different datasets and under various levels of noise. We use two different neural networks that have been introduced in previous works. The experiments show that our approach improves the reconstruction quality in the presence of noise.</p>

This method effectively combines DR learning, a paradigm aimed at enhancing model robustness against variations in data distribution, with safe screening (SS), a sparse optimization technique designed to identify irrelevant samples and features prior to model training. The core concept of the DRSS method involves reformulating the DR covariate-shift problem as a weighted empirical risk minimization problem, where the weights are subject to uncertainty within a predetermined range. By extending the SS technique to accommodate this weight uncertainty, the DRSS method is capable of reliably identifying unnecessary samples and features under any future distribution within a specified range. We provide a theoretical guarantee of the DRSS method and validate its performance through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers trained on natural language data have been shown to learn its hierarchical structure and generalize to sentences with unseen syntactic structures without explicitly encoding any structural bias. In this work, we investigate sources of inductive bias in transformer models and their training that could cause such generalization behavior to emerge. We extensively experiment with transformer models trained on multiple synthetic datasets and with different training objectives and show that while other objectives e.g. sequence-to-sequence modeling, prefix language modeling, often failed to lead to hierarchical generalization, models trained with the language modeling objective consistently learned to generalize hierarchically. We then conduct pruning experiments to study how transformers trained with the language modeling objective encode hierarchical structure. When pruned, we find joint existence of subnetworks within the model with different generalization behaviors (subnetworks corresponding to hierarchical structure and linear order). Finally, we take a Bayesian perspective to further uncover transformers' preference for hierarchical generalization: We establish a correlation between whether transformers generalize hierarchically on a dataset and whether the simplest explanation of that dataset is provided by a hierarchical grammar compared to regular grammars exhibiting linear generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: The interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) dictate therapeutic efficacy of radiation and many systemic therapies in breast cancer. However, to date, there is not a widely available method to reproducibly measure tumor and immune phenotypes for each patient's tumor. Given this unmet clinical need, we applied multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithms to assess activity of ten biologically relevant pathways from the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slide of primary breast tumors. We employed different feature extraction approaches and state-of-the-art model architectures. Using binary classification, our models attained area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores above 0.70 for nearly all gene expression pathways and on some cases, exceeded 0.80. Attention maps suggest that our trained models recognize biologically relevant spatial patterns of cell sub-populations from H&E. These efforts represent a first step towards developing computational H&E biomarkers that reflect facets of the TME and hold promise for augmenting precision oncology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Winderl, Nicola Franco, Jeanette Miriam Lorenz</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the critical need to enhance security measures against adversarial attacks and protect QML models becomes increasingly evident. In this work, we outline the connection between quantum noise channels and differential privacy (DP), by constructing a family of noise channels which are inherently $\epsilon$-DP: $(\alpha, \gamma)$-channels. Through this approach, we successfully replicate the $\epsilon$-DP bounds observed for depolarizing and random rotation channels, thereby affirming the broad generality of our framework. Additionally, we use a semi-definite program to construct an optimally robust channel. In a small-scale experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the benefits of using our optimal noise channel over depolarizing noise, particularly in enhancing adversarial accuracy. Moreover, we assess how the variables $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ affect the certifiable robustness and investigate how different encoding methods impact the classifier's robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning has the potential to revolutionize passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) for ecological assessments. However, high annotation and compute costs limit the field's efficacy. Generalizable pretrained networks can overcome these costs, but high-quality pretraining requires vast annotated libraries, limiting its current applicability primarily to bird taxa. Here, we identify the optimum pretraining strategy for a data-deficient domain using coral reef bioacoustics. We assemble ReefSet, a large annotated library of reef sounds, though modest compared to bird libraries at 2% of the sample count. Through testing few-shot transfer learning performance, we observe that pretraining on bird audio provides notably superior generalizability compared to pretraining on ReefSet or unrelated audio alone. However, our key findings show that cross-domain mixing which leverages bird, reef and unrelated audio during pretraining maximizes reef generalizability. SurfPerch, our pretrained network, provides a strong foundation for automated analysis of marine PAM data with minimal annotation and compute costs.</p>

For the loss function defined by the monotonically increasing function $f$ and inverse divergence, the conditions for the statistical model and function $f$ under which the estimating equation is unbiased are clarified. Specifically, we characterize two types of statistical models, an inverse Gaussian type and a mixture of generalized inverse Gaussian type distributions, to show that the conditions for the function $f$ are different for each model. We also define Bregman divergence as a linear sum over the dimensions of the inverse divergence and extend the results to the multi-dimensional case.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Peng, Xiaofeng Li, Xinyu Li, Zhenghan Wang, Hui Deng, Xiaoxian Luo, Lixue Yin, Hongmei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and cardiac amyloidosis (CA) are both heart conditions that can progress to heart failure if untreated. They exhibit similar echocardiographic characteristics, often leading to diagnostic challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-view deep learning approach that utilizes 2D echocardiography for differentiating between HCM and CA. The method begins by classifying 2D echocardiography data into five distinct echocardiographic views: apical 4-chamber, parasternal long axis of left ventricle, parasternal short axis at levels of the mitral valve, papillary muscle, and apex. It then extracts features of each view separately and combines five features for disease classification. A total of 212 patients diagnosed with HCM, and 30 patients diagnosed with CA, along with 200 individuals with normal cardiac function(Normal), were enrolled in this study from 2018 to 2022. This approach achieved a precision, recall of 0.905, and micro-F1 score of 0.904, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately identifying HCM and CA using a multi-view analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose an end-to-end real-estate recommendation system, RE-RecSys, which has been productionized in real-world industry setting. We categorize any user into 4 categories based on available historical data: i) cold-start users; ii) short-term users; iii) long-term users; and iv) short-long term users. For cold-start users, we propose a novel rule-based engine that is based on the popularity of locality and user preferences. For short-term users, we propose to use content-filtering model which recommends properties based on recent interactions of users. For long-term and short-long term users, we propose a novel combination of content and collaborative filtering based approach which can be easily productionized in the real-world scenario. Moreover, based on the conversion rate, we have designed a novel weighing scheme for different impressions done by users on the platform for the training of content and collaborative models. Finally, we show the efficiency of the proposed pipeline, RE-RecSys, on a real-world property and clickstream dataset collected from leading real-estate platform in India. We show that the proposed pipeline is deployable in real-world scenario with an average latency of <40 ms serving 1000 rpm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasan F. Ates, Suleyman Yildirim, Bahadir K. Gunturk</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task in image processing due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. Complex degradations present in real life images make it difficult to solve this problem using na\"ive deep learning approaches, where models are often trained on synthetically generated image pairs. Most of the effort so far has been focused on solving the inverse problem under some constraints, such as for a limited space of blur kernels and/or assuming noise-free input images. Yet, there is a gap in the literature to provide a well-generalized deep learning-based solution that performs well on images with unknown and highly complex degradations. In this paper, we propose IKR-Net (Iterative Kernel Reconstruction Network) for blind SISR. In the proposed approach, kernel and noise estimation and high-resolution image reconstruction are carried out iteratively using dedicated deep models. The iterative refinement provides significant improvement in both the reconstructed image and the estimated blur kernel even for noisy inputs. IKR-Net provides a generalized solution that can handle any type of blur and level of noise in the input low-resolution image. IKR-Net achieves state-of-the-art results in blind SISR, especially for noisy images with motion blur.</p>

The next step is to integrate GenAI technology into products, a task typically conducted by software developers. Such product development always comes with a certain risk of liability.

This technology deals with data for both model training and generated output. We summarize key aspects regarding our current knowledge that every software developer involved in product development using GenAI should be aware of to avoid critical mistakes that may expose them to liability claims.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Deng, Yihan Zhang, Andrew Parkes, Alex Bentley, Amanda Wright, Michael Pound, Michael Somekh</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimation of the optical properties of scattering media such as tissue is important in diagnostics as well as in the development of techniques to image deeper. As light penetrates the sample scattering events occur that alter the propagation direction of the photons in a random manner leading degradation of image quality. The distribution of the scattered light does, however, give a measure of the optical properties such as the reduced scattering coefficient and the absorption coefficient. Unfortunately, inverting scattering patterns to recover the optical properties is not simple, especially in the regime where the light is partially randomized. Machine learning has been proposed by several authors as a means of recovering these properties from either the back scattered or the transmitted light. In the present paper, we train a general purpose convolutional neural network RESNET 50 with simulated data based on Monte Carlo simulations. We show that compared with previous work our approach gives comparable or better reconstruction accuracy with training on a much smaller dataset. Moreover, by training on multiple parameters such as the intensity distribution at multiple planes or the exit angle and spatial distribution one achieves improved performance compared to training on a single input such as the intensity distribution captured at the sample surface. While our approach gives good parameter reconstruction, we identify factors that limit the accuracy of the recovered properties, particularly the absorption coefficient. In the light of these limitations, we suggest how the present approach may be enhanced for even better performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing autonomous agents for mobile devices can significantly enhance user interactions by offering increased efficiency and accessibility. However, despite the growing interest in mobile device control agents, the absence of a commonly adopted benchmark makes it challenging to quantify scientific progress in this area. In this work, we introduce B-MoCA: a novel benchmark designed specifically for evaluating mobile device control agents. To create a realistic benchmark, we develop B-MoCA based on the Android operating system and define 60 common daily tasks. Importantly, we incorporate a randomization feature that changes various aspects of mobile devices, including user interface layouts and language settings, to assess generalization performance. We benchmark diverse agents, including agents employing large language models (LLMs) or multi-modal LLMs as well as agents trained from scratch using human expert demonstrations. While these agents demonstrate proficiency in executing straightforward tasks, their poor performance on complex tasks highlights significant opportunities for future research to enhance their effectiveness.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16676">Multilayer Correlation Clustering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Atsushi Miyauchi, Florian Adriaens, Francesco Bonchi, Nikolaj Tatti</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we establish Multilayer Correlation Clustering, a novel generalization of Correlation Clustering (Bansal et al., FOCS '02) to the multilayer setting. In this model, we are given a series of inputs of Correlation Clustering (called layers) over the common set $V$. The goal is then to find a clustering of $V$ that minimizes the $\ell_p$-norm ($p\geq 1$) of the disagreements vector, which is defined as the vector (with dimension equal to the number of layers), each element of which represents the disagreements of the clustering on the corresponding layer. For this generalization, we first design an $O(L\log n)$-approximation algorithm, where $L$ is the number of layers, based on the well-known region growing technique. We then study an important special case of our problem, namely the problem with the probability constraint. For this case, we first give an $(\alpha+2)$-approximation algorithm, where $\alpha$ is any possible approximation ratio for the single-layer counterpart. For instance, we can take $\alpha=2.5$ in general (Ailon et al., JACM '08) and $\alpha=1.73+\epsilon$ for the unweighted case (Cohen-Addad et al., FOCS '23). Furthermore, we design a $4$-approximation algorithm, which improves the above approximation ratio of $\alpha+2=4.5$ for the general probability-constraint case. Computational experiments using real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Krishnamurthy (Dj),  Dvijotham, H. Brendan McMahan, Krishna Pillutla, Thomas Steinke, Abhradeep Thakurta</p>
<p>Abstract: In the task of differentially private (DP) continual counting, we receive a stream of increments and our goal is to output an approximate running total of these increments, without revealing too much about any specific increment. Despite its simplicity, differentially private continual counting has attracted significant attention both in theory and in practice. Existing algorithms for differentially private continual counting are either inefficient in terms of their space usage or add an excessive amount of noise, inducing suboptimal utility.
  The most practical DP continual counting algorithms add carefully correlated Gaussian noise to the values. The task of choosing the covariance for this noise can be expressed in terms of factoring the lower-triangular matrix of ones (which computes prefix sums). We present two approaches from this class (for different parameter regimes) that achieve near-optimal utility for DP continual counting and only require logarithmic or polylogarithmic space (and time).
  Our first approach is based on a space-efficient streaming matrix multiplication algorithm for a class of Toeplitz matrices. We show that to instantiate this algorithm for DP continual counting, it is sufficient to find a low-degree rational function that approximates the square root on a circle in the complex plane. We then apply and extend tools from approximation theory to achieve this. We also derive efficient closed-forms for the objective function for arbitrarily many steps, and show direct numerical optimization yields a highly practical solution to the problem. Our second approach combines our first approach with a recursive construction similar to the binary tree mechanism.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present LayerSkip, an end-to-end solution to speed-up inference of large language models (LLMs). First, during training we apply layer dropout, with low dropout rates for earlier layers and higher dropout rates for later layers, and an early exit loss where all transformer layers share the same exit. Second, during inference, we show that this training recipe increases the accuracy of early exit at earlier layers, without adding any auxiliary layers or modules to the model. Third, we present a novel self-speculative decoding solution where we exit at early layers and verify and correct with remaining layers of the model. Our proposed self-speculative decoding approach has less memory footprint than other speculative decoding approaches and benefits from shared compute and activations of the draft and verification stages. We run experiments on different Llama model sizes on different types of training: pretraining from scratch, continual pretraining, finetuning on specific data domain, and finetuning on specific task. We implement our inference solution and show speedups of up to 2.16x on summarization for CNN/DM documents, 1.82x on coding, and 2.0x on TOPv2 semantic parsing task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detection of malignant lesions on mammography images is extremely important for early breast cancer diagnosis. In clinical practice, images are acquired from two different angles, and radiologists can fully utilize information from both views, simultaneously locating the same lesion. However, for automatic detection approaches such information fusion remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new model called MAMM-Net, which allows the processing of both mammography views simultaneously by sharing information not only on an object level, as seen in existing works, but also on a feature level. MAMM-Net's key component is the Fusion Layer, based on deformable attention and designed to increase detection precision while keeping high recall. Our experiments show superior performance on the public DDSM dataset compared to the previous state-of-the-art model, while introducing new helpful features such as lesion annotation on pixel-level and classification of lesions malignancy.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning approach for Dubins Traveling Salesman Problems(DTSP) with Neighborhood (DTSPN) to quickly produce a tour of a non-holonomic vehicle passing through neighborhoods of given task points. The method involves two learning phases: initially, a model-free reinforcement learning approach leverages privileged information to distill knowledge from expert trajectories generated by the LinKernighan heuristic (LKH) algorithm. Subsequently, a supervised learning phase trains an adaptation network to solve problems independently of privileged information. Before the first learning phase, a parameter initialization technique using the demonstration data was also devised to enhance training efficiency. The proposed learning method produces a solution about 50 times faster than LKH and substantially outperforms other imitation learning and RL with demonstration schemes, most of which fail to sense all the task points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gahyeon Kim, Sohee Kim, Seokju Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on zero-shot downstream tasks. Building upon this, recent studies, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, have proposed the use of prompt learning, where context within a prompt is replaced with learnable vectors, leading to significant improvements over manually crafted prompts. However, the performance improvement for unseen classes is still marginal, and to tackle this problem, data augmentation has been frequently used in traditional zero-shot learning techniques. Through our experiments, we have identified important issues in CoOp and CoCoOp: the context learned through traditional image augmentation is biased toward seen classes, negatively impacting generalization to unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose adversarial token embedding to disentangle low-level visual augmentation features from high-level class information when inducing bias in learnable prompts. Through our novel mechanism called "Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning", AAPL, we guide the learnable context to effectively extract text features by focusing on high-level features for unseen classes. We have conducted experiments across 11 datasets, and overall, AAPL shows favorable performances compared to the existing methods in few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, cross-dataset, and domain generalization tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Addressing the challenges of rare diseases is difficult, especially with the limited number of reference images and a small patient population. This is more evident in rare skin diseases, where we encounter long-tailed data distributions that make it difficult to develop unbiased and broadly effective models. The diverse ways in which image datasets are gathered and their distinct purposes also add to these challenges. Our study conducts a detailed examination of the benefits and drawbacks of episodic and conventional training methodologies, adopting a few-shot learning approach alongside transfer learning. We evaluated our models using the ISIC2018, Derm7pt, and SD-198 datasets. With minimal labeled examples, our models showed substantial information gains and better performance compared to previously trained models. Our research emphasizes the improved ability to represent features in DenseNet121 and MobileNetV2 models, achieved by using pre-trained models on ImageNet to increase similarities within classes. Moreover, our experiments, ranging from 2-way to 5-way classifications with up to 10 examples, showed a growing success rate for traditional transfer learning methods as the number of examples increased. The addition of data augmentation techniques significantly improved our transfer learning based model performance, leading to higher performances than existing methods, especially in the SD-198 and ISIC2018 datasets.

<p>Abstract: Aiming to replicate human-like dexterity, perceptual experiences, and motion patterns, we explore learning from human demonstrations using a bimanual system with multifingered hands and visuotactile data. Two significant challenges exist: the lack of an affordable and accessible teleoperation system suitable for a dual-arm setup with multifingered hands, and the scarcity of multifingered hand hardware equipped with touch sensing. To tackle the first challenge, we develop HATO, a low-cost hands-arms teleoperation system that leverages off-the-shelf electronics, complemented with a software suite that enables efficient data collection; the comprehensive software suite also supports multimodal data processing, scalable policy learning, and smooth policy deployment. To tackle the latter challenge, we introduce a novel hardware adaptation by repurposing two prosthetic hands equipped with touch sensors for research. Using visuotactile data collected from our system, we learn skills to complete long-horizon, high-precision tasks which are difficult to achieve without multifingered dexterity and touch feedback. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the effects of dataset size, sensing modality, and visual input preprocessing on policy learning. Our results mark a promising step forward in bimanual multifingered manipulation from visuotactile data. Videos, code, and datasets can be found at https://toruowo.github.io/hato/ .</p>

To achieve this, we exploit a simple proxy task of ordering a shuffled image sequence, with `time' serving as a supervisory signal since only changes that are monotonic with time can give rise to the correct ordering. We also introduce a flexible transformer-based model for general-purpose ordering of image sequences of arbitrary length with built-in attribution maps. After training, the model successfully discovers and localizes monotonic changes while ignoring cyclic and stochastic ones. We demonstrate applications of the model in multiple video settings covering different scene and object types, discovering both object-level and environmental changes in unseen sequences. We also demonstrate that the attention-based attribution maps function as effective prompts for segmenting the changing regions, and that the learned representations can be used for downstream applications. Finally, we show that the model achieves the state of the art on standard benchmarks for ordering a set of images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirban Das, Timothy Castiglia, Shiqiang Wang, Stacy Patterson</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider federated learning in tiered communication networks. Our network model consists of a set of silos, each holding a vertical partition of the data. Each silo contains a hub and a set of clients, with the silo's vertical data shard partitioned horizontally across its clients. We propose Tiered Decentralized Coordinate Descent (TDCD), a communication-efficient decentralized training algorithm for such two-tiered networks. The clients in each silo perform multiple local gradient steps before sharing updates with their hub to reduce communication overhead. Each hub adjusts its coordinates by averaging its workers' updates, and then hubs exchange intermediate updates with one another. We present a theoretical analysis of our algorithm and show the dependence of the convergence rate on the number of vertical partitions and the number of local updates. We further validate our approach empirically via simulation-based experiments using a variety of datasets and objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fransisca Susan (MIT Operations Research Center), Negin Golrezaei (MIT Sloan School of Management), Ehsan Emamjomeh-Zadeh (Meta Platforms, Inc), David Kempe (University of Southern California, Los Angeles)</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a non-parametric choice model based on consumers' decisions. We present a negative result showing that such choice models may not be identifiable. To overcome the identifiability problem, we introduce a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of the choice model. This representation provably encodes all the information about the choice model which can be inferred from the available data, in the sense that it permits computing all choice probabilities.
  We establish that given exact choice probabilities for a collection of item sets, one can reconstruct the DAG. However, attempting to extend this methodology to estimate the DAG from noisy choice frequency data obtained during an active learning process leads to inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we present an inclusion-exclusion approach that effectively manages error propagation across DAG levels, leading to a more accurate estimate of the DAG. Utilizing this technique, our algorithm estimates the DAG representation of an underlying non-parametric choice model. The algorithm operates efficiently (in polynomial time) when the set of frequent rankings is drawn uniformly at random. It learns the distribution over the most popular items among frequent preference types by actively and repeatedly offering assortments of items and observing the chosen item. We demonstrate that our algorithm more effectively recovers a set of frequent preferences on both synthetic and publicly available datasets on consumers' preferences, compared to corresponding non-active learning estimation algorithms. These findings underscore the value of our algorithm and the broader applicability of active-learning approaches in modeling consumer behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Lohrer, Darpan Malik, Claudius Zelenka, Peer Kr\"oger</p>
<p>Abstract: Group Anomaly Detection (GAD) identifies unusual pattern in groups where individual members might not be anomalous. This task is of major importance across multiple disciplines, in which also sequences like trajectories can be considered as a group. As groups become more diverse in heterogeneity and size, detecting group anomalies becomes challenging, especially without supervision. Though Recurrent Neural Networks are well established deep sequence models, their performance can decrease with increasing sequence lengths. Hence, this paper introduces GADformer, a BERT-based model for attention-driven GAD on trajectories in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate how group anomalies can be detected by attention-based GAD. We also introduce the Block-Attention-anomaly-Score (BAS) to enhance model transparency by scoring attention patterns. In addition to that, synthetic trajectory generation allows various ablation studies. In extensive experiments we investigate our approach versus related works in their robustness for trajectory noise and novelties on synthetic data and three real world datasets.</p>

  Additionally, if the activation function is smooth and such an interpolation networks exists, then the set of parameters which interpolate forms a manifold. Furthermore, we give a characterization of the Hessian of the loss function evaluated at the interpolation points.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baturalp Yalcin, Haixiang Zhang, Javad Lavaei, Murat Arcak</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the system identification problem for linear discrete-time systems under adversaries and analyzes two lasso-type estimators. We examine both asymptotic and non-asymptotic properties of these estimators in two separate scenarios, corresponding to deterministic and stochastic models for the attack times. Since the samples collected from the system are correlated, the existing results on lasso are not applicable. We prove that when the system is stable and attacks are injected periodically, the sample complexity for exact recovery of the system dynamics is linear in terms of the dimension of the states. When adversarial attacks occur at each time instance with probability p, the required sample complexity for exact recovery scales polynomially in the dimension of the states and the probability p. This result implies almost sure convergence to the true system dynamics under the asymptotic regime. As a by-product, our estimators still learn the system correctly even when more than half of the data is compromised. We highlight that the attack vectors are allowed to be correlated with each other in this work, whereas we make some assumptions about the times at which the attacks happen. This paper provides the first mathematical guarantee in the literature on learning from correlated data for dynamical systems in the case when there is less clean data than corrupt data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchang Tao, Qi Cao, Huawei Shen, Yunfan Wu, Bingbing Xu, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the success of graph neural networks (GNNs), their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses tremendous challenges for practical applications. Existing defense methods suffer from severe performance decline under unseen attacks, due to either limited observed adversarial examples or pre-defined heuristics. To address these limitations, we analyze the causalities in graph adversarial attacks and conclude that causal features are key to achieve graph adversarial robustness, owing to their determinedness for labels and invariance across attacks. To learn these causal features, we innovatively propose an Invariant causal DEfense method against adversarial Attacks (IDEA). We derive node-based and structure-based invariance objectives from an information-theoretic perspective. IDEA ensures strong predictability for labels and invariant predictability across attacks, which is provably a causally invariant defense across various attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IDEA attains state-of-the-art defense performance under all five attacks on all five datasets. The implementation of IDEA is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IDEA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elia Cunegatti, Matteo Farina, Doina Bucur, Giovanni Iacca</p>
<p>Abstract: Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI) algorithms provide Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs) which are computationally more efficient than their dense counterparts, and try to avoid performance degradation. While much emphasis has been directed towards \emph{how} to prune, we still do not know \emph{what topological metrics} of the SNNs characterize \emph{good performance}. From prior work, we have layer-wise topological metrics by which SNN performance can be predicted: the Ramanujan-based metrics. To exploit these metrics, proper ways to represent network layers via Graph Encodings (GEs) are needed, with Bipartite Graph Encodings (BGEs) being the \emph{de-facto} standard at the current stage. Nevertheless, existing BGEs neglect the impact of the inputs, and do not characterize the SNN in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, thanks to a thorough study of the Ramanujan-based metrics, we discover that they are only as good as the \emph{layer-wise density} as performance predictors, when paired with BGEs. To close both gaps, we design a comprehensive topological analysis for SNNs with both linear and convolutional layers, via (i) a new input-aware Multipartite Graph Encoding (MGE) for SNNs and (ii) the design of new end-to-end topological metrics over the MGE. With these novelties, we show the following: (a) The proposed MGE allows to extract topological metrics that are much better predictors of the accuracy drop than metrics computed from current input-agnostic BGEs; (b) Which metrics are important at different sparsity levels and for different architectures; (c) A mixture of our topological metrics can rank PaI algorithms more effectively than Ramanujan-based metrics.

<p>Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged in 2019, causing a COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in 7 million deaths out of 770 million reported cases over the next four years. The global health emergency called for unprecedented efforts to monitor and reduce the rate of infection, pushing the study of new diagnostic methods. In this paper, we introduce a cheap, fast, and non-invasive detection system, which exploits only the exhaled breath. Specifically, provided an air sample, the mass spectra in the 10--351 mass-to-charge range are measured using an original nano-sampling device coupled with a high-precision spectrometer; then, the raw spectra are processed by custom software algorithms; the clean and augmented data are eventually classified using state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms. An uncontrolled clinical trial was conducted between 2021 and 2022 on some 300 subjects who were concerned about being infected, either due to exhibiting symptoms or having quite recently recovered from illness. Despite the simplicity of use, our system showed a performance comparable to the traditional polymerase-chain-reaction and antigen testing in identifying cases of COVID-19 (that is, 0.95 accuracy, 0.94 recall, 0.96 specificity, and 0.92 F1-score). In light of these outcomes, we think that the proposed system holds the potential for substantial contributions to routine screenings and expedited responses during future epidemics, as it yields results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, providing them in a more rapid and less invasive manner.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers are central to recent successes in natural language processing and computer vision. Transformers have a mostly uniform backbone where layers alternate between feed-forward and self-attention in order to build a deep network. Here we investigate this design choice and find that more complex blocks that have different permutations of layer primitives can be more efficient. Using this insight, we develop a complex block, named Brainformer, that consists of a diverse sets of layers such as sparsely gated feed-forward layers, dense feed-forward layers, attention layers, and various forms of layer normalization and activation functions. Brainformer consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art dense and sparse Transformers, in terms of both quality and efficiency. A Brainformer model with 8 billion activated parameters per token demonstrates 2x faster training convergence and 5x faster step time compared to its GLaM counterpart. In downstream task evaluation, Brainformer also demonstrates a 3% higher SuperGLUE score with fine-tuning compared to GLaM with a similar number of activated parameters. Finally, Brainformer largely outperforms a Primer dense model derived with NAS with similar computation per token on fewshot evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Mohan, Amy Zhang, Marius Lindauer</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL), bolstered by the expressive capabilities of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for function approximation, has demonstrated considerable success in numerous applications. However, its practicality in addressing various real-world scenarios, characterized by diverse and unpredictable dynamics, noisy signals, and large state and action spaces, remains limited. This limitation stems from poor data efficiency, limited generalization capabilities, a lack of safety guarantees, and the absence of interpretability, among other factors. To overcome these challenges and improve performance across these crucial metrics, one promising avenue is to incorporate additional structural information about the problem into the RL learning process. Various sub-fields of RL have proposed methods for incorporating such inductive biases. We amalgamate these diverse methodologies under a unified framework, shedding light on the role of structure in the learning problem, and classify these methods into distinct patterns of incorporating structure. By leveraging this comprehensive framework, we provide valuable insights into the challenges of structured RL and lay the groundwork for a design pattern perspective on RL research. This novel perspective paves the way for future advancements and aids in developing more effective and efficient RL algorithms that can potentially handle real-world scenarios better.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongyuan Liang, Yanchao Sun, Ruijie Zheng, Xiangyu Liu, Benjamin Eysenbach, Tuomas Sandholm, Furong Huang, Stephen McAleer</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) systems requires robustness to uncertainty and model misspecification, yet prior robust RL methods typically only study noise introduced independently across time. However, practical sources of uncertainty are usually coupled across time. We formally introduce temporally-coupled perturbations, presenting a novel challenge for existing robust RL methods. To tackle this challenge, we propose GRAD, a novel game-theoretic approach that treats the temporally-coupled robust RL problem as a partially observable two-player zero-sum game. By finding an approximate equilibrium within this game, GRAD optimizes for general robustness against temporally-coupled perturbations. Experiments on continuous control tasks demonstrate that, compared with prior methods, our approach achieves a higher degree of robustness to various types of attacks on different attack domains, both in settings with temporally-coupled perturbations and decoupled perturbations.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of big data on deep learning models to help solve the full waveform inversion (FWI) problem. While it is well known that big data can boost the performance of deep learning models in many tasks, its effectiveness has not been validated for FWI. To address this gap, we present an empirical study that investigates how deep learning models in FWI behave when trained on OpenFWI, a collection of large-scale, multi-structural, synthetic datasets published recently. In particular, we train and evaluate the FWI models on a combination of 10 2D subsets in OpenFWI that contain 470K pairs of seismic data and velocity maps in total. Our experiments demonstrate that training on the combined dataset yields an average improvement of 13.03% in MAE, 7.19% in MSE and 1.87% in SSIM compared to each split dataset, and an average improvement of 28.60%, 21.55% and 8.22% in the leave-one-out generalization test. We further demonstrate that model capacity needs to scale in accordance with data size for optimal improvement, where our largest model yields an average improvement of 20.06%, 13.39% and 0.72% compared to the smallest one.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ou Deng, Qun Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Addressing missing data in complex datasets including electronic health records (EHR) is critical for ensuring accurate analysis and decision-making in healthcare. This paper proposes dynamically adaptable structural equation modeling (SEM) using a self-attention method (SESA), an approach to data imputation in EHR. SESA innovates beyond traditional SEM-based methods by incorporating self-attention mechanisms, thereby enhancing model adaptability and accuracy across diverse EHR datasets. Such enhancement allows SESA to dynamically adjust and optimize imputation and overcome the limitations of static SEM frameworks. Our experimental analyses demonstrate the achievement of robust predictive SESA performance for effectively handling missing data in EHR. Moreover, the SESA architecture not only rectifies potential mis-specifications in SEM but also synergizes with causal discovery algorithms to refine its imputation logic based on underlying data structures. Such features highlight its capabilities and broadening applicational potential in EHR data analysis and beyond, marking a reasonable leap forward in the field of data imputation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL), which learns environment model from offline dataset and generates more out-of-distribution model data, has become an effective approach to the problem of distribution shift in offline RL. Due to the gap between the learned and actual environment, conservatism should be incorporated into the algorithm to balance accurate offline data and imprecise model data. The conservatism of current algorithms mostly relies on model uncertainty estimation. However, uncertainty estimation is unreliable and leads to poor performance in certain scenarios, and the previous methods ignore differences between the model data, which brings great conservatism. Therefore, this paper proposes a milDly cOnservative Model-bAsed offlINe RL algorithm (DOMAIN) without estimating model uncertainty to address the above issues. DOMAIN introduces adaptive sampling distribution of model samples, which can adaptively adjust the model data penalty. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that the Q value learned by the DOMAIN outside the region is a lower bound of the true Q value, the DOMAIN is less conservative than previous model-based offline RL algorithms and has the guarantee of security policy improvement. The results of extensive experiments show that DOMAIN outperforms prior RL algorithms on the D4RL dataset benchmark, and achieves better performance than other RL algorithms on tasks that require generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Double descent presents a counter-intuitive aspect within the machine learning domain, and researchers have observed its manifestation in various models and tasks. While some theoretical explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon in specific contexts, an accepted theory to account for its occurrence in deep learning remains yet to be established. In this study, we revisit the phenomenon of double descent and demonstrate that its occurrence is strongly influenced by the presence of noisy data. Through conducting a comprehensive analysis of the feature space of learned representations, we unveil that double descent arises in imperfect models trained with noisy data. We argue that double descent is a consequence of the model first learning the noisy data until interpolation and then adding implicit regularization via over-parameterization acquiring therefore capability to separate the information from the noise.</p>

<p>Abstract: In contemporary machine learning workloads, numerous hyper-parameter search algorithms are frequently utilized to efficiently discover high-performing hyper-parameter values, such as learning and regularization rates. As a result, a range of parameter schedules have been designed to leverage the capability of adjusting hyper-parameters during training to enhance loss performance. These schedules, however, introduce new hyper-parameters to be searched and do not account for the current loss values of the models being trained.
  To address these issues, we propose Population Descent (PopDescent), a progress-aware hyper-parameter tuning technique that employs a memetic, population-based search. By merging evolutionary and local search processes, PopDescent proactively explores hyper-parameter options during training based on their performance. Our trials on standard machine learning vision tasks show that PopDescent converges faster than existing search methods, finding model parameters with test-loss values up to 18% lower, even when considering the use of schedules. Moreover, we highlight the robustness of PopDescent to its initial training parameters, a crucial characteristic for hyper-parameter search techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Chen, Xiaochen Zheng, Amina Mollaysa, Manuel Sch\"urch, Ahmed Allam, Michael Krauthammer</p>
<p>Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series data is characterized by varying time intervals between consecutive observations of measured variables/signals (i.e., features) and varying sampling rates (i.e., recordings/measurement) across these features. Modeling time series while taking into account these irregularities is still a challenging task for machine learning methods. Here, we introduce TADA, a Two-stageAggregation process with Dynamic local Attention to harmonize time-wise and feature-wise irregularities in multivariate time series. In the first stage, the irregular time series undergoes temporal embedding (TE) using all available features at each time step. This process preserves the contribution of each available feature and generates a fixed-dimensional representation per time step. The second stage introduces a dynamic local attention (DLA) mechanism with adaptive window sizes. DLA aggregates time recordings using feature-specific windows to harmonize irregular time intervals capturing feature-specific sampling rates. Then hierarchical MLP mixer layers process the output of DLA through multiscale patching to leverage information at various scales for the downstream tasks. TADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets, including the latest MIMIC IV dataset, and highlights its effectiveness in handling irregular multivariate time series and its potential for various real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The analytical prediction of building energy performance in residential buildings based on the heat losses of its individual envelope components is a challenging task. It is worth noting that this field is still in its infancy, with relatively limited research conducted in this specific area to date, especially when it comes for data-driven approaches. In this paper we introduce a novel physics-informed neural network model for addressing this problem. Through the employment of unexposed datasets that encompass general building information, audited characteristics, and heating energy consumption, we feed the deep learning model with general building information, while the model's output consists of the structural components and several thermal properties that are in fact the basic elements of an energy performance certificate (EPC). On top of this neural network, a function, based on physics equations, calculates the energy consumption of the building based on heat losses and enhances the loss function of the deep learning model. This methodology is tested on a real case study for 256 buildings located in Riga, Latvia. Our investigation comes up with promising results in terms of prediction accuracy, paving the way for automated, and data-driven energy efficiency performance prediction based on basic properties of the building, contrary to exhaustive energy efficiency audits led by humans, which are the current status quo.</p>

Since both provide information about predictors and their decision process, they are often seen as two independent means for one single end. This view has led to a dichotomous literature: explainability techniques designed for complex black-box models, or interpretable approaches ignoring the many explainability tools. In this position paper, we challenge the common idea that interpretability and explainability are substitutes for one another by listing their principal shortcomings and discussing how both of them mitigate the drawbacks of the other. In doing so, we call for a new perspective on interpretability and explainability, and works targeting both topics simultaneously, leveraging each of their respective assets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberta Hansen, Matias Vera, Lautaro Estienne, Luciana Ferrer, Pablo Piantanida</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper deals with the convergence analysis of the SUCPA (Semi Unsupervised Calibration through Prior Adaptation) algorithm, defined from a first-order non-linear difference equations, first developed to correct the scores output by a supervised machine learning classifier. The convergence analysis is addressed as a dynamical system problem, by studying the local and global stability of the nonlinear map derived from the algorithm. This map, which is defined by a composition of exponential and rational functions, turns out to be non-hyperbolic with a non-bounded set of non-isolated fixed points. Hence, a non-standard method for solving the convergence analysis is used consisting of an ad-hoc geometrical approach. For a binary classification problem (two-dimensional map), we rigorously prove that the map is globally asymptotically stable. Numerical experiments on real-world application are performed to support the theoretical results by means of two different classification problems: Sentiment Polarity performed with a Large Language Model and Cat-Dog Image classification. For a greater number of classes, the numerical evidence shows the same behavior of the algorithm, and this is illustrated with a Natural Language Inference example. The experiment codes are publicly accessible online at the following repository: https://github.com/LautaroEst/sucpa-convergence</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongho Park, Jaeseung Park, Zheyang Xiong, Nayoung Lee, Jaewoong Cho, Samet Oymak, Kangwook Lee, Dimitris Papailiopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023), have been proposed as alternatives to Transformer networks in language modeling, by incorporating gating, convolutions, and input-dependent token selection to mitigate the quadratic cost of multi-head attention. Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenlu Ye, Wei Xiong, Yuheng Zhang, Nan Jiang, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) under a general preference oracle. In particular, we do not assume that there exists a reward function and the preference signal is drawn from the Bradley-Terry model as most of the prior works do. We consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized minimax game between two LLMs for RLHF under general preference oracle. The learning objective of this formulation is to find a policy so that it is consistently preferred by the KL-regularized preference oracle over any competing LLMs. We show that this framework is strictly more general than the reward-based one, and propose sample-efficient algorithms for both the offline learning from a pre-collected preference dataset and online learning where we can query the preference oracle along the way of training. Empirical studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Achieving a balance between computational speed, prediction accuracy, and universal applicability in molecular simulations has been a persistent challenge. This paper presents substantial advancements in the TorchMD-Net software, a pivotal step forward in the shift from conventional force fields to neural network-based potentials. The evolution of TorchMD-Net into a more comprehensive and versatile framework is highlighted, incorporating cutting-edge architectures such as TensorNet. This transformation is achieved through a modular design approach, encouraging customized applications within the scientific community. The most notable enhancement is a significant improvement in computational efficiency, achieving a very remarkable acceleration in the computation of energy and forces for TensorNet models, with performance gains ranging from 2-fold to 10-fold over previous iterations. Other enhancements include highly optimized neighbor search algorithms that support periodic boundary conditions and the smooth integration with existing molecular dynamics frameworks. Additionally, the updated version introduces the capability to integrate physical priors, further enriching its application spectrum and utility in research.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents FlowCyt, the first comprehensive benchmark for multi-class single-cell classification in flow cytometry data. The dataset comprises bone marrow samples from 30 patients, with each cell characterized by twelve markers. Ground truth labels identify five hematological cell types: T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, Monocytes, Mast cells, and Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs). Experiments utilize supervised inductive learning and semi-supervised transductive learning on up to 1 million cells per patient. Baseline methods include Gaussian Mixture Models, XGBoost, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs demonstrate superior performance by exploiting spatial relationships in graph-encoded data. The benchmark allows standardized evaluation of clinically relevant classification tasks, along with exploratory analyses to gain insights into hematological cell phenotypes. This represents the first public flow cytometry benchmark with a richly annotated, heterogeneous dataset. It will empower the development and rigorous assessment of novel methodologies for single-cell analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: The White House Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence highlights the risks of large language models (LLMs) empowering malicious actors in developing biological, cyber, and chemical weapons. To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 4,157 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop CUT, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. CUT reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danrui Qi, Jiannan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data standardization is a crucial part in data science life cycle. While tools like Pandas offer robust functionalities, their complexity and the manual effort required for customizing code to diverse column types pose significant challenges. Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in automating this process through natural language understanding and code generation, it still demands expert-level programming knowledge and continuous interaction for prompt refinement. To solve these challenges, our key idea is to propose a Python library with declarative, unified APIs for standardizing column types, simplifying the code generation of LLM with concise API calls. We first propose Dataprep.Clean which is written as a component of the Dataprep Library, offers a significant reduction in complexity by enabling the standardization of specific column types with a single line of code. Then we introduce the CleanAgent framework integrating Dataprep.Clean and LLM-based agents to automate the data standardization process. With CleanAgent, data scientists need only provide their requirements once, allowing for a hands-free, automatic standardization process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yewon Byun, Dylan Sam, Michael Oberst, Zachary C. Lipton, Bryan Wilder</p>
<p>Abstract: The presence of inequity is a fundamental problem in the outcomes of decision-making systems, especially when human lives are at stake. Yet, estimating notions of unfairness or inequity is difficult, particularly if they rely on hard-to-measure concepts such as risk. Such measurements of risk can be accurately obtained when no unobserved confounders have jointly influenced past decisions and outcomes. However, in the real world, this assumption rarely holds. In this paper, we show a surprising result that one can still give meaningful bounds on treatment rates to high-risk individuals, even when entirely eliminating or relaxing the assumption that all relevant risk factors are observed. We use the fact that in many real-world settings (e.g., the release of a new treatment) we have data from prior to any allocation to derive unbiased estimates of risk. This result is of immediate practical interest: we can audit unfair outcomes of existing decision-making systems in a principled manner. For instance, in a real-world study of Paxlovid allocation, our framework provably identifies that observed racial inequity cannot be explained by unobserved confounders of the same strength as important observed covariates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mokhtar Z. Alaya (LMAC), Alain Rakotomamonjy (LITIS), Maxime Berar (LITIS), Gilles Gasso (LITIS)</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian smoothed sliced Wasserstein distance has been recently introduced for comparing probability distributions, while preserving privacy on the data. It has been shown that it provides performances similar to its non-smoothed (non-private) counterpart. However, the computationaland statistical properties of such a metric have not yet been well-established. This work investigates the theoretical properties of this distance as well as those of generalized versions denoted as Gaussian-smoothed sliced divergences. We first show that smoothing and slicing preserve the metric property and the weak topology. To study the sample complexity of such divergences, we then introduce $\hat{\hat\mu}_{n}$ the double empirical distribution for the smoothed-projected $\mu$. The distribution $\hat{\hat\mu}_{n}$ is a result of a double sampling process: one from sampling according to the origin distribution $\mu$ and the second according to the convolution of the projection of $\mu$ on the unit sphere and the Gaussian smoothing. We particularly focus on the Gaussian smoothed sliced Wasserstein distance and prove that it converges with a rate $O(n^{-1/2})$. We also derive other properties, including continuity, of different divergences with respect to the smoothing parameter. We support our theoretical findings with empirical studies in the context of privacy-preserving domain adaptation.</p>

We apply GLDGCN to the semi-supervised node classification task.

GLDGCN also perform well on the classic social network KarateClub and the new Wiki-CS dataset.
  For the insufficient ability of our algorithm to process large graphs during the experiment, we also introduce subgraph clustering and stochastic gradient descent methods into GCN and design a semi-supervised node classification algorithm based on the CLustering Graph Convolutional neural Network, which enables GCN to process large graph and improves its application value. We complete semi-supervised node classification experiments on two classic large graph which are PPI dataset (more than 50,000 nodes) and Reddit dataset (more than 200,000 nodes), and also perform well.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13503">Predict to Minimize Swap Regret for All Payoff-Bounded Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lunjia Hu, Yifan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: A sequence of predictions is calibrated if and only if it induces no swap regret to all down-stream decision tasks. We study the Maximum Swap Regret (MSR) of predictions for binary events: the swap regret maximized over all downstream tasks with bounded payoffs. Previously, the best online prediction algorithm for minimizing MSR is obtained by minimizing the K1 calibration error, which upper bounds MSR up to a constant factor. However, recent work (Qiao and Valiant, 2021) gives an ${\Omega}(T^{0.528})$ lower bound for the worst-case expected $K_1$ calibration error incurred by any randomized algorithm in T rounds, presenting a barrier to achieving better rates for MSR. Several relaxations of MSR have been considered to overcome this barrier, via external regret (Kleinberg et al., 2023) and regret bounds depending polynomially on the number of actions in downstream tasks (Noarov et al., 2023; Roth and Shi, 2024). We show that the barrier can be surpassed without any relaxations: we give an efficient randomized prediction algorithm that guarantees $O(\sqrt{T}logT)$ expected MSR. We also discuss the economic utility of calibration by viewing MSR as a decision-theoretic calibration error metric and study its relationship to existing metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinlin Zhu, Xunkai Li, Zhengyu Wu, Di Wu, Miao Hu, Rong-Hua Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Subgraph federated learning (subgraph-FL) is a new distributed paradigm that facilitates the collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client subgraphs. Unfortunately, a significant challenge of subgraph-FL arises from subgraph heterogeneity, which stems from node and topology variation, causing the impaired performance of the global GNN. Despite various studies, they have not yet thoroughly investigated the impact mechanism of subgraph heterogeneity. To this end, we decouple node and topology variation, revealing that they correspond to differences in label distribution and structure homophily. Remarkably, these variations lead to significant differences in the class-wise knowledge reliability of multiple local GNNs, misguiding the model aggregation with varying degrees. Building on this insight, we propose topology-aware data-free knowledge distillation technology (FedTAD), enhancing reliable knowledge transfer from the local model to the global model. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedTAD over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aojun Lu, Tao Feng, Hangjie Yuan, Xiaotian Song, Yanan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Efforts to overcome catastrophic forgetting have primarily centered around developing more effective Continual Learning (CL) methods. In contrast, less attention was devoted to analyzing the role of network architecture design (e.g., network depth, width, and components) in contributing to CL. This paper seeks to bridge this gap between network architecture design and CL, and to present a holistic study on the impact of network architectures on CL. This work considers architecture design at the network scaling level, i.e., width and depth, and also at the network components, i.e., skip connections, global pooling layers, and down-sampling. In both cases, we first derive insights through systematically exploring how architectural designs affect CL. Then, grounded in these insights, we craft a specialized search space for CL and further propose a simple yet effective ArchCraft method to steer a CL-friendly architecture, namely, this method recrafts AlexNet/ResNet into AlexAC/ResAC. Experimental validation across various CL settings and scenarios demonstrates that improved architectures are parameter-efficient, achieving state-of-the-art performance of CL while being 86%, 61%, and 97% more compact in terms of parameters than the naive CL architecture in Task IL and Class IL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianyu Long, Qiyuan Wang, Christos Anagnostopoulos, Daning Bi</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has become popular due to its robustness and avoidance of centralized coordination. In this paradigm, clients actively engage in training by exchanging models with their networked neighbors. However, DFL introduces increased costs in terms of training and communication. Existing methods focus on minimizing communication often overlooking training efficiency and data heterogeneity. To address this gap, we propose a novel \textit{sparse-to-sparser} training scheme: DA-DPFL. DA-DPFL initializes with a subset of model parameters, which progressively reduces during training via \textit{dynamic aggregation} and leads to substantial energy savings while retaining adequate information during critical learning periods.
  Our experiments showcase that DA-DPFL substantially outperforms DFL baselines in test accuracy, while achieving up to $5$ times reduction in energy costs. We provide a theoretical analysis of DA-DPFL's convergence by solidifying its applicability in decentralized and personalized learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing-Xiao Liao, Bo-Jian Hou, Hang-Cheng Dong, Hao Zhang, Xiaoge Zhang, Jinwei Sun, Shiping Zhang, Feng-Lei Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the complexity and diversity of biological neurons, a quadratic neuron is proposed to replace the inner product in the current neuron with a simplified quadratic function. Employing such a novel type of neurons offers a new perspective on developing deep learning. When analyzing quadratic neurons, we find that there exists a function such that a heterogeneous network can approximate it well with a polynomial number of neurons but a purely conventional or quadratic network needs an exponential number of neurons to achieve the same level of error. Encouraged by this inspiring theoretical result on heterogeneous networks, we directly integrate conventional and quadratic neurons in an autoencoder to make a new type of heterogeneous autoencoders. To our best knowledge, it is the first heterogeneous autoencoder that is made of different types of neurons. Next, we apply the proposed heterogeneous autoencoder to unsupervised anomaly detection for tabular data and bearing fault signals. The anomaly detection faces difficulties such as data unknownness, anomaly feature heterogeneity, and feature unnoticeability, which is suitable for the proposed heterogeneous autoencoder. Its high feature representation ability can characterize a variety of anomaly data (heterogeneity), discriminate the anomaly from the normal (unnoticeability), and accurately learn the distribution of normal samples (unknownness). Experiments show that heterogeneous autoencoders perform competitively compared to other state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vitor Cerqueira, Luis Torgo</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant wave height forecasting is a key problem in ocean data analytics. This problem is relevant in several maritime operations, such as managing the passage of vessels or estimating the energy production from waves. In this work, we focus on the prediction of extreme values of significant wave height that can cause coastal disasters. This task is framed as an exceedance probability forecasting problem. Accordingly, we aim to estimate the probability that the significant wave height will exceed a predefined critical threshold. This problem is usually solved using a probabilistic binary classification model. Instead, we propose a novel approach based on a forecasting model. A probabilistic binary forecast streamlines information for decision-making, and point forecasts can provide additional insights into the data dynamics. The proposed method works by converting point forecasts into exceedance probability estimates using the cumulative distribution function. We carried out experiments using data from a buoy placed on the coast of Halifax, Canada. The results suggest that the proposed methodology is better than state-of-the-art approaches for exceedance probability forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Eisenstein, Daniel Andor, Bernd Bohnet, Michael Collins, David Mimno</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable question answering systems should produce not only accurate answers but also rationales that justify their reasoning and allow humans to check their work. But what sorts of rationales are useful and how can we train systems to produce them? We propose a new style of rationale for open-book question answering, called \emph{markup-and-mask}, which combines aspects of extractive and free-text explanations. In the markup phase, the passage is augmented with free-text markup that enables each sentence to stand on its own outside the discourse context. In the masking phase, a sub-span of the marked-up passage is selected. To train a system to produce markup-and-mask rationales without annotations, we leverage in-context learning. Specifically, we generate silver annotated data by sending a series of prompts to a frozen pretrained language model, which acts as a teacher. We then fine-tune a smaller student model by training on the subset of rationales that led to correct answers. The student is "honest" in the sense that it is a pipeline: the rationale acts as a bottleneck between the passage and the answer, while the "untrusted" teacher operates under no such constraints. Thus, we offer a new way to build trustworthy pipeline systems from a combination of end-task annotations and frozen pretrained language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaiva Vasiliauskaite, Nino Antulov-Fantulin</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential equations are a ubiquitous tool to study dynamics, ranging from physical systems to complex systems, where a large number of agents interact through a graph with non-trivial topological features. Data-driven approximations of differential equations present a promising alternative to traditional methods for uncovering a model of dynamical systems, especially in complex systems that lack explicit first principles. A recently employed machine learning tool for studying dynamics is neural networks, which can be used for data-driven solution finding or discovery of differential equations. Specifically for the latter task, however, deploying deep learning models in unfamiliar settings - such as predicting dynamics in unobserved state space regions or on novel graphs - can lead to spurious results. Focusing on complex systems whose dynamics are described with a system of first-order differential equations coupled through a graph, we show that extending the model's generalizability beyond traditional statistical learning theory limits is feasible. However, achieving this advanced level of generalization requires neural network models to conform to fundamental assumptions about the dynamical model. Additionally, we propose a statistical significance test to assess prediction quality during inference, enabling the identification of a neural network's confidence level in its predictions.</p>

Our result places no assumptions on the distribution of the data, on the properties of the base algorithm, or on the dimensionality of the covariates. Our guarantee applies to many variants of bagging and is optimal up to a constant.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihua Wang, Mingzhe Chen, Cong Shen, Changchuan Yin, Christopher G. Brinton</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, the performance optimization of federated learning (FL), when deployed over a realistic wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system with digital modulation and over-the-air computation (AirComp) is studied. In particular, a MIMO system is considered in which edge devices transmit their local FL models (trained using their locally collected data) to a parameter server (PS) using beamforming to maximize the number of devices scheduled for transmission. The PS, acting as a central controller, generates a global FL model using the received local FL models and broadcasts it back to all devices. Due to the limited bandwidth in a wireless network, AirComp is adopted to enable efficient wireless data aggregation. However, fading of wireless channels can produce aggregate distortions in an AirComp-based FL scheme. To tackle this challenge, we propose a modified federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm that combines digital modulation with AirComp to mitigate wireless fading while ensuring the communication efficiency. This is achieved by a joint transmit and receive beamforming design, which is formulated as an optimization problem to dynamically adjust the beamforming matrices based on current FL model parameters so as to minimize the transmitting error and ensure the FL performance. To achieve this goal, we first analytically characterize how the beamforming matrices affect the performance of the FedAvg in different iterations. Based on this relationship, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to estimate the local FL models of all devices and adjust the beamforming matrices at the PS for future model transmission. The algorithmic advantages and improved performance of the proposed methodologies are demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Kumar, Miguel A. Guirao Aguilera, Reza Tourani, Satyajayant Misra</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing popularity of Machine Learning (ML) has led to its deployment in various sensitive domains, which has resulted in significant research focused on ML security and privacy. However, in some applications, such as Augmented/Virtual Reality, integrity verification of the outsourced ML tasks is more critical--a facet that has not received much attention. Existing solutions, such as multi-party computation and proof-based systems, impose significant computation overhead, which makes them unfit for real-time applications. We propose Fides, a novel framework for real-time integrity validation of ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) inference. Fides features a novel and efficient distillation technique--Greedy Distillation Transfer Learning--that dynamically distills and fine-tunes a space and compute-efficient verification model for verifying the corresponding service model while running inside a trusted execution environment. Fides features a client-side attack detection model that uses statistical analysis and divergence measurements to identify, with a high likelihood, if the service model is under attack. Fides also offers a re-classification functionality that predicts the original class whenever an attack is identified. We devised a generative adversarial network framework for training the attack detection and re-classification models. The evaluation shows that Fides achieves an accuracy of up to 98% for attack detection and 94% for re-classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Bermejo, Borja Aizpurua, Roman Orus</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning algorithms, both in their classical and quantum versions, heavily rely on optimization algorithms based on gradients, such as gradient descent and alike. The overall performance is dependent on the appearance of local minima and barren plateaus, which slow-down calculations and lead to non-optimal solutions. In practice, this results in dramatic computational and energy costs for AI applications. In this paper we introduce a generic strategy to accelerate and improve the overall performance of such methods, allowing to alleviate the effect of barren plateaus and local minima. Our method is based on coordinate transformations, somehow similar to variational rotations, adding extra directions in parameter space that depend on the cost function itself, and which allow to explore the configuration landscape more efficiently. The validity of our method is benchmarked by boosting a number of quantum machine learning algorithms, getting a very significant improvement in their performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shauli Ravfogel, Valentina Pyatkin, Amir DN Cohen, Avshalom Manevich, Yoav Goldberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying texts with a given semantics is central for many information seeking scenarios. Similarity search over vector embeddings appear to be central to this ability, yet the similarity reflected in current text embeddings is corpus-driven, and is inconsistent and sub-optimal for many use cases. What, then, is a good notion of similarity for effective retrieval of text?
  We identify the need to search for texts based on abstract descriptions of their content, and the corresponding notion of \emph{description based similarity}. We demonstrate the inadequacy of current text embeddings and propose an alternative model that significantly improves when used in standard nearest neighbor search. The model is trained using positive and negative pairs sourced through prompting a LLM, demonstrating how data from LLMs can be used for creating new capabilities not immediately possible using the original model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Alkhalefi, Georgios Leontidis, Mingjun Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning algorithms (SSL) based on instance discrimination have shown promising results, performing competitively or even outperforming supervised learning counterparts in some downstream tasks. Such approaches employ data augmentation to create two views of the same instance (i.e., positive pairs) and encourage the model to learn good representations by attracting these views closer in the embedding space without collapsing to the trivial solution. However, data augmentation is limited in representing positive pairs, and the repulsion process between the instances during contrastive learning may discard important features for instances that have similar categories. To address this issue, we propose an approach to identify those images with similar semantic content and treat them as positive instances, thereby reducing the chance of discarding important features during representation learning and increasing the richness of the latent representation. Our approach is generic and could work with any self-supervised instance discrimination frameworks such as MoCo and SimSiam. To evaluate our method, we run experiments on three benchmark datasets: ImageNet, STL-10 and CIFAR-10 with different instance discrimination SSL approaches. The experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all three datasets; for instance, we improve upon the vanilla MoCo-v2 by 4.1% on ImageNet under a linear evaluation protocol over 800 epochs. We also report results on semi-supervised learning, transfer learning on downstream tasks, and object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moon Ye-Bin, Nam Hyeon-Woo, Wonseok Choi, Nayeong Kim, Suha Kwak, Tae-Hyun Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Data imbalance in training data often leads to biased predictions from trained models, which in turn causes ethical and social issues. A straightforward solution is to carefully curate training data, but given the enormous scale of modern neural networks, this is prohibitively labor-intensive and thus impractical. Inspired by recent developments in generative models, this paper explores the potential of synthetic data to address the data imbalance problem. To be specific, our method, dubbed SYNAuG, leverages synthetic data to equalize the unbalanced distribution of training data. Our experiments demonstrate that, although a domain gap between real and synthetic data exists, training with SYNAuG followed by fine-tuning with a few real samples allows to achieve impressive performance on diverse tasks with different data imbalance issues, surpassing existing task-specific methods for the same purpose.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Sebasti\'an, Carlos E. Gonz\'alez-Guill\'en, Jes\'us Juan</p>
<p>Abstract: The study of Day-Ahead prices in the electricity market is one of the most popular problems in time series forecasting. Previous research has focused on employing increasingly complex learning algorithms to capture the sophisticated dynamics of the market. However, there is a threshold where increased complexity fails to yield substantial improvements. In this work, we propose an alternative approach by introducing an adaptive standardisation to mitigate the effects of dataset shifts that commonly occur in the market. By doing so, learning algorithms can prioritize uncovering the true relationship between the target variable and the explanatory variables. We investigate five distinct markets, including two novel datasets, previously unexplored in the literature. These datasets provide a more realistic representation of the current market context, that conventional datasets do not show. The results demonstrate a significant improvement across all five markets using the widely accepted learning algorithms in the literature (LEAR and DNN). In particular, the combination of the proposed methodology with the methodology previously presented in the literature obtains the best results. This significant advancement unveils new lines of research in this field, highlighting the potential of adaptive transformations in enhancing the performance of forecasting models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Luttner</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the "Uncertainty-aware Mixture of Experts" (uMoE), a novel solution aimed at addressing aleatoric uncertainty within Neural Network (NN) based predictive models. While existing methodologies primarily concentrate on managing uncertainty during inference, uMoE uniquely embeds uncertainty into the training phase. Employing a "Divide and Conquer" strategy, uMoE strategically partitions the uncertain input space into more manageable subspaces. It comprises Expert components, individually trained on their respective subspace uncertainties. Overarching the Experts, a Gating Unit, leveraging additional information regarding the distribution of uncertain in-puts across these subspaces, dynamically adjusts the weighting to minimize deviations from ground truth. Our findings demonstrate the superior performance of uMoE over baseline methods in effectively managing data uncertainty. Furthermore, through a comprehensive robustness analysis, we showcase its adaptability to varying uncertainty levels and propose optimal threshold parameters. This innovative approach boasts broad applicability across diverse da-ta-driven domains, including but not limited to biomedical signal processing, autonomous driving, and production quality control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Experimental particle physics uses machine learning for many of tasks, where one application is to classify signal and background events. The classification can be used to bin an analysis region to enhance the expected significance for a mass resonance search. In natural language processing, one of the leading neural network architectures is the transformer. In this work, an event classifier transformer is proposed to bin an analysis region, in which the network is trained with special techniques. The techniques developed here can enhance the significance and reduce the correlation between the network's output and the reconstructed mass. It is found that this trained network can perform better than boosted decision trees and feed-forward networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengfan Zhou, Qianyu Zhou, Bangjie Yin, Hui Zheng, Xuequan Lu, Lizhuang Ma, Hefei Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) systems can be easily deceived by adversarial examples that manipulate benign face images through imperceptible perturbations. Adversarial attacks on FR encompass two types: impersonation (targeted) attacks and dodging (untargeted) attacks. Previous methods often achieve a successful impersonation attack on FR; However, it does not necessarily guarantee a successful dodging attack on FR in the black-box setting. In this paper, our key insight is that the generation of adversarial examples should perform both impersonation and dodging attacks simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel attack method termed as Adversarial Pruning (Adv-Pruning), to fine-tune existing adversarial examples to enhance their dodging capabilities while preserving their impersonation capabilities. Adv-Pruning consists of Priming, Pruning, and Restoration stages. Concretely, we propose Adversarial Priority Quantification to measure the region-wise priority of original adversarial perturbations, identifying and releasing those with minimal impact on absolute model output variances. Then, Biased Gradient Adaptation is presented to adapt the adversarial examples to traverse the decision boundaries of both the attacker and victim by adding perturbations favoring dodging attacks on the vacated regions, preserving the prioritized features of the original perturbations while boosting dodging performance. As a result, we can maintain the impersonation capabilities of original adversarial examples while effectively enhancing dodging capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berk Atil, Mahsa Sheikhi Karizaki, Rebecca J. Passonneau</p>
<p>Abstract: With an increasing focus in STEM education on critical thinking skills, science writing plays an ever more important role in curricula that stress inquiry skills. A recently published dataset of two sets of college level lab reports from an inquiry-based physics curriculum relies on analytic assessment rubrics that utilize multiple dimensions, specifying subject matter knowledge and general components of good explanations. Each analytic dimension is assessed on a 6-point scale, to provide detailed feedback to students that can help them improve their science writing skills. Manual assessment can be slow, and difficult to calibrate for consistency across all students in large classes. While much work exists on automated assessment of open-ended questions in STEM subjects, there has been far less work on long-form writing such as lab reports. We present an end-to-end neural architecture that has separate verifier and assessment modules, inspired by approaches to Open Domain Question Answering (OpenQA). VerAs first verifies whether a report contains any content relevant to a given rubric dimension, and if so, assesses the relevant sentences. On the lab reports, VerAs outperforms multiple baselines based on OpenQA systems or Automated Essay Scoring (AES). VerAs also performs well on an analytic rubric for middle school physics essays.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Nazhat Abdullah, Tarkan Aydin</p>
<p>Abstract: The Attention mechanism is the main component of the Transformer architecture, and since its introduction, it has led to significant advancements in Deep Learning that span many domains and multiple tasks. The Attention Mechanism was utilized in Computer Vision as the Vision Transformer ViT, and its usage has expanded into many tasks in the vision domain, such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and image generation. While this mechanism is very expressive and capable, it comes with the drawback of being computationally expensive and requiring datasets of considerable size for effective optimization. To address these shortcomings, many designs have been proposed in the literature to reduce the computational burden and alleviate the data size requirements. Examples of such attempts in the vision domain are the MLP-Mixer, the Conv-Mixer, the Perciver-IO, and many more. This paper introduces a new computational block as an alternative to the standard ViT block that reduces the compute burdens by replacing the normal Attention layers with a Network in Network structure that enhances the static approach of the MLP Mixer with a dynamic system of learning an element-wise gating function by a token mixing process. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed design provides better performance than the baseline architectures on multiple datasets applied in the image classification task of the vision domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a generative artificial intelligence approach to probabilistic forecasting of electricity market signals, such as real-time locational marginal prices and area control error signals. Inspired by the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series, we propose a weak innovation autoencoder architecture and a novel deep learning algorithm that extracts the canonical independent and identically distributed innovation sequence of the time series, from which future time series samples are generated. The validity of the proposed approach is established by proving that, under ideal training conditions, the generated samples have the same conditional probability distribution as that of the ground truth. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for self-scheduled resources such as battery storage participants, (ii) interregional price spread forecasting for virtual bidders in interchange markets, and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed generative forecaster over leading classical and modern machine learning techniques under both probabilistic and point forecasting metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers have widely adopted attention networks for sequence mixing and MLPs for channel mixing, playing a pivotal role in achieving breakthroughs across domains. However, recent literature highlights issues with attention networks, including low inductive bias and quadratic complexity concerning input sequence length. State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and others (Hippo, Global Convolutions, liquid S4, LRU, Mega, and Mamba), have emerged to address the above issues to help handle longer sequence lengths. Mamba, while being the state-of-the-art SSM, has a stability issue when scaled to large networks for computer vision datasets. We propose SiMBA, a new architecture that introduces Einstein FFT (EinFFT) for channel modeling by specific eigenvalue computations and uses the Mamba block for sequence modeling. Extensive performance studies across image and time-series benchmarks demonstrate that SiMBA outperforms existing SSMs, bridging the performance gap with state-of-the-art transformers. Notably, SiMBA establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art SSM on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks such as Stanford Car and Flower as well as task learning benchmarks as well as seven time series benchmark datasets.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09779">A replica analysis of under-bagging</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Takashi Takahashi</p>
<p>Abstract: Under-bagging (UB), which combines under sampling and bagging, is a popular ensemble learning method for training classifiers on an imbalanced data. Using bagging to reduce the increased variance caused by the reduction in sample size due to under sampling is a natural approach. However, it has recently been pointed out that in generalized linear models, naive bagging, which does not consider the class imbalance structure, and ridge regularization can produce the same results. Therefore, it is not obvious whether it is better to use UB, which requires an increased computational cost proportional to the number of under-sampled data sets, when training linear models. Given such a situation, in this study, we heuristically derive a sharp asymptotics of UB and use it to compare with several other standard methods for learning from imbalanced data, in the scenario where a linear classifier is trained from a two-component mixture data. The methods compared include the under-sampling (US) method, which trains a model using a single realization of the subsampled data, and the simple weighting (SW) method, which trains a model with a weighted loss on the entire data. It is shown that the performance of UB is improved by increasing the size of the majority class while keeping the size of the minority fixed, even though the class imbalance can be large, especially when the size of the minority class is small. This is in contrast to US, whose performance does not change as the size of the majority class increases, and SW, whose performance decreases as the imbalance increases. These results are different from the case of the naive bagging when training generalized linear models without considering the structure of the class imbalance, indicating the intrinsic difference between the ensembling and the direct regularization on the parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the problem of private vector mean estimation in the shuffle model of privacy where $n$ users each have a unit vector $v^{(i)} \in\mathbb{R}^d$. We propose a new multi-message protocol that achieves the optimal error using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\min(n\varepsilon^2,d)\right)$ messages per user. Moreover, we show that any (unbiased) protocol that achieves optimal error requires each user to send $\Omega(\min(n\varepsilon^2,d)/\log(n))$ messages, demonstrating the optimality of our message complexity up to logarithmic factors. Additionally, we study the single-message setting and design a protocol that achieves mean squared error $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/(d+2)}\varepsilon^{-4/(d+2)})$. Moreover, we show that any single-message protocol must incur mean squared error $\Omega(dn^{d/(d+2)})$, showing that our protocol is optimal in the standard setting where $\varepsilon = \Theta(1)$. Finally, we study robustness to malicious users and show that malicious users can incur large additive error with a single shuffler.</p>

The technologies of interacting with data particularly have an important entanglement with LLMs as efficient and intuitive data interactions are paramount. In this paper, we present DB-GPT, a revolutionary and product-ready Python library that integrates LLMs into traditional data interaction tasks to enhance user experience and accessibility. DB-GPT is designed to understand data interaction tasks described by natural language and provide context-aware responses powered by LLMs, making it an indispensable tool for users ranging from novice to expert. Its system design supports deployment across local, distributed, and cloud environments. Beyond handling basic data interaction tasks like Text-to-SQL with LLMs, it can handle complex tasks like generative data analysis through a Multi-Agents framework and the Agentic Workflow Expression Language (AWEL). The Service-oriented Multi-model Management Framework (SMMF) ensures data privacy and security, enabling users to employ DB-GPT with private LLMs. Additionally, DB-GPT offers a series of product-ready features designed to enable users to integrate DB-GPT within their product environments easily.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawei Zhu, Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Furu Wei, Sujian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding models play a pivot role in modern NLP applications such as IR and RAG. While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens, embedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k tokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as legal contracts. This paper explores context window extension of existing embedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional training. First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for long context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark. LongEmbed comprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks, featuring documents of varying length and dispersed target information. Benchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models. Based on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window extension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the context window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of their original context being 512 or beyond 4k. Furthermore, for models employing absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further fine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving original behavior for short inputs. For models using rotary position embedding (RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific methods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for context window extension.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Jin, Zili Zhang, Xuanlin Jiang, Fangyue Liu, Xin Liu, Xuanzhe Liu, Xin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks by integrating the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and external knowledge databases. However, RAG introduces long sequence generation and leads to high computation and memory costs. We propose RAGCache, a novel multilevel dynamic caching system tailored for RAG. Our analysis benchmarks current RAG systems, pinpointing the performance bottleneck (i.e., long sequence due to knowledge injection) and optimization opportunities (i.e., caching knowledge's intermediate states). Based on these insights, we design RAGCache, which organizes the intermediate states of retrieved knowledge in a knowledge tree and caches them in the GPU and host memory hierarchy. RAGCache proposes a replacement policy that is aware of LLM inference characteristics and RAG retrieval patterns. It also dynamically overlaps the retrieval and inference steps to minimize the end-to-end latency. We implement RAGCache and evaluate it on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference system and Faiss, a state-of-the-art vector database. The experimental results show that RAGCache reduces the time to first token (TTFT) by up to 4x and improves the throughput by up to 2.1x compared to vLLM integrated with Faiss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchi Liu, Lei Wang, Yuli Zou, James Zou, Liang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Model calibration aims to align confidence with prediction correctness. The Cross-Entropy (CE) loss is widely used for calibrator training, which enforces the model to increase confidence on the ground truth class. However, we find the CE loss has intrinsic limitations. For example, for a narrow misclassification, a calibrator trained by the CE loss often produces high confidence on the wrongly predicted class (e.g., a test sample is wrongly classified and its softmax score on the ground truth class is around 0.4), which is undesirable. In this paper, we propose a new post-hoc calibration objective derived from the aim of calibration. Intuitively, the proposed objective function asks that the calibrator decrease model confidence on wrongly predicted samples and increase confidence on correctly predicted samples. Because a sample itself has insufficient ability to indicate correctness, we use its transformed versions (e.g., rotated, greyscaled and color-jittered) during calibrator training. Trained on an in-distribution validation set and tested with isolated, individual test samples, our method achieves competitive calibration performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets compared with the state of the art. Further, our analysis points out the difference between our method and commonly used objectives such as CE loss and mean square error loss, where the latters sometimes deviates from the calibration aim.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13591">MARVEL: Multidimensional Abstraction and Reasoning through Visual Evaluation and Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Jiang, Jiarui Zhang, Kexuan Sun, Zhivar Sourati, Kian Ahrabian, Kaixin Ma, Filip Ilievski, Jay Pujara</p>
<p>Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown significant progress on many popular visual reasoning benchmarks, whether they possess abstract visual reasoning abilities remains an open question. Similar to the Sudoku puzzles, abstract visual reasoning (AVR) problems require finding high-level patterns (e.g., repetition constraints) that control the input shapes (e.g., digits) in a specific task configuration (e.g., matrix). However, existing AVR benchmarks only considered a limited set of patterns (addition, conjunction), input shapes (rectangle, square), and task configurations (3 by 3 matrices). To evaluate MLLMs' reasoning abilities comprehensively, we introduce MARVEL, a multidimensional AVR benchmark with 770 puzzles composed of six core knowledge patterns, geometric and abstract shapes, and five different task configurations. To inspect whether the model accuracy is grounded in perception and reasoning, MARVEL complements the general AVR question with perception questions in a hierarchical evaluation framework. We conduct comprehensive experiments on MARVEL with nine representative MLLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our experiments reveal that all models show near-random performance on the AVR question, with significant performance gaps (40%) compared to humans across all patterns and task configurations. Further analysis of perception questions reveals that MLLMs struggle to comprehend the visual features (near-random performance) and even count the panels in the puzzle ( <45%), hindering their ability for abstract reasoning. We release our entire code and dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Ye, Zeqian Ju, Haohe Liu, Xu Tan, Jianyi Chen, Yiwen Lu, Peiwen Sun, Jiahao Pan, Weizhen Bian, Shulin He, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo, Wei Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis has been significantly advanced by language models and diffusion models. However, the generation process of both methods is slow and computationally intensive. Efficient speech synthesis using a lower computing budget to achieve quality on par with previous work remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present FlashSpeech, a large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis system with approximately 5\% of the inference time compared with previous work. FlashSpeech is built on the latent consistency model and applies a novel adversarial consistency training approach that can train from scratch without the need for a pre-trained diffusion model as the teacher. Furthermore, a new prosody generator module enhances the diversity of prosody, making the rhythm of the speech sound more natural. The generation processes of FlashSpeech can be achieved efficiently with one or two sampling steps while maintaining high audio quality and high similarity to the audio prompt for zero-shot speech generation. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of FlashSpeech. Notably, FlashSpeech can be about 20 times faster than other zero-shot speech synthesis systems while maintaining comparable performance in terms of voice quality and similarity. Furthermore, FlashSpeech demonstrates its versatility by efficiently performing tasks like voice conversion, speech editing, and diverse speech sampling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandra Leticia Ju\'arez Osorio, Mayra Alejandra Rivera Ruiz, Andres Mendez-Vazquez, Eduardo Rodriguez-Tello</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we apply 1D quantum convolution to address the task of time series forecasting. By encoding multiple points into the quantum circuit to predict subsequent data, each point becomes a feature, transforming the problem into a multidimensional one. Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15419">Using Deep Learning to Identify Initial Error Sensitivity of ENSO Forecasts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kinya Toride, Matthew Newman, Andrew Hoell, Antonietta Capotondi, Jakob Schl\"or, Dillon Amaya</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a hybrid method that integrates deep learning with model-analog forecasting, a straightforward yet effective approach that generates forecasts from similar initial climate states in a repository of model simulations. This hybrid framework employs a convolutional neural network to estimate state-dependent weights to identify analog states. The advantage of our method lies in its physical interpretability, offering insights into initial-error-sensitive regions through estimated weights and the ability to trace the physically-based temporal evolution of the system through analog forecasting. We evaluate our approach using the Community Earth System Model Version 2 Large Ensemble to forecast the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on a seasonal-to-annual time scale. Results show a 10% improvement in forecasting sea surface temperature anomalies over the equatorial Pacific at 9-12 months leads compared to the traditional model-analog technique. Furthermore, our hybrid model demonstrates improvements in boreal winter and spring initialization when evaluated against a reanalysis dataset. Our deep learning-based approach reveals state-dependent sensitivity linked to various seasonally varying physical processes, including the Pacific Meridional Modes, equatorial recharge oscillator, and stochastic wind forcing. Notably, disparities emerge in the sensitivity associated with El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na events. We find that sea surface temperature over the tropical Pacific plays a more crucial role in El Ni\~no forecasting, while zonal wind stress over the same region exhibits greater significance in La Ni\~na prediction. This approach has broad implications for forecasting diverse climate phenomena, including regional temperature and precipitation, which are challenging for the traditional model-analog forecasting method.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15510">NeuraChip: Accelerating GNN Computations with a Hash-based Decoupled Spatial Accelerator</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustubh Shivdikar, Nicolas Bohm Agostini, Malith Jayaweera, Gilbert Jonatan, Jose L. Abellan, Ajay Joshi, John Kim, David Kaeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as a formidable tool for processing non-euclidean data across various domains, ranging from social network analysis to bioinformatics. Despite their effectiveness, their adoption has not been pervasive because of scalability challenges associated with large-scale graph datasets, particularly when leveraging message passing.
  To tackle these challenges, we introduce NeuraChip, a novel GNN spatial accelerator based on Gustavson's algorithm. NeuraChip decouples the multiplication and addition computations in sparse matrix multiplication. This separation allows for independent exploitation of their unique data dependencies, facilitating efficient resource allocation. We introduce a rolling eviction strategy to mitigate data idling in on-chip memory as well as address the prevalent issue of memory bloat in sparse graph computations. Furthermore, the compute resource load balancing is achieved through a dynamic reseeding hash-based mapping, ensuring uniform utilization of computing resources agnostic of sparsity patterns. Finally, we present NeuraSim, an open-source, cycle-accurate, multi-threaded, modular simulator for comprehensive performance analysis.
  Overall, NeuraChip presents a significant improvement, yielding an average speedup of 22.1x over Intel's MKL, 17.1x over NVIDIA's cuSPARSE, 16.7x over AMD's hipSPARSE, and 1.5x over prior state-of-the-art SpGEMM accelerator and 1.3x over GNN accelerator.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15967">Interpretable Clustering with the Distinguishability Criterion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Turfah, Xiaoquan Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Cluster analysis is a popular unsupervised learning tool used in many disciplines to identify heterogeneous sub-populations within a sample. However, validating cluster analysis results and determining the number of clusters in a data set remains an outstanding problem. In this work, we present a global criterion called the Distinguishability criterion to quantify the separability of identified clusters and validate inferred cluster configurations. Our computational implementation of the Distinguishability criterion corresponds to the Bayes risk of a randomized classifier under the 0-1 loss. We propose a combined loss function-based computational framework that integrates the Distinguishability criterion with many commonly used clustering procedures, such as hierarchical clustering, k-means, and finite mixture models. We present these new algorithms as well as the results from comprehensive data analysis based on simulation studies and real data applications.</p>
