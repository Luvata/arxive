<p><b>Authors:</b> Austin Xu, Srijan Bansal, Yifei Ming, Semih Yavuz, Shafiq Joty</p>
<p>Abstract: The large language model (LLM)-as-judge paradigm has been used to meet the demand for a cheap, reliable, and fast evaluation of model outputs during AI system development and post-deployment monitoring. While judge models -- LLMs finetuned to specialize in assessing and critiquing model outputs -- have been touted as general purpose evaluators, they are typically evaluated only on non-contextual scenarios, such as instruction following. The omission of contextual settings -- those where external information is used as context to generate an output -- is surprising given the increasing prevalence of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases. Contextual assessment is uniquely challenging, as evaluation often depends on practitioner priorities, leading to conditional evaluation criteria (e.g., comparing responses based on factuality and then considering completeness if they are equally factual). To address the gap, we propose ContextualJudgeBench, a judge benchmark with 2,000 challenging response pairs across eight splits inspired by real-world contextual evaluation scenarios. We build our benchmark with a multi-pronged data construction pipeline that leverages both existing human annotations and model-based perturbations. Our comprehensive study across 11 judge models and 9 general purpose models, reveals that the contextual information and its assessment criteria present a significant challenge to even state-of-the-art models. For example, OpenAI's o1, the best-performing model, barely reaches 55% consistent accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15664">Enhancing Pancreatic Cancer Staging with Large Language Models: The Role of Retrieval-Augmented Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hisashi Johno, Yuki Johno, Akitomo Amakawa, Junichi Sato, Ryota Tozuka, Atsushi Komaba, Hiroaki Watanabe, Hiroki Watanabe, Chihiro Goto, Hiroyuki Morisaka, Hiroshi Onishi, Kazunori Nakamoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technology to enhance the functionality and reliability of large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant information from reliable external knowledge (REK). RAG has gained interest in radiology, and we previously reported the utility of NotebookLM, an LLM with RAG (RAG-LLM), for lung cancer staging. However, since the comparator LLM differed from NotebookLM's internal model, it remained unclear whether its advantage stemmed from RAG or inherent model differences. To better isolate RAG's impact and assess its utility across different cancers, we compared NotebookLM with its internal LLM, Gemini 2.0 Flash, in a pancreatic cancer staging experiment.
  Materials and Methods: A summary of Japan's pancreatic cancer staging guidelines was used as REK. We compared three groups - REK+/RAG+ (NotebookLM with REK), REK+/RAG- (Gemini 2.0 Flash with REK), and REK-/RAG- (Gemini 2.0 Flash without REK) - in staging 100 fictional pancreatic cancer cases based on CT findings. Staging criteria included TNM classification, local invasion factors, and resectability classification. In REK+/RAG+, retrieval accuracy was quantified based on the sufficiency of retrieved REK excerpts.
  Results: REK+/RAG+ achieved a staging accuracy of 70%, outperforming REK+/RAG- (38%) and REK-/RAG- (35%). For TNM classification, REK+/RAG+ attained 80% accuracy, exceeding REK+/RAG- (55%) and REK-/RAG- (50%). Additionally, REK+/RAG+ explicitly presented retrieved REK excerpts, achieving a retrieval accuracy of 92%.
  Conclusion: NotebookLM, a RAG-LLM, outperformed its internal LLM, Gemini 2.0 Flash, in a pancreatic cancer staging experiment, suggesting that RAG may improve LLM's staging accuracy. Furthermore, its ability to retrieve and present REK excerpts provides transparency for physicians, highlighting its applicability for clinical diagnosis and classification.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15718">Am I eligible? Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trial Patient Recruitment: the Patient&#x27;s Point of View</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathilde Aguiar, Pierre Zweigenbaum, Nona Naderi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recruiting patients to participate in clinical trials can be challenging and time-consuming. Usually, participation in a clinical trial is initiated by a healthcare professional and proposed to the patient. Promoting clinical trials directly to patients via online recruitment might help to reach them more efficiently. In this study, we address the case where a patient is initiating their own recruitment process and wants to determine whether they are eligible for a given clinical trial, using their own language to describe their medical profile. To study whether this creates difficulties in the patient trial matching process, we design a new dataset and task, Natural Language Inference for Patient Recruitment (NLI4PR), in which patient language profiles must be matched to clinical trials. We create it by adapting the TREC 2022 Clinical Trial Track dataset, which provides patients' medical profiles, and rephrasing them manually using patient language. We also use the associated clinical trial reports where the patients are either eligible or excluded. We prompt several open-source Large Language Models on our task and achieve from 56.5 to 71.8 of F1 score using patient language, against 64.7 to 73.1 for the same task using medical language. When using patient language, we observe only a small loss in performance for the best model, suggesting that having the patient as a starting point could be adopted to help recruit patients for clinical trials. The corpus and code bases are all freely available on our Github and HuggingFace repositories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heming Zhang, Wenyu Li, Di Huang, Yinjie Tang, Yixin Chen, Philip Payne, Fuhai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that plays a crucial role in information extraction, question answering, and knowledge-based systems. Traditional deep learning-based NER models often struggle with domain-specific generalization and suffer from data sparsity issues. In this work, we introduce Knowledge Graph distilled for Named Entity Recognition (KoGNER), a novel approach that integrates Knowledge Graph (KG) distillation into NER models to enhance entity recognition performance. Our framework leverages structured knowledge representations from KGs to enrich contextual embeddings, thereby improving entity classification and reducing ambiguity in entity detection. KoGNER employs a two-step process: (1) Knowledge Distillation, where external knowledge sources are distilled into a lightweight representation for seamless integration with NER models, and (2) Entity-Aware Augmentation, which integrates contextual embeddings that have been enriched with knowledge graph information directly into GNN, thereby improving the model's ability to understand and represent entity relationships. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KoGNER achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming finetuned NER models and LLMs by a significant margin. These findings suggest that leveraging knowledge graphs as auxiliary information can significantly improve NER accuracy, making KoGNER a promising direction for future research in knowledge-aware NLP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandra DeLucia, Mark Dredze</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstractive multi-document summarization (MDS) is the task of automatically summarizing information in multiple documents, from news articles to conversations with multiple speakers. The training approaches for current MDS models can be grouped into four approaches: end-to-end with special pre-training ("direct"), chunk-then-summarize, extract-then-summarize, and inference with GPT-style models. In this work, we evaluate MDS models across training approaches, domains, and dimensions (reference similarity, quality, and factuality), to analyze how and why models trained on one domain can fail to summarize documents from another (News, Science, and Conversation) in the zero-shot domain transfer setting. We define domain-transfer "failure" as a decrease in factuality, higher deviation from the target, and a general decrease in summary quality. In addition to exploring domain transfer for MDS models, we examine potential issues with applying popular summarization metrics out-of-the-box.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tsunehiko Tanaka, Edgar Simo-Serra</p>
<p>Abstract: Game Description Generation (GDG) is the task of generating a game description written in a Game Description Language (GDL) from natural language text. Previous studies have explored generation methods leveraging the contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs); however, accurately reproducing the game features of the game descriptions remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning of LLMs for GDG (RLGDG). Our training method simultaneously improves grammatical correctness and fidelity to game concepts by introducing both grammar rewards and concept rewards. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy where Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline methods using SFT alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangqing Zhao, Yuhao Zhou, Yupei Ren, Zhe Chen, Chenghao Jia, Fang Zhe, Zhaogaung Long, Shu Liu, Man Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Ancient Chinese text processing presents unique challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its distinct linguistic features, complex structural constraints, and rich cultural context. While existing benchmarks have primarily focused on evaluating comprehension through multiple-choice questions, there remains a critical gap in assessing models' generative capabilities in classical Chinese. We introduce F\`ux\`i, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates both understanding and generation capabilities across 21 diverse tasks. Our benchmark distinguishes itself through three key contributions: (1) balanced coverage of both comprehension and generation tasks, including novel tasks like poetry composition and couplet completion, (2) specialized evaluation metrics designed specifically for classical Chinese text generation, combining rule-based verification with fine-tuned LLM evaluators, and (3) a systematic assessment framework that considers both linguistic accuracy and cultural authenticity. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant performance gaps between understanding and generation tasks, with models achieving promising results in comprehension but struggling considerably in generation tasks, particularly those requiring deep cultural knowledge and adherence to classical formats. Our findings highlight the current limitations in ancient Chinese text processing and provide insights for future model development. The benchmark, evaluation toolkit, and baseline results are publicly available to facilitate research in this domain.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15850">Uncertainty Quantification and Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models: A Survey</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoou Liu, Tiejin Chen, Longchao Da, Chacha Chen, Zhen Lin, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generation, reasoning, and decision-making, enabling their adoption in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and transportation. However, their reliability is a major concern, as they often produce plausible but incorrect responses. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) enhances trustworthiness by estimating confidence in outputs, enabling risk mitigation and selective prediction. However, traditional UQ methods struggle with LLMs due to computational constraints and decoding inconsistencies. Moreover, LLMs introduce unique uncertainty sources, such as input ambiguity, reasoning path divergence, and decoding stochasticity, that extend beyond classical aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. To address this, we introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes UQ methods based on computational efficiency and uncertainty dimensions (input, reasoning, parameter, and prediction uncertainty). We evaluate existing techniques, assess their real-world applicability, and identify open challenges, emphasizing the need for scalable, interpretable, and robust UQ approaches to enhance LLM reliability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15879">Typed-RAG: Type-aware Multi-Aspect Decomposition for Non-Factoid Question Answering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> DongGeon Lee, Ahjeong Park, Hyeri Lee, Hyeonseo Nam, Yunho Maeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-factoid question-answering (NFQA) poses a significant challenge due to its open-ended nature, diverse intents, and the need for multi-aspect reasoning, which renders conventional factoid QA approaches, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), inadequate. Unlike factoid questions, non-factoid questions (NFQs) lack definitive answers and require synthesizing information from multiple sources across various reasoning dimensions. To address these limitations, we introduce Typed-RAG, a type-aware multi-aspect decomposition framework within the RAG paradigm for NFQA. Typed-RAG classifies NFQs into distinct types -- such as debate, experience, and comparison -- and applies aspect-based decomposition to refine retrieval and generation strategies. By decomposing multi-aspect NFQs into single-aspect sub-queries and aggregating the results, Typed-RAG generates more informative and contextually relevant responses. To evaluate Typed-RAG, we introduce Wiki-NFQA, a benchmark dataset covering diverse NFQ types. Experimental results demonstrate that Typed-RAG outperforms baselines, thereby highlighting the importance of type-aware decomposition for effective retrieval and generation in NFQA.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15888">Parameters vs. Context: Fine-Grained Control of Knowledge Reliance in Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Baolong Bi, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Yilong Xu, Junfeng Fang, Lingrui Mei, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge. However, conflicts between parametric knowledge and retrieved context pose challenges, particularly when retrieved information is unreliable or the model's internal knowledge is outdated. In such cases, LLMs struggle to determine whether to rely more on their own parameters or the conflicted context. To address this, we propose **CK-PLUG**, a plug-and-play method for controlling LLMs' reliance on parametric and contextual knowledge. We introduce a novel knowledge consistency metric, Confidence Gain, which detects knowledge conflicts by measuring entropy shifts in token probability distributions after context insertion. CK-PLUG then enables fine-grained control over knowledge preference by adjusting the probability distribution of tokens with negative confidence gain through a single tuning parameter. Experiments demonstrate CK-PLUG's ability to significantly regulate knowledge reliance in counterfactual RAG scenarios while maintaining generation fluency and knowledge accuracy. For instance, on Llama3-8B, memory recall (MR) of RAG response can be adjusted within a broad range (9.9%-71.9%), compared to the baseline of 42.1%. Moreover, CK-PLUG supports adaptive control based on the model's confidence in both internal and external knowledge, achieving consistent performance improvements across various general RAG tasks.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet concerns persist regarding their tendency to reflect or amplify social biases present in their training data. This study introduces a novel evaluation framework to uncover gender biases in LLMs, focusing on their occupational narratives. Unlike previous methods relying on structured scenarios or carefully crafted prompts, our approach leverages free-form storytelling to reveal biases embedded in the models. Systematic analyses show an overrepresentation of female characters across occupations in six widely used LLMs. Additionally, our findings reveal that LLM-generated occupational gender rankings align more closely with human stereotypes than actual labor statistics. These insights underscore the need for balanced mitigation strategies to ensure fairness while avoiding the reinforcement of new stereotypes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiyi Lin, Fukai Zhang, Kai Niu, Hao Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual instruction tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to learn incrementally while retaining past knowledge, whereas existing methods primarily focus on how to retain old knowledge rather than on selecting which new knowledge to learn. In domain-specific contexts, maintaining data quality and managing system constraints remain key challenges. To address these issues, we propose an automated continual instruction tuning framework that dynamically filters incoming data, which identify and reduce redundant data across successive updates. Our approach utilizes a small proxy model for efficient perplexity-based filtering, and updates the proxy to ensure that the filtering criteria remain aligned with the evolving state of the deployed model. Compared to existing static data selection methods, our framework can effectively handle incrementally acquired data and shifting distributions. Additionally, it addresses practical deployment challenges by enabling seamless model updates, supporting version rollback and incorporating automatic checkpoint evaluation. We evaluated the system in real-world medical scenarios. It reduced computational costs by 66.7% and improved model performance, and achieved autonomous updates, thus demonstrating its effectiveness for automatic continual instruction tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyi Liu, Yan Zheng, Rong Cheng, Qiyu Wu, Wei Guo, Fei Ni, Hebin Liang, Yifu Yuan, Hangyu Mao, Fuzheng Zhang, Jianye Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress, yet their capacity for logical ``slow-thinking'' reasoning persists as a critical research frontier. Current inference scaling paradigms suffer from two fundamental constraints: fragmented thought flows compromising logical coherence, and intensively computational complexity that escalates with search space dimensions. To overcome these limitations, we present \textbf{Atomic Reasoner} (\textbf{AR}), a cognitive inference strategy that enables fine-grained reasoning through systematic atomic-level operations. AR decomposes the reasoning process into atomic cognitive units, employing a cognitive routing mechanism to dynamically construct reasoning representations and orchestrate inference pathways. This systematic methodology implements stepwise, structured cognition, which ensures logical coherence while significantly reducing cognitive load, effectively simulating the cognitive patterns observed in human deep thinking processes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate AR's superior reasoning capabilities without the computational burden of exhaustive solution searches, particularly excelling in linguistic logic puzzles. These findings substantiate AR's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' capacity for robust, long-sequence logical reasoning and deliberation.</p>

However, we find some deficiency that influences RL stability and inference efficiency. Thus, we propose Adaptive Group Policy Optimization (AGPO) which contains two simple but effective modifications: a revised advantage estimation method to mitigate zero-variance situations; a length-based reward, incentivizing the model to avoid overthinking. The experiments demonstrate our methods achieve more stable training and comparable or superior performance with significantly fewer tokens in reasoning steps.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in studying cognitive distortions and emotional appraisals from both computational and psychological perspectives. Despite considerable similarities between emotional reappraisal and cognitive reframing as emotion regulation techniques, these concepts have largely been examined in isolation. This research explores the relationship between cognitive distortions and emotional appraisal dimensions, examining their potential connections and relevance for future interdisciplinary studies. Under this pretext, we conduct an exploratory computational study, aimed at investigating the relationship between cognitive distortion and emotional appraisals. We show that the patterns of statistically significant relationships between cognitive distortions and appraisal dimensions vary across different distortion categories, giving rise to distinct appraisal profiles for individual distortion classes. Additionally, we analyze the impact of cognitive restructuring on appraisal dimensions, exemplifying the emotion regulation aspect of cognitive restructuring.</p>

Inhibitor attention employs Manhattan distances and ReLU activations instead of the matrix multiplications and softmax activation of the conventional scaled dot-product attention. This shift offers potential computational and energy savings while maintaining model effectiveness. We propose further adjustments to improve the inhibitor mechanism's training efficiency and evaluate its performance on the DistilBERT architecture. Our knowledge distillation experiments indicate that the modified inhibitor transformer model can achieve competitive performance on standard NLP benchmarks, including General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) and sentiment analysis tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Langming Liu, Haibin Chen, Yuhao Wang, Yujin Yuan, Shilei Liu, Wenbo Su, Xiangyu Zhao, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capabilities across various NLP tasks. Their potential in e-commerce is also substantial, evidenced by practical implementations such as platform search, personalized recommendations, and customer service. One primary concern associated with LLMs is their factuality (e.g., hallucination), which is urgent in e-commerce due to its significant impact on user experience and revenue. Despite some methods proposed to evaluate LLMs' factuality, issues such as lack of reliability, high consumption, and lack of domain expertise leave a gap between effective assessment in e-commerce. To bridge the evaluation gap, we propose ECKGBench, a dataset specifically designed to evaluate the capacities of LLMs in e-commerce knowledge. Specifically, we adopt a standardized workflow to automatically generate questions based on a large-scale knowledge graph, guaranteeing sufficient reliability. We employ the simple question-answering paradigm, substantially improving the evaluation efficiency by the least input and output tokens. Furthermore, we inject abundant e-commerce expertise in each evaluation stage, including human annotation, prompt design, negative sampling, and verification. Besides, we explore the LLMs' knowledge boundaries in e-commerce from a novel perspective. Through comprehensive evaluations of several advanced LLMs on ECKGBench, we provide meticulous analysis and insights into leveraging LLMs for e-commerce.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16022">Corrective In-Context Learning: Evaluating Self-Correction in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mario Sanz-Guerrero, Katharina von der Wense</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has transformed the use of large language models (LLMs) for NLP tasks, enabling few-shot learning by conditioning on labeled examples without finetuning. Despite its effectiveness, ICL is prone to errors, especially for challenging examples. With the goal of improving the performance of ICL, we propose corrective in-context learning (CICL), an approach that incorporates a model's incorrect predictions alongside ground truth corrections into the prompt, aiming to enhance classification accuracy through self-correction. However, contrary to our hypothesis, extensive experiments on text classification tasks demonstrate that CICL consistently underperforms standard ICL, with performance degrading as the proportion of corrections in the prompt increases. Our findings indicate that CICL introduces confusion by disrupting the model's task understanding, rather than refining its predictions. Additionally, we observe that presenting harder examples in standard ICL does not improve performance, suggesting that example difficulty alone may not be a reliable criterion for effective selection. By presenting these negative results, we provide important insights into the limitations of self-corrective mechanisms in LLMs and offer directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihan Yang, Fanghua Ye, Jian Li, Siyu Yuan, Yikai Zhang, Zhaopeng Tu, Xiaolong Li, Deqing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently transformed from text-based assistants to autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, and iteratively improving their actions. While numerical reward signals and verifiers can effectively rank candidate actions, they often provide limited contextual guidance. In contrast, natural language feedback better aligns with the generative capabilities of LLMs, providing richer and more actionable suggestions. However, parsing and implementing this feedback effectively can be challenging for LLM-based agents. In this work, we introduce Critique-Guided Improvement (CGI), a novel two-player framework, comprising an actor model that explores an environment and a critic model that generates detailed nature language feedback. By training the critic to produce fine-grained assessments and actionable revisions, and the actor to utilize these critiques, our approach promotes more robust exploration of alternative strategies while avoiding local optima. Experiments in three interactive environments show that CGI outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin. Notably, even a small critic model surpasses GPT-4 in feedback quality. The resulting actor achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the power of explicit iterative guidance to enhance decision-making in LLM-based agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Kartheek Reddy Kasu, Shankar Biradar, Sunil Saumya</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Deceptive Humor Dataset (DHD), a novel resource for studying humor derived from fabricated claims and misinformation. In an era of rampant misinformation, understanding how humor intertwines with deception is essential. DHD consists of humor-infused comments generated from false narratives, incorporating fabricated claims and manipulated information using the ChatGPT-4o model. Each instance is labeled with a Satire Level, ranging from 1 for subtle satire to 3 for high-level satire and classified into five distinct Humor Categories: Dark Humor, Irony, Social Commentary, Wordplay, and Absurdity. The dataset spans multiple languages including English, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, and their code-mixed variants (Te-En, Hi-En, Ka-En, Ta-En), making it a valuable multilingual benchmark. By introducing DHD, we establish a structured foundation for analyzing humor in deceptive contexts, paving the way for a new research direction that explores how humor not only interacts with misinformation but also influences its perception and spread. We establish strong baselines for the proposed dataset, providing a foundation for future research to benchmark and advance deceptive humor detection models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoyao Yu, Leilei Gan, Yinghao Hu, Bin Wei, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Test-Time Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across various domains and tasks, particularly in reasoning. While these models have shown impressive performance on general language tasks, their effectiveness in specialized fields like legal remains unclear. To address this, we present a preliminary evaluation of LLMs in various legal scenarios, covering both Chinese and English legal tasks. Our analysis includes 9 LLMs and 17 legal tasks, with a focus on newly published and more complex challenges such as multi-defendant legal judgments and legal argument reasoning. Our findings indicate that, despite DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 being among the most powerful models, their legal reasoning capabilities are still lacking. Specifically, these models score below 80\% on seven Chinese legal reasoning tasks and below 80\% on two English legal reasoning tasks. This suggests that, even among the most advanced reasoning models, legal reasoning abilities remain underdeveloped.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Cao, Peifeng Li, Yaxin Fan, Qiaoming Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although existing fashionable generation methods on Incomplete Utterance Rewriting (IUR) can generate coherent utterances, they often result in the inclusion of irrelevant and redundant tokens in rewritten utterances due to their inability to focus on critical tokens in dialogue context. Furthermore, the limited size of the training datasets also contributes to the insufficient training of the IUR model. To address the first issue, we propose a multi-task learning framework EO-IUR (Editing Operation-guided Incomplete Utterance Rewriting) that introduces the editing operation labels generated by sequence labeling module to guide generation model to focus on critical tokens. Furthermore, we introduce a token-level heterogeneous graph to represent dialogues. To address the second issue, we propose a two-dimensional utterance augmentation strategy, namely editing operation-based incomplete utterance augmentation and LLM-based historical utterance augmentation. The experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our EO-IUR outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in both open-domain and task-oriented dialogue.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Goodale, Salvador Mascarenhas, Yair Lakretz</p>
<p>Abstract: Children acquire language despite being exposed to several orders of magnitude less data than large language models require. Meta-learning has been proposed as a way to integrate human-like learning biases into neural-network architectures, combining both the structured generalizations of symbolic models with the scalability of neural-network models. But what does meta-learning exactly imbue the model with? We investigate the meta-learning of formal languages and find that, contrary to previous claims, meta-trained models are not learning simplicity-based priors when meta-trained on datasets organised around simplicity. Rather, we find evidence that meta-training imprints neural mechanisms (such as counters) into the model, which function like cognitive primitives for the network on downstream tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that meta-training on a single formal language can provide as much improvement to a model as meta-training on 5000 different formal languages, provided that the formal language incentivizes the learning of useful neural mechanisms. Taken together, our findings provide practical implications for efficient meta-learning paradigms and new theoretical insights into linking symbolic theories and neural mechanisms.</p>

To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called TEO (\emph{Two-stage approach on Editing Operation}) for IUR, in which the first stage generates editing operations and the second stage rewrites incomplete utterances utilizing the generated editing operations and the dialogue context. Furthermore, an adversarial perturbation strategy is proposed to mitigate cascading errors and exposure bias caused by the inconsistency between training and inference in the second stage. Experimental results on three IUR datasets show that our TEO outperforms the SOTA models significantly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Wei, Shuchi Wu, Ruochen Liu, Xiang Ying, Jingbo Shang, Fangbo Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16094">Cultural Alignment in Large Language Models Using Soft Prompt Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Reem I. Masoud, Martin Ferianc, Philip Treleaven, Miguel Rodrigues</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) alignment conventionally relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning based alignment frameworks. These methods typically require labeled or preference datasets and involve updating model weights to align the LLM with the training objective or reward model. Meanwhile, in social sciences such as cross-cultural studies, factor analysis is widely used to uncover underlying dimensions or latent variables that explain observed patterns in survey data. The non-differentiable nature of these measurements deriving from survey data renders the former alignment methods infeasible for alignment with cultural dimensions. To overcome this, we propose a parameter efficient strategy that combines soft prompt tuning, which freezes the model parameters while modifying the input prompt embeddings, with Differential Evolution (DE), a black-box optimization method for cases where a differentiable objective is unattainable. This strategy ensures alignment consistency without the need for preference data or model parameter updates, significantly enhancing efficiency and mitigating overfitting. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in LLama-3-8B-Instruct's cultural dimensions across multiple regions, outperforming both the Naive LLM and the In-context Learning (ICL) baseline, and effectively bridges computational models with human cultural nuances.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in medical question answering (QA), yet their effectiveness remains predominantly limited to English due to imbalanced multilingual training data and scarce medical resources for low-resource languages. To address this critical language gap in medical QA, we propose Multilingual Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Ranking (MKG-Rank), a knowledge graph-enhanced framework that enables English-centric LLMs to perform multilingual medical QA. Through a word-level translation mechanism, our framework efficiently integrates comprehensive English-centric medical knowledge graphs into LLM reasoning at a low cost, mitigating cross-lingual semantic distortion and achieving precise medical QA across language barriers. To enhance efficiency, we introduce caching and multi-angle ranking strategies to optimize the retrieval process, significantly reducing response times and prioritizing relevant medical knowledge. Extensive evaluations on multilingual medical QA benchmarks across Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Swahili demonstrate that MKG-Rank consistently outperforms zero-shot LLMs, achieving maximum 33.89% increase in accuracy, while maintaining an average retrieval time of only 0.0009 seconds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenbin Qian, Constantin Or\u{a}san, Diptesh Kanojia, F\'elix do Carmo</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) of user-generated content (UGC) involves unique challenges such as checking whether the nuance of emotions from the source are preserved in the target text. Recent studies have proposed emotion-related datasets, frameworks and models to automatically evaluate MT quality of Chinese UGC, without relying on reference translations. However, whether these models are robust to the challenge of preserving emotional nuances has been left largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel method inspired by information theory which generates challenging Chinese homophone words related to emotions, by leveraging the concept of self-information. Our approach generates homophones that were observed to cause translation errors in emotion preservation, and exposes vulnerabilities in MT systems and their evaluation methods when tackling emotional UGC. We evaluate the efficacy of our method using human evaluation for the quality of these generated homophones, and compare it with an existing one, showing that our method achieves higher correlation with human judgments. The generated Chinese homophones, along with their manual translations, are utilized to generate perturbations and to probe the robustness of existing quality evaluation models, including models trained using multi-task learning, fine-tuned variants of multilingual language models, as well as large language models (LLMs). Our results indicate that LLMs with larger size exhibit higher stability and robustness to such perturbations. We release our data and code for reproducibility and further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex-Razvan Ispas, Charles-Elie Simon, Fabien Caspani, Vincent Guigue</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models are prompting us to view more NLP tasks from a generative perspective. At the same time, they offer a new way of accessing information, mainly through the RAG framework. While there have been notable improvements for the autoregressive models, overcoming hallucination in the generated answers remains a continuous problem. A standard solution is to use commercial LLMs, such as GPT4, to evaluate these algorithms. However, such frameworks are expensive and not very transparent. Therefore, we propose a study which demonstrates the interest of open-weight models for evaluating RAG hallucination. We develop a lightweight approach using smaller, quantized LLMs to provide an accessible and interpretable metric that gives continuous scores for the generated answer with respect to their correctness and faithfulness. This score allows us to question decisions' reliability and explore thresholds to develop a new AUC metric as an alternative to correlation with human judgment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shibo Jie, Yehui Tang, Kai Han, Zhi-Hong Deng, Jing Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have already achieved remarkable results on long-text tasks, but the limited GPU memory (VRAM) resources struggle to accommodate the linearly growing demand for key-value (KV) cache as the sequence length increases, which has become a bottleneck for the application of LLMs on long sequences. Existing KV cache compression methods include eviction, merging, or quantization of the KV cache to reduce its size. However, compression results in irreversible information forgetting, potentially affecting the accuracy of subsequent decoding. In this paper, we propose SpeCache, which takes full advantage of the large and easily expandable CPU memory to offload the complete KV cache, and dynamically fetches KV pairs back in each decoding step based on their importance measured by low-bit KV cache copy in VRAM. To avoid inference latency caused by CPU-GPU communication, SpeCache speculatively predicts the KV pairs that the next token might attend to, allowing us to prefetch them before the next decoding step which enables parallelization of prefetching and computation. Experiments on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks verify that SpeCache effectively reduces VRAM usage while avoiding information forgetting for long sequences without re-training, even with a 10x high KV cache compression ratio.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive progress in mathematical reasoning. While data augmentation is promising to enhance mathematical problem-solving ability, current approaches are predominantly limited to instance-level modifications-such as rephrasing or generating syntactic variations-which fail to capture and leverage the intrinsic relational structures inherent in mathematical knowledge. Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, \textbf{MathFusionQA}, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental results demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting performance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while requiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a substantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Shen, Lifu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent findings reveal that much of the knowledge in a Transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) is encoded in its feed-forward (FFN) layers, where each FNN layer can be interpreted as the summation of sub-updates, each corresponding to a weighted column vector from the FFN's value parameter matrix that often encodes human-interpretable concepts. In light of this, we hypothesize that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBRACES, a novel and efficient method that computes relevance scores associated with value vectors in FFN layers and leverages these scores to dynamically adjust the contribution of sub-updates. By optimizing sub-update contributions, LLMBRACES refines the prediction process, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs, much like a 'brace' providing support and stability. Moreover, LLMBRACES can be extended to support conditional control over generation characteristics, such as sentiment, thereby offering fine-grained steering of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments on various LLMs-including Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama2-7B, and Llama3-8B-demonstrate that LLMBRACES outperforms baseline approaches in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings while requiring significantly fewer tunable parameters, up to 75% fewer compared to LoRA. Furthermore, LLMBRACES excels in sentiment-controlled generation and toxicity reduction, highlighting its potential for flexible, controlled text generation across applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks. Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruyi Xu, Guangxuan Xiao, Haofeng Huang, Junxian Guo, Song Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) are vital for real-world applications but suffer high computational costs due to attention's quadratic complexity. Block-sparse attention mitigates this by focusing computation on critical regions, yet existing methods struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency due to costly block importance measurements. In this paper, we introduce XAttention, a plug-and-play framework that dramatically accelerates long-context inference in Transformers models using sparse attention. XAttention's key innovation is the insight that the sum of antidiagonal values (i.e., from the lower-left to upper-right) in the attention matrix provides a powerful proxy for block importance. This allows for precise identification and pruning of non-essential blocks, resulting in high sparsity and dramatically accelerated inference. Across comprehensive evaluations on demanding long-context benchmarks-including RULER and LongBench for language, VideoMME for video understanding, and VBench for video generation. XAttention achieves accuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial computational gains. We demonstrate up to 13.5x acceleration in attention computation. These results underscore XAttention's ability to unlock the practical potential of block sparse attention, paving the way for scalable and efficient deployment of LCTMs in real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuhiro Sasabuchi, Naoki Wake, Atsushi Kanehira, Jun Takamatsu, Katsushi Ikeuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: In human-robot interaction (HRI), the beginning of an interaction is often complex. Whether the robot should communicate with the human is dependent on several situational factors (e.g., the current human's activity, urgency of the interaction, etc.). We test whether large language models (LLM) and vision language models (VLM) can provide solutions to this problem. We compare four different system-design patterns using LLMs and VLMs, and test on a test set containing 84 human-robot situations. The test set mixes several publicly available datasets and also includes situations where the appropriate action to take is open-ended. Our results using the GPT-4o and Phi-3 Vision model indicate that LLMs and VLMs are capable of handling interaction beginnings when the desired actions are clear, however, challenge remains in the open-ended situations where the model must balance between the human and robot situation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amandine M. Caut, Amy Rouillard, Beimnet Zenebe, Matthias Green, \'Ag\'ust P\'almason Morthens, David J. T. Sumpter</p>
<p>Abstract: An important part of data science is the use of visualisations to display data in a way that is easy to digest. Visualisations often rely on underlying statistical or machine learning models -- ranging from basic calculations like category means to advanced methods such as principal component analysis of multidimensional datasets -- to convey insights. We introduce an analogous concept for word descriptions of data, which we call wordalisations. Wordalisations describe data in easy to digest words, without necessarily reporting numerical values from the data. We show how to create wordalisations using large language models, through prompt templates engineered according to a task-agnostic structure which can be used to automatically generate prompts from data. We show how to produce reliable and engaging texts on three application areas: scouting football players, personality tests, and international survey data. Using the model cards framework, we emphasise the importance of clearly stating the model we are imposing on the data when creating the wordalisation, detailing how numerical values are translated into words, incorporating background information into prompts for the large language model, and documenting the limitations of the wordalisations. We argue that our model cards approach is a more appropriate framework for setting best practices in wordalisation of data than performance tests on benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaymari Chua, Chen Wang, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence demonstrates surpassing human performance across real-world tasks, disclosing superhuman capabilities poses challenges for fairness, accountability, and trust. To investigate how transparency impacts attitudes and perceptions, we introduce a grounded and validated set of synthetic personas reflecting diverse fairness concerns and technology acceptance levels. Then we evaluate responses in two contrasting domains: (1) a competitive player in StarCraft II, where strategy and high-skill gameplay often elicit toxic interactions, and (2) a cooperative personal-assistant in providing information. Across numerous interactions spanning persona profiles, we test non-disclosure versus explicit superhuman labelling under controlled game outcomes and usage contexts. Our findings reveal sharp domain-specific effects: in StarCraft II, explicitly labelling AI as superhuman, novice personas who learned of it reported lower toxicity and higher fairness-attributing defeat to advanced skill rather than hidden cheating-whereas expert personas found the disclosure statements irksome but still less deceptive than non-disclosure. Conversely, in the LLM as personal-assistant setting, disclosure of superhuman capabilities improved perceived trustworthiness, though it risked AI overreliance among certain persona segments. We release Dataset X-containing persona cards-including profile attributes, disclosure prompts, and detailed interaction logs, accompanied by reproducible protocols and disclaimers for adapting them to diverse tasks. Our results demonstrate that transparency is not a cure-all: while it reduces suspicion and enhances trust in cooperative contexts, it may inflame resistance or disappointment in competitive domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Loukas Triantafyllopoulos, Dimitris Kalles</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving consensus in group decision-making often involves overcoming significant challenges, particularly in reconciling diverse perspectives and mitigating biases that hinder agreement. Traditional methods relying on human facilitators are often constrained by scalability and efficiency, especially in large-scale, fast-paced discussions. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel framework employing large language models (LLMs) as automated facilitators within a custom-built multi-user chat system. Leveraging cosine similarity as a core metric, this approach evaluates the ability of three state-of-the-art LLMs- ChatGPT 4.0, Mistral Large 2, and AI21 Jamba Instruct- to synthesize consensus proposals that align with participants' viewpoints. Unlike conventional techniques, the system integrates adaptive facilitation strategies, including clarifying misunderstandings, summarizing discussions, and proposing compromises, enabling the LLMs to iteratively refine consensus proposals based on user feedback. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ChatGPT 4.0, which achieves higher alignment with participant opinions, requiring fewer iterations to reach consensus compared to its counterparts. Moreover, analysis reveals the nuanced performance of the models across various sustainability-focused discussion topics, such as climate action, quality education, good health and well-being, and access to clean water and sanitation. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLM-driven facilitation for improving collective decision-making processes and underscore the importance of advancing evaluation metrics and cross-cultural adaptability in future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tharindu Kumarage, Cameron Johnson, Jadie Adams, Lin Ai, Matthias Kirchner, Anthony Hoogs, Joshua Garland, Julia Hirschberg, Arslan Basharat, Huan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational agents, particularly chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), poses a significant risk of social engineering (SE) attacks on social media platforms. SE detection in multi-turn, chat-based interactions is considerably more complex than single-instance detection due to the dynamic nature of these conversations. A critical factor in mitigating this threat is understanding the mechanisms through which SE attacks operate, specifically how attackers exploit vulnerabilities and how victims' personality traits contribute to their susceptibility. In this work, we propose an LLM-agentic framework, SE-VSim, to simulate SE attack mechanisms by generating multi-turn conversations. We model victim agents with varying personality traits to assess how psychological profiles influence susceptibility to manipulation. Using a dataset of over 1000 simulated conversations, we examine attack scenarios in which adversaries, posing as recruiters, funding agencies, and journalists, attempt to extract sensitive information. Based on this analysis, we present a proof of concept, SE-OmniGuard, to offer personalized protection to users by leveraging prior knowledge of the victims personality, evaluating attack strategies, and monitoring information exchanges in conversations to identify potential SE attempts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Cocchi, Nicholas Moratelli, Davide Caffagni, Sara Sarto, Lorenzo Baraldi, Marcella Cornia, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has highlighted the critical roles of both the visual backbone and the underlying language model. While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to billions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and performance remain underexplored. Additionally, inconsistencies in training data and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it difficult to derive optimal design choices. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures. Our analysis systematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4, LLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and instruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and performance. Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a comprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based architectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2. Additional experiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and variations in pre-training datasets. Overall, our results provide insights into the design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation framework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model development.

<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents that navigate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to automate tasks like document editing and file management can greatly enhance computer workflows. While existing research focuses on online settings, desktop environments, critical for many professional and everyday tasks, remain underexplored due to data collection challenges and licensing issues. We introduce UI-Vision, the first comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark for offline, fine-grained evaluation of computer use agents in real-world desktop environments. Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense, high-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI labels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83 software applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to rigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B, including issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning, and complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges in developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as open-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for real-world desktop tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shibo Jie, Yehui Tang, Kai Han, Yitong Li, Duyu Tang, Zhi-Hong Deng, Yunhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) activates only a subset of experts during inference, allowing the model to maintain low inference FLOPs and latency even as the parameter count scales up. However, since MoE dynamically selects the experts, all the experts need to be loaded into VRAM. Their large parameter size still limits deployment, and offloading, which load experts into VRAM only when needed, significantly increase inference latency. To address this, we propose Mixture of Lookup Experts (MoLE), a new MoE architecture that is efficient in both communication and VRAM usage. In MoLE, the experts are Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) during training, taking the output of the embedding layer as input. Before inference, these experts can be re-parameterized as lookup tables (LUTs) that retrieves expert outputs based on input ids, and offloaded to storage devices. Therefore, we do not need to perform expert computations during inference. Instead, we directly retrieve the expert's computation results based on input ids and load them into VRAM, and thus the resulting communication overhead is negligible. Experiments show that, with the same FLOPs and VRAM usage, MoLE achieves inference speeds comparable to dense models and significantly faster than MoE with experts offloading, while maintaining performance on par with MoE.</p>

While now used by millions around the world, a coherent pathway for evaluating the user experience (UX) ChatGPT offers remains missing. In this rapid review (N = 58), I explored how ChatGPT UX has been approached quantitatively so far. I focused on the independent variables (IVs) manipulated, the dependent variables (DVs) measured, and the methods used for measurement. Findings reveal trends, gaps, and emerging consensus in UX assessments. This work offers a first step towards synthesizing existing approaches to measuring ChatGPT UX, urgent trajectories to advance standardization and breadth, and two preliminary frameworks aimed at guiding future research and tool development. I seek to elevate the field of ChatGPT UX by empowering researchers and practitioners in optimizing user interactions with ChatGPT and similar LLM-based systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghan Zhang, Xiting Wang, Fengran Mo, Yeyang Zhou, Wanfu Gao, Kunpeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In large language model (LLM) reasoning, multi-step processes have proven effective for solving complex tasks. However, the depth of exploration can significantly affect the reasoning performance. Existing methods to automatically decide the depth often bring high costs and lack flexibility, and thus undermine the model's reasoning accuracy. To address these issues, we propose Entropy-based Exploration Depth Conduction (Entro-duction), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the exploration depth during multi-step reasoning by monitoring LLM's output entropy and variance entropy. We employ these two metrics to capture the model's current uncertainty and the fluctuation of uncertainty across consecutive reasoning steps. Based on the observed changes, the LLM selects whether to deepen, expand or stop exploration according to the probability. In this way, we balance the reasoning accuracy and exploration effectiveness. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of Entro-duction. We further conduct experiments and analysis on the components of Entro-duction to discuss their contributions to reasoning performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunan Wang, Jijie Li, Bo-Wen Zhang, Liangdong Wang, Guang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) optimizes language models to align with human preferences. Utilizing on-policy samples, generated directly by the policy model, typically results in better performance due to its distribution consistency with the model compared to off-policy samples. This paper identifies the quality of candidate preference samples as another critical factor. While the quality of on-policy data is inherently constrained by the capabilities of the policy model, off-policy data, which can be derived from diverse sources, offers greater potential for quality despite experiencing distribution shifts. However, current research mostly relies on on-policy data and neglects the value of off-policy data in terms of data quality, due to the challenge posed by distribution shift. In this paper, we propose InCo-DPO, an efficient method for synthesizing preference data by integrating on-policy and off-policy data, allowing dynamic adjustments to balance distribution shifts and data quality, thus finding an optimal trade-off. Consequently, InCo-DPO overcomes the limitations of distribution shifts in off-policy data and the quality constraints of on-policy data. We evaluated InCo-DPO with the Alpaca-Eval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms both on-policy and off-policy data but also achieves a state-of-the-art win rate of 60.8 on Arena-Hard with the vanilla DPO using Gemma-2 model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantifying the realism of images remains a challenging problem in the field of artificial intelligence. For example, an image of Albert Einstein holding a smartphone violates common-sense because modern smartphone were invented after Einstein's death. We introduce a novel method for assessing image realism using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our approach is based on the premise that LVLMs may generate hallucinations when confronted with images that defy common sense. Using LVLM to extract atomic facts from these images, we obtain a mix of accurate facts and erroneous hallucinations. We proceed by calculating pairwise entailment scores among these facts, subsequently aggregating these values to yield a singular reality score. This process serves to identify contradictions between genuine facts and hallucinatory elements, signaling the presence of images that violate common sense. Our approach has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot mode on the WHOOPS! dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emil Bakkensen Johansen, Oliver Baumann</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have facilitated autonomous AI agents capable of imitating human-generated content. This technological advancement raises fundamental questions about AI's potential impact on the diversity and democratic value of information ecosystems. Here, we introduce a large-scale simulation framework to examine AI-based imitation in news, a context critically influential for public discourse. By systematically testing two distinct imitation strategies across a range of information environments varying in initial diversity, we demonstrate that AI-generated articles do not uniformly homogenize content. Instead, AI's influence is strongly context-dependent: AI-generated articles can introduce valuable diversity in originally homogeneous news environments, while potentially diminishing diversity in contexts that initially display high heterogeneity. These results illustrate that the baseline diversity of an information space critically shapes AI's impact, challenging assumptions that AI-driven imitation uniformly threatens information diversity. Instead, when information is initially homogeneous, AI-driven imitation can expand perspectives, styles, and topics. This is especially important in news contexts, where information diversity fosters richer public debate by exposing citizens to alternative viewpoints, challenging biases, and preventing narrative monopolies, which is essential for a resilient democracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihang Liu, Chen-Wei Xie, Pandeng Li, Liming Zhao, Longxiang Tang, Yun Zheng, Chuanbin Liu, Hongtao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been challenged by the computational overhead resulting from massive video frames, often alleviated through compression strategies. However, the visual content is not equally contributed to user instructions, existing strategies (\eg, average pool) inevitably lead to the loss of potentially useful information. To tackle this, we propose the Hybrid-level Instruction Injection Strategy for Conditional Token Compression in MLLMs (HICom), utilizing the instruction as a condition to guide the compression from both local and global levels. This encourages the compression to retain the maximum amount of user-focused information while reducing visual tokens to minimize computational burden. Specifically, the instruction condition is injected into the grouped visual tokens at the local level and the learnable tokens at the global level, and we conduct the attention mechanism to complete the conditional compression. From the hybrid-level compression, the instruction-relevant visual parts are highlighted while the temporal-spatial structure is also preserved for easier understanding of LLMs. To further unleash the potential of HICom, we introduce a new conditional pre-training stage with our proposed dataset HICom-248K. Experiments show that our HICom can obtain distinguished video understanding ability with fewer tokens, increasing the performance by 2.43\% average on three multiple-choice QA benchmarks and saving 78.8\% tokens compared with the SOTA method.

<p>Abstract: Prompt-based language models like GPT4 and LLaMa have been used for a wide variety of use cases such as simulating agents, searching for information, or for content analysis. For all of these applications and others, political biases in these models can affect their performance. Several researchers have attempted to study political bias in language models using evaluation suites based on surveys, such as the Political Compass Test (PCT), often finding a particular leaning favored by these models. However, there is some variation in the exact prompting techniques, leading to diverging findings and most research relies on constrained-answer settings to extract model responses. Moreover, the Political Compass Test is not a scientifically valid survey instrument. In this work, we contribute a political bias measured informed by political science theory, building on survey design principles to test a wide variety of input prompts, while taking into account prompt sensitivity. We then prompt 11 different open and commercial models, differentiating between instruction-tuned and non-instruction-tuned models, and automatically classify their political stances from 88,110 responses. Leveraging this dataset, we compute political bias profiles across different prompt variations and find that while PCT exaggerates bias in certain models like GPT3.5, measures of political bias are often unstable, but generally more left-leaning for instruction-tuned models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Yi Lin, Chunhua Liu, Haoyu Gao, Patanamon Thongtanunam, Christoph Treude</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation capabilities but struggle with real-world software engineering tasks, such as revising source code to address code reviews, hindering their practical use. Code review comments are often implicit, ambiguous, and colloquial, requiring models to grasp both code and human intent. This challenge calls for evaluating large language models' ability to bridge both technical and conversational contexts. While existing work has employed the automated code refinement (ACR) task to resolve these comments, current evaluation methods fall short, relying on text matching metrics that provide limited insight into model failures and remain susceptible to training data contamination. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel evaluation benchmark, $\textbf{CodeReviewQA}$ that enables us to conduct fine-grained assessment of model capabilities and mitigate data contamination risks. In CodeReviewQA, we decompose the generation task of code refinement into $\textbf{three essential reasoning steps}$: $\textit{change type recognition}$ (CTR), $\textit{change localisation}$ (CL), and $\textit{solution identification}$ (SI). Each step is reformulated as multiple-choice questions with varied difficulty levels, enabling precise assessment of model capabilities, while mitigating data contamination risks. Our comprehensive evaluation spans 72 recently released large language models on $\textbf{900 manually curated, high-quality examples}$ across nine programming languages. Our results show that CodeReviewQA is able to expose specific model weaknesses in code review comprehension, disentangled from their generative automated code refinement results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scaling architectures have been proven effective for improving Scene Text Recognition (STR), but the individual contribution of vision encoder and text decoder scaling remain under-explored. In this work, we present an in-depth empirical analysis and demonstrate that, contrary to previous observations, scaling the decoder yields significant performance gains, always exceeding those achieved by encoder scaling alone. We also identify label noise as a key challenge in STR, particularly in real-world data, which can limit the effectiveness of STR models. To address this, we propose Cloze Self-Distillation (CSD), a method that mitigates label noise by distilling a student model from context-aware soft predictions and pseudolabels generated by a teacher model. Additionally, we enhance the decoder architecture by introducing differential cross-attention for STR. Our methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 11 benchmarks using only real data, while significantly reducing the parameter size and computational costs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) typically relies on massive computational resources and extensive datasets, limiting accessibility for resource-constrained settings. Our study investigates the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning in small LLMs, focusing on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict constraints: training on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs (48 GB VRAM each) within 24 hours. Adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, we conducted three experiments to explore model behavior and performance. Our results demonstrate rapid reasoning gains - e.g., AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing o1-preview - using only 7,000 samples and a $42 training cost, compared to thousands of dollars for baseline models. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. These findings highlight the efficacy of RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs, offering a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches. We release our code and datasets as open-source resources, providing insights into trade-offs and laying a foundation for scalable, reasoning-capable LLMs in resource-limited environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akhil Perincherry, Jacob Krantz, Stefan Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents are tasked with navigating an unseen environment using natural language instructions. In this work, we study if visual representations of sub-goals implied by the instructions can serve as navigational cues and lead to increased navigation performance. To synthesize these visual representations or imaginations, we leverage a text-to-image diffusion model on landmark references contained in segmented instructions. These imaginations are provided to VLN agents as an added modality to act as landmark cues and an auxiliary loss is added to explicitly encourage relating these with their corresponding referring expressions. Our findings reveal an increase in success rate (SR) of around 1 point and up to 0.5 points in success scaled by inverse path length (SPL) across agents. These results suggest that the proposed approach reinforces visual understanding compared to relying on language instructions alone.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Sun, Han Wang, Dongbai Li, Gang Wang, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC)-the inclusion of benchmark testing samples in the training set-has raised increasing concerns in Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, leading to falsely inflated performance estimates and undermining evaluation reliability. To address this, researchers have proposed various mitigation strategies to update existing benchmarks, including modifying original questions or generating new ones based on them. However, a rigorous examination of the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies remains lacking. In this paper, we design a systematic and controlled pipeline along with two novel metrics-fidelity and contamination resistance-to provide a fine-grained and comprehensive assessment of existing BDC mitigation strategies. Previous assessment methods, such as accuracy drop and accuracy matching, focus solely on aggregate accuracy, often leading to incomplete or misleading conclusions. Our metrics address this limitation by emphasizing question-level evaluation result matching. Extensive experiments with 10 LLMs, 5 benchmarks, 20 BDC mitigation strategies, and 2 contamination scenarios reveal that no existing strategy significantly improves resistance over the vanilla case (i.e., no benchmark update) across all benchmarks, and none effectively balances fidelity and contamination resistance. These findings underscore the urgent need for designing more effective BDC mitigation strategies. Our code repository is available at https://github.com/ASTRAL-Group/BDC_mitigation_assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asaf Yehudai, Lilach Eden, Alan Li, Guy Uziel, Yilun Zhao, Roy Bar-Haim, Arman Cohan, Michal Shmueli-Scheuer</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of LLM-based agents represents a paradigm shift in AI, enabling autonomous systems to plan, reason, use tools, and maintain memory while interacting with dynamic environments. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of evaluation methodologies for these increasingly capable agents. We systematically analyze evaluation benchmarks and frameworks across four critical dimensions: (1) fundamental agent capabilities, including planning, tool use, self-reflection, and memory; (2) application-specific benchmarks for web, software engineering, scientific, and conversational agents; (3) benchmarks for generalist agents; and (4) frameworks for evaluating agents. Our analysis reveals emerging trends, including a shift toward more realistic, challenging evaluations with continuously updated benchmarks. We also identify critical gaps that future research must address-particularly in assessing cost-efficiency, safety, and robustness, and in developing fine-grained, and scalable evaluation methods. This survey maps the rapidly evolving landscape of agent evaluation, reveals the emerging trends in the field, identifies current limitations, and proposes directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinliang Frederick Zhang, Carter Blum, Temma Choji, Shalin Shah, Alakananda Vempala</p>
<p>Abstract: Structural extraction of events within discourse is critical since it avails a deeper understanding of communication patterns and behavior trends. Event argument extraction (EAE), at the core of event-centric understanding, is the task of identifying role-specific text spans (i.e., arguments) for a given event. Document-level EAE (DocEAE) focuses on arguments that are scattered across an entire document. In this work, we explore open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for DocEAE, and propose ULTRA, a hierarchical framework that extracts event arguments more cost-effectively. Further, it alleviates the positional bias issue intrinsic to LLMs. ULTRA sequentially reads text chunks of a document to generate a candidate argument set, upon which non-pertinent candidates are dropped through self-refinement. We introduce LEAFER to address the challenge LLMs face in locating the exact boundary of an argument. ULTRA outperforms strong baselines, including strong supervised models and ChatGPT, by 9.8% when evaluated by Exact Match (EM).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anmol Goel, Nico Daheim, Christian Montag, Iryna Gurevych</p>
<p>Abstract: Reframing a negative into a positive thought is at the crux of several cognitive approaches to mental health and psychotherapy that could be made more accessible by large language model-based solutions. Such reframing is typically non-trivial and requires multiple rationalization steps to uncover the underlying issue of a negative thought and transform it to be more positive. However, this rationalization process is currently neglected by both datasets and models which reframe thoughts in one step. In this work, we address this gap by augmenting open-source datasets for positive text rewriting with synthetically-generated Socratic rationales using a novel framework called \textsc{SocraticReframe}. SocraticReframe uses a sequence of question-answer pairs to rationalize the thought rewriting process. We show that such Socratic rationales significantly improve positive text rewriting for different open-source LLMs according to both automatic and human evaluations guided by criteria from psychotherapy research. We validate our framework and the synthetic rationalizations with expert judgements from domain experts and psychology students in an IRB-approved annotation study. Our findings highlight the potential of utilizing the synergy between LLM reasoning and established psychotherapy techniques to build assistive solutions for reframing negative thoughts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiasheng Ye, Peiju Liu, Tianxiang Sun, Jun Zhan, Yunhua Zhou, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretraining data of large language models composes multiple domains (e.g., web texts, academic papers, codes), whose mixture proportions crucially impact the competence of outcome models. While existing endeavors rely on heuristics or qualitative strategies to tune the proportions, we discover the quantitative predictability of model performance regarding the mixture proportions in function forms, which we refer to as the data mixing laws. Fitting such functions on sample mixtures unveils model performance on unseen mixtures before actual runs, thus guiding the selection of an ideal data mixture. Furthermore, we propose nested use of the scaling laws of training steps, model sizes, and our data mixing law to enable predicting the performance of large models trained on massive data under various mixtures with only small-scale training. Moreover, experimental results verify that our method effectively optimizes the training mixture of a 1B model trained for 100B tokens in RedPajama, reaching a performance comparable to the one trained for 48% more steps on the default mixture. Extending the application of data mixing laws to continual training accurately predicts the critical mixture proportion that avoids catastrophic forgetting and outlooks the potential for dynamic data schedules</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Nguyen, Andrew Baker, Clement Neo, Allen Roush, Andreas Kirsch, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text by sampling the next token from a probability distribution over the vocabulary at each decoding step. Popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures which lead to incoherent or repetitive outputs. We propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by using the top token's probability as a scaling factor. Our experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing show that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text across different model families (Mistral and Llama 3) and model sizes (1B to 123B parameters), especially at higher temperatures. Human evaluations further show a clear preference for min-p sampling, in both text quality and creativity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by popular open-source LLM frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, and many others, highlighting its significant impact on improving text generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin L. Badger</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms that confer selective focus on a strict subset of input elements are nearly ubiquitous in language models today. We posit there to be downside to the use of attention: most input information is lost. In support of this idea we observe poor input representation accuracy in transformers and more accurate representation in what we term masked mixers, which replace self-attention with masked convolutions. The masked mixer learns causal language modeling more efficiently than early transformer implementations and even outperforms optimized, current transformers when training on small ($n_{ctx}<512$) but not larger context windows. Evidence is presented for the hypothesis that differences in transformer and masked mixer training efficiencies for various tasks are best predicted by input representation accuracy, or equivalently global invertibility. We hypothesize that the information loss exhibited by transformers would be more detrimental to retrieval than generation, as the former is more closely approximated by a bijective and thus invertible function. We find that masked mixers are more effective retrieval models both when the pretrained embedding model is unchanged as well as when the embedding model is modified via cosine similarity-based InfoNCE loss minimization. A small masked mixer is shown to outperform a large and near state-of-the-art transformer-based retrieval model, despite the latter being trained with many orders of magnitude more data and compute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Satvaty, Suzan Verberne, Fatih Turkmen</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent research increasingly showcases the remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is equally crucial to examine their associated risks. Among these, privacy and security vulnerabilities are particularly concerning, posing significant ethical and legal challenges. At the heart of these vulnerabilities stands memorization, which refers to a model's tendency to store and reproduce phrases from its training data. This phenomenon has been shown to be a fundamental source to various privacy and security attacks against LLMs. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of the literature on LLM memorization, exploring it across three dimensions: granularity, retrievability, and desirability. Next, we discuss the metrics and methods used to quantify memorization, followed by an analysis of the causes and factors that contribute to memorization phenomenon. We then explore strategies that are used so far to mitigate the undesirable aspects of this phenomenon. We conclude our survey by identifying potential research topics for the near future, including methods to balance privacy and performance, and the analysis of memorization in specific LLM contexts such as conversational agents, retrieval-augmented generation, and diffusion language models. Given the rapid research pace in this field, we also maintain a dedicated repository of the references discussed in this survey which will be regularly updated to reflect the latest developments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong learning (LL) capabilities are essential for QA models to excel in real-world applications, and architecture-based LL approaches have proven to be a promising direction for achieving this goal. However, adapting existing methods to QA tasks is far from straightforward. Many prior approaches either rely on access to task identities during testing or fail to adequately model samples from unseen tasks, which limits their practical applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Diana , a novel \underline{d}ynam\underline{i}c \underline{a}rchitecture-based lifelo\underline{n}g Q\underline{A} framework designed to learn a sequence of QA tasks using a prompt-enhanced language model.Diana leverages four hierarchically structured types of prompts to capture QA knowledge at multiple levels of granularity. Task-level prompts are specifically designed to encode task-specific knowledge, ensuring strong lifelong learning performance. Meanwhile, instance-level prompts are utilized to capture shared knowledge across diverse input samples, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities. Additionally, Diana incorporates dedicated prompts to explicitly handle unseen tasks and introduces a set of prompt key vectors that facilitate efficient knowledge transfer and sharing between tasks. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that Diana achieves state-of-the-art performance among lifelong QA models, with particularly notable improvements in its ability to handle previously unseen tasks. This makes Diana a significant advancement in the field of lifelong learning for question-answering systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Rezazadeh, Zichao Li, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their context windows, yet challenges in effective long-term memory management remain. We introduce MemTree, an algorithm that leverages a dynamic, tree-structured memory representation to optimize the organization, retrieval, and integration of information, akin to human cognitive schemas. MemTree organizes memory hierarchically, with each node encapsulating aggregated textual content, corresponding semantic embeddings, and varying abstraction levels across the tree's depths. Our algorithm dynamically adapts this memory structure by computing and comparing semantic embeddings of new and existing information to enrich the model's context-awareness. This approach allows MemTree to handle complex reasoning and extended interactions more effectively than traditional memory augmentation methods, which often rely on flat lookup tables. Evaluations on benchmarks for multi-turn dialogue understanding and document question answering show that MemTree significantly enhances performance in scenarios that demand structured memory management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Rivera Soto, Barry Chen, Nicholas Andrews</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality paraphrases are easy to produce using instruction-tuned language models or specialized paraphrasing models. Although this capability has a variety of benign applications, paraphrasing attacks$\unicode{x2013}$paraphrases applied to machine-generated texts$\unicode{x2013}$are known to significantly degrade the performance of machine-text detectors. This motivates us to consider the novel problem of paraphrase inversion, where, given paraphrased text, the objective is to recover an approximation of the original text. The closer the approximation is to the original text, the better machine-text detectors will perform. We propose an approach which frames the problem as translation from paraphrased text back to the original text, which requires examples of texts and corresponding paraphrases to train the inversion model. Fortunately, such training data can easily be generated, given a corpus of original texts and one or more paraphrasing models. We find that language models such as GPT-4 and Llama-3 exhibit biases when paraphrasing which an inversion model can learn with a modest amount of data. Perhaps surprisingly, we also find that such models generalize well, including to paraphrase models unseen at training time. Finally, we show that when combined with a paraphrased-text detector, our inversion models provide an effective defense against paraphrasing attacks, and overall our approach yields an average improvement of +22% AUROC across seven machine-text detectors and three different domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijian Zhuo, Ya Wang, Yutao Zeng, Xiaoqing Li, Xun Zhou, Jinwen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have found extensive applications across various domains due to the powerful fitting capabilities. This success can be partially attributed to their inherent nonlinearity. Thus, in addition to the ReLU function employed in the original transformer architecture, researchers have explored alternative modules such as GeLU and SwishGLU to enhance nonlinearity and thereby augment representational capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel category of polynomial composition activations (PolyCom), designed to optimize the dynamics of transformers. Theoretically, we provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis of PolyCom, highlighting its enhanced expressivity and efficacy relative to other activation functions. Notably, we demonstrate that networks incorporating PolyCom achieve the $\textbf{optimal approximation rate}$, indicating that PolyCom networks require minimal parameters to approximate general smooth functions in Sobolev spaces. We conduct empirical experiments on the pre-training configurations of large language models (LLMs), including both dense and sparse architectures. By substituting conventional activation functions with PolyCom, we enable LLMs to capture higher-order interactions within the data, thus improving performance metrics in terms of accuracy and convergence rates. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements over other activation functions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ishika Agarwal, Krishnateja Killamsetty, Lucian Popa, Marina Danilevksy</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is essential for enhancing their performance on specific tasks but is often resource-intensive due to redundant or uninformative data. To address this inefficiency, we introduce DELIFT (Data Efficient Language model Instruction Fine-Tuning), a novel algorithm that systematically optimizes data selection across the three key stages of fine-tuning: (1) instruction tuning, (2) task-specific fine-tuning (e.g., reasoning, question-answering), and (3) continual fine-tuning (e.g., incorporating new data versions). Unlike existing methods that focus on single-stage optimization or rely on computationally intensive gradient calculations, DELIFT operates efficiently across all stages. Central to our approach is a pairwise utility metric that quantifies how beneficial a data sample is for improving the model's responses to other samples, effectively measuring the informational value relative to the model's current capabilities. By leveraging different submodular functions applied to this metric, DELIFT selects diverse and optimal subsets that are useful across all stages of fine-tuning. Experiments across various tasks and model scales demonstrate that DELIFT can reduce the fine-tuning data size by up to 70% without compromising performance, offering significant computational savings and outperforming existing methods in both efficiency and efficacy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code have become indispensable in various domains, including code generation, reasoning tasks and agent systems. While open-access code LLMs are increasingly approaching the performance levels of proprietary models, high-quality code LLMs suitable for rigorous scientific investigation, particularly those with reproducible data processing pipelines and transparent training protocols, remain limited. The scarcity is due to various challenges, including resource constraints, ethical considerations, and the competitive advantages of keeping models advanced. To address the gap, we introduce OpenCoder, a top-tier code LLM that not only achieves performance comparable to leading models but also serves as an "open cookbook" for the research community. Unlike most prior efforts, we release not only model weights and inference code, but also the reproducible training data, complete data processing pipeline, rigorous experimental ablation results, and detailed training protocols for open scientific research. Through this comprehensive release, we identify the key ingredients for building a top-tier code LLM: (1) code optimized heuristic rules for data cleaning and methods for data deduplication, (2) recall of text corpus related to code and (3) high-quality synthetic data in both annealing and supervised fine-tuning stages. By offering this level of openness, we aim to broaden access to all aspects of a top-tier code LLM, with OpenCoder serving as both a powerful model and an open foundation to accelerate research, and enable reproducible advancements in code AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adapting general multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specific domains, such as scientific and industrial fields, is highly significant in promoting their practical applications. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs through post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipelines, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4V) in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: While the two-stage training--initially on image-caption pairs followed by visual instruction tasks--is commonly adopted for developing general MLLMs, we apply a single-stage training pipeline to enhance task diversity for domain-specific post-training. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Furthermore, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks. While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications - such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval - continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, integrating LLMs with text embeddings has become a major research focus in recent years. In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, adapting their innate capabilities for high-quality embedding; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing recent works based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuzhou Yuan, Jingyi Sun, Ran Zhang, Michael F\"arber, Steffen Eger, Pepa Atanasova, Isabelle Augenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language explanations (NLEs) are commonly used to provide plausible free-text explanations of a model's reasoning about its predictions. However, recent work has questioned their faithfulness, as they may not accurately reflect the model's internal reasoning process regarding its predicted answer. In contrast, highlight explanations--input fragments critical for the model's predicted answers--exhibit measurable faithfulness. Building on this foundation, we propose G-Tex, a Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation framework designed to enhance the faithfulness of NLEs. Specifically, highlight explanations are first extracted as faithful cues reflecting the model's reasoning logic toward answer prediction. They are subsequently encoded through a graph neural network layer to guide the NLE generation, which aligns the generated explanations with the model's underlying reasoning toward the predicted answer. Experiments on T5 and BART using three reasoning datasets show that G-Tex improves NLE faithfulness by up to 12.18% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, G-Tex generates NLEs with greater semantic and lexical similarity to human-written ones. Human evaluations show that G-Tex can decrease redundant content and enhance the overall quality of NLEs. Our work presents a novel method for explicitly guiding NLE generation to enhance faithfulness, serving as a foundation for addressing broader criteria in NLE and generated text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hailin Chen, Fangkai Jiao, Mathieu Ravaut, Nawshad Farruque, Xuan Phi Nguyen, Chengwei Qin, Manan Dey, Bosheng Ding, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty, Yingbo Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) demands robust, unbiased, and scalable evaluation methods. However, human annotations are costly to scale, model-based evaluations are susceptible to stylistic biases, and target-answer-based benchmarks are vulnerable to data contamination and cheating. To address these limitations, we propose StructTest, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability to follow compositional instructions and generate structured outputs, providing an unbiased, cost-effective, and difficult-to-cheat evaluation framework. Assessments are conducted deterministically using a rule-based evaluator, which can be easily extended to new tasks and datasets. By testing structured outputs across diverse domains including Summarization, Code, HTML, and Math, and evaluating 17 popular LLMs, we demonstrate that StructTest remains challenging even for top-performing models like Deepseek-V3/R1 and GPT-4o, establishing it as a robust proxy for measuring reasoning capabilities. We believe StructTest offers a critical and complementary approach to achieving objective and comprehensive model evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huihan Li, Arnav Goel, Keyu He, Xiang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: In open-ended generative tasks like narrative writing or dialogue, large language models often exhibit cultural biases, showing limited knowledge and generating templated outputs for less prevalent cultures. Recent works show that these biases may stem from uneven cultural representation in pretraining corpora. This work investigates how pretraining leads to biased culture-conditioned generations by analyzing how models associate entities with cultures based on pretraining data patterns. We propose the MEMOed framework (MEMOrization from pretraining document) to determine whether a generation for a culture arises from memorization. Using MEMOed on culture-conditioned generations about food and clothing for 110 cultures, we find that high-frequency cultures in pretraining data yield more generations with memorized symbols, while some low-frequency cultures produce none. Additionally, the model favors generating entities with extraordinarily high frequency regardless of the conditioned culture, reflecting biases toward frequent pretraining terms irrespective of relevance. We hope that the MEMOed framework and our insights will inspire more works on attributing model performance on pretraining data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anmol Goel, Yaxi Hu, Iryna Gurevych, Amartya Sanyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and away from undesirable behaviors (such as hallucination) has become increasingly important. Recently, steering LLMs towards a desired behavior via activation editing has emerged as an effective method to mitigate harmful generations at inference-time. Activation editing modifies LLM representations by preserving information from positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) and minimising information from negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinations). When these demonstrations come from a private dataset, the aligned LLM may leak private information contained in those private samples. In this work, we present the first study of aligning LLM behavior with private datasets. Our work proposes the Private Steering for LLM Alignment (PSA) algorithm to edit LLM activations with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on seven different benchmarks with open-source LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to 7B) and model families (LlaMa, Qwen, Mistral and Gemma). Our results show that PSA achieves DP guarantees for LLM alignment with minimal loss in performance, including alignment metrics, open-ended text generation quality, and general-purpose reasoning. We also develop the first Membership Inference Attack (MIA) for evaluating and auditing the empirical privacy for the problem of LLM steering via activation editing. Our experiments support the theoretical guarantees by showing improved guarantees for our PSA algorithm compared to several existing non-private techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaetano Rossiello, Nhan Pham, Michael Glass, Junkyu Lee, Dharmashankar Subramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a framework for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales to enhance text-to-SQL model fine-tuning. These rationales consist of intermediate SQL statements and explanations, serving as incremental steps toward constructing the final SQL query. The process begins with manually annotating a small set of examples, which are then used to prompt a large language model in an iterative, dynamic few-shot knowledge distillation procedure from a teacher model. A rationalization model is subsequently trained on the validated decomposed queries, enabling extensive synthetic CoT annotations for text-to-SQL datasets. To evaluate the approach, we fine-tune small language models with and without these rationales on the BIRD dataset. Results indicate that step-by-step query generation improves execution accuracy, especially for moderately and highly complex queries, while also enhancing explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixin Tang, Chieh-Yang Huang, Tsung-Che Li, Ho Yin Sam Ng, Hen-Hsen Huang, Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: A language can have different varieties. These varieties can affect the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models, including large language models (LLMs), which are often trained on data from widely spoken varieties. This paper introduces a novel and cost-effective approach to benchmark model performance across language varieties. We argue that international online review platforms, such as Booking.com, can serve as effective data sources for constructing datasets that capture comments in different language varieties from similar real-world scenarios, like reviews for the same hotel with the same rating using the same language (e.g., Mandarin Chinese) but different language varieties (e.g., Taiwan Mandarin, Mainland Mandarin). To prove this concept, we constructed a contextually aligned dataset comprising reviews in Taiwan Mandarin and Mainland Mandarin and tested six LLMs in a sentiment analysis task. Our results show that LLMs consistently underperform in Taiwan Mandarin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoming Xu, Ningyuan Zhao, Liming Yang, Sendong Zhao, Shumin Deng, Mengru Wang, Bryan Hooi, Nay Oo, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current unlearning methods for large language models usually rely on reverse optimization to reduce target token probabilities. However, this paradigm disrupts the subsequent tokens prediction, degrading model performance and linguistic coherence. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics overemphasize contextual forgetting while inadequately assessing response fluency and relevance. To address these challenges, we propose ReLearn, a data augmentation and fine-tuning pipeline for effective unlearning, along with a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework introduces Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR) and Knowledge Retention Rate (KRR) to measure knowledge-level preservation, and Linguistic Score (LS) to evaluate generation quality. Our experiments show that ReLearn successfully achieves targeted forgetting while preserving high-quality output. Through mechanistic analysis, we further demonstrate how reverse optimization disrupts coherent text generation, while ReLearn preserves this essential capability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lan Zhang, Marco Valentino, Andre Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: Thanks to their linguistic capabilities, LLMs offer an opportunity to bridge the gap between informal mathematics and formal languages through autoformalization. However, it is still unclear how well LLMs generalize to sophisticated and naturally occurring mathematical statements. To address this gap, we investigate the task of autoformalizing real-world mathematical definitions -- a critical component of mathematical discourse. Specifically, we introduce two novel resources for autoformalisation, collecting definitions from Wikipedia (Def_Wiki) and arXiv papers (Def_ArXiv). We then systematically evaluate a range of LLMs, analyzing their ability to formalize definitions into Isabelle/HOL. Furthermore, we investigate strategies to enhance LLMs' performance including refinement through external feedback from Proof Assistants, and formal definition grounding, where we guide LLMs through relevant contextual elements from formal mathematical libraries. Our findings reveal that definitions present a greater challenge compared to existing benchmarks, such as miniF2F. In particular, we found that LLMs still struggle with self-correction, and aligning with relevant mathematical libraries. At the same time, structured refinement methods and definition grounding strategies yield notable improvements of up to 16% on self-correction capabilities and 43% on the reduction of undefined errors, highlighting promising directions for enhancing LLM-based autoformalization in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recognizing events and their coreferential mentions in a document is essential for understanding semantic meanings of text. The existing research on event coreference resolution is mostly limited to news articles. In this paper, we present the first dataset for the legal domain, LegalCore, which has been annotated with comprehensive event and event coreference information. The legal contract documents we annotated in this dataset are several times longer than news articles, with an average length of around 25k tokens per document. The annotations show that legal documents have dense event mentions and feature both short-distance and super long-distance coreference links between event mentions. We further benchmark mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset for both event detection and event coreference resolution tasks, and find that this dataset poses significant challenges for state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, which perform significantly worse than a supervised baseline. We will publish the dataset as well as the code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivank Garg, Ayush Singh, Shweta Singh, Paras Chopra</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the primary method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. While it enables LLMs to achieve human-level alignment, it often incurs significant computational and financial costs due to its reliance on training external reward models or human-labeled preferences. In this work, we propose Implicit Preference Optimization (IPO), an alternative approach that leverages generative LLMs as preference classifiers, thereby reducing the dependence on external human feedback or reward models to obtain preferences. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the preference classification ability of LLMs using RewardBench, assessing models across different sizes, architectures, and training levels to validate our hypothesis. Furthermore, we investigate the self-improvement capabilities of LLMs by generating multiple responses for a given instruction and employing the model itself as a preference classifier for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based training. Our findings demonstrate that models trained through IPO achieve performance comparable to those utilizing state-of-the-art reward models for obtaining preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhe Zhang, Richard Bai, Zijin Gu, Ruixiang Zhang, Jiatao Gu, Emmanuel Abbe, Samy Bengio, Navdeep Jaitly</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models usually use left-to-right (L2R) autoregressive factorization. However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability and directional conditional entropy. We ablate the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Dai, Yijie Xu, Jinhui Ye, Hao Liu, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved generation performance by incorporating externally retrieved knowledge, a process known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the potential of this approach, existing studies evaluate RAG effectiveness by 1) assessing retrieval and generation components jointly, which obscures retrieval's distinct contribution, or 2) examining retrievers using traditional metrics such as NDCG, which creates a gap in understanding retrieval's true utility in the overall generation process. To address the above limitations, in this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation method that measures retrieval quality through the lens of information gain within the RAG framework. Specifically, we propose Semantic Perplexity (SePer), a metric that captures the LLM's internal belief about the correctness of the retrieved information. We quantify the utility of retrieval by the extent to which it reduces semantic perplexity post-retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SePer not only aligns closely with human preferences but also offers a more precise and efficient evaluation of retrieval utility across diverse RAG scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they face challenges such as low computational efficiency, gradient vanishing, and difficulties in capturing complex feature interactions. To address these limitations, a novel framework has been proposed. This framework incorporates a learnable dense residual skip connection mechanism, a TransformerX module a transformer based component integrating multiscale convolution and adaptive activation functions and a multitoken prediction interaction module. The learnable dense residual connections enhance information flow and feature capture across layers. Within the TransformerX module, large convolutional kernels aggregate semantic information from extensive text segments, while smaller convolutions focus on local word order and syntactic structures. The adaptive activation function dynamically adjusts its parameters based on the semantic features of the input text, improving the model's ability to handle diverse semantic expressions and complex relationships. The multitoken prediction module boosts data utilization and accelerates inference by predicting multiple future tokens. These components significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Attention encoder-decoder model architecture is the backbone of several recent top performing foundation speech models: Whisper, Seamless, OWSM, and Canary-1B. However, the reported data and compute requirements for their training are prohibitive for many in the research community. In this work, we focus on the efficiency angle and ask the questions of whether we are training these speech models efficiently, and what can we do to improve? We argue that a major, if not the most severe, detrimental factor for training efficiency is related to the sampling strategy of sequential data. We show that negligence in mini-batch sampling leads to more than 50% computation being spent on padding. To that end, we study, profile, and optimize Canary-1B training to show gradual improvement in GPU utilization leading up to 5x increase in average batch sizes versus its original training settings. This in turn allows us to train an equivalent model using 4x less GPUs in the same wall time, or leverage the original resources and train it in 2x shorter wall time. Finally, we observe that the major inference bottleneck lies in the autoregressive decoder steps. We find that adjusting the model architecture to transfer model parameters from the decoder to the encoder results in a 3x inference speedup as measured by inverse real-time factor (RTFx) while preserving the accuracy and compute requirements for convergence. The training code and models will be available as open-source.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on existing medical question-answering benchmarks. This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints.

<p>Abstract: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities during inference to use search engines is not optimal, since the LLM does not learn how to optimally interact with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model where the LLM learns -- solely through reinforcement learning (RL) -- to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM rollouts with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 26% (Qwen2.5-7B), 21% (Qwen2.5-3B), and 10% (LLaMA3.2-3B) over strong baselines.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing through their state of art reasoning capabilities. This paper explores the convergence of LLM reasoning techniques and feature generation for machine learning tasks. We examine four key reasoning approaches: Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Thought Space Exploration. Our analysis reveals how these approaches can be used to identify effective feature generation rules without having to manually specify search spaces. The paper categorizes LLM-based feature generation methods across various domains including finance, healthcare, and text analytics. LLMs can extract key information from clinical notes and radiology reports in healthcare, by enabling more efficient data utilization. In finance, LLMs facilitate text generation, summarization, and entity extraction from complex documents. We analyze evaluation methodologies for assessing feature quality and downstream performance, with particular attention to OCTree's decision tree reasoning approach that provides language-based feedback for iterative improvements. Current challenges include hallucination, computational efficiency, and domain adaptation. As of March 2025, emerging approaches include inference-time compute scaling, reinforcement learning, and supervised fine-tuning with model distillation. Future directions point toward multimodal feature generation, self-improving systems, and neuro-symbolic approaches. This paper provides a detailed overview of an emerging field that promises to automate and enhance feature engineering through language model reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tabular data analysis is crucial in many scenarios, yet efficiently identifying the most relevant data analysis queries and results for a new table remains a significant challenge. The complexity of tabular data, diverse analytical operations, and the demand for high-quality analysis make the process tedious. To address these challenges, we aim to recommend query-code-result triplets tailored for new tables in tabular data analysis workflows. In this paper, we present TablePilot, a pioneering tabular data analysis framework leveraging large language models to autonomously generate comprehensive and superior analytical results without relying on user profiles or prior interactions. The framework incorporates key designs in analysis preparation and analysis optimization to enhance accuracy. Additionally, we propose Rec-Align, a novel method to further improve recommendation quality and better align with human preferences. Experiments on DART, a dataset specifically designed for comprehensive tabular data analysis recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Based on GPT-4o, the tuned TablePilot achieves 77.0% top-5 recommendation recall. Human evaluations further highlight its effectiveness in optimizing tabular data analysis workflows.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces JuDGE (Judgment Document Generation Evaluation), a novel benchmark for evaluating the performance of judgment document generation in the Chinese legal system. We define the task as generating a complete legal judgment document from the given factual description of the case. To facilitate this benchmark, we construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of factual descriptions from real legal cases, paired with their corresponding full judgment documents, which serve as the ground truth for evaluating the quality of generated documents. This dataset is further augmented by two external legal corpora that provide additional legal knowledge for the task: one comprising statutes and regulations, and the other consisting of a large collection of past judgment documents. In collaboration with legal professionals, we establish a comprehensive automated evaluation framework to assess the quality of generated judgment documents across various dimensions. We evaluate various baseline approaches, including few-shot in-context learning, fine-tuning, and a multi-source retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, using both general and legal-domain LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that, while RAG approaches can effectively improve performance in this task, there is still substantial room for further improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rrubaa Panchendrarajan, Arkaitz Zubiaga</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying claims requiring verification is a critical task in automated fact-checking, especially given the proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms. Despite significant progress in the task, there remain open challenges such as dealing with multilingual and multimodal data prevalent in online discourse. Addressing the multilingual challenge, recent efforts have focused on fine-tuning pre-trained multilingual language models. While these models can handle multiple languages, their ability to effectively transfer cross-lingual knowledge for detecting claims spreading on social media remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce EX-Claim, an entity-aware cross-lingual claim detection model that generalizes well to handle claims written in any language. The model leverages entity information derived from named entity recognition and entity linking techniques to improve the language-level performance of both seen and unseen languages during training. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets from different social media platforms demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms the baselines, across 27 languages, and achieves the highest rate of knowledge transfer, even with limited training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Chambon, Baptiste Roziere, Benoit Sagot, Gabriel Synnaeve</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce BigO(Bench), a novel coding benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of generative language models in understanding and generating code with specified time and space complexities. This benchmark addresses the gap in current evaluations that often overlook the ability of models to comprehend and produce code constrained by computational complexity. BigO(Bench) includes tooling to infer the algorithmic complexity of any Python function from profiling measurements, including human- or LLM-generated solutions. BigO(Bench) also includes of set of 3,105 coding problems and 1,190,250 solutions from Code Contests annotated with inferred (synthetic) time and space complexity labels from the complexity framework, as well as corresponding runtime and memory footprint values for a large set of input sizes. We present results from evaluating multiple state-of-the-art language models on this benchmark, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in handling complexity requirements. In particular, token-space reasoning models are unrivaled in code generation but not in complexity understanding, hinting that they may not generalize well to tasks for which no reward was given at training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> ZhengLin Lai, MengYao Liao, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text classification, a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), aims to categorize textual data into predefined labels. Traditional methods struggled with complex linguistic structures and semantic dependencies. The advent of deep learning, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformer-based models, has significantly advanced the field by enabling nuanced feature extraction and context-aware predictions. Despite improvements, existing models exhibit limitations in balancing interpretability, computational efficiency, and long-range contextual understanding. This paper proposes the Dynamic Bidirectional Elman with Attention Network (DBEAN), which integrates bidirectional temporal modelling with self-attention mechanisms. DBEAN dynamically assigns weights to critical segments of input, improving contextual representation while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shoubin Yu, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in recent multimodal reasoning approaches, they are still limited in flexibility and efficiency, as these models typically process only a few fixed modality inputs and require updates to numerous parameters. This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, a generalizable, highly efficient, and modular modality-fusion framework that can incorporate any new modality to enhance video reasoning. We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio, thermal heatmap, and touch map) from given videos without extra human annotation by leveraging sensors or existing pre-trained models. Next, we introduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with each accessible modality. It projects diverse modality features to the LLM token embedding space, allowing the model to integrate different data types for response generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel progressive multimodal fusion design supported by a lightweight fusion module and modality-sequential training strategy. It helps compress information across various assisting modalities, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLM while improving performance. We validate our method on 7 video-language reasoning tasks assisted by diverse modalities, including conventional VideoQA and Video-Audio/3D/Touch/Thermal QA, and achieve better/equivalent performance against strong multimodal LLMs, including OneLLM, BLIP-2, and SeViLA while reducing over 90% trainable parameters. We provide extensive analyses of CREMA, including the impact of each modality on reasoning domains, the design of the fusion module, and example visualizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parshin Shojaee, Kazem Meidani, Shashank Gupta, Amir Barati Farimani, Chandan K Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical equations have been unreasonably effective in describing complex natural phenomena across various scientific disciplines. However, discovering such insightful equations from data presents significant challenges due to the necessity of navigating extremely large combinatorial hypothesis spaces. Current methods of equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression techniques, largely focus on extracting equations from data alone, often neglecting the domain-specific prior knowledge that scientists typically depend on. They also employ limited representations such as expression trees, constraining the search space and expressiveness of equations. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive scientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data. Specifically, LLM-SR treats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs' scientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs. The LLM iteratively proposes new equation skeleton hypotheses, drawing from its domain knowledge, which are then optimized against data to estimate parameters. We evaluate LLM-SR on four benchmark problems across diverse scientific domains (e.g., physics, biology), which we carefully designed to simulate the discovery process and prevent LLM recitation. Our results demonstrate that LLM-SR discovers physically accurate equations that significantly outperform state-of-the-art symbolic regression baselines, particularly in out-of-domain test settings. We also show that LLM-SR's incorporation of scientific priors enables more efficient equation space exploration than the baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Sahin Tas, Royden Wagner</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models generate hidden states that are difficult to interpret. In this work, we analyze hidden states and modify them at inference, with a focus on motion forecasting. We use linear probing to analyze whether interpretable features are embedded in hidden states. Our experiments reveal high probing accuracy, indicating latent space regularities with functionally important directions. Building on this, we use the directions between hidden states with opposing features to fit control vectors. At inference, we add our control vectors to hidden states and evaluate their impact on predictions. Remarkably, such modifications preserve the feasibility of predictions. We further refine our control vectors using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). This leads to more linear changes in predictions when scaling control vectors. Our approach enables mechanistic interpretation as well as zero-shot generalization to unseen dataset characteristics with negligible computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis evaluating the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) against traditional macro time series forecasting approaches. In recent times, LLMs have surged in popularity for forecasting due to their ability to capture intricate patterns in data and quickly adapt across very different domains. However, their effectiveness in forecasting macroeconomic time series data compared to conventional methods remains an area of interest. To address this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs against traditional macro forecasting methods, using as common ground the FRED-MD database. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in forecasting macroeconomic time series, shedding light on their applicability in real-world scenarios</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MIA-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on their ability to strictly adhere to complex instructions. Our benchmark comprises a diverse set of 400 image-prompt pairs, each crafted to challenge the models' compliance with layered instructions in generating accurate responses that satisfy specific requested patterns. Evaluation results from a wide array of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant variations in performance, highlighting areas for improvement in instruction fidelity. Additionally, we create extra training data and explore supervised fine-tuning to enhance the models' ability to strictly follow instructions without compromising performance on other tasks. We hope this benchmark not only serves as a tool for measuring MLLM adherence to instructions, but also guides future developments in MLLM training methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Wolf, a WOrLd summarization Framework for accurate video captioning. Wolf is an automated captioning framework that adopts a mixture-of-experts approach, leveraging complementary strengths of Vision Language Models (VLMs). By utilizing both image and video models, our framework captures different levels of information and summarizes them efficiently. Our approach can be applied to enhance video understanding, auto-labeling, and captioning. To evaluate caption quality, we introduce CapScore, an LLM-based metric to assess the similarity and quality of generated captions compared to the ground truth captions. We further build four human-annotated datasets in three domains: autonomous driving, general scenes, and robotics, to facilitate comprehensive comparisons. We show that Wolf achieves superior captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches from the research community (VILA1.5, CogAgent) and commercial solutions (Gemini-Pro-1.5, GPT-4V). For instance, in comparison with GPT-4V, Wolf improves CapScore both quality-wise by 55.6% and similarity-wise by 77.4% on challenging driving videos. Finally, we establish a benchmark for video captioning and introduce a leaderboard, aiming to accelerate advancements in video understanding, captioning, and data alignment.

<p>Abstract: GPT-4o, an omni-modal model that enables vocal conversations with diverse emotions and tones, marks a milestone for omni-modal foundation models. However, empowering Large Language Models to perceive and generate images, texts, and speeches end-to-end with publicly available data remains challenging for the open-source community. Existing vision-language models rely on external tools for speech processing, while speech-language models still suffer from limited or totally without vision-understanding capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the EMOVA (EMotionally Omni-present Voice Assistant), to enable Large Language Models with end-to-end speech abilities while maintaining the leading vision-language performance. With a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer, we surprisingly notice that omni-modal alignment can further enhance vision-language and speech abilities compared with the bi-modal aligned counterparts. Moreover, a lightweight style module is introduced for the flexible speech style controls including emotions and pitches. For the first time, EMOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the vision-language and speech benchmarks, and meanwhile, supporting omni-modal spoken dialogue with vivid emotions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Yu, Virginie Do, Karen Hambardzumyan, Nicola Cancedda</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can elicit harmful responses. Defending against such attacks remains challenging due to the opacity of jailbreaking mechanisms and the high computational cost of training LLMs robustly. We demonstrate that adversarial attacks share a universal mechanism for circumventing LLM safeguards that works by ablating a dimension in the residual stream embedding space called the refusal feature. We further show that the operation of refusal feature ablation (RFA) approximates the worst-case perturbation of offsetting model safety. Based on these findings, we propose Refusal Feature Adversarial Training (ReFAT), a novel algorithm that efficiently performs LLM adversarial training by simulating the effect of input-level attacks via RFA. Experiment results show that ReFAT significantly improves the robustness of three popular LLMs against a wide range of adversarial attacks, with considerably less computational overhead compared to existing adversarial training methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Zhao, Hanze Dong, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations (i.e., generating plausible but inaccurate content) and laziness (i.e. excessive refusals or defaulting to "I don't know") persist as major challenges in LLM reasoning. Current efforts to reduce hallucinations primarily focus on factual errors in knowledge-grounded tasks, often neglecting hallucinations related to faulty reasoning. Meanwhile, some approaches render LLMs overly conservative, limiting their problem-solving capabilities. To mitigate hallucination and laziness in reasoning tasks, we propose Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration (Auto-CEI) to enhance LLM reasoning and align responses to the model's capabilities--assertively answering within its limits and declining when tasks exceed them. In our method, Expert Iteration explores the reasoning trajectories near the LLM policy, guiding incorrect paths back on track to reduce compounding errors and improve robustness; it also promotes appropriate "I don't know" responses after sufficient reasoning attempts. The curriculum automatically adjusts rewards, incentivizing extended reasoning before acknowledging incapability, thereby pushing the limits of LLM reasoning and aligning its behaviour with these limits. We compare Auto-CEI with various SOTA baselines across logical reasoning, mathematics, and planning tasks, where Auto-CEI achieves superior alignment by effectively balancing assertiveness and conservativeness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Hu, Jia-Chen Gu, Zi-Yi Dou, Mohsen Fayyaz, Pan Lu, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether models can retrieve and utilize external textual knowledge for question answering. However, there are scenarios where retrieving visual information is either more beneficial or easier to access than textual data. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation benchmark, MRAG-Bench, in which we systematically identify and categorize scenarios where visually augmented knowledge is better than textual knowledge, for instance, more images from varying viewpoints. MRAG-Bench consists of 16,130 images and 1,353 human-annotated multiple-choice questions across 9 distinct scenarios. With MRAG-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of 10 open-source and 4 proprietary large vision-language models (LVLMs). Our results show that all LVLMs exhibit greater improvements when augmented with images compared to textual knowledge, confirming that MRAG-Bench is vision-centric. Additionally, we conduct extensive analysis with MRAG-Bench, which offers valuable insights into retrieval-augmented LVLMs. Notably, the top-performing model, GPT-4o, faces challenges in effectively leveraging retrieved knowledge, achieving only a 5.82% improvement with ground-truth information, in contrast to a 33.16% improvement observed in human participants. These findings highlight the importance of MRAG-Bench in encouraging the community to enhance LVLMs' ability to utilize retrieved visual knowledge more effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Rifat Arefin, Gopeshh Subbaraj, Nicolas Gontier, Yann LeCun, Irina Rish, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, Christopher Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoder-only Transformers often struggle with complex reasoning tasks, particularly arithmetic reasoning requiring multiple sequential operations. In this work, we identify representation collapse in the model's intermediate layers as a key factor limiting their reasoning capabilities. To address this, we propose Sequential Variance-Covariance Regularization (Seq-VCR), which enhances the entropy of intermediate representations and prevents collapse. Combined with dummy pause tokens as substitutes for chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens, our method significantly improves performance in arithmetic reasoning problems. In the challenging $5 \times 5$ integer multiplication task, our approach achieves $99.5\%$ exact match accuracy, outperforming models of the same size (which yield $0\%$ accuracy) and GPT-4 with five-shot CoT prompting ($44\%$). We also demonstrate superior results on arithmetic expression and longest increasing subsequence (LIS) datasets. Our findings highlight the importance of preventing intermediate layer representation collapse to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Transformers and show that Seq-VCR offers an effective solution without requiring explicit CoT supervision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities across various domains. However, these models often generate videos that have misalignments with text prompts, especially when the prompts describe complex scenes with multiple objects and attributes. To address this, we introduce VideoRepair, a novel model-agnostic, training-free video refinement framework that automatically identifies fine-grained text-video misalignments and generates explicit spatial and textual feedback, enabling a T2V diffusion model to perform targeted, localized refinements. VideoRepair consists of two stages: In (1) video refinement planning, we first detect misalignments by generating fine-grained evaluation questions and answering them using an MLLM. Based on video evaluation outputs, we identify accurately generated objects and construct localized prompts to precisely refine misaligned regions. In (2) localized refinement, we enhance video alignment by 'repairing' the misaligned regions from the original video while preserving the correctly generated areas. This is achieved by frame-wise region decomposition using our Region-Preserving Segmentation (RPS) module. On two popular video generation benchmarks (EvalCrafter and T2V-CompBench), VideoRepair substantially outperforms recent baselines across various text-video alignment metrics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of VideoRepair components and qualitative examples.</p>

It conducts ethical attacks by designing an identical multi-step prompts that simulates the scenario of "corporate middle managers competing for promotions." The data results show that the guardrails of the above-mentioned LLMs were bypassed and the content of verbal attacks was generated. Claude 3.5 Sonnet's resistance to multi-step jailbreak prompts is more obvious.

<p>Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in video understanding, most efforts remain limited to coarse-grained or visual-only video tasks. However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Chen, Yuying Ge, Weiliang Tang, Yizhuo Li, Yixiao Ge, Mingyu Ding, Ying Shan, Xihui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</p>

In response to this challenge, we explore two hypotheses: (1) critique of critique can be easier than critique itself, extending the widely-accepted observation that verification is easier than generation to the critique domain, as critique itself is a specialized form of generation; (2) this difficulty relationship is recursively held, suggesting that when direct evaluation is infeasible, performing high-order critiques (e.g., critique of critique of critique) offers a more tractable supervision pathway. To examine these hypotheses, we perform Human-Human, Human-AI, and AI-AI experiments across multiple tasks. Our results demonstrate encouraging evidence supporting these hypotheses and suggest that recursive self-critiquing is a promising direction for scalable oversight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: For pre-training of MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) models, one of the main issues is unbalanced expert loads, which may cause routing collapse or increased computational overhead. Existing methods contain the Loss-Controlled method and the Loss-Free method, where both the unbalanced degrees at first several training steps are still high and decrease slowly. In this work, we propose BIP-Based Balancing, an expert load balancing algorithm based on binary integer programming (BIP). The algorithm maintains an additional vector q on each MoE layer that can help change the top-K order of s by solving a binary integer programming with very small time costs. We implement the algorithm on two MoE language models: 16-expert (0.3B) and 64-expert (1.1B). The experimental results show that on both models comparing with the Loss-Controlled method and the Loss-Free method, our algorithm trains models with the lowest perplexities, while saves at least 13% of pre-training time compared with the Loss-Controlled method. Within our current knowledge, this is the first routing algorithm that achieves maintaining load balance status on every expert in every MoE layer from the first step to the last step during the whole pre-training process, while the trained MoE models also perform well.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00057">Improved YOLOv12 with LLM-Generated Synthetic Data for Enhanced Apple Detection and Benchmarking Against YOLOv11 and YOLOv10</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranjan Sapkota, Manoj Karkee</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluated the performance of the YOLOv12 object detection model, and compared against the performances YOLOv11 and YOLOv10 for apple detection in commercial orchards based on the model training completed entirely on synthetic images generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The YOLOv12n configuration achieved the highest precision at 0.916, the highest recall at 0.969, and the highest mean Average Precision (mAP@50) at 0.978. In comparison, the YOLOv11 series was led by YOLO11x, which achieved the highest precision at 0.857, recall at 0.85, and mAP@50 at 0.91. For the YOLOv10 series, YOLOv10b and YOLOv10l both achieved the highest precision at 0.85, with YOLOv10n achieving the highest recall at 0.8 and mAP@50 at 0.89. These findings demonstrated that YOLOv12, when trained on realistic LLM-generated datasets surpassed its predecessors in key performance metrics. The technique also offered a cost-effective solution by reducing the need for extensive manual data collection in the agricultural field. In addition, this study compared the computational efficiency of all versions of YOLOv12, v11 and v10, where YOLOv11n reported the lowest inference time at 4.7 ms, compared to YOLOv12n's 5.6 ms and YOLOv10n's 5.9 ms. Although YOLOv12 is new and more accurate than YOLOv11, and YOLOv10, YOLO11n still stays the fastest YOLO model among YOLOv10, YOLOv11 and YOLOv12 series of models.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05244">WritingBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Generative Writing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuning Wu, Jiahao Mei, Ming Yan, Chenliang Li, Shaopeng Lai, Yuran Ren, Zijia Wang, Ji Zhang, Mengyue Wu, Qin Jin, Fei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced text generation capabilities, yet evaluating their performance in generative writing remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on generic text generation or limited in writing tasks, failing to capture the diverse requirements of high-quality written contents across various domains. To bridge this gap, we present WritingBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across 6 core writing domains and 100 subdomains, encompassing creative, persuasive, informative, and technical writing. We further propose a query-dependent evaluation framework that empowers LLMs to dynamically generate instance-specific assessment criteria. This framework is complemented by a fine-tuned critic model for criteria-aware scoring, enabling evaluations in style, format and length. The framework's validity is further demonstrated by its data curation capability, which enables 7B-parameter models to approach state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We open-source the benchmark, along with evaluation tools and modular framework components, to advance the development of LLMs in writing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iv\'an Arcuschin, Jett Janiak, Robert Krzyzanowski, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda, Arthur Conmy</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful, i.e. CoT reasoning does not always reflect how models arrive at conclusions. So far, most of these studies have focused on unfaithfulness in unnatural contexts where an explicit bias has been introduced. In contrast, we show that unfaithful CoT can occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. Our results reveal non-negligible rates of several forms of unfaithful reasoning in frontier models: Sonnet 3.7 (16.3%), DeepSeek R1 (5.3%) and ChatGPT-4o (7.0%) all answer a notable proportion of question pairs unfaithfully. Specifically, we find that models rationalize their implicit biases in answers to binary questions ("implicit post-hoc rationalization"). For example, when separately presented with the questions "Is X bigger than Y?" and "Is Y bigger than X?", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We also investigate restoration errors (Dziri et al., 2023), where models make and then silently correct errors in their reasoning, and unfaithful shortcuts, where models use clearly illogical reasoning to simplify solving problems in Putnam questions (a hard benchmark). Our findings raise challenges for AI safety work that relies on monitoring CoT to detect undesired behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shoubin Yu, Difan Liu, Ziqiao Ma, Yicong Hong, Yang Zhou, Hao Tan, Joyce Chai, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent video diffusion models have enhanced video editing, but it remains challenging to handle instructional editing and diverse tasks (e.g., adding, removing, changing) within a unified framework. In this paper, we introduce VEGGIE, a Video Editor with Grounded Generation from Instructions, a simple end-to-end framework that unifies video concept editing, grounding, and reasoning based on diverse user instructions. Specifically, given a video and text query, VEGGIE first utilizes an MLLM to interpret user intentions in instructions and ground them to the video contexts, generating frame-specific grounded task queries for pixel-space responses. A diffusion model then renders these plans and generates edited videos that align with user intent. To support diverse tasks and complex instructions, we employ a curriculum learning strategy: first aligning the MLLM and video diffusion model with large-scale instructional image editing data, followed by end-to-end fine-tuning on high-quality multitask video data. Additionally, we introduce a novel data synthesis pipeline to generate paired instructional video editing data for model training. It transforms static image data into diverse, high-quality video editing samples by leveraging Image-to-Video models to inject dynamics. VEGGIE shows strong performance in instructional video editing with different editing skills, outperforming the best instructional baseline as a versatile model, while other models struggle with multi-tasking. VEGGIE also excels in video object grounding and reasoning segmentation, where other baselines fail. We further reveal how the multiple tasks help each other and highlight promising applications like zero-shot multimodal instructional and in-context video editing.</p>
