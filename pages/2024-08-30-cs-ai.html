<p><b>Authors:</b> Agnieszka Mensfelt, Kostas Stathis, Vince Trencsenyi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents (LELMA) framework, a novel approach to enhance the trustworthiness of social simulations that utilize large language models (LLMs). While LLMs have gained attention as agents for simulating human behaviour, their applicability in this role is limited by issues such as inherent hallucinations and logical inconsistencies. LELMA addresses these challenges by integrating LLMs with symbolic AI, enabling logical verification of the reasoning generated by LLMs. This verification process provides corrective feedback, refining the reasoning output. The framework consists of three main components: an LLM-Reasoner for producing strategic reasoning, an LLM-Translator for mapping natural language reasoning to logic queries, and a Solver for evaluating these queries. This study focuses on decision-making in game-theoretic scenarios as a model of human interaction. Experiments involving the Hawk-Dove game, Prisoner's Dilemma, and Stag Hunt highlight the limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 Omni and Gemini 1.0 Pro, in producing correct reasoning in these contexts. LELMA demonstrates high accuracy in error detection and improves the reasoning correctness of LLMs via self-refinement, particularly in GPT-4 Omni.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifei Xie, Changqiao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in language models have achieved significant progress. GPT-4o, as a new milestone, has enabled real-time conversations with humans, demonstrating near-human natural fluency. Such human-computer interaction necessitates models with the capability to perform reasoning directly with the audio modality and generate output in streaming. However, this remains beyond the reach of current academic models, as they typically depend on extra TTS systems for speech synthesis, resulting in undesirable latency. This paper introduces the Mini-Omni, an audio-based end-to-end conversational model, capable of real-time speech interaction. To achieve this capability, we propose a text-instructed speech generation method, along with batch-parallel strategies during inference to further boost the performance. Our method also helps to retain the original model's language capabilities with minimal degradation, enabling other works to establish real-time interaction capabilities. We call this training method "Any Model Can Talk". We also introduce the VoiceAssistant-400K dataset to fine-tune models optimized for speech output. To our best knowledge, Mini-Omni is the first fully end-to-end, open-source model for real-time speech interaction, offering valuable potential for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arwin Gansekoele, Emiel Hess, Sandjai Bhulai</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing privacy concerns surrounding face image data demand new techniques that can guarantee user privacy. One such face recognition technique that claims to achieve better user privacy is Federated Face Recognition (FRR), a subfield of Federated Learning (FL). However, FFR faces challenges due to the heterogeneity of the data, given the large number of classes that need to be handled. To overcome this problem, solutions are sought in the field of personalized FL. This work introduces three new data partitions based on the CelebA dataset, each with a different form of data heterogeneity. It also proposes Hessian-Free Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (HF-MAML) in an FFR setting. We show that HF-MAML scores higher in verification tests than current FFR models on three different CelebA data partitions. In particular, the verification scores improve the most in heterogeneous data partitions. To balance personalization with the development of an effective global model, an embedding regularization term is introduced for the loss function. This term can be combined with HF-MAML and is shown to increase global model verification performance. Lastly, this work performs a fairness analysis, showing that HF-MAML and its embedding regularization extension can improve fairness by reducing the standard deviation over the client evaluation scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toru Nagasaka, Kimihiro Yamashita, Mitsugu Fujita</p>
<p>Abstract: The study presents a novel approach for quantifying cellular interactions in digital pathology using deep learning-based image cytometry. Traditional methods struggle with the diversity and heterogeneity of cells within tissues. To address this, we introduce the Spatial Interaction Potential (SIP) and the Co-Localization Index (CLI), leveraging deep learning classification probabilities. SIP assesses the potential for cell-to-cell interactions, similar to an electric field, while CLI incorporates distances between cells, accounting for dynamic cell movements. Our approach enhances traditional methods, providing a more sophisticated analysis of cellular interactions. We validate SIP and CLI through simulations and apply them to colorectal cancer specimens, demonstrating strong correlations with actual biological data. This innovative method offers significant improvements in understanding cellular interactions and has potential applications in various fields of digital pathology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Shaham, Gabriel Ghinita, Bhaskar Krishnamachari, Cyrus Shahabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Smart grids are a valuable data source to study consumer behavior and guide energy policy decisions. In particular, time-series of power consumption over geographical areas are essential in deciding the optimal placement of expensive resources (e.g., transformers, storage elements) and their activation schedules. However, publication of such data raises significant privacy issues, as it may reveal sensitive details about personal habits and lifestyles. Differential privacy (DP) is well-suited for sanitization of individual data, but current DP techniques for time series lead to significant loss in utility, due to the existence of temporal correlation between data readings. We introduce {\em STPT (Spatio-Temporal Private Timeseries)}, a novel method for DP-compliant publication of electricity consumption data that analyzes spatio-temporal attributes and captures both micro and macro patterns by leveraging RNNs. Additionally, it employs a partitioning method for releasing electricity consumption time series based on identified patterns. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, on both real-world and synthetic datasets, that STPT significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, providing a well-balanced trade-off between data utility and user privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayeeta Chaudhuri, Dhruv Thapar, Arjun Chaudhuri, Farshad Firouzi, Krishnendu Chakrabarty</p>
<p>Abstract: Analog and mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuits (ICs) are crucial in modern electronics, playing key roles in signal processing, amplification, sensing, and power management. Many IC companies outsource manufacturing to third-party foundries, creating security risks such as stealthy analog Trojans. Traditional detection methods, including embedding circuit watermarks or conducting hardware-based monitoring, often impose significant area and power overheads, and may not effectively identify all types of Trojans. To address these shortcomings, we propose SPICED, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework that operates within the software domain, eliminating the need for hardware modifications for Trojan detection and localization. This is the first work using LLM-aided techniques for detecting and localizing syntactical bugs and analog Trojans in circuit netlists, requiring no explicit training and incurring zero area overhead. Our framework employs chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot examples to teach anomaly detection rules to LLMs. With the proposed method, we achieve an average Trojan coverage of 93.32% and an average true positive rate of 93.4% in identifying Trojan-impacted nodes for the evaluated analog benchmark circuits. These experimental results validate the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting and locating both syntactical bugs and Trojans within analog netlists.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasir Ali Farrukh, Syed Wali, Irfan Khan, Nathaniel D. Bastian</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, the integration of flow-level and packet-level information for real-time intrusion detection remains a largely untapped area of research. This paper introduces "XG-NID," a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to fuse flow-level and packet-level data within a heterogeneous graph structure, offering a comprehensive analysis of network traffic. Leveraging a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) with graph-level classification, XG-NID uniquely enables real-time inference while effectively capturing the intricate relationships between flow and packet payload data. Unlike traditional GNN-based methodologies that predominantly analyze historical data, XG-NID is designed to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of network traffic, providing a robust and real-time defense mechanism. Our framework extends beyond mere classification; it integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed, human-readable explanations and suggest potential remedial actions, ensuring that the insights produced are both actionable and comprehensible. Additionally, we introduce a new set of flow features based on temporal information, further enhancing the contextual and explainable inferences provided by our model. To facilitate practical application and accessibility, we developed "GNN4ID," an open-source tool that enables the extraction and transformation of raw network traffic into the proposed heterogeneous graph structure, seamlessly integrating flow and packet-level data. Our comprehensive quantitative comparative analysis demonstrates that XG-NID achieves an F1 score of 97\% in multi-class classification, outperforming existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods. This sets a new standard in Network Intrusion Detection Systems by combining innovative data fusion with enhanced interpretability and real-time capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Sun, Haoyang Su, Hanqi Sun, En Wang, Wenbin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is a promising paradigm that leverages mobile users and their smart portable devices to perform various real-world tasks. However, due to budget constraints and the inaccessibility of certain areas, Sparse MCS has emerged as a more practical alternative, collecting data from a limited number of target subareas and utilizing inference algorithms to complete the full sensing map. While existing approaches typically assume a time-discrete setting with data remaining constant within each sensing cycle, this simplification can introduce significant errors, especially when dealing with long cycles, as real-world sensing data often changes continuously. In this paper, we go from fine-grained completion, i.e., the subdivision of sensing cycles into minimal time units, towards a more accurate, time-continuous completion. We first introduce Deep Matrix Factorization (DMF) as a neural network-enabled framework and enhance it with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN-DMF) to capture temporal correlations in these finer time slices. To further deal with the continuous data, we propose TIME-DMF, which captures temporal information across unequal intervals, enabling time-continuous completion. Additionally, we present the Query-Generate (Q-G) strategy within TIME-DMF to model the infinite states of continuous data. Extensive experiments across five types of sensing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our models and the advantages of time-continuous completion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijie Mai, Yu Zhao, Ying Zeng, Jianhua Yao, Haifeng Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to effectively integrate information from various sources to infer sentiment, where in many cases there are no annotations for unimodal labels. Therefore, most works rely on multimodal labels for training. However, there exists the noisy label problem for the learning of unimodal signals as multimodal annotations are not always the ideal substitutes for the unimodal ones, failing to achieve finer optimization for individual modalities. In this paper, we explore the learning of unimodal labels under the weak supervision from the annotated multimodal labels. Specifically, we propose a novel meta uni-label generation (MUG) framework to address the above problem, which leverages the available multimodal labels to learn the corresponding unimodal labels by the meta uni-label correction network (MUCN). We first design a contrastive-based projection module to bridge the gap between unimodal and multimodal representations, so as to use multimodal annotations to guide the learning of MUCN. Afterwards, we propose unimodal and multimodal denoising tasks to train MUCN with explicit supervision via a bi-level optimization strategy. We then jointly train unimodal and multimodal learning tasks to extract discriminative unimodal features for multimodal inference. Experimental results suggest that MUG outperforms competitive baselines and can learn accurate unimodal labels.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine/deep learning to classify snoring sounds excited at different levels of the upper airway in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) using data from drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE). The snoring sounds of 39 subjects were analyzed and labeled according to the Velum, Oropharynx, Tongue Base, and Epiglottis (VOTE) classification system. The dataset, comprising 5,173 one-second segments, was used to train and test models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and ResNet-50. The ResNet-50, a convolutional neural network (CNN), showed the best overall performance in classifying snoring acoustics, particularly in identifying multi-level obstructions. The study emphasizes the potential of integrating snoring acoustics with deep learning to improve the diagnosis and treatment of OSA. However, challenges such as limited sample size, data imbalance, and differences between pharmacologically induced and natural snoring sounds were noted, suggesting further research to enhance model accuracy and generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinying Xiao, Ping Li, Jie Nie, Zhe Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language and vision models have shown strong performance, but due to high pre-training and fine-tuning costs, research has shifted towards faster training via dataset pruning. Previous methods used sample loss as an evaluation criterion, aiming to select the most "difficult" samples for training. However, when the pruning rate increases, the number of times each sample is trained becomes more evenly distributed, which causes many critical or general samples to not be effectively fitted. We refer to this as Low-Frequency Learning (LFL). In other words, LFL prevents the model from remembering most samples. In our work, we decompose the scoring function of LFL, provide a theoretical explanation for the inefficiency of LFL, and propose adding a memory term to the scoring function to enhance the model's memory capability, along with an approximation of this memory term. Similarly, we explore memory in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), marking the first discussion on SSL memory. Using contrastive learning, we derive the memory term both theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we propose Enhance Memory Pruning (EMP), which addresses the issue of insufficient memory under high pruning rates by enhancing the model's memory of data, thereby improving its performance. We evaluated the performance of EMP in tasks such as image classification, natural language understanding, and model pre-training. The results show that EMP can improve model performance under extreme pruning rates. For example, in the CIFAR100-ResNet50 pre-training task, with 70\% pruning, EMP outperforms current methods by 2.2\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Feng, Grace Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled understanding webpage contexts, product details, and human instructions. Utilizing LLMs as the foundational architecture for either reward models or policies in reinforcement learning has gained popularity -- a notable achievement is the success of InstructGPT. RL algorithms have been instrumental in maximizing long-term customer satisfaction and avoiding short-term, myopic goals in industrial recommender systems, which often rely on deep learning models to predict immediate clicks or purchases.
  In this project, several RL methods are implemented and evaluated using the WebShop benchmark environment, data, simulator, and pre-trained model checkpoints. The goal is to train an RL agent to maximize the purchase reward given a detailed human instruction describing a desired product. The RL agents are developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model with various objectives, learning from preferences without a reward model, and employing contemporary training techniques such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as used in InstructGPT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This report also evaluates the RL agents trained using generative trajectories. Evaluations were conducted using Thompson sampling in the WebShop simulator environment.
  The simulated online experiments demonstrate that agents trained on generated trajectories exhibited comparable task performance to those trained using human trajectories. This has demonstrated an example of an extremely low-cost data-efficient way of training reinforcement learning agents. Also, with limited training time (<2hours), without utilizing any images, a DPO agent achieved a 19% success rate after approximately 3000 steps or 30 minutes of training on T4 GPUs, compared to a PPO agent, which reached a 15% success rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ala-Eddine Benrazek, Zineddine Kouahla, Brahim Farou, Hamid Seridi, Ibtissem Kemouguette</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of interconnected devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to an exponential increase in data, commonly known as Big IoT Data. Efficient retrieval of this heterogeneous data demands a robust indexing mechanism for effective organization. However, a significant challenge remains: the overlap in data space partitions during index construction. This overlap increases node access during search and retrieval, resulting in higher resource consumption, performance bottlenecks, and impedes system scalability. To address this issue, we propose three innovative heuristics designed to quantify and strategically reduce data space partition overlap. The volume-based method (VBM) offers a detailed assessment by calculating the intersection volume between partitions, providing deeper insights into spatial relationships. The distance-based method (DBM) enhances efficiency by using the distance between partition centers and radii to evaluate overlap, offering a streamlined yet accurate approach. Finally, the object-based method (OBM) provides a practical solution by counting objects across multiple partitions, delivering an intuitive understanding of data space dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in reducing search time, underscoring their potential to improve data space partitioning and enhance overall system performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the most common subtype. This study aimed to identify key biomarkers associated with stage III NSCLC in non-smoking females using gene expression profiling from the GDS3837 dataset. Utilizing XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, the analysis achieved a strong predictive performance with an AUC score of 0.835. The top biomarkers identified - CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP-alpha), lactate dehydrogenase A4 (LDHA), UNC-45 myosin chaperone B (UNC-45B), checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF-1-alpha) - have been validated in the literature as being significantly linked to lung cancer. These findings highlight the potential of these biomarkers for early diagnosis and personalized therapy, emphasizing the value of integrating machine learning with molecular profiling in cancer research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leo Yeykelis, Kaavya Pichai, James J. Cummings, Byron Reeves</p>
<p>Abstract: This report analyzes the potential for large language models (LLMs) to expedite accurate replication of published message effects studies. We tested LLM-powered participants (personas) by replicating 133 experimental findings from 14 papers containing 45 recent studies in the Journal of Marketing (January 2023-May 2024). We used a new software tool, Viewpoints AI (https://viewpoints.ai/), that takes study designs, stimuli, and measures as input, automatically generates prompts for LLMs to act as a specified sample of unique personas, and collects their responses to produce a final output in the form of a complete dataset and statistical analysis. The underlying LLM used was Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5. We generated 19,447 AI personas to replicate these studies with the exact same sample attributes, study designs, stimuli, and measures reported in the original human research. Our LLM replications successfully reproduced 76% of the original main effects (84 out of 111), demonstrating strong potential for AI-assisted replication of studies in which people respond to media stimuli. When including interaction effects, the overall replication rate was 68% (90 out of 133). The use of LLMs to replicate and accelerate marketing research on media effects is discussed with respect to the replication crisis in social science, potential solutions to generalizability problems in sampling subjects and experimental conditions, and the ability to rapidly test consumer responses to various media stimuli. We also address the limitations of this approach, particularly in replicating complex interaction effects in media response studies, and suggest areas for future research and improvement in AI-assisted experimental replication of media effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash R. Wasil, Tom Reed, Jack William Miller, Peter Barnett</p>
<p>Abstract: What techniques can be used to verify compliance with international agreements about advanced AI development? In this paper, we examine 10 verification methods that could detect two types of potential violations: unauthorized AI training (e.g., training runs above a certain FLOP threshold) and unauthorized data centers. We divide the verification methods into three categories: (a) national technical means (methods requiring minimal or no access from suspected non-compliant nations), (b) access-dependent methods (methods that require approval from the nation suspected of unauthorized activities), and (c) hardware-dependent methods (methods that require rules around advanced hardware). For each verification method, we provide a description, historical precedents, and possible evasion techniques. We conclude by offering recommendations for future work related to the verification and enforcement of international AI governance agreements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saish Shinde</p>
<p>Abstract: Concerns regarding fairness and bias have been raised in recent years due to the growing use of machine learning models in crucial decision-making processes, especially when it comes to delicate characteristics like gender. In order to address biases in machine learning models, this research paper investigates advanced bias mitigation techniques, with a particular focus on counterfactual fairness in conjunction with data augmentation. The study looks into how these integrated approaches can lessen gender bias in the financial industry, specifically in loan approval procedures. We show that these approaches are effective in achieving more equitable results through thorough testing and assessment on a skewed financial dataset. The findings emphasize how crucial it is to use fairness-aware techniques when creating machine learning models in order to guarantee morally righteous and impartial decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglong Wang, Bongshin Lee, Steven Drucker, Dan Marshall, Jianfeng Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: To create rich visualizations, data analysts often need to iterate back and forth among data processing and chart specification to achieve their goals. To achieve this, analysts need not only proficiency in data transformation and visualization tools but also efforts to manage the branching history consisting of many different versions of data and charts. Recent LLM-powered AI systems have greatly improved visualization authoring experiences, for example by mitigating manual data transformation barriers via LLMs' code generation ability. However, these systems do not work well for iterative visualization authoring, because they often require analysts to provide, in a single turn, a text-only prompt that fully describes the complex visualization task to be performed, which is unrealistic to both users and models in many cases. In this paper, we present Data Formulator 2, an LLM-powered visualization system to address these challenges. With Data Formulator 2, users describe their visualization intent with blended UI and natural language inputs, and data transformation are delegated to AI. To support iteration, Data Formulator 2 lets users navigate their iteration history and reuse previous designs towards new ones so that they don't need to start from scratch every time. In a user study with eight participants, we observed that Data Formulator 2 allows participants to develop their own iteration strategies to complete challenging data exploration sessions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread use of charts and infographics as a means of data visualization in various domains has inspired recent research in automated chart understanding. However, information extraction from chart images is a complex multitasked process due to style variations and, as a consequence, it is challenging to design an end-to-end system. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based framework that provides a solution for key steps in the chart information extraction pipeline. The proposed framework utilizes hierarchal vision transformers for the tasks of chart-type and text-role classification, while YOLOv7 for text detection. The detected text is then enhanced using Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks to improve the recognition output of the OCR. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that our proposed framework achieves excellent performance at every stage with F1-scores of 0.97 for chart-type classification, 0.91 for text-role classification, and a mean Average Precision of 0.95 for text detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Chen, Jiaqi Su, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Shlomo Dubnov, Zeyu Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving robust speech separation for overlapping speakers in various acoustic environments with noise and reverberation remains an open challenge. Although existing datasets are available to train separators for specific scenarios, they do not effectively generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel data simulation pipeline that produces diverse training data from a range of acoustic environments and content, and propose new training paradigms to improve quality of a general speech separation model. Specifically, we first introduce AC-SIM, a data simulation pipeline that incorporates broad variations in both content and acoustics. Then we integrate multiple training objectives into the permutation invariant training (PIT) to enhance separation quality and generalization of the trained model. Finally, we conduct comprehensive objective and human listening experiments across separation architectures and benchmarks to validate our methods, demonstrating substantial improvement of generalization on both non-homologous and real-world test sets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces FRACTURED-SORRY-Bench, a framework for evaluating the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) against multi-turn conversational attacks. Building upon the SORRY-Bench dataset, we propose a simple yet effective method for generating adversarial prompts by breaking down harmful queries into seemingly innocuous sub-questions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duncan Taylor, Melissa Humphries</p>
<p>Abstract: DNA profiles are made up from multiple series of electrophoretic signal measuring fluorescence over time. Typically, human DNA analysts 'read' DNA profiles using their experience to distinguish instrument noise, artefactual signal, and signal corresponding to DNA fragments of interest. Recent work has developed an artificial neural network, ANN, to carry out the task of classifying fluorescence types into categories in DNA profile electrophoretic signal. But the creation of the necessarily large amount of labelled training data for the ANN is time consuming and expensive, and a limiting factor in the ability to robustly train the ANN. If realistic, prelabelled, training data could be simulated then this would remove the barrier to training an ANN with high efficacy. Here we develop a generative adversarial network, GAN, modified from the pix2pix GAN to achieve this task. With 1078 DNA profiles we train the GAN and achieve the ability to simulate DNA profile information, and then use the generator from the GAN as a 'realism filter' that applies the noise and artefact elements exhibited in typical electrophoretic signal.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting semantic types of columns in data lake tables is an important application. A key bottleneck in semantic type detection is the availability of human annotation due to the inherent complexity of data lakes. In this paper, we propose using programmatic weak supervision to assist in annotating the training data for semantic type detection by leveraging labeling functions. One challenge in this process is the difficulty of manually writing labeling functions due to the large volume and low quality of the data lake table datasets. To address this issue, we explore employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for labeling function generation and introduce several prompt engineering strategies for this purpose. We conduct experiments on real-world web table datasets. Based on the initial results, we perform extensive analysis and provide empirical insights and future directions for researchers in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steve Hanneke, Samory Kpotufe</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that some basic moduli of continuity $\delta$ -- which measure how fast target risk decreases as source risk decreases -- appear to be at the root of many of the classical relatedness measures in transfer learning and related literature. Namely, bounds in terms of $\delta$ recover many of the existing bounds in terms of other measures of relatedness -- both in regression and classification -- and can at times be tighter.
  We are particularly interested in general situations where the learner has access to both source data and some or no target data. The unified perspective allowed by the moduli $\delta$ allow us to extend many existing notions of relatedness at once to these scenarios involving target data: interestingly, while $\delta$ itself might not be efficiently estimated, adaptive procedures exist -- based on reductions to confidence sets -- which can get nearly tight rates in terms of $\delta$ with no prior distributional knowledge. Such adaptivity to unknown $\delta$ immediately implies adaptivity to many classical relatedness notions, in terms of combined source and target samples' sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Yu, Quanli Liu, Wei Wang, Liyong Zhang, Xiaoguang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, LSS-based multi-view 3D object detection provides an economical and deployment-friendly solution for autonomous driving. However, all the existing LSS-based methods transform multi-view image features into a Cartesian Bird's-Eye-View(BEV) representation, which does not take into account the non-uniform image information distribution and hardly exploits the view symmetry. In this paper, in order to adapt the image information distribution and preserve the view symmetry by regular convolution, we propose to employ the polar BEV representation to substitute the Cartesian BEV representation. To achieve this, we elaborately tailor three modules: a polar view transformer to generate the polar BEV representation, a polar temporal fusion module for fusing historical polar BEV features and a polar detection head to predict the polar-parameterized representation of the object. In addition, we design a 2D auxiliary detection head and a spatial attention enhancement module to improve the quality of feature extraction in perspective view and BEV, respectively. Finally, we integrate the above improvements into a novel multi-view 3D object detector, PolarBEVDet. Experiments on nuScenes show that PolarBEVDet achieves the superior performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Dong, Rubing Huang, Chenhui Cui, Dave Towey, Ling Zhou, Jinyu Tian, Jianzhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Short-Term Electricity-Load Forecasting (STELF) refers to the prediction of the immediate demand (in the next few hours to several days) for the power system. Various external factors, such as weather changes and the emergence of new electricity consumption scenarios, can impact electricity demand, causing load data to fluctuate and become non-linear, which increases the complexity and difficulty of STELF. In the past decade, deep learning has been applied to STELF, modeling and predicting electricity demand with high accuracy, and contributing significantly to the development of STELF. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on deep-learning-based STELF over the past ten years. It examines the entire forecasting process, including data pre-processing, feature extraction, deep-learning modeling and optimization, and results evaluation. This paper also identifies some research challenges and potential research directions to be further investigated in future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonggwon Park, Soobum Kim, Byungmu Yoon, Jihun Hyun, Kyoyun Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, especially in large language models (LLMs), has significantly impacted various domains, including healthcare. In chest X-ray (CXR) analysis, previous studies have employed LLMs, but with limitations: either underutilizing the multi-tasking capabilities of LLMs or lacking clinical accuracy. This paper presents M4CXR, a multi-modal LLM designed to enhance CXR interpretation. The model is trained on a visual instruction-following dataset that integrates various task-specific datasets in a conversational format. As a result, the model supports multiple tasks such as medical report generation (MRG), visual grounding, and visual question answering (VQA). M4CXR achieves state-of-the-art clinical accuracy in MRG by employing a chain-of-thought prompting strategy, in which it identifies findings in CXR images and subsequently generates corresponding reports. The model is adaptable to various MRG scenarios depending on the available inputs, such as single-image, multi-image, and multi-study contexts. In addition to MRG, M4CXR performs visual grounding at a level comparable to specialized models and also demonstrates outstanding performance in VQA. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments reveal M4CXR's versatility in MRG, visual grounding, and VQA, while consistently maintaining clinical accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech dysfluency modeling is the core module for spoken language learning, and speech therapy. However, there are three challenges. First, current state-of-the-art solutions suffer from poor scalability. Second, there is a lack of a large-scale dysfluency corpus. Third, there is not an effective learning framework. In this paper, we propose \textit{SSDM: Scalable Speech Dysfluency Modeling}, which (1) adopts articulatory gestures as scalable forced alignment; (2) introduces connectionist subsequence aligner (CSA) to achieve dysfluency alignment; (3) introduces a large-scale simulated dysfluency corpus called Libri-Dys; and (4) develops an end-to-end system by leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs). We expect SSDM to serve as a standard in the area of dysfluency modeling. Demo is available at \url{https://eureka235.github.io}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) typically employ vision encoders based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. The division of the images into patches by ViT results in a fragmented perception, thereby hindering the visual understanding capabilities of VLMs. In this paper, we propose an innovative enhancement to address this limitation by introducing a Scene Graph Expression (SGE) module in VLMs. This module extracts and structurally expresses the complex semantic information within images, thereby improving the foundational perception and understanding abilities of VLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating our SGE module significantly enhances the VLM's performance in vision-language tasks, indicating its effectiveness in preserving intricate semantic details and facilitating better visual understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhui Zeng, Hongkun Cao, Xin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: In optoelectronics, designing free-form metasurfaces presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving high electromagnetic response fidelity due to the complex relationship between physical structures and electromagnetic behaviors. A key difficulty arises from the one-to-many mapping dilemma, where multiple distinct physical structures can yield similar electromagnetic responses, complicating the design process. This paper introduces a novel generative framework, the Anchor-controlled Generative Adversarial Network (AcGAN), which prioritizes electromagnetic fidelity while effectively navigating the one-to-many challenge to create structurally diverse metasurfaces. Unlike existing methods that mainly replicate physical appearances, AcGAN excels in generating a variety of structures that, despite their differences in physical attributes, exhibit similar electromagnetic responses, thereby accommodating fabrication constraints and tolerances. We introduce the Spectral Overlap Coefficient (SOC) as a precise metric to measure the spectral fidelity between generated designs and their targets. Additionally, a cluster-guided controller refines input processing, ensuring multi-level spectral integration and enhancing electromagnetic fidelity. The integration of AnchorNet into our loss function facilitates a nuanced assessment of electromagnetic qualities, supported by a dynamic loss weighting strategy that optimizes spectral alignment. Collectively, these innovations represent a transformative stride in metasurface inverse design, advancing electromagnetic response-oriented engineering and overcoming the complexities of the one-to-many mapping dilemma.Empirical evidence underscores AcGAN's effectiveness in streamlining the design process, achieving superior electromagnetic precision, and fostering a broad spectrum of design possibilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kshitij Pathania</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of image synthesis, achieving fidelity to a reference image while adhering to conditional prompts remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates a diffusion model with latent space manipulation and gradient-based selective attention mechanisms to address this issue. Leveraging Grad-SAM (Gradient-based Selective Attention Manipulation), we analyze the cross attention maps of the cross attention layers and gradients for the denoised latent vector, deriving importance scores of elements of denoised latent vector related to the subject of interest. Using this information, we create masks at specific timesteps during denoising to preserve subjects while seamlessly integrating the reference image features. This approach ensures the faithful formation of subjects based on conditional prompts, while concurrently refining the background for a more coherent composition. Our experiments on places365 dataset demonstrate promising results, with our proposed model achieving the lowest mean and median Frechet Inception Distance (FID) scores compared to baseline models, indicating superior fidelity preservation. Furthermore, our model exhibits competitive performance in aligning the generated images with provided textual descriptions, as evidenced by high CLIP scores. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in both fidelity preservation and textual context preservation, offering a significant advancement in text-to-image synthesis tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xia Jiang, Yijun Zhou, Alan Wells, Adam Brufsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the two cancers responsible for the most deaths in women, with about 42,000 deaths each year in the US. That there are over 300,000 breast cancers newly diagnosed each year suggests that only a fraction of the cancers result in mortality. Thus, most of the women undergo seemingly curative treatment for localized cancers, but a significant later succumb to metastatic disease for which current treatments are only temporizing for the vast majority. The current prognostic metrics are of little actionable value for 4 of the 5 women seemingly cured after local treatment, and many women are exposed to morbid and even mortal adjuvant therapies unnecessarily, with these adjuvant therapies reducing metastatic recurrence by only a third. Thus, there is a need for better prognostics to target aggressive treatment at those who are likely to relapse and spare those who were actually cured. While there is a plethora of molecular and tumor-marker assays in use and under-development to detect recurrence early, these are time consuming, expensive and still often un-validated as to actionable prognostic utility. A different approach would use large data techniques to determine clinical and histopathological parameters that would provide accurate prognostics using existing data. Herein, we report on machine learning, together with grid search and Bayesian Networks to develop algorithms that present a AUC of up to 0.9 in ROC analyses, using only extant data. Such algorithms could be rapidly translated to clinical management as they do not require testing beyond routine tumor evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sekitoshi Kanai, Yasutoshi Ida, Kazuki Adachi, Mihiro Uchida, Tsukasa Yoshida, Shin'ya Yamaguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates a method to evaluate time-series datasets in terms of the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) with state space models (deep SSMs) trained on the dataset. SSMs have attracted attention as components inside DNNs to address time-series data. Since deep SSMs have powerful representation capacities, training datasets play a crucial role in solving a new task. However, the effectiveness of training datasets cannot be known until deep SSMs are actually trained on them. This can increase the cost of data collection for new tasks, as a trial-and-error process of data collection and time-consuming training are needed to achieve the necessary performance. To advance the practical use of deep SSMs, the metric of datasets to estimate the performance early in the training can be one key element. To this end, we introduce the concept of data evaluation methods used in system identification. In system identification of linear dynamical systems, the effectiveness of datasets is evaluated by using the spectrum of input signals. We introduce this concept to deep SSMs, which are nonlinear dynamical systems. We propose the K-spectral metric, which is the sum of the top-K spectra of signals inside deep SSMs, by focusing on the fact that each layer of a deep SSM can be regarded as a linear dynamical system. Our experiments show that the K-spectral metric has a large absolute value of the correlation coefficient with the performance and can be used to evaluate the quality of training datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can benefit from mitigating hallucinations through fact-checking and overcoming substantial computational overhead with parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). While some studies have explored the parallel integration of multiple LoRAs, these approaches need attention to the connections between them. This paper investigates methods to establish connections among multiple LoRAs. We create three reasoning datasets tailored to fact-checking and fine-tune individual LoRAs, allowing them to view and reason from diverse perspectives. Then, we explore strategies for allocating these reasoning LoRAs and introduce LoraMap, an approach to map connections between them. The results on the fact-checking task demonstrate that the performance of LoraMap is superior to LoraHub, an existing LoRA composition method. LoraMap also outperforms with significantly fewer parameters than LoraConcat, which concatenates LoRAs and further fine-tunes them.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) models excel in accuracy but often overlook open-world challenges posed by open-vocabulary queries and untrimmed videos. This leads to unreliable predictions for noisy, corrupted, and out-of-distribution data. Adapting VTG models to dynamically estimate uncertainties based on user input can address this issue. To this end, we introduce SRAM, a robust network module that benefits from a two-stage cross-modal alignment task. More importantly, it integrates Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to explicitly and thoroughly quantify uncertainty during training, thus allowing the model to say "I do not know" in scenarios beyond its handling capacity. However, the direct application of traditional DER theory and its regularizer reveals structural flaws, leading to unintended constraints in VTG tasks. In response, we develop a simple yet effective Geom-regularizer that enhances the uncertainty learning framework from the ground up. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful attempt of DER in VTG. Our extensive quantitative and qualitative results affirm the effectiveness, robustness, and interpretability of our modules and the uncertainty learning paradigm in VTG tasks. The code will be made available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xunkai Li, Yinlin Zhu, Boyang Pang, Guochen Yan, Yeyu Yan, Zening Li, Zhengyu Wu, Wentao Zhang, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising distributed training paradigm for graph neural networks across multiple local systems without direct data sharing. This approach is particularly beneficial in privacy-sensitive scenarios and offers a new perspective on addressing scalability challenges in large-scale graph learning. Despite the proliferation of FGL, the diverse motivations from practical applications, spanning various research backgrounds and experimental settings, pose a significant challenge to fair evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose OpenFGL, a unified benchmark designed for the primary FGL scenarios: Graph-FL and Subgraph-FL. Specifically, OpenFGL includes 38 graph datasets from 16 application domains, 8 federated data simulation strategies that emphasize graph properties, and 5 graph-based downstream tasks. Additionally, it offers 18 recently proposed SOTA FGL algorithms through a user-friendly API, enabling a thorough comparison and comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the ability of FGL while also revealing its potential limitations, offering valuable insights for future exploration in this thriving field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian Ye, Zicheng Xu, Yuanzhi Li, Zeyuan Allen-Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving reasoning tasks; however, even the strongest models still occasionally make reasoning mistakes. Recently, there has been active research aimed at improving reasoning accuracy, particularly by using pretrained language models to "self-correct" their mistakes via multi-round prompting. In this paper, we follow this line of work but focus on understanding the usefulness of incorporating "error-correction" data directly into the pretraining stage. This data consists of erroneous solution steps immediately followed by their corrections. Using a synthetic math dataset, we show promising results: this type of pretrain data can help language models achieve higher reasoning accuracy directly (i.e., through simple auto-regression, without multi-round prompting) compared to pretraining on the same amount of error-free data. We also delve into many details, such as (1) how this approach differs from beam search, (2) how such data can be prepared, (3) whether masking is needed on the erroneous tokens, (4) the amount of error required, (5) whether such data can be deferred to the fine-tuning stage, and many others.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxuan Wang, Xiaocong Li, Adrish Bhaumik, Prahlad Vadakkepat</p>
<p>Abstract: Controller tuning and optimization have been among the most fundamental problems in robotics and mechatronic systems. The traditional methodology is usually model-based, but its performance heavily relies on an accurate mathematical model of the system. In control applications with complex dynamics, obtaining a precise model is often challenging, leading us towards a data-driven approach. While optimizing a single controller has been explored by various researchers, it remains a challenge to obtain the optimal controller parameters safely and efficiently when multiple controllers are involved. In this paper, we propose a high-dimensional safe Bayesian optimization method based on additive Gaussian processes to optimize multiple controllers simultaneously and safely. Additive Gaussian kernels replace the traditional squared-exponential kernels or Mat\'ern kernels, enhancing the efficiency with which Gaussian processes update information on unknown functions. Experimental results on a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) demonstrate that compared to existing safe Bayesian optimization algorithms, our method can obtain optimal parameters more efficiently while ensuring safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukang Huo, Mingyuan Yao, Qingbin Tian, Tonghao Wang, Ruifeng Wang, Haihua Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past few years, the YOLO series of models has emerged as one of the dominant methodologies in the realm of object detection. Many studies have advanced these baseline models by modifying their architectures, enhancing data quality, and developing new loss functions. However, current models still exhibit deficiencies in processing feature maps, such as overlooking the fusion of cross-scale features and a static fusion approach that lacks the capability for dynamic feature adjustment. To address these issues, this paper introduces an efficient Fine-grained Multi-scale Dynamic Selection Module (FMDS Module), which applies a more effective dynamic feature selection and fusion method on fine-grained multi-scale feature maps, significantly enhancing the detection accuracy of small, medium, and large-sized targets in complex environments. Furthermore, this paper proposes an Adaptive Gated Multi-branch Focus Fusion Module (AGMF Module), which utilizes multiple parallel branches to perform complementary fusion of various features captured by the gated unit branch, FMDS Module branch, and TripletAttention branch. This approach further enhances the comprehensiveness, diversity, and integrity of feature fusion. This paper has integrated the FMDS Module, AGMF Module, into Yolov9 to develop a novel object detection model named FA-YOLO. Extensive experimental results show that under identical experimental conditions, FA-YOLO achieves an outstanding 66.1% mean Average Precision (mAP) on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, representing 1.0% improvement over YOLOv9's 65.1%. Additionally, the detection accuracies of FA-YOLO for small, medium, and large targets are 44.1%, 54.6%, and 70.8%, respectively, showing improvements of 2.0%, 3.1%, and 0.9% compared to YOLOv9's 42.1%, 51.5%, and 69.9%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Alemohammad, Ahmed Imtiaz Humayun, Shruti Agarwal, John Collomosse, Richard Baraniuk</p>
<p>Abstract: The artificial intelligence (AI) world is running out of real data for training increasingly large generative models, resulting in accelerating pressure to train on synthetic data. Unfortunately, training new generative models with synthetic data from current or past generation models creates an autophagous (self-consuming) loop that degrades the quality and/or diversity of the synthetic data in what has been termed model autophagy disorder (MAD) and model collapse. Current thinking around model autophagy recommends that synthetic data is to be avoided for model training lest the system deteriorate into MADness. In this paper, we take a different tack that treats synthetic data differently from real data. Self-IMproving diffusion models with Synthetic data (SIMS) is a new training concept for diffusion models that uses self-synthesized data to provide negative guidance during the generation process to steer a model's generative process away from the non-ideal synthetic data manifold and towards the real data distribution. We demonstrate that SIMS is capable of self-improvement; it establishes new records based on the Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) metric for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64 generation and achieves competitive results on FFHQ-64 and ImageNet-512. Moreover, SIMS is, to the best of our knowledge, the first prophylactic generative AI algorithm that can be iteratively trained on self-generated synthetic data without going MAD. As a bonus, SIMS can adjust a diffusion model's synthetic data distribution to match any desired in-domain target distribution to help mitigate biases and ensure fairness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss, executive dysfunction, and personality changes. Early diagnosis is challenging due to subtle symptoms and varied presentations, often leading to misdiagnosis with traditional unimodal diagnostic methods due to their limited scope. This study introduces an advanced multimodal classification model that integrates clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and EEG data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The model incorporates a feature tagger with a tabular data coding architecture and utilizes the TimesBlock module to capture intricate temporal patterns in Electroencephalograms (EEG) data. By employing Cross-modal Attention Aggregation module, the model effectively fuses Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) spatial information with EEG temporal data, significantly improving the distinction between AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Normal Cognition. Simultaneously, we have constructed the first AD classification dataset that includes three modalities: EEG, MRI, and tabular data. Our innovative approach aims to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention, potentially slowing the progression of AD.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiezhu Sun, Nadia Daoudi, Kisub Kim, Kevin Allix, Tegawend\'e F. Bissyand\'e, Jacques Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in ML and DL have significantly improved Android malware detection, yet many methodologies still rely on basic static analysis, bytecode, or function call graphs that often fail to capture complex malicious behaviors. DexBERT, a pre-trained BERT-like model tailored for Android representation learning, enriches class-level representations by analyzing Smali code extracted from APKs. However, its functionality is constrained by its inability to process multiple Smali classes simultaneously. This paper introduces DetectBERT, which integrates correlated Multiple Instance Learning (c-MIL) with DexBERT to handle the high dimensionality and variability of Android malware, enabling effective app-level detection. By treating class-level features as instances within MIL bags, DetectBERT aggregates these into a comprehensive app-level representation. Our evaluation demonstrates that DetectBERT not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art detection methods but also adapts to evolving malware threats. Moreover, the versatility of the DetectBERT framework holds promising potential for broader applications in app-level analysis and other software engineering tasks, offering new avenues for research and development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianchi Yu, Yiming Qi, Ivan Oseledets, Shiyi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: With growing investigations into solving partial differential equations by physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), more accurate and efficient PINNs are required to meet the practical demands of scientific computing. One bottleneck of current PINNs is computing the high-order derivatives via automatic differentiation which often necessitates substantial computing resources. In this paper, we focus on removing the automatic differentiation of the spatial derivatives and propose a spectral-based neural network that substitutes the differential operator with a multiplication. Compared to the PINNs, our approach requires lower memory and shorter training time. Thanks to the exponential convergence of the spectral basis, our approach is more accurate. Moreover, to handle the different situations between physics domain and spectral domain, we provide two strategies to train networks by their spectral information. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, We validate the aforementioned merits of our proposed network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiefeng Li, Ye Yuan, Davis Rempe, Haotian Zhang, Pavlo Molchanov, Cewu Lu, Jan Kautz, Umar Iqbal</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating global human motion from moving cameras is challenging due to the entanglement of human and camera motions. To mitigate the ambiguity, existing methods leverage learned human motion priors, which however often result in oversmoothed motions with misaligned 2D projections. To tackle this problem, we propose COIN, a control-inpainting motion diffusion prior that enables fine-grained control to disentangle human and camera motions. Although pre-trained motion diffusion models encode rich motion priors, we find it non-trivial to leverage such knowledge to guide global motion estimation from RGB videos. COIN introduces a novel control-inpainting score distillation sampling method to ensure well-aligned, consistent, and high-quality motion from the diffusion prior within a joint optimization framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new human-scene relation loss to alleviate the scale ambiguity by enforcing consistency among the humans, camera, and scene. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COIN, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of global human motion estimation and camera motion estimation. As an illustrative example, COIN outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 33% in world joint position error (W-MPJPE) on the RICH dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Conor Heins, Hao Wu, Dimitrije Markovic, Alexander Tschantz, Jeff Beck, Christopher Buckley</p>
<p>Abstract: Balancing computational efficiency with robust predictive performance is crucial in supervised learning, especially for critical applications. Standard deep learning models, while accurate and scalable, often lack probabilistic features like calibrated predictions and uncertainty quantification. Bayesian methods address these issues but can be computationally expensive as model and data complexity increase. Previous work shows that fast variational methods can reduce the compute requirements of Bayesian methods by eliminating the need for gradient computation or sampling, but are often limited to simple models. We demonstrate that conditional mixture networks (CMNs), a probabilistic variant of the mixture-of-experts (MoE) model, are suitable for fast, gradient-free inference and can solve complex classification tasks. CMNs employ linear experts and a softmax gating network. By exploiting conditional conjugacy and P\'olya-Gamma augmentation, we furnish Gaussian likelihoods for the weights of both the linear experts and the gating network. This enables efficient variational updates using coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI), avoiding traditional gradient-based optimization. We validate this approach by training two-layer CMNs on standard benchmarks from the UCI repository. Our method, CAVI-CMN, achieves competitive and often superior predictive accuracy compared to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with backpropagation, while maintaining competitive runtime and full posterior distributions over all model parameters. Moreover, as input size or the number of experts increases, computation time scales competitively with MLE and other gradient-based solutions like black-box variational inference (BBVI), making CAVI-CMN a promising tool for deep, fast, and gradient-free Bayesian networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human activity recognition is a major field of study that employs computer vision, machine vision, and deep learning techniques to categorize human actions. The field of deep learning has made significant progress, with architectures that are extremely effective at capturing human dynamics. This study emphasizes the influence of feature fusion on the accuracy of activity recognition. This technique addresses the limitation of conventional models, which face difficulties in identifying activities because of their limited capacity to understand spatial and temporal features. The technique employs sensory data obtained from four publicly available datasets: HuGaDB, PKU-MMD, LARa, and TUG. The accuracy and F1-score of two deep learning models, specifically a Transformer model and a Parameter-Optimized Graph Convolutional Network (PO-GCN), were evaluated using these datasets. The feature fusion technique integrated the final layer features from both models and inputted them into a classifier. Empirical evidence demonstrates that PO-GCN outperforms standard models in activity recognition. HuGaDB demonstrated a 2.3% improvement in accuracy and a 2.2% increase in F1-score. TUG showed a 5% increase in accuracy and a 0.5% rise in F1-score. On the other hand, LARa and PKU-MMD achieved lower accuracies of 64% and 69% respectively. This indicates that the integration of features enhanced the performance of both the Transformer model and PO-GCN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated commendable performance for graph-structured data. Yet, GNNs are often vulnerable to adversarial structural attacks as embedding generation relies on graph topology. Existing efforts are dedicated to purifying the maliciously modified structure or applying adaptive aggregation, thereby enhancing the robustness against adversarial structural attacks. It is inevitable for a defender to consume heavy computational costs due to lacking prior knowledge about modified structures. To this end, we propose an efficient defense method, called Simple and Fast Robust Graph Neural Network (SFR-GNN), supported by mutual information theory. The SFR-GNN first pre-trains a GNN model using node attributes and then fine-tunes it over the modified graph in the manner of contrastive learning, which is free of purifying modified structures and adaptive aggregation, thus achieving great efficiency gains. Consequently, SFR-GNN exhibits a 24%--162% speedup compared to advanced robust models, demonstrating superior robustness for node classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning representations with a high Probability of Necessary and Sufficient Causes (PNS) has been shown to enhance deep learning models' ability. This task involves identifying causal features that are both sufficient (guaranteeing the outcome) and necessary (without which the outcome cannot occur). However, current research predominantly focuses on unimodal data, and extending PNS learning to multimodal settings presents significant challenges. The challenges arise as the conditions for PNS identifiability, Exogeneity and Monotonicity, need to be reconsidered in a multimodal context, where sufficient and necessary causal features are distributed across different modalities. To address this, we first propose conceptualizing multimodal representations as comprising modality-invariant and modality-specific components. We then analyze PNS identifiability for each component, while ensuring non-trivial PNS estimation. Finally, we formulate tractable optimization objectives that enable multimodal models to learn high-PNS representations, thereby enhancing their predictive performance. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Copilot, are transforming software development by automating code generation and, arguably, enable rapid prototyping, support education, and boost productivity. Therefore, correctness and quality of the generated code should be on par with manually written code. To assess the current state of LLMs in generating correct code of high quality, we conducted controlled experiments with ChatGPT and Copilot: we let the LLMs generate simple algorithms in Java and Python along with the corresponding unit tests and assessed the correctness and the quality (coverage) of the generated (test) codes. We observed significant differences between the LLMs, between the languages, between algorithm and test codes, and over time. The present paper reports these results together with the experimental methods allowing repeated and comparable assessments for more algorithms, languages, and LLMs over time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Distracted driving is a leading cause of road accidents globally. Identification of distracted driving involves reliably detecting and classifying various forms of driver distraction (e.g., texting, eating, or using in-car devices) from in-vehicle camera feeds to enhance road safety. This task is challenging due to the need for robust models that can generalize to a diverse set of driver behaviors without requiring extensive annotated datasets. In this paper, we propose KiD3, a novel method for distracted driver detection (DDD) by infusing auxiliary knowledge about semantic relations between entities in a scene and the structural configuration of the driver's pose. Specifically, we construct a unified framework that integrates the scene graphs, and driver pose information with the visual cues in video frames to create a holistic representation of the driver's actions.Our results indicate that KiD3 achieves a 13.64% accuracy improvement over the vision-only baseline by incorporating such auxiliary knowledge with visual information.</p>

Prior approaches either involve deep learning models, which require many observed networks for training, or stylized models, which are limited in their realism and flexibility. In contrast, LLMs offer the potential for zero-shot and flexible network generation. However, two key questions are: (1) are LLM's generated networks realistic, and (2) what are risks of bias, given the importance of demographics in forming social ties? To answer these questions, we develop three prompting methods for network generation and compare the generated networks to real social networks. We find that more realistic networks are generated with "local" methods, where the LLM constructs relations for one persona at a time, compared to "global" methods that construct the entire network at once. We also find that the generated networks match real networks on many characteristics, including density, clustering, community structure, and degree. However, we find that LLMs emphasize political homophily over all other types of homophily and overestimate political homophily relative to real-world measures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Evanusa, Cornelia Ferm\"uller, Yiannis Aloimonos</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks has struggled to devise a way to incorporate working memory into neural networks. While the ``long term'' memory can be seen as the learned weights, the working memory consists likely more of dynamical activity, that is missing from feed-forward models. Current state of the art models such as transformers tend to ``solve'' this by ignoring working memory entirely and simply process the sequence as an entire piece of data; however this means the network cannot process the sequence in an online fashion, and leads to an immense explosion in memory requirements. Here, inspired by a combination of controls, reservoir computing, deep learning, and recurrent neural networks, we offer an alternative paradigm that combines the strength of recurrent networks, with the pattern matching capability of feed-forward neural networks, which we call the \textit{Maelstrom Networks} paradigm. This paradigm leaves the recurrent component - the \textit{Maelstrom} - unlearned, and offloads the learning to a powerful feed-forward network. This allows the network to leverage the strength of feed-forward training without unrolling the network, and allows for the memory to be implemented in new neuromorphic hardware. It endows a neural network with a sequential memory that takes advantage of the inductive bias that data is organized causally in the temporal domain, and imbues the network with a state that represents the agent's ``self'', moving through the environment. This could also lead the way to continual learning, with the network modularized and ``'protected'' from overwrites that come with new data. In addition to aiding in solving these performance problems that plague current non-temporal deep networks, this also could finally lead towards endowing artificial networks with a sense of ``self''.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuan Shi, Jing Yan, Xiaoli Tang, Lingjuan Lyu, Boi Faltings</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing sophistication of text-to-image generative models has led to complex challenges in defining and enforcing copyright infringement criteria and protection. Existing methods, such as watermarking and dataset deduplication, fail to provide comprehensive solutions due to the lack of standardized metrics and the inherent complexity of addressing copyright infringement in diffusion models. To deal with these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning-based Copyright Protection(RLCP) method for Text-to-Image Diffusion Model, which minimizes the generation of copyright-infringing content while maintaining the quality of the model-generated dataset. Our approach begins with the introduction of a novel copyright metric grounded in copyright law and court precedents on infringement. We then utilize the Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) framework to guide the model through a multi-step decision-making process, optimizing it using a reward function that incorporates our proposed copyright metric. Additionally, we employ KL divergence as a regularization term to mitigate some failure modes and stabilize RL fine-tuning. Experiments conducted on 3 mixed datasets of copyright and non-copyright images demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces copyright infringement risk while maintaining image quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongjie Fu, Anmol Jain, Xuan Di, Xu Chen, Zhaobin Mo</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of autonomous driving technologies necessitates increasingly sophisticated methods for understanding and predicting real-world scenarios. Vision language models (VLMs) are emerging as revolutionary tools with significant potential to influence autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose the DriveGenVLM framework to generate driving videos and use VLMs to understand them. To achieve this, we employ a video generation framework grounded in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) aimed at predicting real-world video sequences. We then explore the adequacy of our generated videos for use in VLMs by employing a pre-trained model known as Efficient In-context Learning on Egocentric Videos (EILEV). The diffusion model is trained with the Waymo open dataset and evaluated using the Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) score to ensure the quality and realism of the generated videos. Corresponding narrations are provided by EILEV for these generated videos, which may be beneficial in the autonomous driving domain. These narrations can enhance traffic scene understanding, aid in navigation, and improve planning capabilities. The integration of video generation with VLMs in the DriveGenVLM framework represents a significant step forward in leveraging advanced AI models to address complex challenges in autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangyuan Yu, Hardeep Singh Arora, Matt Johnson</p>
<p>Abstract: By compressing diverse narratives, LLMs go beyond memorization, achieving intelligence by capturing generalizable causal relationships. However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules. Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable. Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning. To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm. A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers. These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-vector dense models, such as ColBERT, have proven highly effective in information retrieval. ColBERT's late interaction scoring approximates the joint query-document attention seen in cross-encoders while maintaining inference efficiency closer to traditional dense retrieval models, thanks to its bi-encoder architecture and recent optimizations in indexing and search. In this paper, we introduce several improvements to the ColBERT model architecture and training pipeline, leveraging techniques successful in the more established single-vector embedding model paradigm, particularly those suited for heterogeneous multilingual data. Our new model, Jina-ColBERT-v2, demonstrates strong performance across a range of English and multilingual retrieval tasks, while also cutting storage requirements by up to 50% compared to previous models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziniu Li, Congliang Chen, Tian Xu, Zeyu Qin, Jiancong Xiao, Ruoyu Sun, Zhi-Quan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to specialize in downstream tasks. Cross Entropy (CE) loss is the de facto choice in SFT, but it often leads to overfitting and limited output diversity due to its aggressive updates to the data distribution. This paper aim to address these issues by introducing the maximum entropy principle, which favors models with flatter distributions that still effectively capture the data. Specifically, we develop a new distribution matching method called GEM, which solves reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization with an entropy regularizer.
  For the SFT of Llama-3-8B models, GEM outperforms CE in several aspects. First, when applied to the UltraFeedback dataset to develop general instruction-following abilities, GEM exhibits reduced overfitting, evidenced by lower perplexity and better performance on the IFEval benchmark. Furthermore, GEM enhances output diversity, leading to performance gains of up to 7 points on math reasoning and code generation tasks using best-of-n sampling, even without domain-specific data. Second, when fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets for math reasoning and code generation, GEM also shows less overfitting and improvements of up to 10 points compared with CE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Attila Lischka, Jiaming Wu, Morteza Haghir Chehreghani, Bal\'azs Kulcs\'ar</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last years, many neural network-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, GNNs are inherently not well suited to operate on dense graphs, such as in routing problems. Furthermore, models operating on Euclidean coordinates cannot be applied to non-Euclidean versions of routing problems that are often found in real-world settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel GNN-related edge-based neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). We evaluate the performance of GREAT in the edge-classification task to predict optimal edges in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We can use such a trained GREAT model to produce sparse TSP graph instances, keeping only the edges GREAT finds promising. Compared to other, non-learning-based methods to sparsify TSP graphs, GREAT can produce very sparse graphs while keeping most of the optimal edges. Furthermore, we build a reinforcement learning-based GREAT framework which we apply to Euclidean and non-Euclidean asymmetric TSP. This framework achieves state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hritik Bansal, Arian Hosseini, Rishabh Agarwal, Vinh Q. Tran, Mehran Kazemi</p>
<p>Abstract: Training on high-quality synthetic data from strong language models (LMs) is a common strategy to improve the reasoning performance of LMs. In this work, we revisit whether this strategy is compute-optimal under a fixed inference budget (e.g., FLOPs). To do so, we investigate the trade-offs between generating synthetic data using a stronger but more expensive (SE) model versus a weaker but cheaper (WC) model. We evaluate the generated data across three key metrics: coverage, diversity, and false positive rate, and show that the data from WC models may have higher coverage and diversity, but also exhibit higher false positive rates. We then finetune LMs on data from SE and WC models in different settings: knowledge distillation, self-improvement, and a novel weak-to-strong improvement setup where a weaker LM teaches reasoning to a stronger LM. Our findings reveal that models finetuned on WC-generated data consistently outperform those trained on SE-generated data across multiple benchmarks and multiple choices of WC and SE models. These results challenge the prevailing practice of relying on SE models for synthetic data generation, suggesting that WC may be the compute-optimal approach for training advanced LM reasoners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beidi Dong, Jin R. Lee, Ziwei Zhu, Balassubramanian Srinivasan</p>
<p>Abstract: The United States has experienced a significant increase in violent extremism, prompting the need for automated tools to detect and limit the spread of extremist ideology online. This study evaluates the performance of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) in detecting and classifying online domestic extremist posts. We collected social media posts containing "far-right" and "far-left" ideological keywords and manually labeled them as extremist or non-extremist. Extremist posts were further classified into one or more of five contributing elements of extremism based on a working definitional framework. The BERT model's performance was evaluated based on training data size and knowledge transfer between categories. We also compared the performance of GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 models using different prompts: na\"ive, layperson-definition, role-playing, and professional-definition. Results showed that the best performing GPT models outperformed the best performing BERT models, with more detailed prompts generally yielding better results. However, overly complex prompts may impair performance. Different versions of GPT have unique sensitives to what they consider extremist. GPT 3.5 performed better at classifying far-left extremist posts, while GPT 4 performed better at classifying far-right extremist posts. Large language models, represented by GPT models, hold significant potential for online extremism classification tasks, surpassing traditional BERT models in a zero-shot setting. Future research should explore human-computer interactions in optimizing GPT models for extremist detection and classification tasks to develop more efficient (e.g., quicker, less effort) and effective (e.g., fewer errors or mistakes) methods for identifying extremist content.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting test-time distribution shift has emerged as a key capability for safely deployed machine learning models, with the question being tackled under various guises in recent years. In this paper, we aim to provide a consolidated view of the two largest sub-fields within the community: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and open-set recognition (OSR). In particular, we aim to provide rigorous empirical analysis of different methods across settings and provide actionable takeaways for practitioners and researchers. Concretely, we make the following contributions: (i) We perform rigorous cross-evaluation between state-of-the-art methods in the OOD detection and OSR settings and identify a strong correlation between the performances of methods for them; (ii) We propose a new, large-scale benchmark setting which we suggest better disentangles the problem tackled by OOD detection and OSR, re-evaluating state-of-the-art OOD detection and OSR methods in this setting; (iii) We surprisingly find that the best performing method on standard benchmarks (Outlier Exposure) struggles when tested at scale, while scoring rules which are sensitive to the deep feature magnitude consistently show promise; and (iv) We conduct empirical analysis to explain these phenomena and highlight directions for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gen Li, Yuling Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have revolutionized the field of generative modeling, achieving unprecedented success in generating realistic and diverse content. Despite empirical advances, the theoretical basis for why optimizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the log-likelihood is effective for training diffusion generative models, such as DDPMs, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this question by establishing a density formula for a continuous-time diffusion process, which can be viewed as the continuous-time limit of the forward process in an SGM. This formula reveals the connection between the target density and the score function associated with each step of the forward process. Building on this, we demonstrate that the minimizer of the optimization objective for training DDPMs nearly coincides with that of the true objective, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing DDPMs using the ELBO. Furthermore, we offer new insights into the role of score-matching regularization in training GANs, the use of ELBO in diffusion classifiers, and the recently proposed diffusion loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangfu Liu, Wenqiang Sun, Hanyang Wang, Yikai Wang, Haowen Sun, Junliang Ye, Jun Zhang, Yueqi Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in 3D scene reconstruction have transformed 2D images from the real world into 3D models, producing realistic 3D results from hundreds of input photos. Despite great success in dense-view reconstruction scenarios, rendering a detailed scene from insufficient captured views is still an ill-posed optimization problem, often resulting in artifacts and distortions in unseen areas. In this paper, we propose ReconX, a novel 3D scene reconstruction paradigm that reframes the ambiguous reconstruction challenge as a temporal generation task. The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of large pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction. However, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly generated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited input views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and encodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition. Guided by the condition, the video diffusion model then synthesizes video frames that are both detail-preserved and exhibit a high degree of 3D consistency, ensuring the coherence of the scene from various perspectives. Finally, we recover the 3D scene from the generated video through a confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show the superiority of our ReconX over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.</p>

Our framework supports various prompt types, including 3D points, boxes, and masks, and can generalize across diverse scenarios, such as 3D objects, indoor scenes, outdoor environments, and raw sparse LiDAR. Demonstrations on multiple 3D datasets, e.g., Objaverse, S3DIS, ScanNet, Semantic3D, and KITTI, highlight the robust generalization capabilities of SAM2Point.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederic Boussemart, Christophe Lecoutre, Gilles Audemard, C\'edric Piette</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a major revision of the format XCSP 2.1, called XCSP3, to build integrated representations of combinatorial constrained problems. This new format is able to deal with mono/multi optimization, many types of variables, cost functions, reification, views, annotations, variable quantification, distributed, probabilistic and qualitative reasoning. The new format is made compact, highly readable, and rather easy to parse. Interestingly, it captures the structure of the problem models, through the possibilities of declaring arrays of variables, and identifying syntactic and semantic groups of constraints. The number of constraints is kept under control by introducing a limited set of basic constraint forms, and producing almost automatically some of their variations through lifting, restriction, sliding, logical combination and relaxation mechanisms. As a result, XCSP3 encompasses practically all constraints that can be found in major constraint solvers developed by the CP community. A website, which is developed conjointly with the format, contains many models and series of instances. The user can make sophisticated queries for selecting instances from very precise criteria. The objective of XCSP3 is to ease the effort required to test and compare different algorithms by providing a common test-bed of combinatorial constrained instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eren Kurshan</p>
<p>Abstract: AI faces a trifecta of grand challenges: the Energy Wall, the Alignment Problem and the Leap from Narrow AI to AGI. Contemporary AI solutions consume unsustainable amounts of energy during model training and daily operations. Making things worse, the amount of computation required to train each new AI model has been doubling every 2 months since 2020, directly translating to unprecedented increases in energy consumption.
  The leap from AI to AGI requires multiple functional subsystems operating in a balanced manner, which requires a system architecture. However, the current approach to artificial intelligence lacks system design; even though system characteristics play a key role in the human brain; from the way it processes information to how it makes decisions. System design is the key to alignment, one of the most challenging goals in AI. This difficulty stems from the fact that the complexity of human moral system requires a similarly sophisticated system for alignment. Without accurately reflecting the complexity of these core moral subsystems and systems, aligning AI with human values becomes significantly more challenging.
  In this paper, we posit that system design is the missing piece in overcoming the grand challenges. We present a Systematic Approach to AGI that utilizes system design principles to AGI, while providing ways to overcome the energy wall and the alignment challenges. This paper asserts that artificial intelligence can be realized through a multiplicity of design-specific pathways, rather than a singular, overarching AGI architecture. AGI systems may exhibit diverse architectural configurations and capabilities, contingent upon their intended use cases. It advocates for a focus on employing system design principles as a guiding framework, rather than solely concentrating on a universal AGI architecture.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancement of large language models (LLMs) represents a transformational capability at the frontier of artificial intelligence. However, LLMs are generalized models, trained on extensive text corpus, and often struggle to provide context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge, such as wildfire details within the broader context of climate change. For decision-makers focused on wildfire resilience and adaptation, it is crucial to obtain responses that are not only precise but also domain-specific. To that end, we developed WildfireGPT, a prototype LLM agent designed to transform user queries into actionable insights on wildfire risks. We enrich WildfireGPT by providing additional context, such as climate projections and scientific literature, to ensure its information is current, relevant, and scientifically accurate. This enables WildfireGPT to be an effective tool for delivering detailed, user-specific insights on wildfire risks to support a diverse set of end users, including but not limited to researchers and engineers, for making positive impact and decision making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica L\'opez Espejel, Mahaman Sanoussi Yahaya Alassan, Merieme Bouhandi, Walid Dahhane, El Hassane Ettifouri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a popular choice for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks due to their versatility and ability to produce high-quality results. Specifically, they are increasingly used for automatic code generation to help developers tackle repetitive coding tasks. However, LLMs' substantial computational and memory requirements often make them inaccessible to users with limited resources. This paper focuses on very low-cost models which offer a more accessible alternative to resource-intensive LLMs. We notably: (1) propose a thorough semi-manual evaluation of their performance in generating Python code, (2) introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy to improve model reasoning and code quality, and (3) propose a new dataset of 60 programming problems, with varied difficulty levels, designed to extend existing benchmarks like HumanEval and EvalPlus. Our findings show that some low-cost compatible models achieve competitive results compared to larger models like ChatGPT despite using significantly fewer resources. We will make our dataset and prompts publicly available to support further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangmin Li, Ruiqi Zhu, Wengen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis is an active research area that combines multiple data modalities, e.g., text, image and audio, to analyze human emotions and benefits a variety of applications. Existing multimodal sentiment analysis methods can be classified as modality interaction-based methods, modality transformation-based methods and modality similarity-based methods. However, most of these methods highly rely on the strong correlations between modalities, and cannot fully uncover and utilize the correlations between modalities to enhance sentiment analysis. Therefore, these methods usually achieve bad performance for identifying the sentiment of multimodal data with weak correlations. To address this issue, we proposed a two-stage semi-supervised model termed Correlation-aware Multimodal Transformer (CorMulT) which consists pre-training stage and prediction stage. At the pre-training stage, a modality correlation contrastive learning module is designed to efficiently learn modality correlation coefficients between different modalities. At the prediction stage, the learned correlation coefficients are fused with modality representations to make the sentiment prediction. According to the experiments on the popular multimodal dataset CMU-MOSEI, CorMulT obviously surpasses state-of-the-art multimodal sentiment analysis methods.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11024">A mathematical framework of intelligence and consciousness based on Riemannian Geometry</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding intelligence is a central pursuit in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Intelligence encompasses learning, problem-solving, creativity, and even consciousness. Recent advancements in geometric analysis have revealed new insights into high-dimensional information representation and organisation, exposing intrinsic data structures and dynamic processes within neural and artificial systems. However, a comprehensive framework that unifies the static and dynamic aspects of intelligence is still lacking. This manuscript proposes a mathematical framework based on Riemannian geometry to describe the structure and dynamics of intelligence and consciousness. Intelligence elements are conceptualised as tokens embedded in a high-dimensional space. The learned token embeddings capture the interconnections of tokens across various scenarios and tasks, forming manifolds in the intelligence space. Thought flow is depicted as the sequential activation of tokens along geodesics within these manifolds. During the navigation of geodesics, consciousness, as a self-referential process, perceives the thought flow, evaluates it against predictions, and provides feedback through prediction errors, adjusting the geodesic: non-zero prediction errors, such as learning, lead to the restructuring of the curved manifolds, thus changing the geodesic of thought flow. This dynamic interaction integrates new information, evolves the geometry and facilitates learning. The geometry of intelligence guides consciousness, and consciousness structures the geometry of intelligence. By integrating geometric concepts, this proposed theory offers a unified, mathematically framework for describing the structure and dynamics of intelligence and consciousness. Applicable to biological and artificial intelligence, this framework may pave the way for future research and empirical validation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihui Hou, Shencheng Chen, Yongqi Fan, Lifeng Zhu, Jing Sun, Jingping Liu, Tong Ruan</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical diagnosis is critical in medical practice, typically requiring a continuous and evolving process that includes primary diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and final diagnosis. However, most existing clinical diagnostic tasks are single-step processes, which does not align with the complex multi-step diagnostic procedures found in real-world clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a multi-step diagnostic task and annotate a clinical diagnostic dataset (MSDiagnosis). This dataset includes primary diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and final diagnosis questions. Additionally, we propose a novel and effective framework. This framework combines forward inference, backward inference, reflection, and refinement, enabling the LLM to self-evaluate and adjust its diagnostic results. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed method, we design and conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also provide a comprehensive experimental analysis and suggest future research directions for this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinendra Malekar, Mohammed E. Elbtity, Ramtin Zand</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of 1-bit large language models (LLMs) has attracted considerable attention and opened up new research opportunities. However, 1-bit LLMs only improve a fraction of models by applying extreme quantization to the projection layers while leaving attention heads unchanged. Therefore, to avoid fundamentally wrong choices of goals in future research, it is crucial to understand the actual improvements in computation and memory usage that 1-bit LLMs can deliver. In this work, we present an adaptation of Amdahl's Law tailored for the 1-bit LLM context, which illustrates how partial improvements in 1-bit LLMs impact overall model performance. Through extensive experiments, we uncover key nuances across different model architectures and hardware configurations, offering a roadmap for future research in the era of 1-bit LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongsheng Ding, Kaiqing Zhang, Jiali Duan, Tamer Ba\c{s}ar, Mihailo R. Jovanovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: We study sequential decision making problems aimed at maximizing the expected total reward while satisfying a constraint on the expected total utility. We employ the natural policy gradient method to solve the discounted infinite-horizon optimal control problem for Constrained Markov Decision Processes (constrained MDPs). Specifically, we propose a new Natural Policy Gradient Primal-Dual (NPG-PD) method that updates the primal variable via natural policy gradient ascent and the dual variable via projected sub-gradient descent. Although the underlying maximization involves a nonconcave objective function and a nonconvex constraint set, under the softmax policy parametrization we prove that our method achieves global convergence with sublinear rates regarding both the optimality gap and the constraint violation. Such convergence is independent of the size of the state-action space, i.e., it is~dimension-free. Furthermore, for log-linear and general smooth policy parametrizations, we establish sublinear convergence rates up to a function approximation error caused by restricted policy parametrization. We also provide convergence and finite-sample complexity guarantees for two sample-based NPG-PD algorithms. Finally, we use computational experiments to showcase the merits and the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Paltenghi, Rahul Pandita, Austin Z. Henley, Albert Ziegler</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent neural models of code, such as OpenAI Codex and AlphaCode, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency at code generation due to the underlying attention mechanism. However, it often remains unclear how the models actually process code, and to what extent their reasoning and the way their attention mechanism scans the code matches the patterns of developers. A poor understanding of the model reasoning process limits the way in which current neural models are leveraged today, so far mostly for their raw prediction. To fill this gap, this work studies how the processed attention signal of three open large language models - CodeGen, InCoder and GPT-J - agrees with how developers look at and explore code when each answers the same sensemaking questions about code. Furthermore, we contribute an open-source eye-tracking dataset comprising 92 manually-labeled sessions from 25 developers engaged in sensemaking tasks. We empirically evaluate five heuristics that do not use the attention and ten attention-based post-processing approaches of the attention signal of CodeGen against our ground truth of developers exploring code, including the novel concept of follow-up attention which exhibits the highest agreement between model and human attention. Our follow-up attention method can predict the next line a developer will look at with 47% accuracy. This outperforms the baseline prediction accuracy of 42.3%, which uses the session history of other developers to recommend the next line. These results demonstrate the potential of leveraging the attention signal of pre-trained models for effective code exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fares Fourati, Salma Kharrat, Vaneet Aggarwal, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Marco Canini</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning, an emerging machine learning paradigm, enables clients to collaboratively train a model without exchanging local data. Clients participating in the training process significantly impact the convergence rate, learning efficiency, and model generalization. We propose a novel approach, client filtering, to improve model generalization and optimize client participation and training. The proposed method periodically filters available clients to identify a subset that maximizes a combinatorial objective function with an efficient greedy filtering algorithm. Thus, the clients are assessed as a combination rather than individually. We theoretically analyze the convergence of federated learning with client filtering in heterogeneous settings and evaluate its performance across diverse vision and language tasks, including realistic scenarios with time-varying client availability. Our empirical results demonstrate several benefits of our approach, including improved learning efficiency, faster convergence, and up to 10% higher test accuracy than training without client filtering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumit Asthana, Sagih Hilleli, Pengcheng He, Aaron Halfaker</p>
<p>Abstract: Meetings play a critical infrastructural role in the coordination of work. In recent years, due to shift to hybrid and remote work, more meetings are moving to online Computer Mediated Spaces. This has led to new problems (e.g. more time spent in less engaging meetings) and new opportunities (e.g. automated transcription/captioning and recap support). Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for dialog summarization have the potential to improve the experience of meetings by reducing individuals' meeting load and increasing the clarity and alignment of meeting outputs. Despite this potential, they face technological limitation due to long transcripts and inability to capture diverse recap needs based on user's context. To address these gaps, we design, implement and evaluate in-context a meeting recap system. We first conceptualize two salient recap representations -- important highlights, and a structured, hierarchical minutes view. We develop a system to operationalize the representations with dialogue summarization as its building blocks. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the system with seven users in the context of their work meetings. Our findings show promise in using LLM-based dialogue summarization for meeting recap and the need for both representations in different contexts. However, we find that LLM-based recap still lacks an understanding of whats personally relevant to participants, can miss important details, and mis-attributions can be detrimental to group dynamics. We identify collaboration opportunities such as a shared recap document that a high quality recap enables. We report on implications for designing AI systems to partner with users to learn and improve from natural interactions to overcome the limitations related to personal relevance and summarization quality.</p>

Our measures are easily computable and well suited for quantifying and interpreting the strength of group disparities as well as for comparing biases across different models, datasets, or time points. We derive a link between the different families of existing fairness measures for scores and show that the proposed standardized fairness measures outperform ROC-based fairness measures because they are more explicit and can quantify significant biases that ROC-based fairness measures miss.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models with their powerful expressivity and high sample quality have achieved State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance in the generative domain. The pioneering Vision Transformer (ViT) has also demonstrated strong modeling capabilities and scalability, especially for recognition tasks. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of ViTs in diffusion-based generative learning and propose a new model denoted as Diffusion Vision Transformers (DiffiT). Specifically, we propose a methodology for finegrained control of the denoising process and introduce the Time-dependant Multihead Self Attention (TMSA) mechanism. DiffiT is surprisingly effective in generating high-fidelity images with significantly better parameter efficiency. We also propose latent and image space DiffiT models and show SOTA performance on a variety of class-conditional and unconditional synthesis tasks at different resolutions. The Latent DiffiT model achieves a new SOTA FID score of 1.73 on ImageNet256 dataset while having 19.85%, 16.88% less parameters than other Transformer-based diffusion models such as MDT and DiT,respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Apoorva Beedu, Harish Haresamudram, Karan Samel, Irfan Essa</p>
<p>Abstract: Anticipating future actions is a highly challenging task due to the diversity and scale of potential future actions; yet, information from different modalities help narrow down plausible action choices. Each modality can provide diverse and often complementary context for the model to learn from. While previous multi-modal methods leverage information from modalities such as video and audio, we primarily explore how text descriptions of actions and objects can also lead to more accurate action anticipation by providing additional contextual cues, e.g., about the environment and its contents. We propose a Multi-modal Contrastive Anticipative Transformer (M-CAT), a video transformer architecture that jointly learns from multi-modal features and text descriptions of actions and objects. We train our model in two stages, where the model first learns to align video clips with descriptions of future actions, and is subsequently fine-tuned to predict future actions. Compared to existing methods, M-CAT has the advantage of learning additional context from two types of text inputs: rich descriptions of future actions during pre-training, and, text descriptions for detected objects and actions during modality feature fusion. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our model outperforms previous methods on the EpicKitchens datasets, and show that using simple text descriptions of actions and objects aid in more effective action anticipation. In addition, we examine the impact of object and action information obtained via text, and perform extensive ablations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Palaash Agrawal, Shavak Vasania, Cheston Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various reasoning capabilities through language-based prompts alone, particularly in unstructured task settings (tasks purely based on language semantics). However, LLMs often struggle with structured tasks, because of the inherent incompatibility of input representation. Reducing structured tasks to uni-dimensional language semantics often renders the problem trivial. Keeping the trade-off between LLM compatibility and structure complexity in mind, we design various graph reasoning tasks as a proxy to semi-structured tasks in this paper, in order to test the ability to navigate through representations beyond plain text in various LLMs. Particularly, we design 10 distinct problems of graph traversal, each representing increasing levels of complexity, and benchmark 5 different instruct-finetuned LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude-2, Llama-2 and Palm-2) on the aforementioned tasks. Further, we analyse the performance of models across various settings such as varying sizes of graphs as well as different forms of k-shot prompting. We highlight various limitations, biases and properties of LLMs through this benchmarking process, such as an inverse relation to the average degrees of freedom of traversal per node in graphs, the overall negative impact of k-shot prompting on graph reasoning tasks, and a positive response bias which prevents LLMs from identifying the absence of a valid solution. Finally, we introduce a new prompting technique specially designed for graph traversal tasks (PathCompare), which demonstrates a notable increase in the performance of LLMs in comparison to standard prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Zhou, Jonathan Booher, Khashayar Rohanimanesh, Wei Liu, Aleksandr Petiushko, Animesh Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning tasks are a challenging domain despite being very common in the real world. The widely adopted CMDP model constrains the risks in expectation, which makes room for dangerous behaviors in long-tail states. In safety-critical domains, such behaviors could lead to disastrous outcomes. To address this issue, we first describe the problem with a stronger Uniformly Constrained MDP (UCMDP) model where we impose constraints on all reachable states; we then propose Objective Suppression, a novel method that adaptively suppresses the task reward maximizing objectives according to a safety critic, as a solution to the Lagrangian dual of a UCMDP. We benchmark Objective Suppression in two multi-constraint safety domains, including an autonomous driving domain where any incorrect behavior can lead to disastrous consequences. On the driving domain, we evaluate on open source and proprietary data and evaluate transfer to a real autonomous fleet. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed method, when combined with existing safe RL algorithms, can match the task reward achieved by baselines with significantly fewer constraint violations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henri Bollaert, Marko Palangeti\'c, Chris Cornelis, Salvatore Greco, Roman S{\l}owi\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretability is the next frontier in machine learning research. In the search for white box models - as opposed to black box models, like random forests or neural networks - rule induction algorithms are a logical and promising option, since the rules can easily be understood by humans. Fuzzy and rough set theory have been successfully applied to this archetype, almost always separately. As both approaches to rule induction involve granular computing based on the concept of equivalence classes, it is natural to combine them. The QuickRules\cite{JensenCornelis2009} algorithm was a first attempt at using fuzzy rough set theory for rule induction. It is based on QuickReduct, a greedy algorithm for building decision reducts. QuickRules already showed an improvement over other rule induction methods. However, to evaluate the full potential of a fuzzy rough rule induction algorithm, one needs to start from the foundations. In this paper, we introduce a novel rule induction algorithm called Fuzzy Rough Rule Induction (FRRI). We provide background and explain the workings of our algorithm. Furthermore, we perform a computational experiment to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and compare it to other state-of-the-art rule induction approaches. We find that our algorithm is more accurate while creating small rulesets consisting of relatively short rules. We end the paper by outlining some directions for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Kang, Qingru Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Geonhwa Jeong, Zaoxing Liu, Tushar Krishna, Tuo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Silin Du, Xiaowei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited memorable strategic behaviors in social deductive games. However, the significance of opinion leadership exhibited by LLM-based agents has been largely overlooked, which is crucial for practical applications in multi-agent and human-AI interaction settings. Opinion leaders are individuals who have a noticeable impact on the beliefs and behaviors of others within a social group. In this work, we employ the Werewolf game as a simulation platform to assess the opinion leadership of LLMs. The game includes the role of the Sheriff, tasked with summarizing arguments and recommending decision options, and therefore serves as a credible proxy for an opinion leader. We develop a framework integrating the Sheriff role and devise two novel metrics based on the critical characteristics of opinion leaders. The first metric measures the reliability of the opinion leader, and the second assesses the influence of the opinion leader on other players' decisions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate LLMs of different scales. In addition, we collect a Werewolf question-answering dataset (WWQA) to assess and enhance LLM's grasp of the game rules, and we also incorporate human participants for further analysis. The results suggest that the Werewolf game is a suitable test bed to evaluate the opinion leadership of LLMs, and few LLMs possess the capacity for opinion leadership.</p>

While the primary objective of automatic assessment tasks is to score movements, the automatic generation of feedback highlighting key movement issues has the potential to significantly enhance and accelerate the rehabilitation process. While numerous research works exist in the field of automatic movement assessment, only a handful address feedback generation. In this study, we propose terminology and criteria for the classification, evaluation, and comparison of feedback generation solutions. We discuss the challenges associated with each feedback generation approach and use our proposed criteria to classify existing solutions.

<p>Abstract: The integration of Foundation Models (FMs) with Federated Learning (FL) presents a transformative paradigm in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This integration offers enhanced capabilities while addressing concerns of privacy, data decentralization, and computational efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the emerging field of Federated Foundation Models (FedFM), elucidating their synergistic relationship and exploring novel methodologies, challenges, and future directions that the FL research field needs to focus on in order to thrive in the age of FMs. A systematic multi-tiered taxonomy is proposed, categorizing existing FedFM approaches for model training, aggregation, trustworthiness, and incentivization.

Artificial neural networks are a promising technique for virtual analog modeling. While neural approaches have successfully accurately modeled distortion circuits, they require architectural improvements that account for parameter conditioning and low-latency response. This article explores the application of recent machine learning advancements for virtual analog modeling. In particular, we compare State-Space models and Linear Recurrent Units against the more common Long Short-Term Memory networks. Our comparative study uses these black-box neural modeling techniques with various audio effects. We evaluate the performance and limitations of these models using multiple metrics, providing insights for future research and development. Our metrics aim to assess the models' ability to accurately replicate energy envelopes and frequency contents, with a particular focus on transients in the audio signal. To incorporate control parameters into the models, we employ the Feature-wise Linear Modulation method. Long Short-Term Memory networks exhibit better accuracy in emulating distortions and equalizers, while the State-Space model, followed by Long Short-Term Memory networks when integrated in an encoder-decoder structure, and Linear Recurrent Unit outperforms others in emulating saturation and compression. When considering long time-variant characteristics, the State-Space model demonstrates the greatest capability to track history. Long Short-Term Memory networks tend to introduce audio artifacts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Benaglia, Angelo Porrello, Pietro Buzzega, Simone Calderara, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory forecasting is crucial for video surveillance analytics, as it enables the anticipation of future movements for a set of agents, e.g. basketball players engaged in intricate interactions with long-term intentions. Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwei Zeng, Chao Yu, Xinyi Yang, Wenxuan Ao, Qianyue Hao, Jian Yuan, Yong Li, Yu Wang, Huazhong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasingly severe congestion problem in modern cities strengthens the significance of developing city-scale traffic signal control (TSC) methods for traffic efficiency enhancement. While reinforcement learning has been widely explored in TSC, most of them still target small-scale optimization and cannot directly scale to the city level due to unbearable resource demand. Only a few of them manage to tackle city-level optimization, namely a thousand-scale optimization, by incorporating parameter-sharing mechanisms, but hardly have they fully tackled the heterogeneity of intersections and intricate between-intersection interactions inherent in real-world city road networks. To fill in the gap, we target at the two important challenges in adopting parameter-sharing paradigms to solve TSC: inconsistency of inner state representations for intersections heterogeneous in configuration, scale, and orders of available traffic phases; intricacy of impacts from neighborhood intersections that have various relative traffic relationships due to inconsistent phase orders and diverse relative positioning. Our method, CityLight, features a universal representation module that not only aligns the state representations of intersections by reindexing their phases based on their semantics and designing heterogeneity-preserving observations, but also encodes the narrowed relative traffic relation types to project the neighborhood intersections onto a uniform relative traffic impact space. We further attentively fuse neighborhood representations based on their competing relations and incorporate neighborhood-integrated rewards to boost coordination. Extensive experiments with hundreds to tens of thousands of intersections validate the surprising effectiveness and generalizability of CityLight, with an overall performance gain of 11.68% and a 22.59% improvement in transfer scenarios in throughput.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilya Ilyankou, Meihui Wang, Stefano Cavazzi, James Haworth</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit emerging geospatial capabilities, stemming from their pre-training on vast unlabelled text datasets that are often derived from the Common Crawl (CC) corpus. However, the geospatial content within CC remains largely unexplored, impacting our understanding of LLMs' spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the prevalence of geospatial data in recent Common Crawl releases using Gemini 1.5, a powerful language model. By analyzing a sample of documents and manually revising the results, we estimate that 18.7% of web documents in CC contain geospatial information such as coordinates and addresses. We find little difference in prevalence between Enlgish- and non-English-language documents. Our findings provide quantitative insights into the nature and extent of geospatial data in CC, and lay the groundwork for future studies of geospatial biases of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zepeng Ding, Ruiyang Ke, Wenhao Huang, Guochao Jiang, Yanda Li, Deqing Yang, Jiaqing Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing research on large language models (LLMs) shows that they can solve information extraction tasks through multi-step planning. However, their extraction behavior on complex sentences and tasks is unstable, emerging issues such as false positives and missing elements. We observe that decomposing complex extraction tasks and extracting them step by step can effectively improve LLMs' performance, and the extraction orders of entities significantly affect the final results of LLMs. This paper proposes a two-stage multi-step method for LLM-based information extraction and adopts the RL framework to execute the multi-step planning. We regard sequential extraction as a Markov decision process, build an LLM-based extraction environment, design a decision module to adaptively provide the optimal order for sequential entity extraction on different sentences, and utilize the DDQN algorithm to train the decision model. We also design the rewards and evaluation metrics suitable for the extraction results of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the information extraction capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agnimitra Dasgupta, Harisankar Ramaswamy, Javier Murgoitio-Esandi, Ken Foo, Runze Li, Qifa Zhou, Brendan Kennedy, Assad Oberai</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a framework to perform Bayesian inference using conditional score-based diffusion models to solve a class of inverse problems in mechanics involving the inference of a specimen's spatially varying material properties from noisy measurements of its mechanical response to loading. Conditional score-based diffusion models are generative models that learn to approximate the score function of a conditional distribution using samples from the joint distribution. More specifically, the score functions corresponding to multiple realizations of the measurement are approximated using a single neural network, the so-called score network, which is subsequently used to sample the posterior distribution using an appropriate Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme based on Langevin dynamics. Training the score network only requires simulating the forward model. Hence, the proposed approach can accommodate black-box forward models and complex measurement noise. Moreover, once the score network has been trained, it can be re-used to solve the inverse problem for different realizations of the measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on a suite of high-dimensional inverse problems in mechanics that involve inferring heterogeneous material properties from noisy measurements. Some examples we consider involve synthetic data, while others include data collected from actual elastography experiments. Further, our applications demonstrate that the proposed approach can handle different measurement modalities, complex patterns in the inferred quantities, non-Gaussian and non-additive noise models, and nonlinear black-box forward models. The results show that the proposed framework can solve large-scale physics-based inverse problems efficiently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Vonessen, Florian Gr\"otschla, Roger Wattenhofer</p>
<p>Abstract: Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are extensively employed in graph learning tasks but suffer from limitations such as the restricted scope of information exchange, by being confined to neighboring nodes during each round of message passing. Various strategies have been proposed to address these limitations, including incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate global information exchange. In this study, we introduce the Hierarchical Support Graph (HSG), an extension of the virtual node concept created through recursive coarsening of the original graph. This approach provides a flexible framework for enhancing information flow in graphs, independent of the specific MPNN layers utilized. We present a theoretical analysis of HSGs, investigate their empirical performance, and demonstrate that HSGs can surpass other methods augmented with virtual nodes, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya K Surikuchi, Raquel Fern\'andez, Sandro Pezzelle</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual storytelling consists in generating a natural language story given a temporally ordered sequence of images. This task is not only challenging for models, but also very difficult to evaluate with automatic metrics since there is no consensus about what makes a story 'good'. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that measures story quality in terms of human likeness regarding three key aspects highlighted in previous work: visual grounding, coherence, and repetitiveness. We then use this method to evaluate the stories generated by several models, showing that the foundation model LLaVA obtains the best result, but only slightly so compared to TAPM, a 50-times smaller visual storytelling model. Upgrading the visual and language components of TAPM results in a model that yields competitive performance with a relatively low number of parameters. Finally, we carry out a human evaluation study, whose results suggest that a 'good' story may require more than a human-like level of visual grounding, coherence, and repetition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Post-nonlinear (PNL) causal models stand out as a versatile and adaptable framework for modeling intricate causal relationships. However, accurately capturing the invertibility constraint required in PNL models remains challenging in existing studies. To address this problem, we introduce CAF-PoNo (Causal discovery via Normalizing Flows for Post-Nonlinear models), harnessing the power of the normalizing flows architecture to enforce the crucial invertibility constraint in PNL models. Through normalizing flows, our method precisely reconstructs the hidden noise, which plays a vital role in cause-effect identification through statistical independence testing. Furthermore, the proposed approach exhibits remarkable extensibility, as it can be seamlessly expanded to facilitate multivariate causal discovery via causal order identification, empowering us to efficiently unravel complex causal relationships. Extensive experimental evaluations on both simulated and real datasets consistently demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in both bivariate and multivariate causal discovery tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nu Hoang, Bao Duong, Thin Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian causal discovery offers the power to quantify epistemic uncertainties among a broad range of structurally diverse causal theories potentially explaining the data, represented in forms of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, existing methods struggle with efficient DAG sampling due to the complex acyclicity constraint. In this study, we propose a scalable Bayesian approach to effectively learn the posterior distribution over causal graphs given observational data thanks to the ability to generate DAGs without explicitly enforcing acyclicity. Specifically, we introduce a novel differentiable DAG sampling method that can generate a valid acyclic causal graph by mapping an unconstrained distribution of implicit topological orders to a distribution over DAGs. Given this efficient DAG sampling scheme, we are able to model the posterior distribution over causal graphs using a simple variational distribution over a continuous domain, which can be learned via the variational inference framework. Extensive empirical experiments on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

An equivalent characterization in the form of an operational semantics is also provided and, together with a type system, is used to prove the type soundness of $\mu\mathcal{G}$. We show how $\mu\mathcal{G}$ programs can be represented in a more user-friendly graphical visualization, and provide examples of its generality by showing how it can be used to define some of the most popular graph neural network models, or to develop any custom graph processing application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bocheng Zou, Mu Cai, Jianrui Zhang, Yong Jae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of vision models, the primary mode of representation is using pixels to rasterize the visual world. Yet this is not always the best or unique way to represent visual content, especially for designers and artists who depict the world using geometry primitives such as polygons. Vector graphics (VG), on the other hand, offer a textual representation of visual content, which can be more concise and powerful for content like cartoons, sketches and scientific figures. Recent studies have shown promising results on processing vector graphics with capable Large Language Models (LLMs). However, such works focus solely on qualitative results, understanding, or a specific type of vector graphics. We propose VGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for LLMs on handling vector graphics through diverse aspects, including (a) both visual understanding and generation, (b) evaluation of various vector graphics formats, (c) diverse question types, (d) wide range of prompting techniques, (e) under multiple LLMs and (f) comparison with VLMs on rasterized representations. Evaluating on our collected 4279 understanding and 5845 generation samples, we find that LLMs show strong capability on both aspects while exhibiting less desirable performance on low-level formats (SVG). Both data and evaluation pipeline will be open-sourced at https://vgbench.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Li, Tianxiang Zhao, Lingwei Chen, Junjie Xu, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are pervasive in the real-world, such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have great ability in node classification, a fundamental task on graphs. Unfortunately, conventional GNNs still face challenges in scenarios with few labeled nodes, despite the prevalence of few-shot node classification tasks in real-world applications. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed, including graph meta-learning, transfer learning, and methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs). However, traditional meta-learning and transfer learning methods often require prior knowledge from base classes or fail to exploit the potential advantages of unlabeled nodes. Meanwhile, LLM-based methods may overlook the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs and rely heavily on the quality of generated contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates LLMs and GNNs, leveraging the zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities of LLMs and employing a Graph-LLM-based active learning paradigm to enhance GNNs' performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in improving node classification accuracy with considerably limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisanne van Gelderen, Cristian Tejedor-Garc\'ia</p>
<p>Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, frequently presents with early-stage speech impairments. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL), have significantly enhanced PD diagnosis through the analysis of speech data. Nevertheless, the progress of research is restricted by the limited availability of publicly accessible speech-based PD datasets, primarily due to privacy concerns. The goal of this systematic review is to explore the current landscape of speech-based DL approaches for PD classification, based on 33 scientific works published between 2020 and March 2024. We discuss their available resources, capabilities, potential limitations, and issues related to bias, explainability, and privacy. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of publicly accessible speech-based datasets and open-source material for PD. The DL approaches are categorized into end-to-end (E2E) learning, transfer learning (TL) and deep acoustic features extraction (DAFE) approaches. Among E2E approaches, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are prevalent, though Transformers are increasingly popular. E2E approaches face challenges such as limited data and computational resources, especially with Transformers. TL addresses these issues by providing more robust PD diagnosis and better generalizability across languages. DAFE aims to improve the explainability and interpretability of results by examining the specific effects of deep features on both other DL approaches and more traditional machine learning (ML) methods. However, it often underperforms compared to E2E and TL approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

<p>Abstract: In the realm of electronic and electrical engineering, automation of analog circuit is increasingly vital given the complexity and customized requirements of modern applications. However, existing methods only develop search-based algorithms that require many simulation iterations to design a custom circuit topology, which is usually a time-consuming process. To this end, we introduce LaMAGIC, a pioneering language model-based topology generation model that leverages supervised finetuning for automated analog circuit design. LaMAGIC can efficiently generate an optimized circuit design from the custom specification in a single pass. Our approach involves a meticulous development and analysis of various input and output formulations for circuit. These formulations can ensure canonical representations of circuits and align with the autoregressive nature of LMs to effectively addressing the challenges of representing analog circuits as graphs. The experimental results show that LaMAGIC achieves a success rate of up to 96\% under a strict tolerance of 0.01. We also examine the scalability and adaptability of LaMAGIC, specifically testing its performance on more complex circuits. Our findings reveal the enhanced effectiveness of our adjacency matrix-based circuit formulation with floating-point input, suggesting its suitability for handling intricate circuit designs. This research not only demonstrates the potential of language models in graph generation, but also builds a foundational framework for future explorations in automated analog circuit design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panfeng Cao, Pietro Lio</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential recommendation is a task to capture hidden user preferences from historical user item interaction data and recommend next items for the user. Significant progress has been made in this domain by leveraging classification based learning methods. Inspired by the recent paradigm of 'pretrain, prompt and predict' in NLP, we consider sequential recommendation as a sequence to sequence generation task and propose a novel model named Generative Recommendation (GenRec). Unlike classification based models that learn explicit user and item representations, GenRec utilizes the sequence modeling capability of Transformer and adopts the masked item prediction objective to effectively learn the hidden bidirectional sequential patterns. Different from existing generative sequential recommendation models, GenRec does not rely on manually designed hard prompts. The input to GenRec is textual user item sequence and the output is top ranked next items. Moreover, GenRec is lightweight and requires only a few hours to train effectively in low-resource settings, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios and helping to democratize large language models in the sequential recommendation domain. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that GenRec generalizes on various public real-world datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results. Our experiments also validate the effectiveness of the the proposed masked item prediction objective that improves the model performance by a large margin.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling optical dynamic range compressors using deep neural networks with Selective State Space models. The proposed approach surpasses previous methods based on recurrent layers by employing a Selective State Space block to encode the input audio. It features a refined technique integrating Feature-wise Linear Modulation and Gated Linear Units to adjust the network dynamically, conditioning the compression's attack and release phases according to external parameters. The proposed architecture is well-suited for low-latency and real-time applications, crucial in live audio processing. The method has been validated on the analog optical compressors TubeTech CL 1B and Teletronix LA-2A, which possess distinct characteristics. Evaluation is performed using quantitative metrics and subjective listening tests, comparing the proposed method with other state-of-the-art models. Results show that our black-box modeling methods outperform all others, achieving accurate emulation of the compression process for both seen and unseen settings during training. We further show a correlation between this accuracy and the sampling density of the control parameters in the dataset and identify settings with fast attack and slow release as the most challenging to emulate.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of cloud-based proprietary large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant challenges, including operational dependencies, privacy concerns, and the necessity of continuous internet connectivity. In this work, we introduce an LLMOps pipeline, "LlamaDuo", for the seamless migration of knowledge and abilities from service-oriented LLMs to smaller, locally manageable models. This pipeline is crucial for ensuring service continuity in the presence of operational failures, strict privacy policies, or offline requirements. Our LlamaDuo involves fine-tuning a small language model against the service LLM using a synthetic dataset generated by the latter. If the performance of the fine-tuned model falls short of expectations, it is enhanced by further fine-tuning with additional similar data created by the service LLM. This iterative process guarantees that the smaller model can eventually match or even surpass the service LLM's capabilities in specific downstream tasks, offering a practical and scalable solution for managing AI deployments in constrained environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Cho, Samuel Schmidgall, Cyril Zakka, Mrudang Mathur, Rohan Shad, William Hiesinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation models have made significant strides, producing outputs with improved visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and user control. These advancements hold great promise for improving surgical education by enabling more realistic, diverse, and interactive simulation environments. In this study, we introduce SurGen, a text-guided diffusion model tailored for surgical video synthesis, producing the highest resolution and longest duration videos among existing surgical video generation models. We validate the visual and temporal quality of the outputs using standard image and video generation metrics. Additionally, we assess their alignment to the corresponding text prompts through a deep learning classifier trained on surgical data. Our results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models to serve as valuable educational tools for surgical trainees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cherag Aroraa, Tracy Holloway King, Jayant Kumar, Yi Lu, Sanat Sharma, Arvind Srikantan, David Uvalle, Josep Valls-Vargas, Harsha Vardhan</p>
<p>Abstract: As user content and queries become increasingly multi-modal, the need for effective multi-modal search systems has grown. Traditional search systems often rely on textual and metadata annotations for indexed images, while multi-modal embeddings like CLIP enable direct search using text and image embeddings. However, embedding-based approaches face challenges in integrating contextual features such as user locale and recency. Building a scalable multi-modal search system requires fine-tuning several components. This paper presents a multi-modal search architecture and a series of AB tests that optimize embeddings and multi-modal technologies in Adobe Express template search. We address considerations such as embedding model selection, the roles of embeddings in matching and ranking, and the balance between dense and sparse embeddings. Our iterative approach demonstrates how utilizing sparse, dense, and contextual features enhances short and long query search, significantly reduces null rates (over 70\%), and increases click-through rates (CTR). Our findings provide insights into developing robust multi-modal search systems, thereby enhancing relevance for complex queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pavan Uttej Ravva, Behdokht Kiafar, Pinar Kullu, Jicheng Li, Anjana Bhat, Roghayeh Leila Barmaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by significant challenges in social interaction and comprehending communication signals. Recently, therapeutic interventions for ASD have increasingly utilized Deep learning powered-computer vision techniques to monitor individual progress over time. These models are trained on private, non-public datasets from the autism community, creating challenges in comparing results across different models due to privacy-preserving data-sharing issues. This work introduces MMASD+, an enhanced version of the novel open-source dataset called Multimodal ASD (MMASD). MMASD+ consists of diverse data modalities, including 3D-Skeleton, 3D Body Mesh, and Optical Flow data. It integrates the capabilities of Yolov8 and Deep SORT algorithms to distinguish between the therapist and children, addressing a significant barrier in the original dataset. Additionally, a Multimodal Transformer framework is proposed to predict 11 action types and the presence of ASD. This framework achieves an accuracy of 95.03% for predicting action types and 96.42% for predicting ASD presence, demonstrating over a 10% improvement compared to models trained on single data modalities. These findings highlight the advantages of integrating multiple data modalities within the Multimodal Transformer framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Di Gennaro, Thibault Laugel, Vincent Grari, Xavier Renard, Marcin Detyniecki</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel post-processing algorithm that is both model-agnostic and does not require the sensitive attribute at test time. In addition, our algorithm is explicitly designed to enforce minimal changes between biased and debiased predictions; a property that, while highly desirable, is rarely prioritized as an explicit objective in fairness literature. Our approach leverages a multiplicative factor applied to the logit value of probability scores produced by a black-box classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through empirical evaluations, comparing its performance against other four debiasing algorithms on two widely used datasets in fairness research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Rutherford, Michael Beukman, Timon Willi, Bruno Lacerda, Nick Hawes, Jakob Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: What data or environments to use for training to improve downstream performance is a longstanding and very topical question in reinforcement learning. In particular, Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) methods have gained recent attention as their adaptive curricula enable agents to be robust to in- and out-of-distribution tasks. We ask to what extent these methods are themselves robust when applied to a novel setting, closely inspired by a real-world robotics problem. Surprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art UED methods either do not improve upon the na\"{i}ve baseline of Domain Randomisation (DR), or require substantial hyperparameter tuning to do so. Our analysis shows that this is due to their underlying scoring functions failing to predict intuitive measures of ``learnability'', i.e., in finding the settings that the agent sometimes solves, but not always. Based on this, we instead directly train on levels with high learnability and find that this simple and intuitive approach outperforms UED methods and DR in several binary-outcome environments, including on our domain and the standard UED domain of Minigrid. We further introduce a new adversarial evaluation procedure for directly measuring robustness, closely mirroring the conditional value at risk (CVaR). We open-source all our code and present visualisations of final policies here: https://github.com/amacrutherford/sampling-for-learnability.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15256">Improving Ontology Requirements Engineering with OntoChat and Participatory Prompting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Zhao, Bohui Zhang, Xi Hu, Shuyin Ouyang, Jongmo Kim, Nitisha Jain, Jacopo de Berardinis, Albert Mero\~no-Pe\~nuela, Elena Simperl</p>
<p>Abstract: Past ontology requirements engineering (ORE) has primarily relied on manual methods, such as interviews and collaborative forums, to gather user requirements from domain experts, especially in large projects. Current OntoChat offers a framework for ORE that utilises large language models (LLMs) to streamline the process through four key functions: user story creation, competency question (CQ) extraction, CQ filtration and analysis, and ontology testing support. In OntoChat, users are expected to prompt the chatbot to generate user stories. However, preliminary evaluations revealed that they struggle to do this effectively. To address this issue, we experimented with a research method called participatory prompting, which involves researcher-mediated interactions to help users without deep knowledge of LLMs use the chatbot more effectively. This participatory prompting user study produces pre-defined prompt templates based on user queries, focusing on creating and refining personas, goals, scenarios, sample data, and data resources for user stories. These refined user stories will subsequently be converted into CQs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christos Theodoropoulos, Natasha Mulligan, Joao Bettencourt-Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing novel predictive models with complex biomedical information is challenging due to various idiosyncrasies related to heterogeneity, standardization or sparseness of the data. We previously introduced a person-centric ontology to organize information about individual patients, and a representation learning framework to extract person-centric knowledge graphs (PKGs) and to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to examine the results of GNN models trained with both structured and unstructured information from the MIMIC-III dataset. Through ablation studies on different clinical, demographic, and social data, we show the robustness of this approach in identifying predictive features in PKGs for the task of readmission prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haichuan Hu, Yuhan Sun, Quanjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a primary technique for mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, incomplete knowledge extraction and insufficient understanding can still mislead LLMs to produce irrelevant or even contradictory responses, which means hallucinations persist in RAG. In this paper, we propose LRP4RAG, a method based on the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithm for detecting hallucinations in RAG. Specifically, we first utilize LRP to compute the relevance between the input and output of the RAG generator. We then apply further extraction and resampling to the relevance matrix. The processed relevance data are input into multiple classifiers to determine whether the output contains hallucinations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that LRP has been used for detecting RAG hallucinations, and extensive experiments demonstrate that LRP4RAG outperforms existing baselines.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15561">CGRA4ML: A Framework to Implement Modern Neural Networks for Scientific Edge Computing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> G Abarajithan, Zhenghua Ma, Zepeng Li, Shrideep Koparkar, Ravidu Munasinghe, Francesco Restuccia, Ryan Kastner</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific edge computing increasingly relies on hardware-accelerated neural networks to implement complex, near-sensor processing at extremely high throughputs and low latencies. Existing frameworks like HLS4ML are effective for smaller models, but struggle with larger, modern neural networks due to their requirement of spatially implementing the neural network layers and storing all weights in on-chip memory. CGRA4ML is an open-source, modular framework designed to bridge the gap between neural network model complexity and extreme performance requirements. CGRA4ML extends the capabilities of HLS4ML by allowing off-chip data storage and supporting a broader range of neural network architectures, including models like ResNet, PointNet, and transformers. Unlike HLS4ML, CGRA4ML generates SystemVerilog RTL, making it more suitable for targeting ASIC and FPGA design flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by implementing and scaling larger models that were previously unattainable with HLS4ML, showcasing its adaptability and efficiency in handling complex computations. CGRA4ML also introduces an extensive verification framework, with a generated runtime firmware that enables its integration into different SoC platforms. CGRA4ML's minimal and modular infrastructure of Python API, SystemVerilog hardware, Tcl toolflows, and C runtime, facilitates easy integration and experimentation, allowing scientists to focus on innovation rather than the intricacies of hardware design and optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anis Bourou, Auguste Genovesio, Val\'erie Mezger</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have seen significant advancements, leading to their widespread adoption across various fields. The original GAN architecture enables the generation of images without any specific control over the content, making it an unconditional generation process. However, many practical applications require precise control over the generated output, which has led to the development of conditional GANs (cGANs) that incorporate explicit conditioning to guide the generation process. cGANs extend the original framework by incorporating additional information (conditions), enabling the generation of samples that adhere to that specific criteria. Various conditioning methods have been proposed, each differing in how they integrate the conditioning information into both the generator and the discriminator networks. In this work, we review the conditioning methods proposed for GANs, exploring the characteristics of each method and highlighting their unique mechanisms and theoretical foundations. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of these methods, evaluating their performance on various image datasets. Through these analyses, we aim to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of various conditioning techniques, guiding future research and application in generative modeling.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15775">Easy, Interpretable, Effective: openSMILE for voice deepfake detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Octavian Pascu, Dan Oneata, Horia Cucu, Nicolas M. M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that attacks in the latest ASVspoof5 dataset -- a de facto standard in the field of voice authenticity and deepfake detection -- can be identified with surprising accuracy using a small subset of very simplistic features. These are derived from the openSMILE library, and are scalar-valued, easy to compute, and human interpretable. For example, attack A10`s unvoiced segments have a mean length of 0.09 +- 0.02, while bona fide instances have a mean length of 0.18 +- 0.07. Using this feature alone, a threshold classifier achieves an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 10.3% for attack A10. Similarly, across all attacks, we achieve up to 0.8% EER, with an overall EER of 15.7 +- 6.0%. We explore the generalization capabilities of these features and find that some of them transfer effectively between attacks, primarily when the attacks originate from similar Text-to-Speech (TTS) architectures. This finding may indicate that voice anti-spoofing is, in part, a problem of identifying and remembering signatures or fingerprints of individual TTS systems. This allows to better understand anti-spoofing models and their challenges in real-world application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amar Amouri, Mohamad Mahmoud Al Rahhal, Yakoub Bazi, Ismail Butun, Imad Mahgoub</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the evolution of machine learning techniques has significantly impacted the field of intrusion detection, particularly within the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). As IoT networks expand, the need for robust security measures to counteract potential threats has become increasingly critical. This paper introduces a hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that synergistically combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with the XGBoost algorithm. Our proposed IDS leverages the unique capabilities of KANs, which utilize learnable activation functions to model complex relationships within data, alongside the powerful ensemble learning techniques of XGBoost, known for its high performance in classification tasks. This hybrid approach not only enhances the detection accuracy but also improves the interpretability of the model, making it suitable for dynamic and intricate IoT environments. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our hybrid IDS achieves an impressive detection accuracy exceeding 99% in distinguishing between benign and malicious activities. Additionally, we were able to achieve F1 scores, precision, and recall that exceeded 98%. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis against traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks, assessing performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The results underscore the efficacy of integrating KANs with XGBoost, highlighting the potential of this innovative approach to significantly strengthen the security framework of IoT networks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15996">Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Jhe Huang, Min-Hung Chen, Shang-Hong Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.
