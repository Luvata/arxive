<p><b>Authors:</b> Juzheng Zhang, Yatao Bian, Yongqiang Chen, Quanming Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks has driven the research community to extend their capabilities to molecular applications. However, most molecular LLMs employ adapter-based architectures that do not treat molecule and text modalities equally and lack a supervision signal for the molecule modality. To address these issues, we introduce UniMoT, a Unified Molecule-Text LLM adopting a tokenizer-based architecture that expands the vocabulary of LLM with molecule tokens. Specifically, we introduce a Vector Quantization-driven tokenizer that incorporates a Q-Former to bridge the modality gap between molecule and text. This tokenizer transforms molecules into sequences of molecule tokens with causal dependency, encapsulating high-level molecular and textual information. Equipped with this tokenizer, UniMoT can unify molecule and text modalities under a shared token representation and an autoregressive training paradigm, enabling it to interpret molecules as a foreign language and generate them as text. Following a four-stage training scheme, UniMoT emerges as a multi-modal generalist capable of performing both molecule-to-text and text-to-molecule tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMoT achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of molecule comprehension and generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sari Masri, Huthaifa I. Ashqar, Mohammed Elhenawy</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban traffic management faces significant challenges due to the dynamic environments, and traditional algorithms fail to quickly adapt to this environment in real-time and predict possible conflicts. This study explores the ability of a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically, GPT-4o-mini to improve traffic management at urban intersections. We recruited GPT-4o-mini to analyze, predict position, detect and resolve the conflicts at an intersection in real-time for various basic scenarios. The key findings of this study to investigate whether LLMs can logically reason and understand the scenarios to enhance the traffic efficiency and safety by providing real-time analysis. The study highlights the potential of LLMs in urban traffic management creating more intelligent and more adaptive systems. Results showed the GPT-4o-mini was effectively able to detect and resolve conflicts in heavy traffic, congestion, and mixed-speed conditions. The complex scenario of multiple intersections with obstacles and pedestrians saw successful conflict management as well. Results show that the integration of LLMs promises to improve the effectiveness of traffic control for safer and more efficient urban intersection management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liam Hebert, Krishna Sayana, Ambarish Jash, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Sukhdeep Sodhi, Sumanth Doddapaneni, Yanli Cai, Dima Kuzmin</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the nuances of a user's extensive interaction history is key to building accurate and personalized natural language systems that can adapt to evolving user preferences. To address this, we introduce PERSOMA, Personalized Soft Prompt Adapter architecture. Unlike previous personalized prompting methods for large language models, PERSOMA offers a novel approach to efficiently capture user history. It achieves this by resampling and compressing interactions as free form text into expressive soft prompt embeddings, building upon recent research utilizing embedding representations as input for LLMs. We rigorously validate our approach by evaluating various adapter architectures, first-stage sampling strategies, parameter-efficient tuning techniques like LoRA, and other personalization methods. Our results demonstrate PERSOMA's superior ability to handle large and complex user histories compared to existing embedding-based and text-prompt-based techniques.</p>

A directed acyclic graph is designed to describe human's nature. Nurture beliefs are incorporated to connect outside events and the human's nature graph. No annotation resources are required due to the power of large language models. Amazon Fine Foods Reviews dataset is used as corpus and food-related motivations are focused.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00981">Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition via Graph Matching</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Zheng, Haibin Chen, Qianli Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-domain NER is a practical yet challenging problem since the data scarcity in the real-world scenario. A common practice is first to learn a NER model in a rich-resource general domain and then adapt the model to specific domains. Due to the mismatch problem between entity types across domains, the wide knowledge in the general domain can not effectively transfer to the target domain NER model. To this end, we model the label relationship as a probability distribution and construct label graphs in both source and target label spaces. To enhance the contextual representation with label structures, we fuse the label graph into the word embedding output by BERT. By representing label relationships as graphs, we formulate cross-domain NER as a graph matching problem. Furthermore, the proposed method has good applicability with pre-training methods and is potentially capable of other cross-domain prediction tasks. Empirical results on four datasets show that our method outperforms a series of transfer learning, multi-task learning, and few-shot learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thang Doan Viet, Zichong Wang, Minh Nhat Nguyen, Wenbin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains but often lack fairness considerations, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes against marginalized populations. Unlike fairness in traditional machine learning, fairness in LLMs involves unique backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfillment techniques. This tutorial provides a systematic overview of recent advances in the literature concerning fair LLMs, beginning with real-world case studies to introduce LLMs, followed by an analysis of bias causes therein. The concept of fairness in LLMs is then explored, summarizing the strategies for evaluating bias and the algorithms designed to promote fairness. Additionally, resources for assessing bias in LLMs, including toolkits and datasets, are compiled, and current research challenges and open questions in the field are discussed.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01038">UNER: A Unified Prediction Head for Named Entity Recognition in Visually-rich Documents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Tu, Chong Zhang, Ya Guo, Huan Chen, Jinyang Tang, Huijia Zhu, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recognition of named entities in visually-rich documents (VrD-NER) plays a critical role in various real-world scenarios and applications. However, the research in VrD-NER faces three major challenges: complex document layouts, incorrect reading orders, and unsuitable task formulations. To address these challenges, we propose a query-aware entity extraction head, namely UNER, to collaborate with existing multi-modal document transformers to develop more robust VrD-NER models. The UNER head considers the VrD-NER task as a combination of sequence labeling and reading order prediction, effectively addressing the issues of discontinuous entities in documents. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UNER in improving entity extraction performance. Moreover, the UNER head enables a supervised pre-training stage on various VrD-NER datasets to enhance the document transformer backbones and exhibits substantial knowledge transfer from the pre-training stage to the fine-tuning stage. By incorporating universal layout understanding, a pre-trained UNER-based model demonstrates significant advantages in few-shot and cross-linguistic scenarios and exhibits zero-shot entity extraction abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashima Suvarna, Xiao Liu, Tanmay Parekh, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Question Under Discussion (QUD) is a discourse framework that uses implicit questions to reveal discourse relationships between sentences. In QUD parsing, each sentence is viewed as an answer to a question triggered by an anchor sentence in prior context. The resulting QUD structure is required to conform to several theoretical criteria like answer compatibility (how well the question is answered), making QUD parsing a challenging task. Previous works construct QUD parsers in a pipelined manner (i.e. detect the trigger sentence in context and then generate the question). However, these parsers lack a holistic view of the task and can hardly satisfy all the criteria. In this work, we introduce QUDSELECT, a joint-training framework that selectively decodes the QUD dependency structures considering the QUD criteria. Using instruction-tuning, we train models to simultaneously predict the anchor sentence and generate the associated question. To explicitly incorporate the criteria, we adopt a selective decoding strategy of sampling multiple QUD candidates during inference, followed by selecting the best one with criteria scorers. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models by 9% in human evaluation and 4% in automatic evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01063">Leveraging Large Language Models for Mobile App Review Feature Extraction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Quim Motger, Alessio Miaschi, Felice Dell'Orletta, Xavier Franch, Jordi Marco</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile app review analysis presents unique challenges due to the low quality, subjective bias, and noisy content of user-generated documents. Extracting features from these reviews is essential for tasks such as feature prioritization and sentiment analysis, but it remains a challenging task. Meanwhile, encoder-only models based on the Transformer architecture have shown promising results for classification and information extraction tasks for multiple software engineering processes. This study explores the hypothesis that encoder-only large language models can enhance feature extraction from mobile app reviews. By leveraging crowdsourced annotations from an industrial context, we redefine feature extraction as a supervised token classification task. Our approach includes extending the pre-training of these models with a large corpus of user reviews to improve contextual understanding and employing instance selection techniques to optimize model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this method improves the precision and recall of extracted features and enhances performance efficiency. Key contributions include a novel approach to feature extraction, annotated datasets, extended pre-trained models, and an instance selection mechanism for cost-effective fine-tuning. This research provides practical methods and empirical evidence in applying large language models to natural language processing tasks within mobile app reviews, offering improved performance in feature extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youna Kim, Hyuhng Joon Kim, Cheonbok Park, Choonghyun Park, Hyunsoo Cho, Junyeob Kim, Kang Min Yoo, Sang-goo Lee, Taeuk Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: When using large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks, such as open-domain question answering, external context can bridge a gap between external knowledge and LLM's parametric knowledge. Recent research has been developed to amplify contextual knowledge over the parametric knowledge of LLM with contrastive decoding approaches. While these approaches could yield truthful responses when relevant context is provided, they are prone to vulnerabilities when faced with noisy contexts. We extend the scope of previous studies to encompass noisy contexts and propose adaptive contrastive decoding (ACD) to leverage contextual influence effectively. ACD demonstrates improvements in open-domain question answering tasks compared to baselines, especially in robustness by remaining undistracted by noisy contexts in retrieval-augmented generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phillip Schneider, Nektarios Machner, Kristiina Jokinen, Florian Matthes</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge models are fundamental to dialogue systems for enabling conversational interactions, which require handling domain-specific knowledge. Ensuring effective communication in information-providing conversations entails aligning user understanding with the knowledge available to the system. However, dialogue systems often face challenges arising from semantic inconsistencies in how information is expressed in natural language compared to how it is represented within the system's internal knowledge. To address this problem, we study the potential of large language models for conversational grounding, a mechanism to bridge information gaps by establishing shared knowledge between dialogue participants. Our approach involves annotating human conversations across five knowledge domains to create a new dialogue corpus called BridgeKG. Through a series of experiments on this dataset, we empirically evaluate the capabilities of large language models in classifying grounding acts and identifying grounded information items within a knowledge graph structure. Our findings offer insights into how these models use in-context learning for conversational grounding tasks and common prediction errors, which we illustrate with examples from challenging dialogues. We discuss how the models handle knowledge graphs as a semantic layer between unstructured dialogue utterances and structured information items.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Zhang, Yu Du, Hongyi Li, Songchen Ma, Rong Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuromorphic computing exhibits great potential to provide high-performance benefits in various applications beyond neural networks. However, a general-purpose program execution model that aligns with the features of neuromorphic computing is required to bridge the gap between program versatility and neuromorphic hardware efficiency. The dataflow model offers a potential solution, but it faces high graph complexity and incompatibility with neuromorphic hardware when dealing with control flow programs, which decreases the programmability and performance. Here, we present a dataflow model tailored for neuromorphic hardware, called neuromorphic dataflow, which provides a compact, concise, and neuromorphic-compatible program representation for control logic. The neuromorphic dataflow introduces "when" and "where" primitives, which restructure the view of control. The neuromorphic dataflow embeds these primitives in the dataflow schema with the plasticity inherited from the spiking algorithms. Our method enables the deployment of general-purpose programs on neuromorphic hardware with both programmability and plasticity, while fully utilizing the hardware's potential.</p>

<p>Abstract: The question-answering system for Life science research, which is characterized by the rapid pace of discovery, evolving insights, and complex interactions among knowledge entities, presents unique challenges in maintaining a comprehensive knowledge warehouse and accurate information retrieval. To address these issues, we introduce BioRAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Large Language Models (LLMs) framework. Our approach starts with parsing, indexing, and segmenting an extensive collection of 22 million scientific papers as the basic knowledge, followed by training a specialized embedding model tailored to this domain. Additionally, we enhance the vector retrieval process by incorporating a domain-specific knowledge hierarchy, which aids in modeling the intricate interrelationships among each query and context. For queries requiring the most current information, BioRAG deconstructs the question and employs an iterative retrieval process incorporated with the search engine for step-by-step reasoning. Rigorous experiments have demonstrated that our model outperforms fine-tuned LLM, LLM with search engines, and other scientific RAG frameworks across multiple life science question-answering tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes IAI group's participation for automated check-worthiness estimation for claims, within the framework of the 2024 CheckThat! Lab "Task 1: Check-Worthiness Estimation". The task involves the automated detection of check-worthy claims in English, Dutch, and Arabic political debates and Twitter data. We utilized various pre-trained generative decoder and encoder transformer models, employing methods such as few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning, fine-tuning, data augmentation, and transfer learning from one language to another. Despite variable success in terms of performance, our models achieved notable placements on the organizer's leaderboard: ninth-best in English, third-best in Dutch, and the top placement in Arabic, utilizing multilingual datasets for enhancing the generalizability of check-worthiness detection. Despite a significant drop in performance on the unlabeled test dataset compared to the development test dataset, our findings contribute to the ongoing efforts in claim detection research, highlighting the challenges and potential of language-specific adaptations in claim verification systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Belanec, Simon Ostermann, Ivan Srba, Maria Bielikova</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt tuning is a modular and efficient solution for training large language models (LLMs). One of its main advantages is task modularity, making it suitable for multi-task problems. However, current soft-prompt-based methods often sacrifice multi-task modularity, requiring the training process to be fully or partially repeated for each newly added task. While recent work on task vectors applied arithmetic operations on full model weights to achieve the desired multi-task performance, a similar approach for soft-prompts is still missing. To this end, we introduce Task Prompt Vectors, created by element-wise difference between weights of tuned soft-prompts and their random initialization. Experimental results on 12 NLU datasets show that task prompt vectors can be used in low-resource settings to effectively initialize prompt tuning on similar tasks. In addition, we show that task prompt vectors are independent of the random initialization of prompt tuning. This allows prompt arithmetics with the pre-trained vectors from different tasks. In this way, by arithmetic addition of task prompt vectors from multiple tasks, we are able to outperform a state-of-the-art baseline in some cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: The adeptness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in comprehending and following natural language instructions is critical for their deployment in sophisticated real-world applications. Existing evaluations mainly focus on fragmented constraints or narrow scenarios, but they overlook the comprehensiveness and authenticity of constraints from the user's perspective. To bridge this gap, we propose CFBench, a large-scale Comprehensive Constraints Following Benchmark for LLMs, featuring 1,000 curated samples that cover more than 200 real-life scenarios and over 50 NLP tasks. CFBench meticulously compiles constraints from real-world instructions and constructs an innovative systematic framework for constraint types, which includes 10 primary categories and over 25 subcategories, and ensures each constraint is seamlessly integrated within the instructions. To make certain that the evaluation of LLM outputs aligns with user perceptions, we propose an advanced methodology that integrates multi-dimensional assessment criteria with requirement prioritization, covering various perspectives of constraints, instructions, and requirement fulfillment. Evaluating current leading LLMs on CFBench reveals substantial room for improvement in constraints following, and we further investigate influencing factors and enhancement strategies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichun Wang, Xuan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Entity Alignment (EA) aims to match equivalent entities in different Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which is essential for knowledge fusion and integration. Recently, embedding-based EA has attracted significant attention and many approaches have been proposed. Early approaches primarily focus on learning entity embeddings from the structural features of KGs, defined by relation triples. Later methods incorporated entities' names and attributes as auxiliary information to enhance embeddings for EA. However, these approaches often used different techniques to encode structural and attribute information, limiting their interaction and mutual enhancement. In this work, we propose a dense entity retrieval framework for EA, leveraging language models to uniformly encode various features of entities and facilitate nearest entity search across KGs. Alignment candidates are first generated through entity retrieval, which are subsequently reranked to determine the final alignments. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both cross-lingual and monolingual EA datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing EA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Zhou, Daniel Gei{\ss}ler, Paul Lukowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advances in natural language processing, but their underlying mechanisms are often misunderstood. Despite exhibiting coherent answers and apparent reasoning behaviors, LLMs rely on statistical patterns in word embeddings rather than true cognitive processes. This leads to vulnerabilities such as "hallucination" and misinformation. The paper argues that current LLM architectures are inherently untrustworthy due to their reliance on correlations of sequential patterns of word embedding vectors. However, ongoing research into combining generative transformer-based models with fact bases and logic programming languages may lead to the development of trustworthy LLMs capable of generating statements based on given truth and explaining their self-reasoning process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel B. Hier, S. Ilyas Munzir, Anne Stahlfeld, Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi, Michael D. Carrithers</p>
<p>Abstract: High-throughput phenotyping automates the mapping of patient signs to standardized ontology concepts and is essential for precision medicine. This study evaluates the automation of phenotyping of clinical summaries from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database using large language models. Due to their rich phenotype data, these summaries can be surrogates for physician notes. We conduct a performance comparison of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our results indicate that GPT-4 surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo in identifying, categorizing, and normalizing signs, achieving concordance with manual annotators comparable to inter-rater agreement. Despite some limitations in sign normalization, the extensive pre-training of GPT-4 results in high performance and generalizability across several phenotyping tasks while obviating the need for manually annotated training data. Large language models are expected to be the dominant method for automating high-throughput phenotyping of clinical text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunlun Zhu, Yifan Luo, Dingling Xu, Ruobing Wang, Shi Yu, Shuo Wang, Yukun Yan, Zhenghao Liu, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have demonstrated their advantages in alleviating the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing RAG benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating whether LLMs can correctly answer the general knowledge. However, they are unable to evaluate the effectiveness of the RAG system in dealing with the data from different vertical domains. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework for automatically generating evaluation datasets to evaluate the knowledge usage ability of different LLMs in different scenarios. Specifically, RAGEval summarizes a schema from seed documents, applies the configurations to generate diverse documents, and constructs question-answering pairs according to both articles and configurations. We propose three novel metrics, Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance, to carefully evaluate the responses generated by LLMs. By benchmarking RAG models in vertical domains, RAGEval has the ability to better evaluate the knowledge usage ability of LLMs, which avoids the confusion regarding the source of knowledge in answering question in existing QA datasets--whether it comes from parameterized memory or retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Chen, Yangfeng Ji, David Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now being considered and even deployed for applications that support high-stakes decision-making, such as recruitment and clinical decisions. While several methods have been proposed for measuring bias, there remains a gap between predictions, which are what the proposed methods consider, and how they are used to make decisions. In this work, we introduce Rank-Allocational-Based Bias Index (RABBI), a model-agnostic bias measure that assesses potential allocational harms arising from biases in LLM predictions. We compare RABBI and current bias metrics on two allocation decision tasks. We evaluate their predictive validity across ten LLMs and utility for model selection. Our results reveal that commonly-used bias metrics based on average performance gap and distribution distance fail to reliably capture group disparities in allocation outcomes, whereas RABBI exhibits a strong correlation with allocation disparities. Our work highlights the need to account for how models are used in contexts with limited resource constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Ding, Jean Lee, Soyeon Caren Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) are essential in academia, finance, medical fields, and marketing due to their multimodal information content. Traditional methods for extracting information from VRDs depend on expert knowledge and manual labor, making them costly and inefficient. The advent of deep learning has revolutionized this process, introducing models that leverage multimodal information vision, text, and layout along with pretraining tasks to develop comprehensive document representations. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of information extraction from VRDs. In response to the growing demands and rapid developments in Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), this paper provides a comprehensive review of deep learning-based VRDU frameworks. We systematically survey and analyze existing methods and benchmark datasets, categorizing them based on adopted strategies and downstream tasks. Furthermore, we compare different techniques used in VRDU models, focusing on feature representation and fusion, model architecture, and pretraining methods, while highlighting their strengths, limitations, and appropriate scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging trends and challenges in VRDU, offering insights into future research directions and practical applications. This survey aims to provide a thorough understanding of VRDU advancements, benefiting both academic and industrial sectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Zhang, Dongyuan Li, Manabu Okumura</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning token embeddings based on token co-occurrence statistics has proven effective for both pre-training and fine-tuning in natural language processing. However, recent studies have pointed out the distribution of learned embeddings degenerates into anisotropy, and even pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from a loss of semantics-related information in embeddings for low-frequency tokens. This study first analyzes fine-tuning dynamics of a PLM, BART-large, and demonstrates its robustness against degeneration. On the basis of this finding, we propose DefinitionEMB, a method that utilizes definitions to construct isotropically distributed and semantics-related token embeddings for PLMs while maintaining original robustness during fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging definitions from Wiktionary to construct such embeddings for RoBERTa-base and BART-large. Furthermore, the constructed embeddings for low-frequency tokens improve the performance of these models across various GLUE and four text summarization datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning stands as a crucial advancement in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for enhanced task performance. However, the annotation of instruction datasets has traditionally been expensive and laborious, often relying on manual annotations or costly API calls of proprietary LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce FANNO, a fully autonomous, open-sourced framework that revolutionizes the annotation process without the need for pre-existing annotated data. Utilizing a Mistral-7b-instruct model, FANNO efficiently produces diverse and high-quality datasets through a structured process involving document pre-screening, instruction generation, and response generation. Experiments on Open LLM Leaderboard and AlpacaEval benchmark show that the FANNO can generate high-quality data with diversity and complexity for free, comparable to human-annotated or cleaned datasets like Alpaca-GPT4-Cleaned.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takashi Furuya, Maarten V. de Hoop, Gabriel Peyr\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define "in-context mappings" which enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt in NLP applications or a set of patches for vision transformers). This work studies in particular the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily large number of context tokens. To mathematically and uniformly address the expressivity of these architectures, we consider the case that the mappings are conditioned on a context represented by a probability distribution of tokens (discrete for a finite number of tokens). The related notion of smoothness corresponds to continuity in terms of the Wasserstein distance between these contexts. We demonstrate that deep transformers are universal and can approximate continuous in-context mappings to arbitrary precision, uniformly over compact token domains. A key aspect of our results, compared to existing findings, is that for a fixed precision, a single transformer can operate on an arbitrary (even infinite) number of tokens. Additionally, it operates with a fixed embedding dimension of tokens (this dimension does not increase with precision) and a fixed number of heads (proportional to the dimension). The use of MLP layers between multi-head attention layers is also explicitly controlled.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prattyush Mangal, Carol Mak, Theo Kanakis, Timothy Donovan, Dave Braines, Edward Pyzer-Knapp</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally altered the way we interact with digital systems and have led to the pursuit of LLM powered AI agents to assist in daily workflows. LLMs, whilst powerful and capable of demonstrating some emergent properties, are not logical reasoners and often struggle to perform well at all sub-tasks carried out by an AI agent to plan and execute a workflow. While existing studies tackle this lack of proficiency by generalised pretraining at a huge scale or by specialised fine-tuning for tool use, we assess if a system comprising of a coalition of pretrained LLMs, each exhibiting specialised performance at individual sub-tasks, can match the performance of single model agents. The coalition of models approach showcases its potential for building robustness and reducing the operational costs of these AI agents by leveraging traits exhibited by specific models. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuning can be mitigated by considering a coalition of pretrained models and believe that this approach can be applied to other non-agentic systems which utilise LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01394">Improving Multilingual Neural Machine Translation by Utilizing Semantic and Linguistic Features</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyu Bu, Shuhao Gu, Yang Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: The many-to-many multilingual neural machine translation can be regarded as the process of integrating semantic features from the source sentences and linguistic features from the target sentences. To enhance zero-shot translation, models need to share knowledge across languages, which can be achieved through auxiliary tasks for learning a universal representation or cross-lingual mapping. To this end, we propose to exploit both semantic and linguistic features between multiple languages to enhance multilingual translation. On the encoder side, we introduce a disentangling learning task that aligns encoder representations by disentangling semantic and linguistic features, thus facilitating knowledge transfer while preserving complete information. On the decoder side, we leverage a linguistic encoder to integrate low-level linguistic features to assist in the target language generation. Experimental results on multilingual datasets demonstrate significant improvement in zero-shot translation compared to the baseline system, while maintaining performance in supervised translation. Further analysis validates the effectiveness of our method in leveraging both semantic and linguistic features. The code is available at https://github.com/ictnlp/SemLing-MNMT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Hua, Yoav Artzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans spontaneously use increasingly efficient language as interactions progress, by adapting and forming ad-hoc conventions. This phenomenon has been studied extensively using reference games, showing properties of human language that go beyond relaying intents. It remains unexplored whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) similarly increase communication efficiency during interactions, and what mechanisms they may adopt for this purpose. We introduce ICCA, an automated framework to evaluate such conversational adaptation as an in-context behavior in MLLMs. We evaluate several state-of-the-art MLLMs, and observe that while they may understand the increasingly efficient language of their interlocutor, they do not spontaneously make their own language more efficient over time. This latter ability can only be elicited in some models (e.g., GPT-4) with heavy-handed prompting. This shows that this property of linguistic interaction does not arise from current training regimes, even though it is a common hallmark of human language.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongwu Xu, Xuan Qi, Zehan Qi, Wei Xu, Zhijiang Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled us to seek answers to inherently debatable questions on LLM chatbots, necessitating a reliable way to evaluate their ability. However, traditional QA benchmarks assume fixed answers are inadequate for this purpose. To address this, we introduce DebateQA, a dataset of 2,941 debatable questions, each accompanied by multiple human-annotated partial answers that capture a variety of perspectives. We develop two metrics: Perspective Diversity, which evaluates the comprehensiveness of perspectives, and Dispute Awareness, which assesses if the LLM acknowledges the question's debatable nature. Experiments demonstrate that both metrics align with human preferences and are stable across different underlying models. Using DebateQA with two metrics, we assess 12 popular LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation methods. Our findings reveal that while LLMs generally excel at recognizing debatable issues, their ability to provide comprehensive answers encompassing diverse perspectives varies considerably.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01423">Prompt Recursive Search: A Living Framework with Adaptive Growth in LLM Auto-Prompting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Zhao, Chengqian Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable proficiency in addressing a diverse array of tasks within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, with various prompt design strategies significantly augmenting their capabilities. However, these prompts, while beneficial, each possess inherent limitations. The primary prompt design methodologies are twofold: The first, exemplified by the Chain of Thought (CoT), involves manually crafting prompts specific to individual datasets, hence termed Expert-Designed Prompts (EDPs). Once these prompts are established, they are unalterable, and their effectiveness is capped by the expertise of the human designers. When applied to LLMs, the static nature of EDPs results in a uniform approach to both simple and complex problems within the same dataset, leading to the inefficient use of tokens for straightforward issues. The second method involves prompts autonomously generated by the LLM, known as LLM-Derived Prompts (LDPs), which provide tailored solutions to specific problems, mitigating the limitations of EDPs. However, LDPs may encounter a decline in performance when tackling complex problems due to the potential for error accumulation during the solution planning process. To address these challenges, we have conceived a novel Prompt Recursive Search (PRS) framework that leverages the LLM to generate solutions specific to the problem, thereby conserving tokens. The framework incorporates an assessment of problem complexity and an adjustable structure, ensuring a reduction in the likelihood of errors. We have substantiated the efficacy of PRS framework through extensive experiments using LLMs with different numbers of parameters across a spectrum of datasets in various domains. Compared to the CoT method, the PRS method has increased the accuracy on the BBH dataset by 8% using Llama3-7B model, achieving a 22% improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the proliferation of social platforms has drastically transformed the way individuals interact, organize, and share information. In this scenario, we experience an unprecedented increase in the scale and complexity of interactions and, at the same time, little to no research about some fringe social platforms. In this paper, we present a multi-dimensional framework for characterizing nodes and hyperedges in social hypernetworks, with a focus on the understudied alt-right platform Scored.co. Our approach integrates the possibility of studying higher-order interactions, thanks to the hypernetwork representation, and various node features such as user activity, sentiment, and toxicity, with the aim to define distinct user archetypes and understand their roles within the network. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Scored.co, we analyze the dynamics of these archetypes over time and explore their interactions and influence within the community. The framework's versatility allows for detailed analysis of both individual user behaviors and broader social structures. Our findings highlight the importance of higher-order interactions in understanding social dynamics, offering new insights into the roles and behaviors that emerge in complex online environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linhan Xia, Jiaxin Cai, Ricky Yuen-Tan Hou, Seon-Phil Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, network communications based on the Shannon-Nyquist theorem gradually reveal their limitations due to the neglect of semantic information in the transmitted content. Semantic communication (SemCom) provides a solution for extracting information meanings from the transmitted content. The semantic information can be successfully interpreted by a receiver with the help of a shared knowledge base (KB). This paper proposes a two-stage hierarchical qualification and validation model for natural language-based machine-to-machine (M2M) SemCom. The approach can be applied in various applications, such as autonomous driving and edge computing. In the proposed model, we quantitatively measure the degree of understanding (DoU) between two communication parties at the word and sentence levels. The DoU is validated and ensured at each level before moving to the next step. The model's effectiveness is verified through a series of experiments, and the results show that the quantification and validation method proposed in this paper can significantly improve the DoU of inter-machine SemCom.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research explores the nuanced differences in texts produced by AI and those written by humans, aiming to elucidate how language is expressed differently by AI and humans. Through comprehensive statistical data analysis, the study investigates various linguistic traits, patterns of creativity, and potential biases inherent in human-written and AI- generated texts. The significance of this research lies in its contribution to understanding AI's creative capabilities and its impact on literature, communication, and societal frameworks. By examining a meticulously curated dataset comprising 500K essays spanning diverse topics and genres, generated by LLMs, or written by humans, the study uncovers the deeper layers of linguistic expression and provides insights into the cognitive processes underlying both AI and human-driven textual compositions. The analysis revealed that human-authored essays tend to have a higher total word count on average than AI-generated essays but have a shorter average word length compared to AI- generated essays, and while both groups exhibit high levels of fluency, the vocabulary diversity of Human authored content is higher than AI generated content. However, AI- generated essays show a slightly higher level of novelty, suggesting the potential for generating more original content through AI systems. The paper addresses challenges in assessing the language generation capabilities of AI models and emphasizes the importance of datasets that reflect the complexities of human-AI collaborative writing. Through systematic preprocessing and rigorous statistical analysis, this study offers valuable insights into the evolving landscape of AI-generated content and informs future developments in natural language processing (NLP).</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Golden-Retriever, designed to efficiently navigate vast industrial knowledge bases, overcoming challenges in traditional LLM fine-tuning and RAG frameworks with domain-specific jargon and context interpretation. Golden-Retriever incorporates a reflection-based question augmentation step before document retrieval, which involves identifying jargon, clarifying its meaning based on context, and augmenting the question accordingly. Specifically, our method extracts and lists all jargon and abbreviations in the input question, determines the context against a pre-defined list, and queries a jargon dictionary for extended definitions and descriptions. This comprehensive augmentation ensures the RAG framework retrieves the most relevant documents by providing clear context and resolving ambiguities, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Evaluations using three open-source LLMs on a domain-specific question-answer dataset demonstrate Golden-Retriever's superior performance, providing a robust solution for efficiently integrating and querying industrial knowledge bases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements have showcased the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in executing reasoning tasks, particularly facilitated by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. While tasks like arithmetic reasoning involve clear, definitive answers and logical chains of thought, the application of LLM reasoning in recommendation systems (RecSys) presents a distinct challenge. RecSys tasks revolve around subjectivity and personalized preferences, an under-explored domain in utilizing LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our study explores several aspects to better understand reasoning for RecSys and demonstrate how task quality improves by utilizing LLM reasoning in both zero-shot and finetuning settings. Additionally, we propose RecSAVER (Recommender Systems Automatic Verification and Evaluation of Reasoning) to automatically assess the quality of LLM reasoning responses without the requirement of curated gold references or human raters. We show that our framework aligns with real human judgment on the coherence and faithfulness of reasoning responses. Overall, our work shows that incorporating reasoning into RecSys can improve personalized tasks, paving the way for further advancements in recommender system methodologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Database queries traditionally operate under the closed-world assumption, providing no answers to questions that require information beyond the data stored in the database. Hybrid querying using SQL offers an alternative by integrating relational databases with large language models (LLMs) to answer beyond-database questions. In this paper, we present the first cross-domain benchmark, SWAN, containing 120 beyond-database questions over four real-world databases. To leverage state-of-the-art language models in addressing these complex questions in SWAN, we present, HQDL, a preliminary solution for hybrid querying, and also discuss potential future directions. Our evaluation demonstrates that HQDL using GPT-4 Turbo with few-shot prompts, achieves 40.0\% in execution accuracy and 48.2\% in data factuality. These results highlights both the potential and challenges for hybrid querying. We believe that our work will inspire further research in creating more efficient and accurate data systems that seamlessly integrate relational databases and large language models to address beyond-database questions.</p>

Such workflows become more effective with reliable confidence estimation. Unfortunately, confidence estimation is a documented weakness of models such as GPT-4, and established methods to compensate require significant additional complexity and computation. The present effort explores methods for effective confidence estimation with GPT-4 with few-shot learning for event detection in the BETTER ontology as a vehicle. The key innovation is expanding the prompt and task presented to GPT-4 to provide License to speculate when unsure and Opportunity to quantify and explain its uncertainty (L&O). This approach improves accuracy and provides usable confidence measures (0.759 AUC) with no additional machinery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Han, Yiwei Yang, Anat Caspi, Bill Howe</p>
<p>Abstract: Equitable urban transportation applications require high-fidelity digital representations of the built environment: not just streets and sidewalks, but bike lanes, marked and unmarked crossings, curb ramps and cuts, obstructions, traffic signals, signage, street markings, potholes, and more. Direct inspections and manual annotations are prohibitively expensive at scale. Conventional machine learning methods require substantial annotated training data for adequate performance. In this paper, we consider vision language models as a mechanism for annotating diverse urban features from satellite images, reducing the dependence on human annotation to produce large training sets. While these models have achieved impressive results in describing common objects in images captured from a human perspective, their training sets are less likely to include strong signals for esoteric features in the built environment, and their performance in these settings is therefore unclear. We demonstrate proof-of-concept combining a state-of-the-art vision language model and variants of a prompting strategy that asks the model to consider segmented elements independently of the original image. Experiments on two urban features -- stop lines and raised tables -- show that while direct zero-shot prompting correctly annotates nearly zero images, the pre-segmentation strategies can annotate images with near 40% intersection-over-union accuracy. We describe how these results inform a new research agenda in automatic annotation of the built environment to improve equity, accessibility, and safety at broad scale and in diverse environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hojae Han, Jaejin Kim, Jaeseok Yoo, Youngwon Lee, Seung-won Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims to extend the code generation capability of large language models (LLMs) to automatically manage comprehensive software requirements from given textual descriptions. Such requirements include both functional (i.e. achieving expected behavior for inputs) and non-functional (e.g., time/space performance, robustness, maintainability) requirements. However, textual descriptions can either express requirements verbosely or may even omit some of them. We introduce ARCHCODE, a novel framework that leverages in-context learning to organize requirements observed in descriptions and to extrapolate unexpressed requirements from them. ARCHCODE generates requirements from given descriptions, conditioning them to produce code snippets and test cases. Each test case is tailored to one of the requirements, allowing for the ranking of code snippets based on the compliance of their execution results with the requirements. Public benchmarks show that ARCHCODE enhances to satisfy functional requirements, significantly improving Pass@k scores. Furthermore, we introduce HumanEval-NFR, the first evaluation of LLMs' non-functional requirements in code generation, demonstrating ARCHCODE's superiority over baseline methods. The implementation of ARCHCODE and the HumanEval-NFR benchmark are both publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Liang, Zhengyang Li, Weitong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the FinSen dataset that revolutionizes financial market analysis by integrating economic and financial news articles from 197 countries with stock market data. The dataset's extensive coverage spans 15 years from 2007 to 2023 with temporal information, offering a rich, global perspective with 160,000 records on financial market news. Our study leverages causally validated sentiment scores and LSTM models to enhance market forecast accuracy and reliability. Utilizing the FinSen dataset, we introduce an innovative Focal Calibration Loss, reducing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to 3.34 percent with the DAN 3 model. This not only improves prediction accuracy but also aligns probabilistic forecasts closely with real outcomes, crucial for the financial sector where predicted probability is paramount. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of combining sentiment analysis with precise calibration techniques for trustworthy financial forecasting where the cost of misinterpretation can be high.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matias Martinez</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent surge of open-source large language models (LLMs) enables developers to create AI-based solutions while maintaining control over aspects such as privacy and compliance, thereby providing governance and ownership of the model deployment process. To utilize these LLMs, inference engines are needed. These engines load the model's weights onto available resources, such as GPUs, and process queries to generate responses. The speed of inference, or performance, of the LLM, is critical for real-time applications, as it computes millions or billions of floating point operations per inference. Recently, advanced inference engines such as vLLM have emerged, incorporating novel mechanisms such as efficient memory management to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we analyze the performance, particularly the throughput (tokens generated per unit of time), of 20 LLMs using two inference libraries: vLLM and HuggingFace's pipelines. We investigate how various hyperparameters, which developers must configure, influence inference performance. Our results reveal that throughput landscapes are irregular, with distinct peaks, highlighting the importance of hyperparameter optimization to achieve maximum performance. We also show that applying hyperparameter optimization when upgrading or downgrading the GPU model used for inference can improve throughput from HuggingFace pipelines by an average of 9.16% and 13.7%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benno Weck, Ilaria Manco, Emmanouil Benetos, Elio Quinton, George Fazekas, Dmitry Bogdanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal models that jointly process audio and language hold great promise in audio understanding and are increasingly being adopted in the music domain. By allowing users to query via text and obtain information about a given audio input, these models have the potential to enable a variety of music understanding tasks via language-based interfaces. However, their evaluation poses considerable challenges, and it remains unclear how to effectively assess their ability to correctly interpret music-related inputs with current methods. Motivated by this, we introduce MuChoMusic, a benchmark for evaluating music understanding in multimodal language models focused on audio. MuChoMusic comprises 1,187 multiple-choice questions, all validated by human annotators, on 644 music tracks sourced from two publicly available music datasets, and covering a wide variety of genres. Questions in the benchmark are crafted to assess knowledge and reasoning abilities across several dimensions that cover fundamental musical concepts and their relation to cultural and functional contexts. Through the holistic analysis afforded by the benchmark, we evaluate five open-source models and identify several pitfalls, including an over-reliance on the language modality, pointing to a need for better multimodal integration. Data and code are open-sourced.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models are expressive tools that enable complex tasks of text understanding within Computational Social Science. Their versatility, while beneficial, poses a barrier for establishing standardized best practices within the field. To bring clarity on the values of different strategies, we present an overview of the performance of modern LLM-based classification methods on a benchmark of 23 social knowledge tasks. Our results point to three best practices: select models with larger vocabulary and pre-training corpora; avoid simple zero-shot in favor of AI-enhanced prompting; fine-tune on task-specific data, and consider more complex forms instruction-tuning on multiple datasets only when only training data is more abundant.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jheng-Hong Yang, Jimmy Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated success across diverse applications, yet their potential to assist in relevance judgments remains uncertain. This paper assesses the relevance estimation capabilities of VLMs, including CLIP, LLaVA, and GPT-4V, within a large-scale \textit{ad hoc} retrieval task tailored for multimedia content creation in a zero-shot fashion. Preliminary experiments reveal the following: (1) Both LLaVA and GPT-4V, encompassing open-source and closed-source visual-instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), achieve notable Kendall's $\tau \sim 0.4$ when compared to human relevance judgments, surpassing the CLIPScore metric. (2) While CLIPScore is strongly preferred, LLMs are less biased towards CLIP-based retrieval systems. (3) GPT-4V's score distribution aligns more closely with human judgments than other models, achieving a Cohen's $\kappa$ value of around 0.08, which outperforms CLIPScore at approximately -0.096. These findings underscore the potential of LLM-powered VLMs in enhancing relevance judgments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yang, Pan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT) has emerged as a promising class of algorithms in offline reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, leveraging pre-collected datasets and Transformer's capability to model long sequences. Recent works have demonstrated that using parts of trajectories from training tasks as prompts in DT enhances its performance on unseen tasks, giving rise to Prompt-DT methods. However, collecting data from specific environments can be both costly and unsafe in many scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance and limited few-shot prompt abilities due to the data-hungry nature of Transformer-based models. Additionally, the limited datasets used in pre-training make it challenging for Prompt-DT type of methods to distinguish between various RL tasks through prompts alone. To address these challenges, we introduce the Language model-initialized Prompt Decision Transformer (LPDT), which leverages pre-trained language models for meta-RL tasks and fine-tunes the model using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA). We further incorporate prompt regularization to effectively differentiate between tasks based on prompt feature representations. Our approach integrates pre-trained language model and RL tasks seamlessly. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that initializing with a pre-trained language model significantly enhances the performance of Prompt-DT on unseen tasks compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingtong Su, Julia Kempe, Karen Ullrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on a deluge of text data with limited quality control. As a result, LLMs can exhibit unintended or even harmful behaviours, such as leaking information, fake news or hate speech. Countermeasures, commonly referred to as preference alignment, include fine-tuning the pretrained LLMs with carefully crafted text examples of desired behaviour. Even then, empirical evidence shows preference aligned LLMs can be enticed to harmful behaviour. This so called jailbreaking of LLMs is typically achieved by adversarially modifying the input prompt to the LLM. Our paper provides theoretical insights into the phenomenon of preference alignment and jailbreaking from a statistical perspective. Under our framework, we first show that pretrained LLMs will mimic harmful behaviour if present in the training corpus. Under that same framework, we then introduce a statistical notion of alignment, and lower-bound the jailbreaking probability, showing that it is unpreventable under reasonable assumptions. Based on our insights, we propose an alteration to the currently prevalent alignment strategy RLHF. Specifically, we introduce a simple modification to the RLHF objective, we call E-RLHF, that aims to increase the likelihood of safe responses. E-RLHF brings no additional training cost, and is compatible with other methods. Empirically, we demonstrate that E-RLHF outperforms RLHF on all alignment problems put forward by the AdvBench and HarmBench project without sacrificing model performance as measured by the MT-Bench project.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomer Wolfson, Daniel Deutch, Jonathan Berant</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL parsers are crucial in enabling non-experts to effortlessly query relational data. Training such parsers, by contrast, generally requires expertise in annotating natural language (NL) utterances with corresponding SQL queries. In this work, we propose a weak supervision approach for training text-to-SQL parsers. We take advantage of the recently proposed question meaning representation called QDMR, an intermediate between NL and formal query languages. Given questions, their QDMR structures (annotated by non-experts or automatically predicted), and the answers, we are able to automatically synthesize SQL queries that are used to train text-to-SQL models. We test our approach by experimenting on five benchmark datasets. Our results show that the weakly supervised models perform competitively with those trained on annotated NL-SQL data. Overall, we effectively train text-to-SQL parsers, while using zero SQL annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ori Yoran, Tomer Wolfson, Ben Bogin, Uri Katz, Daniel Deutch, Jonathan Berant</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern systems for multi-hop question answering (QA) typically break questions into a sequence of reasoning steps, termed chain-of-thought (CoT), before arriving at a final answer. Often, multiple chains are sampled and aggregated through a voting mechanism over the final answers, but the intermediate steps themselves are discarded. While such approaches improve performance, they do not consider the relations between intermediate steps across chains and do not provide a unified explanation for the predicted answer. We introduce Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR), an approach which prompts large language models to meta-reason over multiple chains of thought, rather than aggregating their answers. MCR examines different reasoning chains, mixes information between them and selects the most relevant facts in generating an explanation and predicting the answer. MCR outperforms strong baselines on 7 multi-hop QA datasets. Moreover, our analysis reveals that MCR explanations exhibit high quality, enabling humans to verify its answers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data plays a fundamental role in training Large Language Models (LLMs). Efficient data management, particularly in formulating a well-suited training dataset, is significant for enhancing model performance and improving training efficiency during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning stages. Despite the considerable importance of data management, the underlying mechanism of current prominent practices are still unknown. Consequently, the exploration of data management has attracted more and more attention among the research community. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current research in data management within both the pretraining and supervised fine-tuning stages of LLMs, covering various aspects of data management strategy design. Looking into the future, we extrapolate existing challenges and outline promising directions for development in this field. Therefore, this survey serves as a guiding resource for practitioners aspiring to construct powerful LLMs through efficient data management practices.

<p>Abstract: Over the past few years, one of the most notable advancements in AI research has been in foundation models (FMs), headlined by the rise of language models (LMs). As the models' size increases, LMs demonstrate enhancements in measurable aspects and the development of new qualitative features. However, despite researchers' attention and the rapid growth in LM application, the capabilities, limitations, and associated risks still need to be better understood. To address these issues, we introduce an open Multimodal Evaluation of Russian-language Architectures (MERA), a new instruction benchmark for evaluating foundation models oriented towards the Russian language. The benchmark encompasses 21 evaluation tasks for generative models in 11 skill domains and is designed as a black-box test to ensure the exclusion of data leakage. The paper introduces a methodology to evaluate FMs and LMs in zero- and few-shot fixed instruction settings that can be extended to other modalities. We propose an evaluation methodology, an open-source code base for the MERA assessment, and a leaderboard with a submission system. We evaluate open LMs as baselines and find that they are still far behind the human level. We publicly release MERA to guide forthcoming research, anticipate groundbreaking model features, standardize the evaluation procedure, and address potential societal drawbacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Mohammadshahi, Arshad Rafiq Shaikh, Majid Yazdani</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing foundational large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly costly and inefficient. Also, closed-source and larger open-source models generally offer better response quality but come with higher inference costs than smaller models. In this paper, we introduce Routoo, an architecture designed to optimize the selection of LLMs for specific prompts based on performance, cost, and efficiency. Routoo consists of two key components: a performance predictor and a cost-aware decoding. The performance predictor is a lightweight LLM that estimates the performance of various underlying LLMs without needing to execute and evaluate them. The cost-aware decoding then selects the most suitable model based on these predictions and other constraints like cost and latency. We evaluated Routoo using the MMLU benchmark across 57 domains employing open-source models. Our results show that Routoo matches the performance of the Mixtral 8x7b model while reducing inference costs by one-third. Additionally, by allowing increased costs, Routoo surpasses Mixtral's accuracy by over 5% at equivalent costs, achieving an accuracy of 75.9%. When integrating GPT4 into our model pool, Routoo nearly matches GPT4's performance at half the cost and exceeds it with a 25% cost reduction. These outcomes highlight Routoo's potential to create new SOTA in a cost-effective manner by leveraging the collective knowledge of multiple LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinu Lee, Wonseok Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning ability, providing a structured, explainable proof to ensure explainability, i.e. structured reasoning, still remains challenging. Among two directions of structured reasoning, we specifically focus on backward chaining, where the query is recursively decomposed to subgoals by applying inference rules. We point out that current popular backward chaining implementations (Least-to-most prompting and LAMBADA) fail to implement the necessary features of backward chaining, such as arbitrary-depth recursion and binding propagation. To this end, we propose a novel backward chaining framework, SymBa (Symbolic Backward Chaining). In SymBA, a symbolic solver controls the whole proof process, and an LLM searches for the relevant natural language premises and translates them into a symbolic form for the solver. By this LLM-solver integration, while producing a completely structured proof that is symbolically verified, SymBa achieves significant improvement in performance, proof accuracy, and efficiency in diverse structured reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have shown high performance on many tasks in natural language processing. This is also true for sentence embedding learning, where a decoder-based model, PromptEOL, has achieved the best performance on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. However, PromptEOL requires a manually annotated natural language inference (NLI) dataset for fine-tuning. We aim to improve sentence embeddings without using large manually annotated datasets by automatically generating an NLI dataset with an LLM and using it for fine-tuning of PromptEOL. To achieve this, we explore methods of data generation suitable for sentence embedding learning in this study. Specifically, we will focus on automatic dataset generation through few-shot learning and explore the appropriate methods to leverage few-shot examples. Experimental results on the STS tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing models in settings without large manually annotated datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: A major factor in the recent success of large language models is the use of enormous and ever-growing text datasets for unsupervised pre-training. However, naively training a model on all available data may not be optimal (or feasible), as the quality of available text data can vary. Filtering out data can also decrease the carbon footprint and financial costs of training models by reducing the amount of training required. Data selection methods aim to determine which candidate data points to include in the training dataset and how to appropriately sample from the selected data points. The promise of improved data selection methods has caused the volume of research in the area to rapidly expand. However, because deep learning is mostly driven by empirical evidence and experimentation on large-scale data is expensive, few organizations have the resources for extensive data selection research. Consequently, knowledge of effective data selection practices has become concentrated within a few organizations, many of which do not openly share their findings and methodologies. To narrow this gap in knowledge, we present a comprehensive review of existing literature on data selection methods and related research areas, providing a taxonomy of existing approaches. By describing the current landscape of research, this work aims to accelerate progress in data selection by establishing an entry point for new and established researchers. Additionally, throughout this review we draw attention to noticeable holes in the literature and conclude the paper by proposing promising avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Wang, Wen Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Given that natural language serves as the primary conduit for expressing thoughts and emotions, text analysis has become a key technique in psychological research. It enables the extraction of valuable insights from natural language, facilitating endeavors like personality traits assessment, mental health monitoring, and sentiment analysis in interpersonal communications. In text analysis, existing studies often resort to either human coding, which is time-consuming, using pre-built dictionaries, which often fails to cover all possible scenarios, or training models from scratch, which requires large amounts of labeled data. In this tutorial, we introduce the pretrain-finetune paradigm. The pretrain-finetune paradigm represents a transformative approach in text analysis and natural language processing. This paradigm distinguishes itself through the use of large pretrained language models, demonstrating remarkable efficiency in finetuning tasks, even with limited training data. This efficiency is especially beneficial for research in social sciences, where the number of annotated samples is often quite limited. Our tutorial offers a comprehensive introduction to the pretrain-finetune paradigm. We first delve into the fundamental concepts of pretraining and finetuning, followed by practical exercises using real-world applications. We demonstrate the application of the paradigm across various tasks, including multi-class classification and regression. Emphasizing its efficacy and user-friendliness, the tutorial aims to encourage broader adoption of this paradigm. To this end, we have provided open access to all our code and datasets. The tutorial is highly beneficial across various psychology disciplines, providing a comprehensive guide to employing text analysis in diverse research settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Event reasoning is a fundamental ability that underlies many applications. It requires event schema knowledge to perform global reasoning and needs to deal with the diversity of the inter-event relations and the reasoning paradigms. How well LLMs accomplish event reasoning on various relations and reasoning paradigms remains unknown. To mitigate this disparity, we comprehensively evaluate the abilities of event reasoning of LLMs. We introduce a novel benchmark EV2 for EValuation of EVent reasoning. EV2 consists of two levels of evaluation of schema and instance and is comprehensive in relations and reasoning paradigms. We conduct extensive experiments on EV2. We find that LLMs have abilities to accomplish event reasoning but their performances are far from satisfactory. We also notice the imbalance of event reasoning abilities in LLMs. Besides, LLMs have event schema knowledge, however, they're not aligned with humans on how to utilize the knowledge. Based on these findings, we guide the LLMs in utilizing the event schema knowledge as memory leading to improvements on event reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Koren Ishlach, Itzhak Ben-David, Michael Fire, Lior Rokach</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding news articles is a crucial tool for multiple fields, such as media bias detection, identifying fake news, and making news recommendations. However, existing news embedding methods are not optimized to capture the latent context of news events. Most embedding methods rely on full-text information and neglect time-relevant embedding generation. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight method that optimizes news embedding generation by focusing on entities and themes mentioned in articles and their historical connections to specific events. We suggest a method composed of three stages. First, we process and extract events, entities, and themes from the given news articles. Second, we generate periodic time embeddings for themes and entities by training time-separated GloVe models on current and historical data. Lastly, we concatenate the news embeddings generated by two distinct approaches: Smooth Inverse Frequency (SIF) for article-level vectors and Siamese Neural Networks for embeddings with nuanced event-related information. We leveraged over 850,000 news articles and 1,000,000 events from the GDELT project to test and evaluate our method. We conducted a comparative analysis of different news embedding generation methods for validation. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach can both improve and outperform state-of-the-art methods on shared event detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Lu, Shengwei Xu, Yichi Zhang, Yuqing Kong, Grant Schoenebeck</p>
<p>Abstract: Peer prediction mechanisms motivate high-quality feedback with provable guarantees. However, current methods only apply to rather simple reports, like multiple-choice or scalar numbers. We aim to broaden these techniques to the larger domain of text-based reports, drawing on the recent developments in large language models. This vastly increases the applicability of peer prediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety of feedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments on social media.
  We introduce two mechanisms, the Generative Peer Prediction Mechanism (GPPM) and the Generative Synopsis Peer Prediction Mechanism (GSPPM). These mechanisms utilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction of her peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction is sufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort and truth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, we confirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on two real datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset. We highlight the results that on the ICLR dataset, our mechanisms can differentiate three quality levels -- human-written reviews, GPT-4-generated reviews, and GPT-3.5-generated reviews in terms of expected scores. Additionally, GSPPM penalizes LLM-generated reviews more effectively than GPPM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Haller, Lena S. Bolliger, Lena A. J\"ager</p>
<p>Abstract: To date, most investigations on surprisal and entropy effects in reading have been conducted on the group level, disregarding individual differences. In this work, we revisit the predictive power of surprisal and entropy measures estimated from a range of language models (LMs) on data of human reading times as a measure of processing effort by incorporating information of language users' cognitive capacities. To do so, we assess the predictive power of surprisal and entropy estimated from generative LMs on reading data obtained from individuals who also completed a wide range of psychometric tests. Specifically, we investigate if modulating surprisal and entropy relative to cognitive scores increases prediction accuracy of reading times, and we examine whether LMs exhibit systematic biases in the prediction of reading times for cognitively high- or low-performing groups, revealing what type of psycholinguistic subject a given LM emulates. Our study finds that in most cases, incorporating cognitive capacities increases predictive power of surprisal and entropy on reading times, and that generally, high performance in the psychometric tests is associated with lower sensitivity to predictability effects. Finally, our results suggest that the analyzed LMs emulate readers with lower verbal intelligence, suggesting that for a given target group (i.e., individuals with high verbal intelligence), these LMs provide less accurate predictability estimates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devam Mondal, Carlo Lipizzi</p>
<p>Abstract: In light of recent legal allegations brought by publishers, newspapers, and other creators of copyrighted corpora against large language model developers who use their copyrighted materials for training or fine-tuning purposes, we propose a novel system, a variant of a plagiarism detection system, that assesses whether a knowledge source has been used in the training or fine-tuning of a large language model. Unlike current methods, we utilize an approach that uses Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples to create knowledge graphs from both a source document and an LLM continuation of that document. These graphs are then analyzed with respect to content using cosine similarity and with respect to structure using a normalized version of graph edit distance that shows the degree of isomorphism. Unlike traditional plagiarism systems that focus on content matching and keyword identification between a source and a target corpus, our approach enables a broader and more accurate evaluation of similarity between a source document and LLM continuation by focusing on relationships between ideas and their organization with regards to others. Additionally, our approach does not require access to LLM metrics like perplexity that may be unavailable in closed large language model "black-box" systems, as well as the training corpus. We thus assess whether an LLM has "plagiarized" a corpus in its continuation through similarity measures. A prototype of our system will be found on a hyperlinked GitHub repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danqing Hu, Bing Liu, Xiaofeng Zhu, Nan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a crucial factor in determining the initial treatment for patients with lung cancer, yet accurate preoperative diagnosis of LNM remains challenging. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable text generation capabilities. Leveraging the extensive medical knowledge learned from vast corpora, LLMs can estimate probabilities for clinical problems, though their performance has historically been inferior to data-driven machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble method that combines the medical knowledge acquired by LLMs with the latent patterns identified by machine learning models to enhance LNM prediction performance. Initially, we developed machine learning models using patient data. We then designed a prompt template to integrate the patient data with the predicted probability from the machine learning model. Subsequently, we instructed GPT-4o, the most advanced LLM developed by OpenAI, to estimate the likelihood of LNM based on patient data and then adjust the estimate using the machine learning output. Finally, we collected three outputs from the GPT-4o using the same prompt and ensembled these results as the final prediction. Using the proposed method, our models achieved an AUC value of 0.765 and an AP value of 0.415 for LNM prediction, significantly improving predictive performance compared to baseline machine learning models. The experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can effectively leverage its medical knowledge and the probabilities predicted by machine learning models to achieve more accurate LNM predictions. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can perform well in clinical risk prediction tasks, offering a new paradigm for integrating medical knowledge and patient data in clinical predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Xia, Jingbo Zhou, Zhenhui Shi, Jun Chen, Haifeng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Language Model (RALM) has shown remarkable performance on knowledge-intensive tasks by incorporating external knowledge during inference, which mitigates the factual hallucinations inherited in large language models (LLMs). Despite these advancements, challenges persist in the implementation of RALMs, particularly concerning their reliability and traceability. To be specific, the irrelevant document retrieval may result in unhelpful response generation or even deteriorate the performance of LLMs, while the lack of proper citations in generated outputs complicates efforts to verify the trustworthiness of the models. To this end, we propose a novel self-reasoning framework aimed at improving the reliability and traceability of RALMs, whose core idea is to leverage reasoning trajectories generated by the LLM itself. The framework involves constructing self-reason trajectories with three processes: a relevance-aware process, an evidence-aware selective process, and a trajectory analysis process. We have evaluated our framework across four public datasets (two short-form QA datasets, one long-form QA dataset, and one fact verification dataset) to demonstrate the superiority of our method, which can outperform existing state-of-art models and can achieve comparable performance with GPT-4, while only using 2,000 training samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Feng, Zhen Tian, Yifan Zhu, Zongfu Han, Haoran Luo, Guangwei Zhang, Meina Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The key challenge of cross-modal domain-incremental learning (DIL) is to enable the learning model to continuously learn from novel data with different feature distributions under the same task without forgetting old ones. However, existing top-performing methods still cause high forgetting rates, by lacking intra-domain knowledge extraction and inter-domain common prompting strategy. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework, CP-Prompt, by training limited parameters to instruct a pre-trained model to learn new domains and avoid forgetting existing feature distributions. CP-Prompt captures intra-domain knowledge by compositionally inserting personalized prompts on multi-head self-attention layers and then learns the inter-domain knowledge with a common prompting strategy. CP-Prompt shows superiority compared with state-of-the-art baselines among three widely evaluated DIL tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/dannis97500/CP_Prompt.</p>

We also train the 2B and 9B models with knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) instead of next token prediction. The resulting models deliver the best performance for their size, and even offer competitive alternatives to models that are 2-3 times bigger. We release all our models to the community.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models show remarkable performance in natural language understanding, their resource-intensive nature makes them less accessible. In contrast, smaller language models such as MiniCPM offer more sustainable scalability, but often underperform without specialized optimization. In this paper, we explore the enhancement of smaller language models through the improvement of their text embeddings. We select three language models, MiniCPM, Phi-2, and Gemma, to conduct contrastive fine-tuning on the NLI dataset. Our results demonstrate that this fine-tuning method enhances the quality of text embeddings for all three models across various benchmarks, with MiniCPM showing the most significant improvements of an average 56.33% performance gain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Maltoni, Matteo Ferrara</p>
<p>Abstract: A better understanding of the emergent computation and problem-solving capabilities of recent large language models is of paramount importance to further improve them and broaden their applicability. This work investigates how a language model, trained to predict the next token, can perform arithmetic computations generalizing beyond training data. Binary addition and multiplication constitute a good testbed for this purpose, since they require a very small vocabulary and exhibit relevant input/output discontinuities making smooth input interpolation ineffective for novel data. We successfully trained a light language model to learn these tasks and ran a number of experiments to investigate the extrapolation capabilities and internal information processing. Our findings support the hypothesis that the language model works as an Encoding-Regression-Decoding machine where the computation takes place in the value space once the input token representation is mapped to an appropriate internal representation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications in cloud root cause analysis (RCA) have been actively explored recently. However, current methods are still reliant on manual workflow settings and do not unleash LLMs' decision-making and environment interaction capabilities. We present RCAgent, a tool-augmented LLM autonomous agent framework for practical and privacy-aware industrial RCA usage. Running on an internally deployed model rather than GPT families, RCAgent is capable of free-form data collection and comprehensive analysis with tools. Our framework combines a variety of enhancements, including a unique Self-Consistency for action trajectories, and a suite of methods for context management, stabilization, and importing domain knowledge. Our experiments show RCAgent's evident and consistent superiority over ReAct across all aspects of RCA -- predicting root causes, solutions, evidence, and responsibilities -- and tasks covered or uncovered by current rules, as validated by both automated metrics and human evaluations. Furthermore, RCAgent has already been integrated into the diagnosis and issue discovery workflow of the Real-time Compute Platform for Apache Flink of Alibaba Cloud.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wilson Wu, John X. Morris, Lionel Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Do transformers "think ahead" during inference at a given position? It is known transformers prepare information in the hidden states of the forward pass at time step $t$ that is then used in future forward passes $t+\tau$. We posit two explanations for this phenomenon: pre-caching, in which off-diagonal gradient terms present during training result in the model computing features at $t$ irrelevant to the present inference task but useful for the future, and breadcrumbs, in which features most relevant to time step $t$ are already the same as those that would most benefit inference at time $t+\tau$. We test these hypotheses by training language models without propagating gradients to past timesteps, a scheme we formalize as myopic training. In a constructed synthetic data setting, we find clear evidence for pre-caching. In the autoregressive language modeling setting, our experiments are more suggestive of the breadcrumbs hypothesis, though pre-caching increases with model scale.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have progressed incredibly from research to applicability for general-purpose use cases. LLaVA-Med, a pioneering large language and vision assistant for biomedicine, can perform multi-modal biomedical image and data analysis to provide a natural language interface for radiologists. While it is highly generalizable and works with multi-modal data, it is currently limited by well-known challenges that exist in the large language model space. Hallucinations and imprecision in responses can lead to misdiagnosis which currently hinder the clinical adaptability of VLMs. To create precise, user-friendly models in healthcare, we propose D-Rax -- a domain-specific, conversational, radiologic assistance tool that can be used to gain insights about a particular radiologic image. In this study, we enhance the conversational analysis of chest X-ray (CXR) images to support radiological reporting, offering comprehensive insights from medical imaging and aiding in the formulation of accurate diagnosis. D-Rax is achieved by fine-tuning the LLaVA-Med architecture on our curated enhanced instruction-following data, comprising of images, instructions, as well as disease diagnosis and demographic predictions derived from MIMIC-CXR imaging data, CXR-related visual question answer (VQA) pairs, and predictive outcomes from multiple expert AI models. We observe statistically significant improvement in responses when evaluated for both open and close-ended conversations. Leveraging the power of state-of-the-art diagnostic models combined with VLMs, D-Rax empowers clinicians to interact with medical images using natural language, which could potentially streamline their decision-making process, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and conserve their time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjun An, Yifan Chen, Xiaozhen Qiao, Zhe Sun, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on next-token prediction method for inference, which significantly impedes their processing speed. In this paper, we introduce a novel inference methodology termed next-sentence prediction, aimed at enhancing the inference efficiency of LLMs. We present Sentence Variational Autoencoder (SentenceVAE), a tiny model consisting of a Sentence Encoder and a Sentence Decoder. The encoder effectively condenses the information within a sentence into a singular token, while the decoder reconstructs this compressed data back into its original sentential form. By integrating SentenceVAE into the input and output layers of LLMs, we develop Sentence-level LLMs (SLLMs) that employ a sentence-by-sentence inference approach, markedly accelerating inference speeds. SentenceVAE also maintains the integrity of the original semantic content by segmenting the text into sentences, thereby improving accuracy while boosting inference speeds. Compared to published LLMs, SLLMs process fewer tokens over equivalent context lengths, significantly reducing memory demands for self-attention computations and facilitating the handling of longer contexts. Our experimental findings reveal that this method can accelerate inference speeds by 204~365%, reduce perplexity (PPL) to 46~75% of its original metric, and decrease memory overhead by 86~91% for the same context length, compared to the token-by-token method. Moreover, the benefits of this approach become even more pronounced as model parameters increase.</p>
