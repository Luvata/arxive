<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16198">Learning Collaborative Information Dissemination with Graph-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2308.16198v1 [cs.LG])</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Galliera_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Raffaele Galliera</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Venable_K/0/1/0/all/0/1">Kristen Brent Venable</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Bassani_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Matteo Bassani</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Suri_N/0/1/0/all/0/1">Niranjan Suri</a></p>
<p>In modern communication systems, efficient and reliable information
dissemination is crucial for supporting critical operations across domains like
disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and sensor networks. This paper
introduces a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach as a
significant step forward in achieving more decentralized, efficient, and
collaborative solutions. We propose a Decentralized-POMDP formulation for
information dissemination, empowering each agent to independently decide on
message forwarding. This constitutes a significant paradigm shift from
traditional heuristics based on Multi-Point Relay (MPR) selection. Our approach
harnesses Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning, employing Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) with dynamic attention to capture essential network features. We
propose two approaches, L-DGN and HL-DGN, which differ in the information that
is exchanged among agents. We evaluate the performance of our decentralized
approaches, by comparing them with a widely-used MPR heuristic, and we show
that our trained policies are able to efficiently cover the network while
bypassing the MPR set selection process. Our approach promises a first step
toward bolstering the resilience of real-world broadcast communication
infrastructures via learned, collaborative information dissemination.

<p>Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) mainly has two
scenarios: classification of the discrete labels and regression of the
continuously tagged labels. Although many algorithms were proposed for
classification tasks, there are only a few methods for regression tasks. For
emotion regression, the label is continuous in time. A natural method is to
learn the temporal dynamic patterns. In previous studies, long short-term
memory (LSTM) and temporal convolutional neural networks (TCN) were utilized to
learn the temporal contextual information from feature vectors of EEG. However,
the spatial patterns of EEG were not effectively extracted. To enable the
spatial learning ability of TCN towards better regression and classification
performances, we propose a novel unified model, named MASA-TCN, for EEG emotion
regression and classification tasks. The space-aware temporal layer enables TCN
to additionally learn from spatial relations among EEG electrodes. Besides, a
novel multi-anchor block with attentive fusion is proposed to learn dynamic
temporal dependencies. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show
MASA-TCN achieves higher results than the state-of-the-art methods for both EEG
emotion regression and classification tasks. The code is available at

<p>One approach to explaining the hierarchical levels of understanding within a
machine learning model is the symbolic method of inductive logic programming
(ILP), which is data efficient and capable of learning first-order logic rules
that can entail data behaviour. A differentiable extension to ILP, so-called
differentiable Neural Logic (dNL) networks, are able to learn Boolean functions
as their neural architecture includes symbolic reasoning. We propose an
application of dNL in the field of Relational Reinforcement Learning (RRL) to
address dynamic continuous environments. This represents an extension of
previous work in applying dNL-based ILP in RRL settings, as our proposed model
updates the architecture to enable it to solve problems in continuous RL
environments. The goal of this research is to improve upon current ILP methods
for use in RRL by incorporating non-linear continuous predicates, allowing RRL
agents to reason and make decisions in dynamic and continuous environments.

<p>Retrosynthesis planning is a fundamental challenge in chemistry which aims at
designing reaction pathways from commercially available starting materials to a
target molecule. Each step in multi-step retrosynthesis planning requires
accurate prediction of possible precursor molecules given the target molecule
and confidence estimates to guide heuristic search algorithms. We model
single-step retrosynthesis planning as a distribution learning problem in a
discrete state space. First, we introduce the Markov Bridge Model, a generative
framework aimed to approximate the dependency between two intractable discrete
distributions accessible via a finite sample of coupled data points. Our
framework is based on the concept of a Markov bridge, a Markov process pinned
at its endpoints. Unlike diffusion-based methods, our Markov Bridge Model does
not need a tractable noise distribution as a sampling proxy and directly
operates on the input product molecules as samples from the intractable prior
distribution. We then address the retrosynthesis planning problem with our
novel framework and introduce RetroBridge, a template-free retrosynthesis
modeling approach that achieves state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation
benchmarks.

<p>Lossy video compression is commonly used when transmitting and storing video
data. Unified video codecs (e.g., H.264 or H.265) remain the \emph{de facto}
standard, despite the availability of advanced (neural) compression approaches.
Transmitting videos in the face of dynamic network bandwidth conditions
requires video codecs to adapt to vastly different compression strengths. Rate
control modules augment the codec's compression such that bandwidth constraints
are satisfied and video distortion is minimized. While, both standard video
codes and their rate control modules are developed to minimize video distortion
w.r.t. human quality assessment, preserving the downstream performance of deep
vision models is not considered. In this paper, we present the first end-to-end
learnable deep video codec control considering both bandwidth constraints and
downstream vision performance, while not breaking existing standardization. We
demonstrate for two common vision tasks (semantic segmentation and optical flow
estimation) and on two different datasets that our deep codec control better
preserves downstream performance than using 2-pass average bit rate control
while meeting dynamic bandwidth constraints and adhering to standardizations.

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often an integral part of modern decision
support systems (DSSs). The best-performing predictive models used in AI-based
DSSs lack transparency. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to
create AI systems that can explain their rationale to human users. Local
explanations in XAI can provide information about the causes of individual
predictions in terms of feature importance. However, a critical drawback of
existing local explanation methods is their inability to quantify the
uncertainty associated with a feature's importance. This paper introduces an
extension of a feature importance explanation method, Calibrated Explanations
(CE), previously only supporting classification, with support for standard
regression and probabilistic regression, i.e., the probability that the target
is above an arbitrary threshold. The extension for regression keeps all the
benefits of CE, such as calibration of the prediction from the underlying model
with confidence intervals, uncertainty quantification of feature importance,
and allows both factual and counterfactual explanations. CE for standard
regression provides fast, reliable, stable, and robust explanations. CE for
probabilistic regression provides an entirely new way of creating probabilistic
explanations from any ordinary regression model and with a dynamic selection of
thresholds. The performance of CE for probabilistic regression regarding
stability and speed is comparable to LIME. The method is model agnostic with
easily understood conditional rules. An implementation in Python is freely
available on GitHub and for installation using pip making the results in this
paper easily replicable.

<p>Recently, the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have
been illustrated across a variety of research domains such as natural language
processing, computer vision, and molecular modeling. We extend this paradigm by
utilizing LLMs for material property prediction by introducing our model
Materials Informatics Transformer (MatInFormer). Specifically, we introduce a
novel approach that involves learning the grammar of crystallography through
the tokenization of pertinent space group information. We further illustrate
the adaptability of MatInFormer by incorporating task-specific data pertaining
to Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). Through attention visualization, we uncover
the key features that the model prioritizes during property prediction. The
effectiveness of our proposed model is empirically validated across 14 distinct
datasets, hereby underscoring its potential for high throughput screening

<p>Transformer-like models for vision tasks have recently proven effective for a
wide range of downstream applications such as segmentation and detection.
Previous works have shown that segmentation properties emerge in vision
transformers (ViTs) trained using self-supervised methods such as DINO, but not
in those trained on supervised classification tasks. In this study, we probe
whether segmentation emerges in transformer-based models solely as a result of
intricate self-supervised learning mechanisms, or if the same emergence can be
achieved under much broader conditions through proper design of the model
architecture. Through extensive experimental results, we demonstrate that when
employing a white-box transformer-like architecture known as CRATE, whose
design explicitly models and pursues low-dimensional structures in the data
distribution, segmentation properties, at both the whole and parts levels,
already emerge with a minimalistic supervised training recipe. Layer-wise
finer-grained analysis reveals that the emergent properties strongly
corroborate the designed mathematical functions of the white-box network. Our
results suggest a path to design white-box foundation models that are
simultaneously highly performant and mathematically fully interpretable. Code

<p>Deep learning models often rely only on a small set of features even when
there is a rich set of predictive signals in the training data. This makes
models brittle and sensitive to distribution shifts. In this work, we first
examine vision transformers (ViTs) and find that they tend to extract robust
and spurious features with distinct attention heads. As a result of this
modularity, their performance under distribution shifts can be significantly
improved at test time by pruning heads corresponding to spurious features,
which we demonstrate using an "oracle selection" on validation data. Second, we
propose a method to further enhance the diversity and complementarity of the
learned features by encouraging orthogonality of the attention heads' input
gradients. We observe improved out-of-distribution performance on diagnostic
benchmarks (MNIST-CIFAR, Waterbirds) as a consequence of the enhanced diversity
of features and the pruning of undesirable heads.

<p>The increasing complexity and scale of telecommunication networks have led to
a growing interest in automated anomaly detection systems. However, the
classification of anomalies detected on network Key Performance Indicators
(KPI) has received less attention, resulting in a lack of information about
anomaly characteristics and classification processes. To address this gap, this
paper proposes a modular anomaly classification framework. The framework
assumes separate entities for the anomaly classifier and the detector, allowing
for a distinct treatment of anomaly detection and classification tasks on time
series. The objectives of this study are (1) to develop a time series simulator
that generates synthetic time series resembling real-world network KPI
behavior, (2) to build a detection model to identify anomalies in the time
series, (3) to build classification models that accurately categorize detected
anomalies into predefined classes (4) to evaluate the classification framework
performance on simulated and real-world network KPI time series. This study has
demonstrated the good performance of the anomaly classification models trained
on simulated anomalies when applied to real-world network time series data.

<p>Since their inception in 2014, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have
rapidly emerged as powerful tools for generating realistic and diverse data
across various domains, including computer vision and other applied areas.
Consisting of a discriminative network and a generative network engaged in a
Minimax game, GANs have revolutionized the field of generative modeling. In
February 2018, GAN secured the leading spot on the ``Top Ten Global
Breakthrough Technologies List'' issued by the Massachusetts Science and
Technology Review. Over the years, numerous advancements have been proposed,
leading to a rich array of GAN variants, such as conditional GAN, Wasserstein
GAN, CycleGAN, and StyleGAN, among many others. This survey aims to provide a
general overview of GANs, summarizing the latent architecture, validation
metrics, and application areas of the most widely recognized variants. We also
delve into recent theoretical developments, exploring the profound connection
between the adversarial principle underlying GAN and Jensen-Shannon divergence,
while discussing the optimality characteristics of the GAN framework. The

<p>This work presents a general geometric framework for simulating and learning
the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems that are invariant under a Lie group of
transformations. This means that a group of symmetries is known to act on the
system respecting its dynamics and, as a consequence, Noether's Theorem,
conserved quantities are observed. We propose to simulate and learn the
mappings of interest through the construction of $G$-invariant Lagrangian
submanifolds, which are pivotal objects in symplectic geometry. A notable
property of our constructions is that the simulated/learned dynamics also
preserves the same conserved quantities as the original system, resulting in a
more faithful surrogate of the original dynamics than non-symmetry aware
methods, and in a more accurate predictor of non-observed trajectories.
Furthermore, our setting is able to simulate/learn not only Hamiltonian flows,
but any Lie group-equivariant symplectic transformation. Our designs leverage
pivotal techniques and concepts in symplectic geometry and geometric mechanics:
reduction theory, Noether's Theorem, Lagrangian submanifolds, momentum
mappings, and coisotropic reduction among others. We also present methods to
learn Poisson transformations while preserving the underlying geometry and how
to endow non-geometric integrators with geometric properties. Thus, this work
presents a novel attempt to harness the power of symplectic and Poisson
geometry towards simulating and learning problems.

which hinders the effective communication and negatively impacts the work
outcomes. Prevalent on social media platforms, emojis, as alternative
non-verbal cues, are gaining popularity in the virtual workspaces well. In this
paper, we study how emoji usage influences developer participation and issue
resolution in virtual workspaces. To this end, we collect GitHub issues for a
one-year period and apply causal inference techniques to measure the causal
effect of emojis on the outcome of issues, controlling for confounders such as
issue content, repository, and author information. We find that emojis can
significantly reduce the resolution time of issues and attract more user
participation. We also compare the heterogeneous effect on different types of
issues. These findings deepen our understanding of the developer communities,
and they provide design implications on how to facilitate interactions and
broaden developer participation.

<p>In this paper we propose a proximal subgradient method (Prox-SubGrad) for
solving nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems without assuming
Lipschitz continuity conditions. A number of subgradient upper bounds and their
relationships are presented. By means of these upper bounding conditions, we
establish some uniform recursive relations for the Moreau envelopes for weakly
convex optimization. This uniform scheme simplifies and unifies the proof
schemes to establish rate of convergence for Prox-SubGrad without assuming
Lipschitz continuity. We present a novel convergence analysis in this context.
Furthermore, we propose some new stochastic subgradient upper bounding
conditions and establish convergence and iteration complexity rates for the
stochastic subgradient method (Sto-SubGrad) to solve non-Lipschitz and
nonsmooth stochastic optimization problems. In particular, for both
deterministic and stochastic subgradient methods on weakly convex optimization
problems without Lipschitz continuity, under any of the subgradient upper
bounding conditions to be introduced in the paper, we show that $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate holds in terms of the square of gradient of the Moreau
envelope function, which further improves to be $O(1/{T})$ if, in addition, the
uniform KL condition with exponent $1/2$ holds.

<p>Large Language Model (LLM) inference consists of two distinct phases -
prefill phase which processes the input prompt and decode phase which generates
output tokens autoregressively. While the prefill phase effectively saturates
GPU compute at small batch sizes, the decode phase results in low compute
utilization as it generates one token at a time per request. The varying
prefill and decode times also lead to imbalance across micro-batches when using
pipeline parallelism, resulting in further inefficiency due to bubbles.
</p>
<p>We present SARATHI to address these challenges. SARATHI employs
chunked-prefills, which splits a prefill request into equal sized chunks, and
decode-maximal batching, which constructs a batch using a single prefill chunk
and populates the remaining slots with decodes. During inference, the prefill
chunk saturates GPU compute, while the decode requests 'piggyback' and cost up
to an order of magnitude less compared to a decode-only batch. Chunked-prefills
allows constructing multiple decode-maximal batches from a single prefill
request, maximizing coverage of decodes that can piggyback. Furthermore, the
uniform compute design of these batches ameliorates the imbalance between
micro-batches, significantly reducing pipeline bubbles.
</p>
<p>Our techniques yield significant improvements in inference performance across
models and hardware. For the LLaMA-13B model on A6000 GPU, SARATHI improves
decode throughput by up to 10x, and accelerates end-to-end throughput by up to
1.33x. For LLaMa-33B on A100 GPU, we achieve 1.25x higher end-to-end-throughput
and up to 4.25x higher decode throughput. When used with pipeline parallelism
on GPT-3, SARATHI reduces bubbles by 6.29x, resulting in an end-to-end
throughput improvement of 1.91x.

<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention owing to their
ability to handle graph-structured data and the improvement in practical
applications. However, many of these models prioritize high utility
performance, such as accuracy, with a lack of privacy consideration, which is a
major concern in modern society where privacy attacks are rampant. To address
this issue, researchers have started to develop privacy-preserving GNNs.
Despite this progress, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of the
attacks and the techniques for preserving privacy in the graph domain. In this
survey, we aim to address this gap by summarizing the attacks on graph data
according to the targeted information, categorizing the privacy preservation
techniques in GNNs, and reviewing the datasets and applications that could be
used for analyzing/solving privacy issues in GNNs. We also outline potential
directions for future research in order to build better privacy-preserving
GNNs.

<p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) is structured to derive policies from
static trajectory data without requiring real-time environment interactions.
Recent studies have shown the feasibility of framing offline RL as a sequence
modeling task, where the sole aim is to predict actions based on prior context
using the transformer architecture. However, the limitation of this single task
learning approach is its potential to undermine the transformer model's
attention mechanism, which should ideally allocate varying attention weights
across different tokens in the input context for optimal prediction. To address
this, we reformulate offline RL as a multi-objective optimization problem,
where the prediction is extended to states and returns. We also highlight a
potential flaw in the trajectory representation used for sequence modeling,
which could generate inaccuracies when modeling the state and return
distributions. This is due to the non-smoothness of the action distribution
within the trajectory dictated by the behavioral policy. To mitigate this
issue, we introduce action space regions to the trajectory representation. Our
experiments on D4RL benchmark locomotion tasks reveal that our propositions
allow for more effective utilization of the attention mechanism in the
transformer model, resulting in performance that either matches or outperforms
current state-of-the art methods.

<p>To handle graphs in which features or connectivities are evolving over time,
a series of temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have been proposed. Despite
the success of these TGNNs, the previous TGNN evaluations reveal several
limitations regarding four critical issues: 1) inconsistent datasets, 2)
inconsistent evaluation pipelines, 3) lacking workload diversity, and 4)
lacking efficient comparison. Overall, there lacks an empirical study that puts
TGNN models onto the same ground and compares them comprehensively. To this
end, we propose BenchTemp, a general benchmark for evaluating TGNN models on
various workloads. BenchTemp provides a set of benchmark datasets so that
different TGNN models can be fairly compared. Further, BenchTemp engineers a
standard pipeline that unifies the TGNN evaluation. With BenchTemp, we
extensively compare the representative TGNN models on different tasks (e.g.,

<p>The rapid development of blockchain has led to more and more funding pouring
into the cryptocurrency market, which also attracted cybercriminals' interest
in recent years. The Ponzi scheme, an old-fashioned fraud, is now popular on
the blockchain, causing considerable financial losses to many crypto-investors.
A few Ponzi detection methods have been proposed in the literature, most of
which detect a Ponzi scheme based on its smart contract source code or opcode.
The contract-code-based approach, while achieving very high accuracy, is not
robust: first, the source codes of a majority of contracts on Ethereum are not
available, and second, a Ponzi developer can fool a contract-code-based
detection model by obfuscating the opcode or inventing a new profit
distribution logic that cannot be detected (since these models were trained on
existing Ponzi logics only). A transaction-based approach could improve the
robustness of detection because transactions, unlike smart contracts, are
harder to be manipulated. However, the current transaction-based detection
models achieve fairly low accuracy. We address this gap in the literature by
developing new detection models that rely only on the transactions, hence
guaranteeing the robustness, and moreover, achieve considerably higher
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score than existing transaction-based
models. This is made possible thanks to the introduction of novel
time-dependent features that capture Ponzi behaviours characteristics derived
from our comprehensive data analyses on Ponzi and non-Ponzi data from the

<p>We present a method for balancing between the Local and Global Structures
(LGS) in graph embedding, via a tunable parameter. Some embedding methods aim
to capture global structures, while others attempt to preserve local
neighborhoods. Few methods attempt to do both, and it is not always possible to
capture well both local and global information in two dimensions, which is
where most graph drawing live. The choice of using a local or a global
embedding for visualization depends not only on the task but also on the
structure of the underlying data, which may not be known in advance. For a
given graph, LGS aims to find a good balance between the local and global
structure to preserve. We evaluate the performance of LGS with synthetic and
real-world datasets and our results indicate that it is competitive with the
state-of-the-art methods, using established quality metrics such as stress and
neighborhood preservation. We introduce a novel quality metric, cluster
distance preservation, to assess intermediate structure capture. All
source-code, datasets, experiments and analysis are available online.

<p>The electronic design automation of analog circuits has been a longstanding
challenge in the integrated circuit field due to the huge design space and
complex design trade-offs among circuit specifications. In the past decades,
intensive research efforts have mostly been paid to automate the transistor
sizing with a given circuit topology. By recognizing the graph nature of
circuits, this paper presents a Circuit Graph Neural Network (CktGNN) that
simultaneously automates the circuit topology generation and device sizing
based on the encoder-dependent optimization subroutines. Particularly, CktGNN
encodes circuit graphs using a two-level GNN framework (of nested GNN) where
circuits are represented as combinations of subgraphs in a known subgraph
basis. In this way, it significantly improves design efficiency by reducing the
number of subgraphs to perform message passing. Nonetheless, another critical
roadblock to advancing learning-assisted circuit design automation is a lack of
public benchmarks to perform canonical assessment and reproducible research. To
tackle the challenge, we introduce Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB), an
open-sourced dataset that contains $10$K distinct operational amplifiers with
carefully-extracted circuit specifications. OCB is also equipped with
communicative circuit generation and evaluation capabilities such that it can
help to generalize CktGNN to design various analog circuits by producing
corresponding datasets. Experiments on OCB show the extraordinary advantages of
CktGNN through representation-based optimization frameworks over other recent
powerful GNN baselines and human experts' manual designs. Our work paves the
way toward a learning-based open-sourced design automation for analog circuits.

<p>The detection of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) is intricate due to
their complex waveforms, extended duration, and low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), making them more challenging to be identified compared to compact binary
coalescences. While matched filtering-based techniques are known for their
computational demands, existing deep learning-based methods primarily handle
time-domain data and are often constrained by data duration and SNR. In
addition, most existing work ignores time-delay interferometry (TDI) and
applies the long-wavelength approximation in detector response calculations,
thus limiting their ability to handle laser frequency noise. In this study, we
introduce DECODE, an end-to-end model focusing on EMRI signal detection by
sequence modeling in the frequency domain. Centered around a dilated causal
convolutional neural network, trained on synthetic data considering TDI-1.5
detector response, DECODE can efficiently process a year's worth of
multichannel TDI data with an SNR of around 50. We evaluate our model on 1-year
data with accumulated SNR ranging from 50 to 120 and achieve a true positive
rate of 96.3% at a false positive rate of 1%, keeping an inference time of less
than 0.01 seconds. With the visualization of three showcased EMRI signals for
interpretability and generalization, DECODE exhibits strong potential for

<p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial issue in recommendation
systems. There has been an emergence of various public CTR datasets. However,
existing datasets primarily suffer from the following limitations. Firstly,
users generally click different types of items from multiple scenarios, and
modeling from multiple scenarios can provide a more comprehensive understanding
of users. Existing datasets only include data for the same type of items from a
single scenario. Secondly, multi-modal features are essential in multi-scenario
prediction as they address the issue of inconsistent ID encoding between
different scenarios. The existing datasets are based on ID features and lack
multi-modal features. Third, a large-scale dataset can provide a more reliable
evaluation of models, fully reflecting the performance differences between
models. The scale of existing datasets is around 100 million, which is
relatively small compared to the real-world CTR prediction. To address these
limitations, we propose AntM$^{2}$C, a Multi-Scenario Multi-Modal CTR dataset
based on industrial data from Alipay. Specifically, AntM$^{2}$C provides the
following advantages: 1) It covers CTR data of 5 different types of items,
providing insights into the preferences of users for different items, including
advertisements, vouchers, mini-programs, contents, and videos. 2) Apart from
ID-based features, AntM$^{2}$C also provides 2 multi-modal features, raw text
and image features, which can effectively establish connections between items
with different IDs. 3) AntM$^{2}$C provides 1 billion CTR data with 200

<p>Mobile Internet has profoundly reshaped modern lifestyles in various aspects.
Encrypted Traffic Classification (ETC) naturally plays a crucial role in
managing mobile Internet, especially with the explosive growth of mobile apps
using encrypted communication. Despite some existing learning-based ETC methods
showing promising results, three-fold limitations still remain in real-world
network environments, 1) label bias caused by traffic class imbalance, 2)
traffic homogeneity caused by component sharing, and 3) training with reliance
on sufficient labeled traffic. None of the existing ETC methods can address all
these limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel Pre-trAining
Semi-Supervised ETC framework, dubbed PASS. Our key insight is to resample the
original train dataset and perform contrastive pre-training without using
individual app labels directly to avoid label bias issues caused by class
imbalance, while obtaining a robust feature representation to differentiate
overlapping homogeneous traffic by pulling positive traffic pairs closer and
pushing negative pairs away. Meanwhile, PASS designs a semi-supervised
optimization strategy based on pseudo-label iteration and dynamic loss
weighting algorithms in order to effectively utilize massive unlabeled traffic
data and alleviate manual train dataset annotation workload. PASS outperforms
state-of-the-art ETC methods and generic sampling approaches on four public
datasets with significant class imbalance and traffic homogeneity, remarkably

<p>This paper addresses the tradeoff between standard accuracy on clean examples
and robustness against adversarial examples in deep neural networks (DNNs).
Although adversarial training (AT) improves robustness, it degrades the
standard accuracy, thus yielding the tradeoff. To mitigate this tradeoff, we
propose a novel AT method called ARREST, which comprises three components: (i)
adversarial finetuning (AFT), (ii) representation-guided knowledge distillation
(RGKD), and (iii) noisy replay (NR). AFT trains a DNN on adversarial examples
by initializing its parameters with a DNN that is standardly pretrained on
clean examples. RGKD and NR respectively entail a regularization term and an
algorithm to preserve latent representations of clean examples during AFT. RGKD
penalizes the distance between the representations of the standardly pretrained
and AFT DNNs. NR switches input adversarial examples to nonadversarial ones
when the representation changes significantly during AFT. By combining these
components, ARREST achieves both high standard accuracy and robustness.
Experimental results demonstrate that ARREST mitigates the tradeoff more
effectively than previous AT-based methods do.

<p>In this paper, we propose a new way of remembering by introducing a memory
influence mechanism for the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM).
Without changing the equation constraints of the original LSSVM, this
mechanism, allows an accurate partitioning of the training set without
overfitting. The maximum memory impact model (MIMM) and the weighted impact
memory model (WIMM) are then proposed. It is demonstrated that these models can
be degraded to the LSSVM. Furthermore, we propose some different memory impact
functions for the MIMM and WIMM. The experimental results show that that our
MIMM and WIMM have better generalization performance compared to the LSSVM and
significant advantage in time cost compared to other memory models.

<p>Pre-trained language models like ChatGPT have significantly improved code
generation. As these models scale up, there is an increasing need for the
output to handle more intricate tasks. Moreover, in bioinformatics, generating
functional programs poses additional notable challenges due to the amount of
domain knowledge, the need for complicated data operations, and intricate
functional dependencies between the operations. Here, we present BioCoder, a
benchmark developed to evaluate existing pre-trained models in generating
bioinformatics code. In relation to function-code generation, BioCoder covers
potential package dependencies, class declarations, and global variables. It
incorporates 1026 functions and 1243 methods in Python and Java from GitHub and
253 examples from the Rosalind Project. BioCoder incorporates a fuzz-testing
framework for evaluation, and we have applied it to evaluate many models
including InCoder, CodeGen, CodeGen2, SantaCoder, StarCoder, StarCoder+,

<p>We present a new nonlinear variational framework for simultaneously computing
ground and excited states of quantum systems. Our approach is based on
approximating wavefunctions in the linear span of basis functions that are
augmented and optimized \emph{via} composition with normalizing flows. The
accuracy and efficiency of our approach are demonstrated in the calculations of
a large number of vibrational states of the triatomic H$_2$S molecule as well
as ground and several excited electronic states of prototypical one-electron
systems including the hydrogen atom, the molecular hydrogen ion, and a carbon
atom in a single-active-electron approximation. The results demonstrate
significant improvements in the accuracy of energy predictions and accelerated
basis-set convergence even when using normalizing flows with a small number of
parameters. The present approach can be also seen as the optimization of a set
of intrinsic coordinates that best capture the underlying physics within the

<p>Cross-network node classification (CNNC), which aims to classify nodes in a
label-deficient target network by transferring the knowledge from a source
network with abundant labels, draws increasing attention recently. To address
CNNC, we propose a domain-adaptive message passing graph neural network
(DM-GNN), which integrates graph neural network (GNN) with conditional
adversarial domain adaptation. DM-GNN is capable of learning informative
representations for node classification that are also transferrable across
networks. Firstly, a GNN encoder is constructed by dual feature extractors to
separate ego-embedding learning from neighbor-embedding learning so as to
jointly capture commonality and discrimination between connected nodes.
Secondly, a label propagation node classifier is proposed to refine each node's
label prediction by combining its own prediction and its neighbors' prediction.
In addition, a label-aware propagation scheme is devised for the labeled source
network to promote intra-class propagation while avoiding inter-class
propagation, thus yielding label-discriminative source embeddings. Thirdly,
conditional adversarial domain adaptation is performed to take the
neighborhood-refined class-label information into account during adversarial
domain adaptation, so that the class-conditional distributions across networks
can be better matched. Comparisons with eleven state-of-the-art methods
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DM-GNN.

<p>In dynamic motion generation tasks, including contact and collisions, small
changes in policy parameters can lead to extremely different returns. For
example, in soccer, the ball can fly in completely different directions with a
similar heading motion by slightly changing the hitting position or the force
applied to the ball or when the friction of the ball varies. However, it is
difficult to imagine that completely different skills are needed for heading a
ball in different directions. In this study, we proposed a multitask
reinforcement learning algorithm for adapting a policy to implicit changes in
goals or environments in a single motion category with different reward
functions or physical parameters of the environment. We evaluated the proposed
method on the ball heading task using a monopod robot model. The results showed
that the proposed method can adapt to implicit changes in the goal positions or
the coefficients of restitution of the ball, whereas the standard domain
randomization approach cannot cope with different task settings.

<p>We present Point-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation framework for point cloud
registration (PCR) that improves the generalization and the performance of
registration models. While learning-based approaches have achieved impressive
progress, generalization to unknown testing environments remains a major
challenge due to the variations in 3D scans. Existing methods typically train a
generic model and the same trained model is applied on each instance during
testing. This could be sub-optimal since it is difficult for the same model to
handle all the variations during testing. In this paper, we propose a test-time
adaptation approach for PCR. Our model can adapt to unseen distributions at
test-time without requiring any prior knowledge of the test data. Concretely,
we design three self-supervised auxiliary tasks that are optimized jointly with
the primary PCR task. Given a test instance, we adapt our model using these
auxiliary tasks and the updated model is used to perform the inference. During
training, our model is trained using a meta-auxiliary learning approach, such
that the adapted model via auxiliary tasks improves the accuracy of the primary
task. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
improving generalization of point cloud registration and outperforming other

relative Mahalanobis distance to effectively identify 'near-OOD' instances
commonly encountered in echocardiographic data. Through extensive

<p>Affordable 3D scanners often produce sparse and non-uniform point clouds that
negatively impact downstream applications in robotic systems. While existing
point cloud upsampling architectures have demonstrated promising results on
standard benchmarks, they tend to experience significant performance drops when
the test data have different distributions from the training data. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a test-time adaption approach to enhance model
generality of point cloud upsampling. The proposed approach leverages
meta-learning to explicitly learn network parameters for test-time adaption.
Our method does not require any prior information about the test data. During
meta-training, the model parameters are learned from a collection of
instance-level tasks, each of which consists of a sparse-dense pair of point
clouds from the training data. During meta-testing, the trained model is
fine-tuned with a few gradient updates to produce a unique set of network
parameters for each test instance. The updated model is then used for the final
prediction. Our framework is generic and can be applied in a plug-and-play
manner with existing backbone networks in point cloud upsampling. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models.

<p>Science is facing a reproducibility crisis. Previous work has proposed
incorporating data analysis replications into classrooms as a potential
solution. However, despite the potential benefits, it is unclear whether this
approach is feasible, and if so, what the involved stakeholders-students,
educators, and scientists-should expect from it. Can students perform a data
analysis replication over the course of a class? What are the costs and
benefits for educators? And how can this solution help benchmark and improve
the state of science?
</p>
<p>In the present study, we incorporated data analysis replications in the
project component of the Applied Data Analysis course (CS-401) taught at EPFL
(N=354 students). Here we report pre-registered findings based on surveys
administered throughout the course. First, we demonstrate that students can
replicate previously published scientific papers, most of them qualitatively
and some exactly. We find discrepancies between what students expect of data
analysis replications and what they experience by doing them along with changes
in expectations about reproducibility, which together serve as evidence of
attitude shifts to foster students' critical thinking. Second, we provide
information for educators about how much overhead is needed to incorporate
replications into the classroom and identify concerns that replications bring
as compared to more traditional assignments. Third, we identify tangible
benefits of the in-class data analysis replications for scientific communities,
such as a collection of replication reports and insights about replication
barriers in scientific work that should be avoided going forward.
</p>
<p>Overall, we demonstrate that incorporating replication tasks into a large

<p>Over-squashing and over-smoothing are two critical issues, that limit the
capabilities of graph neural networks (GNNs). While over-smoothing eliminates
the differences between nodes making them indistinguishable, over-squashing
refers to the inability of GNNs to propagate information over long distances,
as exponentially many node states are squashed into fixed-size representations.
Both phenomena share similar causes, as both are largely induced by the graph
topology. To mitigate these problems in graph classification tasks, we propose
CurvPool, a novel pooling method. CurvPool exploits the notion of curvature of
a graph to adaptively identify structures responsible for both over-smoothing
and over-squashing. By clustering nodes based on the Balanced Forman curvature,
CurvPool constructs a graph with a more suitable structure, allowing deeper
models and the combination of distant information. We compare it to other
state-of-the-art pooling approaches and establish its competitiveness in terms
of classification accuracy, computational complexity, and flexibility. CurvPool
outperforms several comparable methods across all considered tasks. The most
consistent results are achieved by pooling densely connected clusters using the
sum aggregation, as this allows additional information about the size of each
pool.

<p>To enable meaningful robotic manipulation of objects in the real-world, 6D
pose estimation is one of the critical aspects. Most existing approaches have
difficulties to extend predictions to scenarios where novel object instances
are continuously introduced, especially with heavy occlusions. In this work, we
propose a few-shot pose estimation (FSPE) approach called SA6D, which uses a
self-adaptive segmentation module to identify the novel target object and
construct a point cloud model of the target object using only a small number of
cluttered reference images. Unlike existing methods, SA6D does not require
object-centric reference images or any additional object information, making it
a more generalizable and scalable solution across categories. We evaluate SA6D
on real-world tabletop object datasets and demonstrate that SA6D outperforms
existing FSPE methods, particularly in cluttered scenes with occlusions, while
requiring fewer reference images.

<p>Score-based and diffusion models have emerged as effective approaches for
both conditional and unconditional generation. Still conditional generation is
based on either a specific training of a conditional model or classifier
guidance, which requires training a noise-dependent classifier, even when the
classifier for uncorrupted data is given. We propose an approach to sample from
unconditional score-based generative models enforcing arbitrary logical
constraints, without any additional training. Firstly, we show how to
manipulate the learned score in order to sample from an un-normalized
distribution conditional on a user-defined constraint. Then, we define a
flexible and numerically stable neuro-symbolic framework for encoding soft
logical constraints. Combining these two ingredients we obtain a general, but
approximate, conditional sampling algorithm. We further developed effective
heuristics aimed at improving the approximation. Finally, we show the
effectiveness of our approach for various types of constraints and data:
tabular data, images and time series.

<p>The success of existing multi-view clustering (MVC) relies on the assumption
that all views are complete. However, samples are usually partially available
due to data corruption or sensor malfunction, which raises the research of
incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Although several anchor-based IMVC
methods have been proposed to process the large-scale incomplete data, they
still suffer from the following drawbacks: i) Most existing approaches neglect
the inter-view discrepancy and enforce cross-view representation to be
consistent, which would corrupt the representation capability of the model; ii)
Due to the samples disparity between different views, the learned anchor might
be misaligned, which we referred as the Anchor-Unaligned Problem for Incomplete
data (AUP-ID). Such the AUP-ID would cause inaccurate graph fusion and degrades
clustering performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel incomplete
anchor graph learning framework termed Scalable Incomplete Multi-View
Clustering with Structure Alignment (SIMVC-SA). Specially, we construct the
view-specific anchor graph to capture the complementary information from
different views. In order to solve the AUP-ID, we propose a novel structure
alignment module to refine the cross-view anchor correspondence. Meanwhile, the
anchor graph construction and alignment are jointly optimized in our unified
framework to enhance clustering quality. Through anchor graph construction
instead of full graphs, the time and space complexity of the proposed SIMVC-SA
is proven to be linearly correlated with the number of samples. Extensive
experiments on seven incomplete benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/wy1019/SIMVC-SA.

<p>Emergency department (ED) crowding is a significant threat to patient safety
and it has been repeatedly associated with increased mortality. Forecasting
future service demand has the potential patient outcomes. Despite active
research on the subject, several gaps remain: 1) proposed forecasting models
have become outdated due to quick influx of advanced machine learning models
(ML), 2) amount of multivariable input data has been limited and 3) discrete
performance metrics have been rarely reported. In this study, we document the
performance of a set of advanced ML models in forecasting ED occupancy 24 hours
ahead. We use electronic health record data from a large, combined ED with an
extensive set of explanatory variables, including the availability of beds in
catchment area hospitals, traffic data from local observation stations, weather
variables, etc. We show that N-BEATS and LightGBM outpeform benchmarks with 11
% and 9 % respective improvements and that DeepAR predicts next day crowding
with an AUC of 0.76 (95 % CI 0.69-0.84). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study to document the superiority of LightGBM and N-BEATS over
statistical benchmarks in the context of ED forecasting.

<p>Mobile devices have widespread to become the most used piece of technology.
Due to their characteristics, they have become major targets for botnet-related
malware. FluBot is one example of botnet malware that infects mobile devices.
In particular, FluBot is a DNS-based botnet that uses Domain Generation
Algorithms (DGA) to establish communication with the Command and Control Server
(C2). MONDEO is a multistage mechanism with a flexible design to detect
DNS-based botnet malware. MONDEO is lightweight and can be deployed without
requiring the deployment of software, agents, or configuration in mobile
devices, allowing easy integration in core networks. MONDEO comprises four
detection stages: Blacklisting/Whitelisting, Query rate analysis, DGA analysis,
and Machine learning evaluation. It was created with the goal of processing
streams of packets to identify attacks with high efficiency, in the distinct
phases. MONDEO was tested against several datasets to measure its efficiency
and performance, being able to achieve high performance with RandomForest
classifiers. The implementation is available at github.

<p>In the rapidly evolving digital era, the analysis of document layouts plays a
pivotal role in automated information extraction and interpretation. In our
work, we have trained MViTv2 transformer model architecture with cascaded mask
R-CNN on BaDLAD dataset to extract text box, paragraphs, images and tables from
a document. After training on 20365 document images for 36 epochs in a 3 phase
cycle, we achieved a training loss of 0.2125 and a mask loss of 0.19. Our work
extends beyond training, delving into the exploration of potential enhancement
avenues. We investigate the impact of rotation and flip augmentation, the
effectiveness of slicing input images pre-inference, the implications of
varying the resolution of the transformer backbone, and the potential of
employing a dual-pass inference to uncover missed text-boxes. Through these

<p>Masked image modeling has been demonstrated as a powerful pretext task for
generating robust representations that can be effectively generalized across
multiple downstream tasks. Typically, this approach involves randomly masking
patches (tokens) in input images, with the masking strategy remaining unchanged
during training. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning approach that
updates the masking strategy to continually increase the complexity of the
self-supervised reconstruction task. We conjecture that, by gradually
increasing the task complexity, the model can learn more sophisticated and
transferable representations. To facilitate this, we introduce a novel
learnable masking module that possesses the capability to generate masks of
different complexities, and integrate the proposed module into masked
autoencoders (MAE). Our module is jointly trained with the MAE, while adjusting
its behavior during training, transitioning from a partner to the MAE
(optimizing the same reconstruction loss) to an adversary (optimizing the
opposite loss), while passing through a neutral state. The transition between
these behaviors is smooth, being regulated by a factor that is multiplied with
the reconstruction loss of the masking module. The resulting training procedure
generates an easy-to-hard curriculum. We train our Curriculum-Learned Masked
Autoencoder (CL-MAE) on ImageNet and show that it exhibits superior
representation learning capabilities compared to MAE. The empirical results on
five downstream tasks confirm our conjecture, demonstrating that curriculum
learning can be successfully used to self-supervise masked autoencoders.

<p>Background Weight loss trajectories after bariatric surgery vary widely
between individuals, and predicting weight loss before the operation remains
challenging. We aimed to develop a model using machine learning to provide
individual preoperative prediction of 5-year weight loss trajectories after
surgery. Methods In this multinational retrospective observational study we
enrolled adult participants (aged $\ge$18 years) from ten prospective cohorts
(including ABOS [NCT01129297], BAREVAL [NCT02310178], the Swedish Obese
Subjects study, and a large cohort from the Dutch Obesity Clinic [Nederlandse
Obesitas Kliniek]) and two randomised trials (SleevePass [NCT00793143] and
SM-BOSS [NCT00356213]) in Europe, the Americas, and Asia, with a 5 year
followup after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or gastric band.
Patients with a previous history of bariatric surgery or large delays between
scheduled and actual visits were excluded. The training cohort comprised
patients from two centres in France (ABOS and BAREVAL). The primary outcome was
BMI at 5 years. A model was developed using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator to select variables and the classification and regression
trees algorithm to build interpretable regression trees. The performances of
the model were assessed through the median absolute deviation (MAD) and root
mean squared error (RMSE) of BMI. Findings10 231 patients from 12 centres in
ten countries were included in the analysis, corresponding to 30 602
patient-years. Among participants in all 12 cohorts, 7701 (75$\bullet$3%) were
female, 2530 (24$\bullet$7%) were male. Among 434 baseline attributes available
in the training cohort, seven variables were selected: height, weight,
intervention type, age, diabetes status, diabetes duration, and smoking status.
At 5 years, across external testing cohorts the overall mean MAD BMI was
2$\bullet$8 kg/m${}^2$ (95% CI 2$\bullet$6-3$\bullet$0) and mean RMSE BMI was
4$\bullet$7 kg/m${}^2$ (4$\bullet$4-5$\bullet$0), and the mean difference
between predicted and observed BMI was-0$\bullet$3 kg/m${}^2$ (SD 4$\bullet$7).
This model is incorporated in an easy to use and interpretable web-based
prediction tool to help inform clinical decision before surgery.
InterpretationWe developed a machine learning-based model, which is
internationally validated, for predicting individual 5-year weight loss
trajectories after three common bariatric interventions.

<p>The spontaneous behavior that often occurs in conversations makes speech more
human-like compared to reading-style. However, synthesizing spontaneous-style
speech is challenging due to the lack of high-quality spontaneous datasets and
the high cost of labeling spontaneous behavior. In this paper, we propose a
semi-supervised pre-training method to increase the amount of spontaneous-style
speech and spontaneous behavioral labels. In the process of semi-supervised
learning, both text and speech information are considered for detecting
spontaneous behaviors labels in speech. Moreover, a linguistic-aware encoder is
used to model the relationship between each sentence in the conversation.
Experimental results indicate that our proposed method achieves superior
expressive speech synthesis performance with the ability to model spontaneous
behavior in spontaneous-style speech and predict reasonable spontaneous
behavior from text.

<p>Detection of tumors in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) plays an essential
role in the early diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. Deep learning models
backboned by fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) have become the
dominant model for segmenting 3D computerized tomography (CT) scans. However,
since their convolution layers suffer from limited kernel size, they are not
able to capture long-range dependencies and global context. To tackle this
restriction, vision transformers have been introduced to solve FCNN's locality
of receptive fields. Although transformers can capture long-range features,
their segmentation performance decreases with various tumor sizes due to the
model sensitivity to the input patch size. While finding an optimal patch size
improves the performance of vision transformer-based models on segmentation
tasks, it is a time-consuming and challenging procedure. This paper proposes a
technique to select the vision transformer's optimal input multi-resolution
image patch size based on the average volume size of metastasis lesions. We
further validated our suggested framework using a transfer-learning technique,
demonstrating that the highest Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) performance
was obtained by pre-training on training data with a larger tumour volume using
the suggested ideal patch size and then training with a smaller one. We
experimentally evaluate this idea through pre-training our model on a
multi-resolution public dataset. Our model showed consistent and improved
results when applied to our private multi-resolution mCRC dataset with a
smaller average tumor volume. This study lays the groundwork for optimizing
semantic segmentation of small objects using vision transformers. The

<p>Global sustainability requires low-carbon urban transport systems, shaped by
adequate infrastructure, deployment of low-carbon transport modes and shifts in
travel behavior. To adequately implement alterations in infrastructure, it's
essential to grasp the location-specific cause-and-effect mechanisms that the
constructed environment has on travel. Yet, current research falls short in
representing causal relationships between the 6D urban form variables and
travel, generalizing across different regions, and modeling urban form effects
at high spatial resolution. Here, we address all three gaps by utilizing a
causal discovery and an explainable machine learning framework to detect urban
form effects on intra-city travel based on high-resolution mobility data of six
cities across three continents. We show that both distance to city center,
demographics and density indirectly affect other urban form features. By
considering the causal relationships, we find that location-specific influences
align across cities, yet vary in magnitude. In addition, the spread of the city
and the coverage of jobs across the city are the strongest determinants of
travel-related emissions, highlighting the benefits of compact development and
associated benefits. Differences in urban form effects across the cities call
for a more holistic definition of 6D measures. Our work is a starting point for
location-specific analysis of urban form effects on mobility behavior using
causal discovery approaches, which is highly relevant for city planners and
municipalities across continents.

<p>Graph classification, aiming at learning the graph-level representations for
effective class assignments, has received outstanding achievements, which
heavily relies on high-quality datasets that have balanced class distribution.
In fact, most real-world graph data naturally presents a long-tailed form,
where the head classes occupy much more samples than the tail classes, it thus
is essential to study the graph-level classification over long-tailed data
while still remaining largely unexplored. However, most existing long-tailed
learning methods in visions fail to jointly optimize the representation
learning and classifier training, as well as neglect the mining of the
hard-to-classify classes. Directly applying existing methods to graphs may lead
to sub-optimal performance, since the model trained on graphs would be more
sensitive to the long-tailed distribution due to the complex topological
characteristics. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel long-tailed
graph-level classification framework via Collaborative Multi-expert Learning
(CoMe) to tackle the problem. To equilibrate the contributions of head and tail
classes, we first develop balanced contrastive learning from the view of
representation learning, and then design an individual-expert classifier
training based on hard class mining. In addition, we execute gated fusion and
disentangled knowledge distillation among the multiple experts to promote the
collaboration in a multi-expert framework. Comprehensive experiments are
performed on seven widely-used benchmark datasets to demonstrate the
superiority of our method CoMe over state-of-the-art baselines.

<p>Despite recent advancements in image generation, diffusion models still
remain largely underexplored in Earth Observation. In this paper we show that
state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models can be conditioned on cartographic
data to generate realistic satellite images. We provide two large datasets of
paired OpenStreetMap images and satellite views over the region of Mainland
Scotland and the Central Belt. We train a ControlNet model and qualitatively
evaluate the results, demonstrating that both image quality and map fidelity
are possible. Finally, we provide some insights on the opportunities and
challenges of applying these models for remote sensing. Our model weights and

<p>The online Data Quality Monitoring system (DQM) of the CMS electromagnetic
calorimeter (ECAL) is a crucial operational tool that allows ECAL experts to
quickly identify, localize, and diagnose a broad range of detector issues that
would otherwise hinder physics-quality data taking. Although the existing ECAL
DQM system has been continuously updated to respond to new problems, it remains
one step behind newer and unforeseen issues. Using unsupervised deep learning,
a real-time autoencoder-based anomaly detection system is developed that is
able to detect ECAL anomalies unseen in past data. After accounting for spatial
variations in the response of the ECAL and the temporal evolution of anomalies,
the new system is able to efficiently detect anomalies while maintaining an
estimated false discovery rate between $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$, beating existing
benchmarks by about two orders of magnitude. The real-world performance of the
system is validated using anomalies found in 2018 and 2022 LHC collision data.
Additionally, first results from deploying the autoencoder-based system in the
CMS online DQM workflow for the ECAL barrel during Run 3 of the LHC are
presented, showing its promising performance in detecting obscure issues that
could have been missed in the existing DQM system.

<p>We can learn from analyzing quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs)
that: 1) working with quantum data can be perceived as embedding physical
system parameters through a hidden feature map; 2) their high performance for
quantum phase recognition can be attributed to generation of a very suitable
basis set during the ground state embedding, where quantum criticality of spin
models leads to basis functions with rapidly changing features; 3) pooling
layers of QCNNs are responsible for picking those basis functions that can
contribute to forming a high-performing decision boundary, and the learning
process corresponds to adapting the measurement such that few-qubit operators
are mapped to full-register observables; 4) generalization of QCNN models
strongly depends on the embedding type, and that rotation-based feature maps
with the Fourier basis require careful feature engineering; 5) accuracy and
generalization of QCNNs with readout based on a limited number of shots favor
the ground state embeddings and associated physics-informed models. We
demonstrate these points in simulation, where our results shed light on
classification for physical processes, relevant for applications in sensing.
Finally, we show that QCNNs with properly chosen ground state embeddings can be
used for fluid dynamics problems, expressing shock wave solutions with good
generalization and proven trainability.

<p>Decentralized federated learning (DFL) has gained popularity due to its
practicality across various applications. Compared to the centralized version,
training a shared model among a large number of nodes in DFL is more
challenging, as there is no central server to coordinate the training process.
Especially when distributed nodes suffer from limitations in communication or
computational resources, DFL will experience extremely inefficient and unstable
training. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we develop a novel
algorithm based on the framework of the inexact alternating direction method
(iADM). On one hand, our goal is to train a shared model with a sparsity
constraint. This constraint enables us to leverage one-bit compressive sensing
(1BCS), allowing transmission of one-bit information among neighbour nodes. On
the other hand, communication between neighbour nodes occurs only at certain
steps, reducing the number of communication rounds. Therefore, the algorithm
exhibits notable communication efficiency. Additionally, as each node selects
only a subset of neighbours to participate in the training, the algorithm is
robust against stragglers. Additionally, complex items are computed only once
for several consecutive steps and subproblems are solved inexactly using
closed-form solutions, resulting in high computational efficiency. Finally,
numerical experiments showcase the algorithm's effectiveness in both
communication and computation.

<p>A vast number of systems across the world use algorithmic decision making
(ADM) to (partially) automate decisions that have previously been made by
humans. When designed well, these systems promise more objective decisions
while saving large amounts of resources and freeing up human time. However,
when ADM systems are not designed well, they can lead to unfair decisions which
discriminate against societal groups. The downstream effects of ADMs critically
depend on the decisions made during the systems' design and implementation, as
biases in data can be mitigated or reinforced along the modeling pipeline. Many
of these design decisions are made implicitly, without knowing exactly how they
will influence the final system. It is therefore important to make explicit the
decisions made during the design of ADM systems and understand how these
decisions affect the fairness of the resulting system.
</p>
<p>To study this issue, we draw on insights from the field of psychology and
introduce the method of multiverse analysis for algorithmic fairness. In our
proposed method, we turn implicit design decisions into explicit ones and
demonstrate their fairness implications. By combining decisions, we create a
grid of all possible "universes" of decision combinations. For each of these
universes, we compute metrics of fairness and performance. Using the resulting
dataset, one can see how and which decisions impact fairness. We demonstrate
how multiverse analyses can be used to better understand variability and
robustness of algorithmic fairness using an exemplary case study of predicting
public health coverage of vulnerable populations for potential interventions.
Our results illustrate how decisions during the design of a machine learning
system can have surprising effects on its fairness and how to detect these
effects using multiverse analysis.

<p>The vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks have recently threatened the
trustworthiness of machine learning models in practical applications.
Conventional wisdom suggests that not everyone can be an attacker since the
process of designing the trigger generation algorithm often involves
significant effort and extensive experimentation to ensure the attack's
stealthiness and effectiveness. Alternatively, this paper shows that there
exists a more severe backdoor threat: anyone can exploit an easily-accessible
algorithm for silent backdoor attacks. Specifically, this attacker can employ
the widely-used lossy image compression from a plethora of compression tools to
effortlessly inject a trigger pattern into an image without leaving any
noticeable trace; i.e., the generated triggers are natural artifacts. One does
not require extensive knowledge to click on the "convert" or "save as" button
while using tools for lossy image compression. Via this attack, the adversary
does not need to design a trigger generator as seen in prior works and only
requires poisoning the data. Empirically, the proposed attack consistently
achieves 100% attack success rate in several benchmark datasets such as MNIST,
CIFAR-10, GTSRB and CelebA. More significantly, the proposed attack can still
achieve almost 100% attack success rate with very small (approximately 10%)
poisoning rates in the clean label setting. The generated trigger of the
proposed attack using one lossy compression algorithm is also transferable
across other related compression algorithms, exacerbating the severity of this
backdoor threat. This work takes another crucial step toward understanding the
extensive risks of backdoor attacks in practice, urging practitioners to
investigate similar attacks and relevant backdoor mitigation methods.

<p>Partial Label Learning (PLL) is a type of weakly supervised learning where
each training instance is assigned a set of candidate labels, but only one
label is the ground-truth. However, this idealistic assumption may not always
hold due to potential annotation inaccuracies, meaning the ground-truth may not
be present in the candidate label set. This is known as Unreliable Partial
Label Learning (UPLL) that introduces an additional complexity due to the
inherent unreliability and ambiguity of partial labels, often resulting in a
sub-optimal performance with existing methods. To address this challenge, we
propose the Unreliability-Robust Representation Learning framework (URRL) that
leverages unreliability-robust contrastive learning to help the model fortify
against unreliable partial labels effectively. Concurrently, we propose a dual
strategy that combines KNN-based candidate label set correction and
consistency-regularization-based label disambiguation to refine label quality
and enhance the ability of representation learning within the URRL framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art PLL methods on various datasets with diverse degrees of
unreliability and ambiguity. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of
our approach from the perspective of the expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm. Upon acceptance, we pledge to make the code publicly accessible.

<p>This paper addresses the problem of localization, which is inherently
non-convex and non-smooth in a federated setting where the data is distributed
across a multitude of devices. Due to the decentralized nature of federated
environments, distributed learning becomes essential for scalability and
adaptability. Moreover, these environments are often plagued by outlier data,
which presents substantial challenges to conventional methods, particularly in
maintaining estimation accuracy and ensuring algorithm convergence. To mitigate
these challenges, we propose a method that adopts an $L_1$-norm robust
formulation within a distributed sub-gradient framework, explicitly designed to
handle these obstacles. Our approach addresses the problem in its original
form, without resorting to iterative simplifications or approximations,
resulting in enhanced computational efficiency and improved estimation
accuracy. We demonstrate that our method converges to a stationary point,
highlighting its effectiveness and reliability. Through numerical simulations,
we confirm the superior performance of our approach, notably in outlier-rich
environments, which surpasses existing state-of-the-art localization methods.

<p>Ultrasound imaging serves as a pivotal tool for diagnosing cervical lymph
node lesions. However, the diagnoses of these images largely hinge on the
expertise of medical practitioners, rendering the process susceptible to
misdiagnoses. Although rapidly developing deep learning has substantially
improved the diagnoses of diverse ultrasound images, there remains a
conspicuous research gap concerning cervical lymph nodes. The objective of our
work is to accurately diagnose cervical lymph node lesions by leveraging a deep
learning model. To this end, we first collected 3392 images containing normal
lymph nodes, benign lymph node lesions, malignant primary lymph node lesions,
and malignant metastatic lymph node lesions. Given that ultrasound images are
generated by the reflection and scattering of sound waves across varied bodily
tissues, we proposed the Conv-FFT Block. It integrates convolutional operations
with the fast Fourier transform to more astutely model the images. Building
upon this foundation, we designed a novel architecture, named US-SFNet. This
architecture not only discerns variances in ultrasound images from the spatial
domain but also adeptly captures microstructural alterations across various
lesions in the frequency domain. To ascertain the potential of US-SFNet, we
benchmarked it against 12 popular architectures through five-fold
cross-validation. The results show that US-SFNet is SOTA and can achieve 92.89%
accuracy, 90.46% precision, 89.95% sensitivity and 97.49% specificity,

<p>Radio map construction requires a large amount of radio measurement data with
location labels, which imposes a high deployment cost. This paper develops a
region-based radio map from received signal strength (RSS) measurements without
location labels. The construction is based on a set of blindly collected RSS
measurement data from a device that visits each region in an indoor area
exactly once, where the footprints and timestamps are not recorded. The main
challenge is to cluster the RSS data and match clusters with the physical
regions. Classical clustering algorithms fail to work as the RSS data naturally
appears as non-clustered due to multipaths and noise. In this paper, a signal
subspace model with a sequential prior is constructed for the RSS data, and an
integrated segmentation and clustering algorithm is developed, which is shown
to find the globally optimal solution in a special case. Furthermore, the
clustered data is matched with the physical regions using a graph-based
approach. Based on real measurements from an office space, the proposed scheme
reduces the region localization error by roughly 50% compared to a weighted
centroid localization (WCL) baseline, and it even outperforms some supervised
localization schemes, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector

<p>In prediction-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS), performance indicators
derived from graph convolutional networks have shown significant success. These
indicators, achieved by representing feed-forward structures as component
graphs through one-hot encoding, face a limitation: their inability to evaluate
architecture performance across varying search spaces. In contrast, handcrafted
performance indicators (zero-shot NAS), which use the same architecture with
random initialization, can generalize across multiple search spaces. Addressing
this limitation, we propose a novel approach for zero-shot NAS using deep
learning. Our method employs Fourier sum of sines encoding for convolutional
kernels, enabling the construction of a computational feed-forward graph with a
structure similar to the architecture under evaluation. These encodings are
learnable and offer a comprehensive view of the architecture's topological
information. An accompanying multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then ranks these
architectures based on their encodings. Experimental results show that our
approach surpasses previous methods using graph convolutional networks in terms
of correlation on the NAS-Bench-201 dataset and exhibits a higher convergence

<p>With the growing imbalance between limited medical resources and escalating
demands, AI-based clinical tasks have become paramount. Medication
recommendation, as a sub-domain, aims to amalgamate longitudinal patient
history with medical knowledge, assisting physicians in prescribing safer and
more accurate medication combinations. Existing methods overlook the inherent
long-tail distribution in medical data, lacking balanced representation between
head and tail data, which leads to sub-optimal model performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce StratMed, a model that incorporates an innovative
relevance stratification mechanism. It harmonizes discrepancies in data
long-tail distribution and strikes a balance between the safety and accuracy of
medication combinations. Specifically, we first construct a pre-training method
using deep learning networks to obtain entity representation. After that, we
design a pyramid-like data stratification method to obtain more generalized
entity relationships by reinforcing the features of unpopular entities. Based
on this relationship, we designed two graph structures to express medication
precision and safety at the same level to obtain visit representations.
Finally, the patient's historical clinical information is fitted to generate
medication combinations for the current health condition. Experiments on the
MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our method has outperformed current

<p>In this work, we study the problem of semantic communication and inference,
in which a student agent (i.e. mobile device) queries a teacher agent (i.e.
cloud sever) to generate higher-order data semantics living in a simplicial
complex. Specifically, the teacher first maps its data into a k-order
simplicial complex and learns its high-order correlations. For effective
communication and inference, the teacher seeks minimally sufficient and
invariant semantic structures prior to conveying information. These minimal
simplicial structures are found via judiciously removing simplices selected by
the Hodge Laplacians without compromising the inference query accuracy.
Subsequently, the student locally runs its own set of queries based on a masked
simplicial convolutional autoencoder (SCAE) leveraging both local and remote
teacher's knowledge. Numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach in terms of improving inference query accuracy under
different channel conditions and simplicial structures. Experiments on a
coauthorship dataset show that removing simplices by ranking the Laplacian
values yields a 85% reduction in payload size without sacrificing accuracy.
Joint semantic communication and inference by masked SCAE improves query
accuracy by 25% compared to local student based query and 15% compared to
remote teacher based query. Finally, incorporating channel semantics is shown
to effectively improve inference accuracy, notably at low SNR values.

<p>Our study reveals new theoretical insights into over-smoothing and feature
over-correlation in deep graph neural networks. We show the prevalence of
invariant subspaces, demonstrating a fixed relative behavior that is unaffected
by feature transformations. Our work clarifies recent observations related to
convergence to a constant state and a potential over-separation of node states,
as the amplification of subspaces only depends on the spectrum of the
aggregation function. In linear scenarios, this leads to node representations
being dominated by a low-dimensional subspace with an asymptotic convergence
rate independent of the feature transformations. This causes a rank collapse of
the node representations, resulting in over-smoothing when smooth vectors span
this subspace, and over-correlation even when over-smoothing is avoided. Guided
by our theory, we propose a sum of Kronecker products as a beneficial property
that can provably prevent over-smoothing, over-correlation, and rank collapse.
We empirically extend our insights to the non-linear case, demonstrating the
inability of existing models to capture linearly independent features.

<p>Accurate traffic forecasting at intersections governed by intelligent traffic
signals is critical for the advancement of an effective intelligent traffic
signal control system. However, due to the irregular traffic time series
produced by intelligent intersections, the traffic forecasting task becomes
much more intractable and imposes three major new challenges: 1) asynchronous
spatial dependency, 2) irregular temporal dependency among traffic data, and 3)
variable-length sequence to be predicted, which severely impede the performance
of current traffic forecasting methods. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous
Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) to predict the traffic
states of the lanes entering intelligent intersections in a future time window.
Specifically, by linking lanes via a traffic diffusion graph, we first propose
an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to model the asynchronous spatial
dependency between the time-misaligned traffic state measurements of lanes.
After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state
sequence, a learnable personalized time encoding is devised to embed the
continuous time for each lane. Then we propose a Transformable Time-aware
Convolution Network that learns meta-filters to derive time-aware convolution
filters with transformable filter sizes for efficient temporal convolution on
the irregular sequence. Furthermore, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network
consisting of a state evolution unit and a semiautoregressive predictor is
designed to effectively and efficiently predict variable-length traffic state
sequences. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of ASeer in six metrics.

<p>Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) have been introduced to deal with
multiple tasks by exploiting the correlations between different outputs.
Generally, MOGPs models assume a flat correlation structure between the
outputs. However, such a formulation does not account for more elaborate
relationships, for instance, if several replicates were observed for each
output (which is a typical setting in biological experiments). This paper
proposes an extension of MOGPs for hierarchical datasets (i.e. datasets for
which the relationships between observations can be represented within a tree
structure). Our model defines a tailored kernel function accounting for
hierarchical structures in the data to capture different levels of correlations
while leveraging the introduction of latent variables to express the underlying
dependencies between outputs through a dedicated kernel. This latter feature is
expected to significantly improve scalability as the number of tasks increases.
An extensive experimental study involving both synthetic and real-world data
from genomics and motion capture is proposed to support our claims.

<p>Federated Learning (FL) requires frequent exchange of model parameters, which
leads to long communication delay, especially when the network environments of
clients vary greatly. Moreover, the parameter server needs to wait for the
slowest client (i.e., straggler, which may have the largest model size, lowest
computing capability or worst network condition) to upload parameters, which
may significantly degrade the communication efficiency. Commonly-used client
selection methods such as partial client selection would lead to the waste of
computing resources and weaken the generalization of the global model. To
tackle this problem, along a different line, in this paper, we advocate the
approach of model parameter dropout instead of client selection, and
accordingly propose a novel framework of Federated learning scheme with
Differential parameter Dropout (FedDD). FedDD consists of two key modules:
dropout rate allocation and uploaded parameter selection, which will optimize
the model parameter uploading ratios tailored to different clients'
heterogeneous conditions and also select the proper set of important model
parameters for uploading subject to clients' dropout rate constraints.
Specifically, the dropout rate allocation is formulated as a convex
optimization problem, taking system heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and
model heterogeneity among clients into consideration. The uploaded parameter
selection strategy prioritizes on eliciting important parameters for uploading
to speedup convergence. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence
of the proposed FedDD scheme. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate
that the proposed FedDD scheme can achieve outstanding performances in both
communication efficiency and model convergence, and also possesses a strong
generalization capability to data of rare classes.

<p>Probabilistic Diffusion Models (PDMs) have recently emerged as a very
promising class of generative models, achieving high performance in natural
image generation. However, their performance relative to non-natural images,
like radar-based satellite data, remains largely unknown. Generating large
amounts of synthetic (and especially labelled) satellite data is crucial to
implement deep-learning approaches for the processing and analysis of
(interferometric) satellite aperture radar data. Here, we leverage PDMs to
generate several radar-based satellite image datasets. We show that PDMs
succeed in generating images with complex and realistic structures, but that
sampling time remains an issue. Indeed, accelerated sampling strategies, which
work well on simple image datasets like MNIST, fail on our radar datasets. We
provide a simple and versatile open-source
https://github.com/thomaskerdreux/PDM_SAR_InSAR_generation to train, sample and
evaluate PDMs using any dataset on a single GPU.

<p>We present a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating the lowest
excited states of a quantum system which is a natural generalization of the
estimation of ground states. The method has no free parameters and requires no
explicit orthogonalization of the different states, instead transforming the
problem of finding excited states of a given system into that of finding the
ground state of an expanded system. Expected values of arbitrary observables
can be calculated, including off-diagonal expectations between different states
such as the transition dipole moment. Although the method is entirely general,
it works particularly well in conjunction with recent work on using neural
networks as variational Ansatze for many-electron systems, and we show that by
combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer Ansatze we can accurately
recover vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths on molecules as
large as benzene. Beyond the examples on molecules presented here, we expect
this technique will be of great interest for applications of variational
quantum Monte Carlo to atomic, nuclear and condensed matter physics.

<p>Several decades ago, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were introduced for
performing binary classification tasks, under a supervised framework. Nowadays,
they often outperform other supervised methods and remain one of the most
popular approaches in the machine learning arena. In this work, we investigate
the training of SVMs through a smooth sparse-promoting-regularized squared
hinge loss minimization. This choice paves the way to the application of quick
training methods built on majorization-minimization approaches, benefiting from
the Lipschitz differentiabililty of the loss function. Moreover, the proposed
approach allows us to handle sparsity-preserving regularizers promoting the
selection of the most significant features, so enhancing the performance.
Numerical tests and comparisons conducted on three different datasets
demonstrate the good performance of the proposed methodology in terms of
qualitative metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 score) as well as
computational cost.

<p>In this article, the optimal sample complexity of learning the underlying
interaction/dependencies of a Linear Dynamical System (LDS) over a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) is studied. The sample complexity of learning a DAG's
structure is well-studied for static systems, where the samples of nodal states
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, such a study is
less explored for DAGs with dynamical systems, where the nodal states are
temporally correlated. We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as \emph{dynamical}
DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics are
driven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary
(WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same {power spectral
density (PSD)}. Inspired by the static settings, a metric and an algorithm
based on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstruct
the DDAG. The equal noise PSD assumption can be relaxed such that
identifiability conditions for DDAG reconstruction are not violated. For the
LDS with WSS (sub) Gaussian exogenous noise sources, it is shown that the
optimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn the
DDAG is $n=\Theta(q\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the
maximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound,
a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two different
sampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano's
inequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposed
algorithm.

<p>We present Belebele, a multiple-choice machine reading comprehension (MRC)
dataset spanning 122 language variants. Significantly expanding the language
coverage of natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks, this dataset
enables the evaluation of text models in high-, medium-, and low-resource
languages. Each question is based on a short passage from the Flores-200
dataset and has four multiple-choice answers. The questions were carefully
curated to discriminate between models with different levels of general
language comprehension. The English dataset on its own proves difficult enough
to challenge state-of-the-art language models. Being fully parallel, this
dataset enables direct comparison of model performance across all languages. We
use this dataset to evaluate the capabilities of multilingual masked language
models (MLMs) and large language models (LLMs). We present extensive results
and find that despite significant cross-lingual transfer in English-centric
LLMs, much smaller MLMs pretrained on balanced multilingual data still
understand far more languages. We also observe that larger vocabulary size and
conscious vocabulary construction correlate with better performance on

<p>A machine learning approach is presented to accelerate the computation of
block polymer morphology evolution for large domains over long timescales. The
strategy exploits the separation of characteristic times between coarse-grained
particle evolution on the monomer scale and slow morphological evolution over
mesoscopic scales. In contrast to empirical continuum models, the proposed
approach learns stochastically driven defect annihilation processes directly
from particle-based simulations. A UNet architecture that respects different
boundary conditions is adopted, thereby allowing periodic and fixed substrate
boundary conditions of arbitrary shape. Physical concepts are also introduced
via the loss function and symmetries are incorporated via data augmentation.
The model is validated using three different use cases. Explainable artificial
intelligence methods are applied to visualize the morphology evolution over
time. This approach enables the generation of large system sizes and long
trajectories to investigate defect densities and their evolution under
different types of confinement. As an application, we demonstrate the
importance of accessing late-stage morphologies for understanding particle
diffusion inside a single block. This work has implications for directed
self-assembly and materials design in micro-electronics, battery materials, and
membranes.

<p>Federated learning (FL) involves several devices that collaboratively train a
shared model without transferring their local data. FL reduces the
communication overhead, making it a promising learning method in UAV-enhanced
wireless networks with scarce energy resources. Despite the potential,
implementing FL in UAV-enhanced networks is challenging, as conventional UAV
placement methods that maximize coverage increase the FL delay significantly.
Moreover, the uncertainty and lack of a priori information about crucial
variables, such as channel quality, exacerbate the problem. In this paper, we
first analyze the statistical characteristics of a UAV-enhanced wireless sensor
network (WSN) with energy harvesting. We then develop a model and solution
based on the multi-objective multi-armed bandit theory to maximize the network
coverage while minimizing the FL delay. Besides, we propose another solution
that is particularly useful with large action sets and strict energy
constraints at the UAVs. Our proposal uses a scalarized best-arm identification
algorithm to find the optimal arms that maximize the ratio of the expected
reward to the expected energy cost by sequentially eliminating one or more arms
in each round. Then, we derive the upper bound on the error probability of our
multi-objective and cost-aware algorithm. Numerical results show the
effectiveness of our approach.

<p>It is a long-standing problem in robotics to develop agents capable of
executing diverse manipulation tasks from visual observations in unstructured
real-world environments. To achieve this goal, the robot needs to have a
comprehensive understanding of the 3D structure and semantics of the scene. In
this work, we present $\textbf{GNFactor}$, a visual behavior cloning agent for
multi-task robotic manipulation with $\textbf{G}$eneralizable $\textbf{N}$eural
feature $\textbf{F}$ields. GNFactor jointly optimizes a generalizable neural
field (GNF) as a reconstruction module and a Perceiver Transformer as a
decision-making module, leveraging a shared deep 3D voxel representation. To
incorporate semantics in 3D, the reconstruction module utilizes a
vision-language foundation model ($\textit{e.g.}$, Stable Diffusion) to distill
rich semantic information into the deep 3D voxel. We evaluate GNFactor on 3
real robot tasks and perform detailed ablations on 10 RLBench tasks with a
limited number of demonstrations. We observe a substantial improvement of
GNFactor over current state-of-the-art methods in seen and unseen tasks,
demonstrating the strong generalization ability of GNFactor. Our project

<p>Contact is at the core of robotic manipulation. At times, it is desired (e.g.
manipulation and grasping), and at times, it is harmful (e.g. when avoiding
obstacles). However, traditional path planning algorithms focus solely on
collision-free paths, limiting their applicability in contact-rich tasks. To
address this limitation, we propose the domain of Language-Conditioned Path
Planning, where contact-awareness is incorporated into the path planning
problem. As a first step in this domain, we propose Language-Conditioned
Collision Functions (LACO) a novel approach that learns a collision function
using only a single-view image, language prompt, and robot configuration. LACO
predicts collisions between the robot and the environment, enabling flexible,
conditional path planning without the need for manual object annotations, point
cloud data, or ground-truth object meshes. In both simulation and the real
world, we demonstrate that LACO can facilitate complex, nuanced path plans that
allow for interaction with objects that are safe to collide, rather than
prohibiting any collision.

<p>Semantic segmentation in autonomous driving has been undergoing an evolution
from sparse point segmentation to dense voxel segmentation, where the objective
is to predict the semantic occupancy of each voxel in the concerned 3D space.
The dense nature of the prediction space has rendered existing efficient
2D-projection-based methods (e.g., bird's eye view, range view, etc.)
ineffective, as they can only describe a subspace of the 3D scene. To address
this, we propose a cylindrical tri-perspective view to represent point clouds
effectively and comprehensively and a PointOcc model to process them
efficiently. Considering the distance distribution of LiDAR point clouds, we
construct the tri-perspective view in the cylindrical coordinate system for
more fine-grained modeling of nearer areas. We employ spatial group pooling to
maintain structural details during projection and adopt 2D backbones to
efficiently process each TPV plane. Finally, we obtain the features of each
point by aggregating its projected features on each of the processed TPV planes
without the need for any post-processing. Extensive experiments on both 3D
occupancy prediction and LiDAR segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed PointOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance with much faster speed.
Specifically, despite only using LiDAR, PointOcc significantly outperforms all
other methods, including multi-modal methods, with a large margin on the
OpenOccupancy benchmark. Code: https://github.com/wzzheng/PointOcc.

<p>Since its inception in "Attention Is All You Need", transformer architecture
has led to revolutionary advancements in NLP. The attention layer within the
transformer admits a sequence of input tokens $X$ and makes them interact
through pairwise similarities computed as softmax$(XQK^\top X^\top)$, where
$(K,Q)$ are the trainable key-query parameters. In this work, we establish a
formal equivalence between the optimization geometry of self-attention and a
hard-margin SVM problem that separates optimal input tokens from non-optimal
tokens using linear constraints on the outer-products of token pairs. This
formalism allows us to characterize the implicit bias of 1-layer transformers
optimized with gradient descent: (1) Optimizing the attention layer with
vanishing regularization, parameterized by $(K,Q)$, converges in direction to
an SVM solution minimizing the nuclear norm of the combined parameter
$W=KQ^\top$. Instead, directly parameterizing by $W$ minimizes a Frobenius norm
objective. We characterize this convergence, highlighting that it can occur
toward locally-optimal directions rather than global ones. (2) Complementing
this, we prove the local/global directional convergence of gradient descent
under suitable geometric conditions. Importantly, we show that
over-parameterization catalyzes global convergence by ensuring the feasibility
of the SVM problem and by guaranteeing a benign optimization landscape devoid
of stationary points. (3) While our theory applies primarily to linear
prediction heads, we propose a more general SVM equivalence that predicts the
implicit bias with nonlinear heads. Our findings are applicable to arbitrary
datasets and their validity is verified via experiments. We also introduce
several open problems and research directions. We believe these findings
inspire the interpretation of transformers as a hierarchy of SVMs that
separates and selects optimal tokens.

relations between visual perception, language, and flavor. The dataset
encompasses 897k images of wine labels and 824k reviews of wines curated from
the Vivino platform. It has over 350k unique vintages, annotated with year,
region, rating, alcohol percentage, price, and grape composition. We obtained
fine-grained flavor annotations on a subset by conducting a wine-tasting

propose a low-dimensional concept embedding algorithm that combines human

<p>Large-scale linear systems, $Ax=b$, frequently arise in practice and demand
effective iterative solvers. Often, these systems are noisy due to operational
errors or faulty data-collection processes. In the past decade, the randomized
Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm has been studied extensively as an efficient iterative
solver for such systems. However, the convergence study of RK in the noisy
regime is limited and considers measurement noise in the right-hand side
vector, $b$. Unfortunately, in practice, that is not always the case; the
coefficient matrix $A$ can also be noisy. In this paper, we analyze the
convergence of RK for noisy linear systems when the coefficient matrix, $A$, is
corrupted with both additive and multiplicative noise, along with the noisy
vector, $b$. In our analyses, the quantity $\tilde R=\| \tilde A^{\dagger}
\|_2^2 \|\tilde A \|_F^2$ influences the convergence of RK, where $\tilde A$
represents a noisy version of $A$. We claim that our analysis is robust and
realistically applicable, as we do not require information about the noiseless
coefficient matrix, $A$, and considering different conditions on noise, we can
control the convergence of RK. We substantiate our theoretical findings by
performing comprehensive numerical experiments.

<p>Synthesis from linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications provides assured
controllers for systems operating in stochastic and potentially adversarial
environments. Automatic synthesis tools, however, require a model of the
environment to construct controllers. In this work, we introduce a model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) approach to derive controllers from given LTL
specifications even when the environment is completely unknown. We model the
problem as a stochastic game (SG) between the controller and the adversarial
environment; we then learn optimal control strategies that maximize the
probability of satisfying the LTL specifications against the worst-case
environment behavior. We first construct a product game using the deterministic
parity automaton (DPA) translated from the given LTL specification. By deriving
distinct rewards and discount factors from the acceptance condition of the DPA,
we reduce the maximization of the worst-case probability of satisfying the LTL
specification into the maximization of a discounted reward objective in the
product game; this enables the use of model-free RL algorithms to learn an
optimal controller strategy. To deal with the common scalability problems when
the number of sets defining the acceptance condition of the DPA (usually
referred as colors), is large, we propose a lazy color generation method where
distinct rewards and discount factors are utilized only when needed, and an
approximate method where the controller eventually focuses on only one color.
In several case studies, we show that our approach is scalable to a wide range
of LTL formulas, significantly outperforming existing methods for learning
controllers from LTL specifications in SGs.

<p>Quality-sensitive applications of machine learning (ML) require quality
assurance (QA) by humans before the predictions of an ML model can be deployed.
QA for ML (QA4ML) interfaces require users to view a large amount of data and
perform many interactions to correct errors made by the ML model. An optimized
user interface (UI) can significantly reduce interaction costs. While UI
optimization can be informed by user studies evaluating design options, this
approach is not scalable because there are typically numerous small variations
that can affect the efficiency of a QA4ML interface. Hence, we propose using
simulation to evaluate and aid the optimization of QA4ML interfaces. In
particular, we focus on simulating the combined effects of human intelligence
in initiating appropriate interaction commands and machine intelligence in
providing algorithmic assistance for accelerating QA4ML processes. As QA4ML is
usually labor-intensive, we use the simulated task completion time as the
metric for UI optimization under different interface and algorithm setups. We
demonstrate the usage of this UI design method in several QA4ML applications.

<p>Current methods for embedding-based query answering over incomplete Knowledge
Graphs (KGs) only focus on inductive reasoning, i.e., predicting answers by
learning patterns from the data, and lack the complementary ability to do
deductive reasoning, which requires the application of domain knowledge to
infer further information. To address this shortcoming, we investigate the
problem of incorporating ontologies into embedding-based query answering models
by defining the task of embedding-based ontology-mediated query answering. We
propose various integration strategies into prominent representatives of
embedding models that involve (1) different ontology-driven data augmentation
techniques and (2) adaptation of the loss function to enforce the ontology
axioms. We design novel benchmarks for the considered task based on the LUBM
and the NELL KGs and evaluate our methods on them. The achieved improvements in
the setting that requires both inductive and deductive reasoning are from 20%

<p>Generative models for images have gained significant attention in computer
vision and natural language processing due to their ability to generate
realistic samples from complex data distributions. To leverage the advances of
image-based generative models for the time series domain, we propose a
two-dimensional image representation for time series, the Extended
Intertemporal Return Plot (XIRP). Our approach captures the intertemporal time
series dynamics in a scale-invariant and invertible way, reducing training time
and improving sample quality. We benchmark synthetic XIRPs obtained by an
off-the-shelf Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) to other image
representations and models regarding similarity and predictive ability metrics.
Our novel, validated image representation for time series consistently and
significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art RNN-based generative model
regarding predictive ability. Further, we introduce an improved stochastic
inversion to substantially improve simulation quality regardless of the
representation and provide the prospect of transfer potentials in other

<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent research topic in
the field of machine learning. Existing GNN models are commonly categorized
into two types: spectral GNNs, which are designed based on polynomial graph
filters, and spatial GNNs, which utilize a message-passing scheme as the
foundation of the model. For the expressive power and universality of spectral
GNNs, a natural approach is to improve the design of basis functions for better
approximation ability. As for spatial GNNs, models like Graph Isomorphism
Networks (GIN) analyze their expressive power based on Graph Isomorphism Tests.
Recently, there have been attempts to establish connections between spatial
GNNs and geometric concepts like curvature and cellular sheaves, as well as
physical phenomena like oscillators. However, despite the recent progress,
there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis regarding the universality of
spatial GNNs from the perspectives of geometry and physics. In this paper, we
propose MetricGNN (MGNN), a spatial GNN model inspired by the
congruent-insensitivity property of classifiers in the classification phase of
GNNs. We demonstrate that a GNN model is universal in the spatial domain if it
can generate embedding matrices that are congruent to any given embedding
matrix. This property is closely related to the Distance Geometry Problem
(DGP). Since DGP is an NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem, we propose
optimizing an energy function derived from spring networks and the
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) problem. This approach also allows our model to
handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Finally, we propose employing
the iteration method to optimize our energy function. We extensively evaluate
the effectiveness of our model through experiments conducted on both synthetic
and real-world datasets. Our code is available at:

<p>The large computing and memory cost of deep neural networks (DNNs) often
precludes their use in resource-constrained devices. Quantizing the parameters
and operations to lower bit-precision offers substantial memory and energy
savings for neural network inference, facilitating the use of DNNs on edge
computing platforms. Recent efforts at quantizing DNNs have employed a range of
techniques encompassing progressive quantization, step-size adaptation, and
gradient scaling. This paper proposes a new quantization approach for mixed
precision convolutional neural networks (CNNs) targeting edge-computing. Our
method establishes a new pareto frontier in model accuracy and memory footprint
demonstrating a range of quantized models, delivering best-in-class accuracy
below 4.3 MB of weights (wgts.) and activations (acts.). Our main contributions
are: (i) hardware-aware heterogeneous differentiable quantization with
tensor-sliced learned precision, (ii) targeted gradient modification for wgts.
and acts. to mitigate quantization errors, and (iii) a multi-phase learning
schedule to address instability in learning arising from updates to the learned
quantizer and model parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
techniques on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models including

<p>The step function is one of the simplest and most natural activation
functions for deep neural networks (DNNs). As it counts 1 for positive
variables and 0 for others, its intrinsic characteristics (e.g., discontinuity
and no viable information of subgradients) impede its development for several
decades. Even if there is an impressive body of work on designing DNNs with
continuous activation functions that can be deemed as surrogates of the step
function, it is still in the possession of some advantageous properties, such
as complete robustness to outliers and being capable of attaining the best
learning-theoretic guarantee of predictive accuracy. Hence, in this paper, we
aim to train DNNs with the step function used as an activation function (dubbed
as 0/1 DNNs). We first reformulate 0/1 DNNs as an unconstrained optimization
problem and then solve it by a block coordinate descend (BCD) method. Moreover,
we acquire closed-form solutions for sub-problems of BCD as well as its
convergence properties. Furthermore, we also integrate
$\ell_{2,0}$-regularization into 0/1 DNN to accelerate the training process and
compress the network scale. As a result, the proposed algorithm has a high
performance on classifying MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. As a result, the
proposed algorithm has a desirable performance on classifying MNIST,

ultimate decision-makers. In this work, we propose two novel architectures of
self-interpretable image classifiers that first explain, and then predict (as
opposed to post-hoc explanations) by harnessing the visual correspondences
between a query image and exemplars. Our models consistently improve (by 1 to 4
points) on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets while performing marginally worse
(by 1 to 2 points) on in-distribution tests than ResNet-50 and a $k$-nearest
neighbor classifier (kNN). Via a large-scale, human study on ImageNet and CUB,
our correspondence-based explanations are found to be more useful to users than
kNN explanations. Our explanations help users more accurately reject AI's wrong
decisions than all other tested methods. Interestingly, for the first time, we
show that it is possible to achieve complementary human-AI team accuracy (i.e.,
that is higher than either AI-alone or human-alone), in ImageNet and CUB image
classification tasks.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02064">GRASP: A Goodness-of-Fit Test for Classification Learning. (arXiv:2209.02064v2 [stat.ME] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Performance of classifiers is often measured in terms of average accuracy on
test data. Despite being a standard measure, average accuracy fails in
characterizing the fit of the model to the underlying conditional law of labels
given the features vector ($Y|X$), e.g. due to model misspecification, over
fitting, and high-dimensionality. In this paper, we consider the fundamental
problem of assessing the goodness-of-fit for a general binary classifier. Our
framework does not make any parametric assumption on the conditional law $Y|X$,
and treats that as a black box oracle model which can be accessed only through
queries. We formulate the goodness-of-fit assessment problem as a tolerance
hypothesis testing of the form \[ H_0: \mathbb{E}\Big[D_f\Big({\sf
Bern}(\eta(X))\|{\sf Bern}(\hat{\eta}(X))\Big)\Big]\leq \tau\,, \] where $D_f$
represents an $f$-divergence function, and $\eta(x)$, $\hat{\eta}(x)$
respectively denote the true and an estimate likelihood for a feature vector
$x$ admitting a positive label. We propose a novel test, called \grasp for
testing $H_0$, which works in finite sample settings, no matter the features
(distribution-free). We also propose model-X \grasp designed for model-X
settings where the joint distribution of the features vector is known. Model-X
\grasp uses this distributional information to achieve better power. We
evaluate the performance of our tests through extensive numerical experiments.

<p>We study the use of binary activated neural networks as interpretable and
explainable predictors in the context of regression tasks on tabular data; more
specifically, we provide guarantees on their expressiveness, present an
approach based on the efficient computation of SHAP values for quantifying the
relative importance of the features, hidden neurons and even weights. As the
model's simplicity is instrumental in achieving interpretability, we propose a
greedy algorithm for building compact binary activated networks. This approach
doesn't need to fix an architecture for the network in advance: it is built one
layer at a time, one neuron at a time, leading to predictors that aren't
needlessly complex for a given task.

<p>Neural networks have gained much interest because of their effectiveness in
many applications. However, their mathematical properties are generally not
well understood. If there is some underlying geometric structure inherent to
the data or to the function to approximate, it is often desirable to take this
into account in the design of the neural network. In this work, we start with a
non-autonomous ODE and build neural networks using a suitable,
structure-preserving, numerical time-discretisation. The structure of the
neural network is then inferred from the properties of the ODE vector field.
Besides injecting more structure into the network architectures, this modelling
procedure allows a better theoretical understanding of their behaviour. We
present two universal approximation results and demonstrate how to impose some
particular properties on the neural networks. A particular focus is on
1-Lipschitz architectures including layers that are not 1-Lipschitz. These
networks are expressive and robust against adversarial attacks, as shown for
the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

<p>The main goal of Few-Shot learning algorithms is to enable learning from
small amounts of data. One of the most popular and elegant Few-Shot learning
approaches is Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). The main idea behind this
method is to learn the shared universal weights of a meta-model, which are then
adapted for specific tasks. However, the method suffers from over-fitting and
poorly quantifies uncertainty due to limited data size. Bayesian approaches
could, in principle, alleviate these shortcomings by learning weight
distributions in place of point-wise weights. Unfortunately, previous
modifications of MAML are limited due to the simplicity of Gaussian posteriors,
MAML-like gradient-based weight updates, or by the same structure enforced for
universal and adapted weights.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Bayesian MAML called
BayesianHMAML, which employs Hypernetworks for weight updates. It learns the
universal weights point-wise, but a probabilistic structure is added when
adapted for specific tasks. In such a framework, we can use simple Gaussian
distributions or more complicated posteriors induced by Continuous Normalizing
Flows.

<p>Compiled software is delivered as executable binary code. Developers write
source code to express the software semantics, but the compiler converts it to
a binary format that the CPU can directly execute. Therefore, binary code
analysis is critical to applications in reverse engineering and computer
security tasks where source code is not available. However, unlike source code
and natural language that contain rich semantic information, binary code is
typically difficult for human engineers to understand and analyze. While
existing work uses AI models to assist source code analysis, few studies have
considered binary code. In this paper, we propose a COntrastive learning Model
for Binary cOde Analysis, or COMBO, that incorporates source code and comment
information into binary code during representation learning. Specifically, we
present three components in COMBO: (1) a primary contrastive learning method
for cold-start pre-training, (2) a simplex interpolation method to incorporate
source code, comments, and binary code, and (3) an intermediate representation
learning algorithm to provide binary code embeddings. Finally, we evaluate the
effectiveness of the pre-trained representations produced by COMBO using three
indicative downstream tasks relating to binary code: algorithmic functionality
classification, binary code similarity, and vulnerability detection. Our
experimental results show that COMBO facilitates representation learning of
binary code visualized by distribution analysis, and improves the performance
on all three downstream tasks by 5.45% on average compared to state-of-the-art
large-scale language representation models. To the best of our knowledge, COMBO
is the first language representation model that incorporates source code,
binary code, and comments into contrastive code representation learning and
unifies multiple tasks for binary code analysis.

<p>Bayesian model reduction provides an efficient approach for comparing the
performance of all nested sub-models of a model, without re-evaluating any of
these sub-models. Until now, Bayesian model reduction has been applied mainly
in the computational neuroscience community on simple models. In this paper, we
formulate and apply Bayesian model reduction to perform principled pruning of
Bayesian neural networks, based on variational free energy minimization. Direct
application of Bayesian model reduction, however, gives rise to approximation
errors. Therefore, a novel iterative pruning algorithm is presented to
alleviate the problems arising with naive Bayesian model reduction, as
supported experimentally on the publicly available UCI datasets for different
inference algorithms. This novel parameter pruning scheme solves the
shortcomings of current state-of-the-art pruning methods that are used by the
signal processing community. The proposed approach has a clear stopping
criterion and minimizes the same objective that is used during training. Next
to these benefits, our experiments indicate better model performance in
comparison to state-of-the-art pruning schemes.

<p>Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, causing a large
proportion of skin cancer deaths. However, melanoma diagnoses by pathologists
shows low interrater reliability. As melanoma is a cancer of the melanocyte,
there is a clear need to develop a melanocytic cell segmentation tool that is
agnostic to pathologist variability and automates pixel-level annotation.
Gigapixel-level pathologist labeling, however, is impractical. Herein, we
propose a means to train deep neural networks for melanocytic cell segmentation
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections and paired
immunohistochemistry (IHC) of adjacent tissue sections, achieving a mean IOU of
0.64 despite imperfect ground-truth labels.

<p>Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a
global model without disclosing their data. Previous researches often require
training the complete model parameters. However, the emergence of powerful
pre-trained models makes it possible to achieve higher performance with fewer
learnable parameters in FL. In this paper, we propose a federated adaptive
prompt tuning algorithm, FedAPT, for multi-domain collaborative image
classification with powerful foundation models, like CLIP. Compared with direct
federated prompt tuning, our core idea is to adaptively unlock specific domain
knowledge for each test sample in order to provide them with personalized
prompts. To implement this idea, we design an adaptive prompt tuning module,
which consists of a meta prompt, an adaptive network, and some keys. The server
randomly generates a set of keys and assigns a unique key to each client. Then
all clients cooperatively train the global adaptive network and meta prompt
with the local datasets and the frozen keys. Ultimately, the global aggregation
model can assign a personalized prompt to CLIP based on the domain features of
each test sample. We perform extensive experiments on two multi-domain image
classification datasets across two different settings - supervised and
unsupervised. The results show that FedAPT can achieve better performance with
less than 10\% of the number of parameters of the fully trained model, and the
global model can perform well in diverse client domains simultaneously.

<p>The aim of Machine Unlearning (MU) is to provide theoretical guarantees on
the removal of the contribution of a given data point from a training
procedure. Federated Unlearning (FU) consists in extending MU to unlearn a
given client's contribution from a federated training routine. Current FU
approaches are generally not scalable, and do not come with sound theoretical
quantification of the effectiveness of unlearning. In this work we present
Informed Federated Unlearning (IFU), a novel efficient and quantifiable FU
approach. Upon unlearning request from a given client, IFU identifies the
optimal FL iteration from which FL has to be reinitialized, with unlearning
guarantees obtained through a randomized perturbation mechanism. The theory of
IFU is also extended to account for sequential unlearning requests.
Experimental results on different tasks and dataset show that IFU leads to more
efficient unlearning procedures as compared to basic re-training and
state-of-the-art FU approaches.

<p>Face de-identification methods have been proposed to preserve users' privacy
by obscuring their faces. These methods, however, can degrade the quality of
photos, and they usually do not preserve the utility of faces, i.e., their age,
gender, pose, and facial expression. Recently, GANs, such as StyleGAN, have
been proposed, which generate realistic, high-quality imaginary faces. In this
paper, we investigate the use of StyleGAN in generating de-identified faces
through style mixing. We examined this de-identification method for preserving
utility and privacy by implementing several face detection, verification, and
identification attacks and conducting a user study. The results from our
extensive experiments, human evaluation, and comparison with two
state-of-the-art methods, i.e., CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy, show that StyleGAN
performs on par or better than these methods, preserving users' privacy and
images' utility. In particular, the results of the machine learning-based
experiments show that StyleGAN0-4 preserves utility better than CIAGAN and
DeepPrivacy while preserving privacy at the same level. StyleGAN0-3 preserves
utility at the same level while providing more privacy. In this paper, for the
first time, we also performed a carefully designed user study to examine both
privacy and utility-preserving properties of StyleGAN0-3, 0-4, and 0-5, as well
as CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy from the human observers' perspectives. Our
statistical tests showed that participants tend to verify and identify
StyleGAN0-5 images more easily than DeepPrivacy images. All the methods but
StyleGAN0-5 had significantly lower identification rates than CIAGAN. Regarding
utility, as expected, StyleGAN0-5 performed significantly better in preserving
some attributes. Among all methods, on average, participants believe gender has
been preserved the most while naturalness has been preserved the least.

<p>Normalizing flow is a class of deep generative models for efficient sampling
and density estimation. In practice, the flow often appears as a chain of
invertible neural network blocks; to facilitate training, existing works have
regularized flow trajectories and designed special network architectures. The
current paper develops a neural ODE flow network inspired by the
Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto (JKO) scheme, which allows efficient block-wise
training of the residual blocks without sampling SDE trajectories or inner
loops of score matching or variational learning. As the JKO scheme unfolds the
dynamic of gradient flow, the proposed model naturally stacks residual network
blocks one by one, reducing the memory load and difficulty in performing
end-to-end deep flow network training. We also develop adaptive time
reparameterization of the flow network with a progressive refinement of the
trajectory in probability space, which improves the model training efficiency
and accuracy in practice. Using numerical experiments with synthetic and real
data, we show that the proposed JKO-iFlow model achieves similar or better
performance in generating new samples compared with the existing flow and
diffusion models at a significantly reduced computational and memory cost.

<p>This study demonstrates the feasibility of point cloud-based proactive link
quality prediction for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Previous
studies have proposed machine learning-based methods to predict received signal
strength for future time periods using time series of depth images to mitigate
the line-of-sight (LOS) path blockage by pedestrians in mmWave communication.
However, these image-based methods have limited applicability due to privacy
concerns as camera images may contain sensitive information. This study
proposes a point cloud-based method for mmWave link quality prediction and
demonstrates its feasibility through experiments. Point clouds represent
three-dimensional (3D) spaces as a set of points and are sparser and less
likely to contain sensitive information than camera images. Additionally, point
clouds provide 3D position and motion information, which is necessary for
understanding the radio propagation environment involving pedestrians. This
study designs the mmWave link quality prediction method and conducts realistic
indoor experiments, where the link quality fluctuates significantly due to
human blockage, using commercially available IEEE 802.11ad-based 60 GHz
wireless LAN devices and Kinect v2 RGB-D camera and Velodyne VLP-16 light
detection and ranging (LiDAR) for point cloud acquisition. The experimental
results showed that our proposed method can predict future large attenuation of
mmWave received signal strength and throughput induced by the LOS path blockage
by pedestrians with comparable or superior accuracy to image-based prediction
methods. Hence, our point cloud-based method can serve as a viable alternative
to image-based methods.

<p>Transformers were originally proposed as a sequence-to-sequence model for
text but have become vital for a wide range of modalities, including images,
audio, video, and undirected graphs. However, transformers for directed graphs
are a surprisingly underexplored topic, despite their applicability to
ubiquitous domains, including source code and logic circuits. In this work, we
propose two direction- and structure-aware positional encodings for directed
graphs: (1) the eigenvectors of the Magnetic Laplacian - a direction-aware
generalization of the combinatorial Laplacian; (2) directional random walk
encodings. Empirically, we show that the extra directionality information is
useful in various downstream tasks, including correctness testing of sorting
networks and source code understanding. Together with a data-flow-centric graph
construction, our model outperforms the prior state of the art on the Open

<p>Artificial neural networks are being proposed as models of parts of the
brain. The networks are compared to recordings of biological neurons, and good
performance in reproducing neural responses is considered to support the
model's validity. A key question is how much this system identification
approach tells us about brain computation. Does it validate one model
architecture over another? We evaluate the most commonly used comparison
techniques, such as a linear encoding model and centered kernel alignment, to
correctly identify a model by replacing brain recordings with known ground
truth models. System identification performance is quite variable; it also
depends significantly on factors independent of the ground truth architecture,
such as stimuli images. In addition, we show the limitations of using
functional similarity scores in identifying higher-level architectural motifs.

<p>This paper studies a cooperative multi-agent multi-armed stochastic bandit
problem where agents operate asynchronously -- agent pull times and rates are
unknown, irregular, and heterogeneous -- and face the same instance of a
K-armed bandit problem. Agents can share reward information to speed up the
learning process at additional communication costs. We propose ODC, an
on-demand communication protocol that tailors the communication of each pair of
agents based on their empirical pull times. ODC is efficient when the pull
times of agents are highly heterogeneous, and its communication complexity
depends on the empirical pull times of agents. ODC is a generic protocol that
can be integrated into most cooperative bandit algorithms without degrading
their performance. We then incorporate ODC into the natural extensions of UCB
and AAE algorithms and propose two communication-efficient cooperative
algorithms. Our analysis shows that both algorithms are near-optimal in regret.

<p>Traffic analysis is crucial for urban operations and planning, while the
availability of dense urban traffic data beyond loop detectors is still scarce.
We present a large-scale floating vehicle dataset of per-street segment traffic
information, Metropolitan Segment Traffic Speeds from Massive Floating Car Data
in 10 Cities (MeTS-10), available for 10 global cities with a 15-minute
resolution for collection periods ranging between 108 and 361 days in 2019-2021
and covering more than 1500 square kilometers per metropolitan area. MeTS-10
features traffic speed information at all street levels from main arterials to
local streets for Antwerp, Bangkok, Barcelona, Berlin, Chicago, Istanbul,
London, Madrid, Melbourne and Moscow. The dataset leverages the
industrial-scale floating vehicle Traffic4cast data with speeds and vehicle
counts provided in a privacy-preserving spatio-temporal aggregation. We detail
the efficient matching approach mapping the data to the OpenStreetMap road
graph. We evaluate the dataset by comparing it with publicly available
stationary vehicle detector data (for Berlin, London, and Madrid) and the Uber
traffic speed dataset (for Barcelona, Berlin, and London). The comparison
highlights the differences across datasets in spatio-temporal coverage and
variations in the reported traffic caused by the binning method. MeTS-10
enables novel, city-wide analysis of mobility and traffic patterns for ten
major world cities, overcoming current limitations of spatially sparse vehicle
detector data. The large spatial and temporal coverage offers an opportunity
for joining the MeTS-10 with other datasets, such as traffic surveys in traffic
planning studies or vehicle detector data in traffic control settings.

<p>Many learning algorithms used as normative models in neuroscience or as
candidate approaches for learning on neuromorphic chips learn by contrasting
one set of network states with another. These Contrastive Learning (CL)
algorithms are traditionally implemented with rigid, temporally non-local, and
periodic learning dynamics that could limit the range of physical systems
capable of harnessing CL. In this study, we build on recent work exploring how
CL might be implemented by biological or neurmorphic systems and show that this
form of learning can be made temporally local, and can still function even if
many of the dynamical requirements of standard training procedures are relaxed.
Thanks to a set of general theorems corroborated by numerical experiments
across several CL models, our results provide theoretical foundations for the
study and development of CL methods for biological and neuromorphic neural
networks.

<p>Tackling unfairness in graph learning models is a challenging task, as the
unfairness issues on graphs involve both attributes and topological structures.
Existing work on fair graph learning simply assumes that attributes of all
nodes are available for model training and then makes fair predictions. In
practice, however, the attributes of some nodes might not be accessible due to
missing data or privacy concerns, which makes fair graph learning even more
challenging. In this paper, we propose FairAC, a fair attribute completion
method, to complement missing information and learn fair node embeddings for
graphs with missing attributes. FairAC adopts an attention mechanism to deal
with the attribute missing problem and meanwhile, it mitigates two types of
unfairness, i.e., feature unfairness from attributes and topological unfairness
due to attribute completion. FairAC can work on various types of homogeneous
graphs and generate fair embeddings for them and thus can be applied to most
downstream tasks to improve their fairness performance. To our best knowledge,
FairAC is the first method that jointly addresses the graph attribution
completion and graph unfairness problems. Experimental results on benchmark
datasets show that our method achieves better fairness performance with less
sacrifice in accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods of fair graph
learning. Code is available at: https://github.com/donglgcn/FairAC.

<p>We seek to give users precise control over diffusion-based image generation
by modeling complex scenes as sequences of layers, which define the desired
spatial arrangement and visual attributes of objects in the scene. Collage
Diffusion harmonizes the input layers to make objects fit together -- the key
challenge involves minimizing changes in the positions and key visual
attributes of the input layers while allowing other attributes to change in the
harmonization process. We ensure that objects are generated in the correct
locations by modifying text-image cross-attention with the layers' alpha masks.
We preserve key visual attributes of input layers by learning specialized text
representations per layer and by extending ControlNet to operate on layers.
Layer input allows users to control the extent of image harmonization on a
per-object basis, and users can even iteratively edit individual objects in
generated images while keeping other objects fixed. By leveraging the rich
information present in layer input, Collage Diffusion generates globally
harmonized images that maintain desired object characteristics better than
prior approaches.

<p>One major challenge in machine learning applications is coping with
mismatches between the datasets used in the development and those obtained in
real-world applications. These mismatches may lead to inaccurate predictions
and errors, resulting in poor product quality and unreliable systems. In this
study, we propose StyleDiff to inform developers of the differences between the
two datasets for the steady development of machine learning systems. Using
disentangled image spaces obtained from recently proposed generative models,
StyleDiff compares the two datasets by focusing on attributes in the images and
provides an easy-to-understand analysis of the differences between the
datasets. The proposed StyleDiff performs in $O (d N\log N)$, where $N$ is the
size of the datasets and $d$ is the number of attributes, enabling the
application to large datasets. We demonstrate that StyleDiff accurately detects
differences between datasets and presents them in an understandable format
using, for example, driving scenes datasets.

<p>Visual Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become a powerful
alternative for full fine-tuning so as to adapt pre-trained vision models to
downstream tasks, which only tunes a small number of parameters while freezing
the vast majority ones to ease storage burden and optimization difficulty.
However, existing PEFT methods introduce trainable parameters to the same
positions across different tasks depending solely on human heuristics and
neglect the domain gaps. To this end, we study where to introduce and how to
allocate trainable parameters by proposing a novel Sensitivity-aware visual
Parameter-efficient fine-Tuning (SPT) scheme, which adaptively allocates
trainable parameters to task-specific important positions given a desired
tunable parameter budget. Specifically, our SPT first quickly identifies the
sensitive parameters that require tuning for a given task in a data-dependent
way. Next, our SPT further boosts the representational capability for the
weight matrices whose number of sensitive parameters exceeds a pre-defined
threshold by utilizing existing structured tuning methods, e.g., LoRA [23] or
Adapter [22], to replace directly tuning the selected sensitive parameters
(unstructured tuning) under the budget. Extensive experiments on a wide range
of downstream recognition tasks show that our SPT is complementary to the
existing PEFT methods and largely boosts their performance, e.g., SPT improves
Adapter with supervised pre-trained ViT-B/16 backbone by 4.2% and 1.4% mean
Top-1 accuracy, reaching SOTA performance on FGVC and VTAB-1k benchmarks,
respectively. Source code is at https://github.com/ziplab/SPT

<p>Realistic aircraft trajectory models are useful in the design and validation
of air traffic management (ATM) systems. Models of aircraft operated under
instrument flight rules (IFR) require capturing the variability inherent in how
aircraft follow standard flight procedures. The variability in aircraft
behavior varies among flight stages. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic
model that can learn the variability from the procedural data and flight tracks
collected from radar surveillance data. For each segment, a Gaussian mixture
model is used to learn the deviations of aircraft trajectories from their
procedures. Given new procedures, we can generate synthetic trajectories by
sampling a series of deviations from the trained Gaussian distributions and
reconstructing the aircraft trajectory using the deviations and the procedures.
We extend this method to capture pairwise correlations between aircraft and
show how a pairwise model can be used to generate traffic involving an
arbitrary number of aircraft. We demonstrate the proposed models on the arrival
tracks and procedures of the John F. Kennedy International Airport. The
distributional similarity between the original and the synthetic trajectory
dataset was evaluated using the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the empirical
distributions of different variables. We also provide qualitative analyses of
the synthetic trajectories generated from the models.

<p>In autonomous driving, data augmentation is commonly used for improving 3D
object detection. The most basic methods include insertion of copied objects
and rotation and scaling of the entire training frame. Numerous variants have
been developed as well. The existing methods, however, are considerably limited
when compared to the variety of the real world possibilities. In this work, we
develop a diversified and realistic augmentation method that can flexibly
construct a whole-body object, freely locate and rotate the object, and apply
self-occlusion and external-occlusion accordingly. To improve the diversity of
the whole-body object construction, we develop an iterative method that
stochastically combines multiple objects observed from the real world into a
single object. Unlike the existing augmentation methods, the constructed
objects can be randomly located and rotated in the training frame because
proper occlusions can be reflected to the whole-body objects in the final step.
Finally, proper self-occlusion at each local object level and
external-occlusion at the global frame level are applied using the Hidden Point
Removal (HPR) algorithm that is computationally efficient. HPR is also used for
adaptively controlling the point density of each object according to the
object's distance from the LiDAR. Experiment results show that the proposed
DR.CPO algorithm is data-efficient and model-agnostic without incurring any
computational overhead. Also, DR.CPO can improve mAP performance by 2.08% when
compared to the best 3D detection result known for KITTI dataset. The code is

<p>We present a linear algebra formulation of backpropagation which allows the
calculation of gradients by using a generically written ``backslash'' or
Gaussian elimination on triangular systems of equations. Generally, the matrix
elements are operators. This paper has three contributions: (i) it is of
intellectual value to replace traditional treatments of automatic
differentiation with a (left acting) operator theoretic, graph-based approach;
(ii) operators can be readily placed in matrices in software in programming
languages such as Julia as an implementation option; (iii) we introduce a novel
notation, ``transpose dot'' operator ``$\{\}^{T_\bullet}$'' that allows for the
reversal of operators.
</p>
<p>We further demonstrate the elegance of the operators approach in a suitable
programming language consisting of generic linear algebra operators such as
Julia \cite{bezanson2017julia}, and that it is possible to realize this
abstraction in code. Our implementation shows how generic linear algebra can
allow operators as elements of matrices. In contrast to ``operator
overloading,'' where backslash would normally have to be rewritten to take
advantage of operators, with ``generic programming'' there is no such need.

<p>Graph data is omnipresent and has a wide variety of applications, such as in
natural science, social networks, or the semantic web. However, while being
rich in information, graphs are often noisy and incomplete. As a result, graph
completion tasks, such as node classification or link prediction, have gained
attention. On one hand, neural methods, such as graph neural networks, have
proven to be robust tools for learning rich representations of noisy graphs. On
the other hand, symbolic methods enable exact reasoning on graphs.We propose
Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (KeGNN), a neuro-symbolic framework
for graph completion that combines both paradigms as it allows for the
integration of prior knowledge into a graph neural network model.Essentially,
KeGNN consists of a graph neural network as a base upon which knowledge
enhancement layers are stacked with the goal of refining predictions with
respect to prior knowledge.We instantiate KeGNN in conjunction with two
state-of-the-art graph neural networks, Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph
Attention Networks, and evaluate KeGNN on multiple benchmark datasets for node
classification.

<p>Plain text has become a prevalent interface for text-to-image synthesis.
However, its limited customization options hinder users from accurately
describing desired outputs. For example, plain text makes it hard to specify
continuous quantities, such as the precise RGB color value or importance of
each word. Furthermore, creating detailed text prompts for complex scenes is
tedious for humans to write and challenging for text encoders to interpret. To
address these challenges, we propose using a rich-text editor supporting
formats such as font style, size, color, and footnote. We extract each word's
attributes from rich text to enable local style control, explicit token
reweighting, precise color rendering, and detailed region synthesis. We achieve
these capabilities through a region-based diffusion process. We first obtain
each word's region based on attention maps of a diffusion process using plain
text. For each region, we enforce its text attributes by creating
region-specific detailed prompts and applying region-specific guidance, and
maintain its fidelity against plain-text generation through region-based
injections. We present various examples of image generation from rich text and
demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines with quantitative
evaluations.

<p>Today, state-of-the-art deep neural networks that process events first
convert them into dense, grid-like input representations before using an
off-the-shelf network. However, selecting the appropriate representation for
the task traditionally requires training a neural network for each
representation and selecting the best one based on the validation score, which
is very time-consuming. This work eliminates this bottleneck by selecting
representations based on the Gromov-Wasserstein Discrepancy (GWD) between raw
events and their representation. It is about 200 times faster to compute than
training a neural network and preserves the task performance ranking of event
representations across multiple representations, network backbones, datasets,
and tasks. Thus finding representations with high task scores is equivalent to
finding representations with a low GWD. We use this insight to, for the first
time, perform a hyperparameter search on a large family of event
representations, revealing new and powerful representations that exceed the
state-of-the-art. Our optimized representations outperform existing
representations by 1.7 mAP on the 1 Mpx dataset and 0.3 mAP on the Gen1

classification score on the mini N-ImageNet benchmark. Moreover, we outperform

<p>A lot of deep learning (DL) research these days is mainly focused on
improving quantitative metrics regardless of other factors. In human-centered
applications, like skin lesion classification in dermatology, DL-driven
clinical decision support systems are still in their infancy due to the limited
transparency of their decision-making process. Moreover, the lack of procedures
that can explain the behavior of trained DL algorithms leads to almost no trust
from clinical physicians. To diagnose skin lesions, dermatologists rely on
visual assessment of the disease and the data gathered from the patient's
anamnesis. Data-driven algorithms dealing with multi-modal data are limited by
the separation of feature-level and decision-level fusion procedures required
by convolutional architectures. To address this issue, we enable single-stage
multi-modal data fusion via the attention mechanism of transformer-based
architectures to aid in diagnosing skin diseases. Our method beats other
state-of-the-art single- and multi-modal DL architectures in image-rich and
patient-data-rich environments. Additionally, the choice of the architecture
enables native interpretability support for the classification task both in the
image and metadata domain with no additional modifications necessary.

<p>Unlike conventional grid and mesh based methods for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), neural networks have the potential to break the
curse of dimensionality, providing approximate solutions to problems where
using classical solvers is difficult or impossible. While global minimization
of the PDE residual over the network parameters works well for boundary value
problems, catastrophic forgetting impairs the applicability of this approach to
initial value problems (IVPs). In an alternative local-in-time approach, the
optimization problem can be converted into an ordinary differential equation
(ODE) on the network parameters and the solution propagated forward in time;
however, we demonstrate that current methods based on this approach suffer from
two key issues. First, following the ODE produces an uncontrolled growth in the
conditioning of the problem, ultimately leading to unacceptably large numerical
errors. Second, as the ODE methods scale cubically with the number of model
parameters, they are restricted to small neural networks, significantly
limiting their ability to represent intricate PDE initial conditions and
solutions. Building on these insights, we develop Neural IVP, an ODE based IVP
solver which prevents the network from getting ill-conditioned and runs in time
linear in the number of parameters, enabling us to evolve the dynamics of
challenging PDEs with neural networks.

<p>In the past decade, deep learning became the prevalent methodology for
predictive modeling thanks to the remarkable accuracy of deep neural networks
in tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing. Meanwhile,
the structure of neural networks converged back to simpler representations
based on piecewise constant and piecewise linear functions such as the
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which became the most commonly used type of
activation function in neural networks. That made certain types of network
structure $\unicode{x2014}$such as the typical fully-connected feedforward
neural network$\unicode{x2014}$ amenable to analysis through polyhedral theory
and to the application of methodologies such as Linear Programming (LP) and
Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for a variety of purposes. In this
paper, we survey the main topics emerging from this fast-paced area of work,
which bring a fresh perspective to understanding neural networks in more detail
as well as to applying linear optimization techniques to train, verify, and
reduce the size of such networks.

<p>In this work, we present MaxViT-UNet, an Encoder-Decoder based hybrid vision
transformer (CNN-Transformer) for medical image segmentation. The proposed
Hybrid Decoder, based on MaxViT-block, is designed to harness the power of both
the convolution and self-attention mechanisms at each decoding stage with a
nominal memory and computational burden. The inclusion of multi-axis
self-attention, within each decoder stage, significantly enhances the
discriminating capacity between the object and background regions, thereby
helping in improving the segmentation efficiency. In the Hybrid Decoder block,
the fusion process commences by integrating the upsampled lower-level decoder
features, obtained through transpose convolution, with the skip-connection
features derived from the hybrid encoder. Subsequently, the fused features
undergo refinement through the utilization of a multi-axis attention mechanism.
The proposed decoder block is repeated multiple times to progressively segment
the nuclei regions. Experimental results on MoNuSeg18 and MoNuSAC20 dataset
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Our MaxViT-UNet
outperformed the previous CNN-based (UNet) and Transformer-based (Swin-UNet)
techniques by a considerable margin on both of the standard datasets. The
following github (https://github.com/PRLAB21/MaxViT-UNet) contains the

<p>Despite tremendous progress in generating high-quality images using diffusion
models, synthesizing a sequence of animated frames that are both photorealistic
and temporally coherent is still in its infancy. While off-the-shelf
billion-scale datasets for image generation are available, collecting similar
video data of the same scale is still challenging. Also, training a video
diffusion model is computationally much more expensive than its image
counterpart. In this work, we explore finetuning a pretrained image diffusion
model with video data as a practical solution for the video synthesis task. We
find that naively extending the image noise prior to video noise prior in video
diffusion leads to sub-optimal performance. Our carefully designed video noise
prior leads to substantially better performance. Extensive experimental
validation shows that our model, Preserve Your Own Correlation (PYoCo), attains
SOTA zero-shot text-to-video results on the UCF-101 and MSR-VTT benchmarks. It
also achieves SOTA video generation quality on the small-scale UCF-101
benchmark with a $10\times$ smaller model using significantly less computation
than the prior art.

<p>Various probabilistic time series forecasting models have sprung up and shown
remarkably good performance. However, the choice of model highly relies on the
characteristics of the input time series and the fixed distribution that the
model is based on. Due to the fact that the probability distributions cannot be
averaged over different models straightforwardly, the current time series model
ensemble methods cannot be directly applied to improve the robustness and
accuracy of forecasting. To address this issue, we propose pTSE, a multi-model
distribution ensemble method for probabilistic forecasting based on Hidden
Markov Model (HMM). pTSE only takes off-the-shelf outputs from member models
without requiring further information about each model. Besides, we provide a
complete theoretical analysis of pTSE to prove that the empirical distribution
of time series subject to an HMM will converge to the stationary distribution
almost surely. Experiments on benchmarks show the superiority of pTSE overall
member models and competitive ensemble methods.

<p>Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) flows suffer from high computational costs in
large scale computations. In this paper, we show that MMD flows with Riesz
kernels $K(x,y) = - \Vert x-y\Vert^r$, $r \in (0,2)$ have exceptional
properties which allow their efficient computation. We prove that the MMD of
Riesz kernels coincides with the MMD of their sliced version. As a consequence,
the computation of gradients of MMDs can be performed in the one-dimensional
setting. Here, for $r=1$, a simple sorting algorithm can be applied to reduce
the complexity from $O(MN+N^2)$ to $O((M+N)\log(M+N))$ for two measures with
$M$ and $N$ support points. As another interesting follow-up result, the MMD of
compactly supported measures can be estimated from above and below by the
Wasserstein-1 distance. For the implementations we approximate the gradient of
the sliced MMD by using only a finite number $P$ of slices. We show that the
resulting error has complexity $O(\sqrt{d/P})$, where $d$ is the data
dimension. These results enable us to train generative models by approximating
MMD gradient flows by neural networks even for image applications. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our model by image generation on MNIST,
FashionMNIST and CIFAR10.

<p>Medical image data are often limited due to the expensive acquisition and
annotation process. Hence, training a deep-learning model with only raw data
can easily lead to overfitting. One solution to this problem is to augment the
raw data with various transformations, improving the model's ability to
generalize to new data. However, manually configuring a generic augmentation
combination and parameters for different datasets is non-trivial due to
inconsistent acquisition approaches and data distributions. Therefore,
automatic data augmentation is proposed to learn favorable augmentation
strategies for different datasets while incurring large GPU overhead. To this
end, we present a novel method, called Dynamic Data Augmentation (DDAug), which
is efficient and has negligible computation cost. Our DDAug develops a
hierarchical tree structure to represent various augmentations and utilizes an
efficient Monte-Carlo tree searching algorithm to update, prune, and sample the
tree. As a result, the augmentation pipeline can be optimized for each dataset
automatically. Experiments on multiple Prostate MRI datasets show that our
method outperforms the current state-of-the-art data augmentation strategies.

<p>Knowledge graphs are powerful tools for representing and organising complex
biomedical data. Several knowledge graph embedding algorithms have been
proposed to learn from and complete knowledge graphs. However, a recent study
demonstrates the limited efficacy of these embedding algorithms when applied to
biomedical knowledge graphs, raising the question of whether knowledge graph
embeddings have limitations in biomedical settings. This study aims to apply
state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding models in the context of a recent
biomedical knowledge graph, BioKG, and evaluate their performance and potential
downstream uses. We achieve a three-fold improvement in terms of performance
based on the HITS@10 score over previous work on the same biomedical knowledge
graph. Additionally, we provide interpretable predictions through a rule-based
method. We demonstrate that knowledge graph embedding models are applicable in
practice by evaluating the best-performing model on four tasks that represent
real-life polypharmacy situations. Results suggest that knowledge learnt from
large biomedical knowledge graphs can be transferred to such downstream use
cases. Our code is available at https://github.com/aryopg/biokge.

<p>Distance-based clustering and classification are widely used in various
fields to group mixed numeric and categorical data. In many algorithms, a
predefined distance measurement is used to cluster data points based on their
dissimilarity. While there exist numerous distance-based measures for data with
pure numerical attributes and several ordered and unordered categorical
metrics, an efficient and accurate distance for mixed-type data that utilizes
the continuous and discrete properties simulatenously is an open problem. Many
metrics convert numerical attributes to categorical ones or vice versa. They
handle the data points as a single attribute type or calculate a distance
between each attribute separately and add them up. We propose a metric called
KDSUM that uses mixed kernels to measure dissimilarity, with cross-validated
optimal bandwidth selection. We demonstrate that KDSUM is a shrinkage method
from existing mixed-type metrics to a uniform dissimilarity metric, and
improves clustering accuracy when utilized in existing distance-based
clustering algorithms on simulated and real-world datasets containing
continuous-only, categorical-only, and mixed-type data.

<p>Medical applications of machine learning (ML) have experienced a surge in
popularity in recent years. The intensive care unit (ICU) is a natural habitat
for ML given the abundance of available data from electronic health records.
Models have been proposed to address numerous ICU prediction tasks like the
early detection of complications. While authors frequently report
state-of-the-art performance, it is challenging to verify claims of
superiority. Datasets and code are not always published, and cohort
definitions, preprocessing pipelines, and training setups are difficult to
reproduce. This work introduces Yet Another ICU Benchmark (YAIB), a modular
framework that allows researchers to define reproducible and comparable
clinical ML experiments; we offer an end-to-end solution from cohort definition
to model evaluation. The framework natively supports most open-access ICU
datasets (MIMIC III/IV, eICU, HiRID, AUMCdb) and is easily adaptable to future
ICU datasets. Combined with a transparent preprocessing pipeline and extensible
training code for multiple ML and deep learning models, YAIB enables unified
model development. Our benchmark comes with five predefined established
prediction tasks (mortality, acute kidney injury, sepsis, kidney function, and
length of stay) developed in collaboration with clinicians. Adding further
tasks is straightforward by design. Using YAIB, we demonstrate that the choice
of dataset, cohort definition, and preprocessing have a major impact on the
prediction performance - often more so than model class - indicating an urgent
need for YAIB as a holistic benchmarking tool. We provide our work to the
clinical ML community to accelerate method development and enable real-world

<p>In reinforcement learning (RL), key components of many algorithms are the
exploration strategy and replay buffer. These strategies regulate what
environment data is collected and trained on and have been extensively studied
in the RL literature. In this paper, we investigate the impact of these
components in the context of generalisation in multi-task RL. We investigate
the hypothesis that collecting and training on more diverse data from the
training environments will improve zero-shot generalisation to new tasks. We
motivate mathematically and show empirically that generalisation to tasks that
are "reachable'' during training is improved by increasing the diversity of
transitions in the replay buffer. Furthermore, we show empirically that this
same strategy also shows improvement for generalisation to similar but
"unreachable'' tasks which could be due to improved generalisation of the
learned latent representations.

<p>In classification and forecasting with tabular data, one often utilizes
tree-based models. Those can be competitive with deep neural networks on
tabular data [cf. Grinsztajn et al., NeurIPS 2022, <a href="/abs/2207.08815">arXiv:2207.08815</a>] and, under
some conditions, explainable. The explainability depends on the depth of the
tree and the accuracy in each leaf of the tree. Decision trees containing
leaves with unbalanced accuracy can provide misleading explanations.
Low-accuracy leaves give less valid explanations, which could be interpreted as
unfairness among explanations. Here, we train a shallow tree with the objective
of minimizing the maximum misclassification error across each leaf node. Then,
we extend each leaf with a separate tree-based model. The shallow tree provides
a global explanation, while the overall statistical performance of the shallow
tree with extended leaves improves upon decision trees of unlimited depth
trained using classical methods (e.g., CART) and is comparable to
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., well-tuned XGBoost).

<p>Personalized prediction is a machine learning approach that predicts a
person's future observations based on their past labeled observations and is
typically used for sequential tasks, e.g., to predict daily mood ratings. When
making personalized predictions, a model can combine two types of trends: (a)
trends shared across people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happier
on weekends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specific
trends, such as a stressful weekly meeting. Mixed effect models are popular
statistical models to study both trends by combining person-generic and
person-specific parameters. Though linear mixed effect models are gaining
popularity in machine learning by integrating them with neural networks, these
integrations are currently limited to linear person-specific parameters: ruling
out nonlinear person-specific trends. In this paper, we propose Neural Mixed
Effect (NME) models to optimize nonlinear person-specific parameters anywhere
in a neural network in a scalable manner. NME combines the efficiency of neural
network optimization with nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Empirically, we
observe that NME improves performance across six unimodal and multimodal
datasets, including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and a
mother-adolescent dataset to predict affective state sequences where half the
mothers experience at least moderate symptoms of depression. Furthermore, we
evaluate NME for two model architectures, including for neural conditional
random fields (CRF) to predict affective state sequences where the CRF learns
nonlinear person-specific temporal transitions between affective states.
Analysis of these person-specific transitions on the mother-adolescent dataset
shows interpretable trends related to the mother's depression symptoms.

<p>Partitioning a polygonal mesh into meaningful parts can be challenging. Many
applications require decomposing such structures for further processing in
computer graphics. In the last decade, several methods were proposed to tackle
this problem, at the cost of intensive computational times. Recently, machine
learning has proven to be effective for the segmentation task on 3D structures.
Nevertheless, these state-of-the-art methods are often hardly generalizable and
require dividing the learned model into several specific classes of objects to
avoid overfitting. We present a data-driven approach leveraging deep learning
to encode a mapping function prior to mesh segmentation for multiple
applications. Our network reproduces a neighborhood map using our knowledge of
the \textsl{Shape Diameter Function} (SDF) method using similarities among
vertex neighborhoods. Our approach is resolution-agnostic as we downsample the
input meshes and query the full-resolution structure solely for neighborhood
contributions. Using our predicted SDF values, we can inject the resulting
structure into a graph-cut algorithm to generate an efficient and robust mesh
segmentation while considerably reducing the required computation times.

needed for one spike to travel from one neuron to another. These delays matter
because they influence the spike arrival times, and it is well-known that
spiking neurons respond more strongly to coincident input spikes. More
formally, it has been shown theoretically that plastic delays greatly increase
the expressivity in SNNs. Yet, efficient algorithms to learn these delays have
been lacking. Here, we propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses
this issue in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation, in an offline
manner. To simulate delays between consecutive layers, we use 1D convolutions
across time. The kernels contain only a few non-zero weights - one per synapse
- whose positions correspond to the delays. These positions are learned
together with the weights using the recently proposed Dilated Convolution with
Learnable Spacings (DCLS). We evaluated our method on three datasets: the
Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) and its
non-spiking version Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) benchmarks, which
require detecting temporal patterns. We used feedforward SNNs with two or three
hidden fully connected layers, and vanilla leaky integrate-and fire neurons. We
showed that fixed random delays help and that learning them helps even more.
Furthermore, our method outperformed the state-of-the-art in the three datasets
without using recurrent connections and with substantially fewer parameters.
Our work demonstrates the potential of delay learning in developing accurate
and precise models for temporal data processing. Our code is based on PyTorch /

<p>The advent of novel 5G services and applications with binding latency
requirements and guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) hastened the need to
incorporate autonomous and proactive decision-making in network management
procedures. The objective of our study is to provide a thorough analysis of
predictive latency within 5G networks by utilizing real-world network data that
is accessible to mobile network operators (MNOs). In particular, (i) we present
an analytical formulation of the user-plane latency as a Hypoexponential

empirical measurements, and (ii) we conduct experimental results of
probabilistic regression, anomaly detection, and predictive forecasting
leveraging on emerging domains in Machine Learning (ML), such as Bayesian

<p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods leverage previous experiences to
learn better policies than the behavior policy used for data collection. In
contrast to behavior cloning, which assumes the data is collected from expert
demonstrations, offline RL can work with non-expert data and multimodal
behavior policies. However, offline RL algorithms face challenges in handling
distribution shifts and effectively representing policies due to the lack of
online interaction during training. Prior work on offline RL uses conditional
diffusion models to represent multimodal behavior in the dataset. Nevertheless,
these methods are not tailored toward alleviating the out-of-distribution state
generalization. We introduce a novel method, named State Reconstruction for
Diffusion Policies (SRDP), incorporating state reconstruction feature learning
in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the out-of-distribution
generalization problem. State reconstruction loss promotes more descriptive
representation learning of states to alleviate the distribution shift incurred
by the out-of-distribution (OOD) states. We design a novel 2D Multimodal
Contextual Bandit environment to illustrate the OOD generalization of SRDP
compared to prior algorithms. In addition, we assess the performance of our
model on D4RL continuous control benchmarks, namely the navigation of an 8-DoF
ant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

modalities remains a challenge. To address this, we propose DNAGPT, a
generalized DNA pre-training model trained on over 200 billion base pairs from

versatile DNA analysis tasks while processing both sequence and numerical data.
Our evaluation of genomic signal and region recognition, mRNA abundance

<p>In this paper we consider online distributed learning problems. Online
distributed learning refers to the process of training learning models on
distributed data sources. In our setting a set of agents need to cooperatively
train a learning model from streaming data. Differently from federated
learning, the proposed approach does not rely on a central server but only on
peer-to-peer communications among the agents. This approach is often used in
scenarios where data cannot be moved to a centralized location due to privacy,
security, or cost reasons. In order to overcome the absence of a central
server, we propose a distributed algorithm that relies on a quantized,
finite-time coordination protocol to aggregate the locally trained models.
Furthermore, our algorithm allows for the use of stochastic gradients during
local training. Stochastic gradients are computed using a randomly sampled
subset of the local training data, which makes the proposed algorithm more
efficient and scalable than traditional gradient descent. In our paper, we
analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the mean distance
from the online solution. Finally, we present numerical results for a logistic
regression task.

<p>Adversarial examples (AEs) for DNNs have been shown to be transferable: AEs
that successfully fool white-box surrogate models can also deceive other
black-box models with different architectures. Although a bunch of empirical
studies have provided guidance on generating highly transferable AEs, many of
these findings lack explanations and even lead to inconsistent advice. In this
paper, we take a further step towards understanding adversarial
transferability, with a particular focus on surrogate aspects. Starting from
the intriguing little robustness phenomenon, where models adversarially trained
with mildly perturbed adversarial samples can serve as better surrogates, we
attribute it to a trade-off between two predominant factors: model smoothness
and gradient similarity. Our investigations focus on their joint effects,
rather than their separate correlations with transferability. Through a series
of theoretical and empirical analyses, we conjecture that the data distribution
shift in adversarial training explains the degradation of gradient similarity.
Building on these insights, we explore the impacts of data augmentation and
gradient regularization on transferability and identify that the trade-off
generally exists in the various training mechanisms, thus building a
comprehensive blueprint for the regulation mechanism behind transferability.
Finally, we provide a general route for constructing better surrogates to boost
transferability which optimizes both model smoothness and gradient similarity
simultaneously, e.g., the combination of input gradient regularization and
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), validated by extensive experiments. In
summary, we call for attention to the united impacts of these two factors for
launching effective transfer attacks, rather than optimizing one while ignoring
the other, and emphasize the crucial role of manipulating surrogate models.

<p>We present the Multi-Modal Discussion Transformer (mDT), a novel multi-modal
graph-based transformer model for detecting hate speech in online social
networks, such as Reddit discussions. In contrast to traditional comment-only
methods, our approach to labelling a comment as hate speech involves a holistic
analysis of text and images grounded in the discussion context. This is done by
leveraging graph transformers to capture the contextual relationships in the
entire discussion surrounding a comment and grounding the interwoven fusion
layers that combine individual comments' text and image embeddings instead of
processing modalities separately. We compare the performance of our model to
baselines that only process individual comments and conduct extensive ablation
studies. To evaluate our work, we present a new dataset, HatefulDiscussions,
comprising complete multi-modal discussions from multiple online communities on
Reddit. We conclude with future work for multimodal solutions to deliver social
value in online contexts, arguing that capturing a holistic view of a
conversation significantly advances the effort to detect anti-social behaviour.

<p>The Fourier neural operator (FNO) is a powerful technique for learning
surrogate maps for partial differential equation (PDE) solution operators. For
many real-world applications, which often require high-resolution data points,
training time and memory usage are significant bottlenecks. While there are
mixed-precision training techniques for standard neural networks, those work
for real-valued datatypes on finite dimensions and therefore cannot be directly
applied to FNO, which crucially operates in the (complex-valued) Fourier domain
and in function spaces. On the other hand, since the Fourier transform is
already an approximation (due to discretization error), we do not need to
perform the operation at full precision. In this work, we (i) profile memory
and runtime for FNO with full and mixed-precision training, (ii) conduct a
study on the numerical stability of mixed-precision training of FNO, and (iii)
devise a training routine which substantially decreases training time and
memory usage (up to 34%), with little or no reduction in accuracy, on the
Navier-Stokes and Darcy flow equations. Combined with the recently proposed
tensorized FNO (Kossaifi et al., 2023), the resulting model has far better
performance while also being significantly faster than the original FNO.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automated program
reasoning, a crucial aspect of many security tasks. However, existing LLM
architectures for code are often borrowed from other domains like natural
language processing, raising concerns about their generalization and robustness
to unseen code. A key generalization challenge is to incorporate the knowledge
of code semantics, including control and data flow, into the LLM architectures.
</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from examples of convolution layers exploiting
translation symmetry, we explore how code symmetries can enhance LLM
architectures for program analysis and modeling. We present a rigorous
group-theoretic framework that formally defines code symmetries as
semantics-preserving transformations and provides techniques for precisely
reasoning about symmetry preservation within LLM architectures. Using this
framework, we introduce a novel variant of self-attention that preserves
program symmetries, demonstrating its effectiveness in generalization and
robustness through detailed experimental evaluations across different binary

penalizes the found PDE not only by its complexity but also the quantified
uncertainty, derived from the model supports' coefficient of variation in a
probabilistic view. We also introduce physics-informed neural network learning
as a simulation-based approach to further validate the selected PDE flexibly
against the other discovered PDE. Numerical results affirm the successful
application of the UBIC in identifying the true governing PDE. Additionally, we
reveal an interesting effect of denoising the observed data on improving the

<p>Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) has received increasing attention
from researchers due to its wide range of applications.As conversation has a
natural graph structure,numerous approaches used to model ERC based on graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) have yielded significant results.However,the
aggregation approach of traditional GCNs suffers from the node information
redundancy problem,leading to node discriminant information
loss.Additionally,single-layer GCNs lack the capacity to capture long-range
contextual information from the graph. Furthermore,the majority of approaches
are based on textual modality or stitching together different modalities,
resulting in a weak ability to capture interactions between modalities. To
address these problems, we present the relational bilevel aggregation graph
convolutional network (RBA-GCN), which consists of three modules: the graph
generation module (GGM), similarity-based cluster building module (SCBM) and
bilevel aggregation module (BiAM). First, GGM constructs a novel graph to
reduce the redundancy of target node information.Then,SCBM calculates the node
similarity in the target node and its structural neighborhood, where noisy
information with low similarity is filtered out to preserve the discriminant
information of the node. Meanwhile, BiAM is a novel aggregation method that can
preserve the information of nodes during the aggregation process. This module
can construct the interaction between different modalities and capture
long-range contextual information based on similarity clusters. On both the
IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, the weighted average F1 score of RBA-GCN has a
2.17$\sim$5.21\% improvement over that of the most advanced method.Our code is

<p>Neural force fields (NFFs) have gained prominence in computational chemistry
as surrogate models, superseding quantum-chemistry calculations in ab initio
molecular dynamics. The prevalent benchmark for NFFs has been the MD17 dataset
and its subsequent extension. These datasets predominantly comprise geometries
from the equilibrium region of the ground electronic state potential energy
surface, sampling from direct adiabatic dynamics. However, many chemical
reactions entail significant molecular deformations, notably bond breaking. We
demonstrate the constrained distribution of internal coordinates and energies
in the MD17 datasets, underscoring their inadequacy for representing systems
undergoing chemical reactions. Addressing this sampling limitation, we
introduce the xxMD (Extended Excited-state Molecular Dynamics) dataset, derived
from non-adiabatic dynamics. This dataset encompasses energies and forces
ascertained from both multireference wave function theory and density
functional theory. Furthermore, its nuclear configuration spaces authentically
depict chemical reactions, making xxMD a more chemically relevant dataset. Our

involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are
not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph
structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the
data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail
to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or
learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a
large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for
training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this
gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to
infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as
supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are
highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this
prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node
features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised
inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via
solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn
meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing
hypergraph structure inference methods.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14388">Biclustering Methods via Sparse Penalty. (arXiv:2308.14388v2 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/stat/1/au:+Wang_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jiqiang Wang</a></p>
<p>In this paper, we first reviewed several biclustering methods that are used
to identify the most significant clusters in gene expression data. Here we
mainly focused on the SSVD(sparse SVD) method and tried a new sparse penalty
named "Prenet penalty" which has been used only in factor analysis to gain
sparsity. Then in the simulation study, we tried different types of generated
datasets (with different sparsity and dimension) and tried 1-layer
approximation then for k-layers which shows the mixed Prenet penalty is very
effective for non-overlapped data. Finally, we used some real gene expression
data to show the behavior of our methods.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15370">Multi-Response Heteroscedastic Gaussian Process Models and Their Inference. (arXiv:2308.15370v2 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/stat/1/au:+Lee_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Taehee Lee</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/stat/1/au:+Liu_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jun S. Liu</a></p>
<p>Despite the widespread utilization of Gaussian process models for versatile
nonparametric modeling, they exhibit limitations in effectively capturing
abrupt changes in function smoothness and accommodating relationships with
heteroscedastic errors. Addressing these shortcomings, the heteroscedastic
Gaussian process (HeGP) regression seeks to introduce flexibility by
acknowledging the variability of residual variances across covariates in the
regression model. In this work, we extend the HeGP concept, expanding its scope
beyond regression tasks to encompass classification and state-space models. To
achieve this, we propose a novel framework where the Gaussian process is
coupled with a covariate-induced precision matrix process, adopting a mixture
formulation. This approach enables the modeling of heteroscedastic covariance
functions across covariates. To mitigate the computational challenges posed by
sampling, we employ variational inference to approximate the posterior and
facilitate posterior predictive modeling. Additionally, our training process
leverages an EM algorithm featuring closed-form M-step updates to efficiently
evaluate the heteroscedastic covariance function. A notable feature of our
model is its consistent performance on multivariate responses, accommodating
various types (continuous or categorical) seamlessly. Through a combination of
simulations and real-world applications in climatology, we illustrate the
model's prowess and advantages. By overcoming the limitations of traditional
Gaussian process models, our proposed framework offers a robust and versatile
tool for a wide array of applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Ban_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">Byunghyun Ban</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Ryu_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Donghun Ryu</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Hwang_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Su-won Hwang</a></p>
<p>We present 'CongNaMul', a comprehensive dataset designed for various tasks in
soybean sprouts image analysis. The CongNaMul dataset is curated to facilitate
tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, decomposition, and
measurement of length and weight. The classification task provides four classes
to determine the quality of soybean sprouts: normal, broken, spotted, and
broken and spotted, for the development of AI-aided automatic quality
inspection technology. For semantic segmentation, images with varying
complexity, from single sprout images to images with multiple sprouts, along
with human-labelled mask images, are included. The label has 4 different
classes: background, head, body, tail. The dataset also provides images and
masks for the image decomposition task, including two separate sprout images
and their combined form. Lastly, 5 physical features of sprouts (head length,
body length, body thickness, tail length, weight) are provided for image-based
measurement tasks. This dataset is expected to be a valuable resource for a
wide range of research and applications in the advanced analysis of images of
soybean sprouts. Also, we hope that this dataset can assist researchers
studying classification, semantic segmentation, decomposition, and physical
feature measurement in other industrial fields, in evaluating their models. The
dataset is available at the authors' repository. (https://bhban.kr/data)

<p>We present MedShapeNet, a large collection of anatomical shapes (e.g., bones,
organs, vessels) and 3D surgical instrument models. Prior to the deep learning
era, the broad application of statistical shape models (SSMs) in medical image
analysis is evidence that shapes have been commonly used to describe medical
data. Nowadays, however, state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms in
medical imaging are predominantly voxel-based. In computer vision, on the
contrary, shapes (including, voxel occupancy grids, meshes, point clouds and
implicit surface models) are preferred data representations in 3D, as seen from
the numerous shape-related publications in premier vision conferences, such as
the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), as
well as the increasing popularity of ShapeNet (about 51,300 models) and
Princeton ModelNet (127,915 models) in computer vision research. MedShapeNet is
created as an alternative to these commonly used shape benchmarks to facilitate
the translation of data-driven vision algorithms to medical applications, and
it extends the opportunities to adapt SOTA vision algorithms to solve critical
medical problems. Besides, the majority of the medical shapes in MedShapeNet
are modeled directly on the imaging data of real patients, and therefore it
complements well existing shape benchmarks comprising of computer-aided design
(CAD) models. MedShapeNet currently includes more than 100,000 medical shapes,
and provides annotations in the form of paired data. It is therefore also a
freely available repository of 3D models for extended reality (virtual reality
- VR, augmented reality - AR, mixed reality - MR) and medical 3D printing. This
white paper describes in detail the motivations behind MedShapeNet, the shape
acquisition procedures, the use cases, as well as the usage of the online shape
search portal: https://medshapenet.ikim.nrw/
