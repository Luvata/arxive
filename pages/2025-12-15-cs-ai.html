<p><b>Authors:</b> Akhil S Anand, Elias Aarekol, Martin Mziray Dalseg, Magnus Stalhane, Sebastien Gros</p>
<p>Abstract: Combinatorial sequential decision making problems are typically modeled as mixed integer linear programs (MILPs) and solved via branch and bound (B&B) algorithms. The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL. We validate the CORL method in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11187">Deep Learning--Accelerated Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search for Real-time Freight Bundling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohui Zhang, Wouter van Heeswijk, Xinyu Hu, Neil Yorke-Smith, Martijn Mes</p>
<p>Abstract: Online Freight Exchange Systems (OFEX) play a crucial role in modern freight logistics by facilitating real-time matching between shippers and carrier. However, efficient combinatorial bundling of transporation jobs remains a bottleneck. We model the OFEX combinatorial bundling problem as a multi-commodity one-to-one pickup-and-delivery selective traveling salesperson problem (m1-PDSTSP), which optimizes revenue-driven freight bundling under capacity, precedence, and route-length constraints. The key challenge is to couple combinatorial bundle selection with pickup-and-delivery routing under sub-second latency. We propose a learning--accelerated hybrid search pipeline that pairs a Transformer Neural Network-based constructive policy with an innovative Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search (MSLNS) metaheuristic within a rolling-horizon scheme in which the platform repeatedly freezes the current marketplace into a static snapshot and solves it under a short time budget. This pairing leverages the low-latency, high-quality inference of the learning-based constructor alongside the robustness of improvement search; the multi-start design and plausible seeds help LNS to explore the solution space more efficiently. Across benchmarks, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural combinatorial optimization and metaheuristic baselines in solution quality with comparable time, achieving an optimality gap of less than 2\% in total revenue relative to the best available exact baseline method. To our knowledge, this is the first work to establish that a Deep Neural Network-based constructor can reliably provide high-quality seeds for (multi-start) improvement heuristics, with applicability beyond the \textit{m1-PDSTSP} to a broad class of selective traveling salesperson problems and pickup and delivery problems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11213">FutureWeaver: Planning Test-Time Compute for Multi-Agent Systems with Modularized Collaboration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwon Jung, Peng Shi, Yi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves large language model performance without additional training. Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11270">A-LAMP: Agentic LLM-Based Framework for Automated MDP Modeling and Policy Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Je-Gal, Chan-Bin Yi, Hyun-Suk Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world tasks requires converting informal descriptions into a formal Markov decision process (MDP), implementing an executable environment, and training a policy agent. Automating this process is challenging due to modeling errors, fragile code, and misaligned objectives, which often impede policy training. We introduce an agentic large language model (LLM)-based framework for automated MDP modeling and policy generation (A-LAMP), that automatically translates free-form natural language task descriptions into an MDP formulation and trained policy. The framework decomposes modeling, coding, and training into verifiable stages, ensuring semantic alignment throughout the pipeline. Across both classic control and custom RL domains, A-LAMP consistently achieves higher policy generation capability than a single state-of-the-art LLM model. Notably, even its lightweight variant, which is built on smaller language models, approaches the performance of much larger models. Failure analysis reveals why these improvements occur. In addition, a case study also demonstrates that A-LAMP generates environments and policies that preserve the task's optimality, confirming its correctness and reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxing Chen, Basem Suleiman, Qifan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world trip planning requires transforming open-ended user requests into executable itineraries under strict spatial, temporal, and budgetary constraints while aligning with user preferences. Existing LLM-based agents struggle with constraint satisfaction, tool coordination, and efficiency, often producing infeasible or costly plans. To address these limitations, we present TriFlow, a progressive multi-agent framework that unifies structured reasoning and language-based flexibility through a three-stage pipeline of retrieval, planning, and governance. By this design, TriFlow progressively narrows the search space, assembles constraint-consistent itineraries via rule-LLM collaboration, and performs bounded iterative refinement to ensure global feasibility and personalisation. Evaluations on TravelPlanner and TripTailor benchmarks demonstrated state-of-the-art results, achieving 91.1% and 97% final pass rates, respectively, with over 10x runtime efficiency improvement compared to current SOTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyi Zhang, Ziyin Zhou, Xu Ji, Shizhao Liu, Zhangchi Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Benefiting from strong and efficient multi-modal alignment strategies, Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) are able to simulate human visual and reasoning capabilities, such as solving CAPTCHAs. However, existing benchmarks based on visual CAPTCHAs still face limitations. Previous studies, when designing benchmarks and datasets, customized them according to their research objectives. Consequently, these benchmarks cannot comprehensively cover all CAPTCHA types. Notably, there is a dearth of dedicated benchmarks for LVLMs. To address this problem, we introduce a novel CAPTCHA benchmark for the first time, named CAPTURE CAPTCHA for Testing Under Real-world Experiments, specifically for LVLMs. Our benchmark encompasses 4 main CAPTCHA types and 25 sub-types from 31 vendors. The diversity enables a multi-dimensional and thorough evaluation of LVLM performance. CAPTURE features extensive class variety, large-scale data, and unique LVLM-tailored labels, filling the gaps in previous research in terms of data comprehensiveness and labeling pertinence. When evaluated by this benchmark, current LVLMs demonstrate poor performance in solving CAPTCHAs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11421">Towards Trustworthy Multi-Turn LLM Agents via Behavioral Guidance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gonca G\"ursun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong reasoning and generation abilities, yet their behavior in multi-turn tasks often lacks reliability and verifiability. We present a task completion framework that enables LLM-based agents to act under explicit behavioral guidance in environments described by reinforcement learning formalisms with defined observation, action, and reward signals.
  The framework integrates three components: a lightweight task profiler that selects reasoning and generation strategies, a reasoning module that learns verifiable observation - action mappings, and a generation module that enforces constraint-compliant outputs through validation or deterministic synthesis. We show that as the agent interacts with the environment, these components co-evolve, yielding trustworthy behavior.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11426">AgentBalance: Backbone-then-Topology Design for Cost-Effective Multi-Agent Systems under Budget Constraints</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuowei Cai, Yansong Ning, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) are becoming indispensable building blocks for web-scale applications such as web search, social network analytics, and online customer support, where cost-effectiveness is increasingly the primary constraint for large-scale deployment. While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11433">Back to the Baseline: Examining Baseline Effects on Explainability Metrics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Agustin Martin Picard (ANITI), Thibaut Boissin (ANITI), Varshini Subhash (SU), R\'emi Cad\`ene (SU), Thomas Fel (ANITI)</p>
<p>Abstract: Attribution methods are among the most prevalent techniques in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and are usually evaluated and compared using Fidelity metrics, with Insertion and Deletion being the most popular. These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

<p>Abstract: We introduce Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning, a 12.7B parameter language model designed to bridge the gap between open-weight systems and proprietary frontier models in complex reasoning and long-context understanding. Addressing the common challenges of model collapse and training instability in reasoning adaptation, we propose a comprehensive, reproducible training recipe spanning system, data, and algorithmic optimizations. Our approach combines memory-efficient infrastructure for 64K-token contexts using hybrid parallelism and kernel-level optimizations with a two-stage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that mitigates distribution mismatch through verified, aligned synthetic data. Furthermore, we detail a robust Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) pipeline that stabilizes training via difficulty-aware data filtering and mixed-policy trajectory reuse. Empirical results demonstrate that Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning achieves performance comparable to models with significantly larger parameter counts across mathematics, coding, and agentic benchmarks, offering the community a competitive open model and a practical blueprint for scaling reasoning capabilities under realistic compute constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Ramanathan, Thomas Prellberg, Matthew Lewis, Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi, Raj Abhijit Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat</p>
<p>Abstract: The No-Three-In-Line problem asks for the maximum number of points that can be placed on an n by n grid with no three collinear, representing a famous problem in combinatorial geometry. While classical methods like Integer Linear Programming (ILP) guarantee optimal solutions, they face exponential scaling with grid size, and recent advances in machine learning offer promising alternatives for pattern-based approximation. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations. These results demonstrate that classical optimization remains essential for exact solutions while AI methods offer competitive performance on smaller instances, with hybrid approaches presenting the most promising direction for scaling to larger problem sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kris A. G. Wyckhuys</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential for democratizing scientific knowledge and converting this to clear, actionable information, yet its application in agri-food science remains unexplored. Here, we verify the scientific knowledge on agroecological crop protection that is generated by either web-grounded or non-grounded large language models (LLMs), i.e., DeepSeek versus the free-tier version of ChatGPT. For nine globally limiting pests, weeds, and plant diseases, we assessed the factual accuracy, data consistency, and breadth of knowledge or data completeness of each LLM. Overall, DeepSeek consistently screened a 4.8-49.7-fold larger literature corpus and reported 1.6-2.4-fold more biological control agents or management solutions than ChatGPT. As a result, DeepSeek reported 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, exhibited greater laboratory-to-field data consistency, and showed more realistic effects of pest identity and management tactics. However, both models hallucinated, i.e., fabricated fictitious agents or references, reported on implausible ecological interactions or outcomes, confused old and new scientific nomenclatures, and omitted data on key agents or solutions. Despite these shortcomings, both LLMs correctly reported low-resolution efficacy trends. Overall, when paired with rigorous human oversight, LLMs may pose a powerful tool to support farm-level decision-making and unleash scientific creativity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyam Basu, Yunfeng Zhang, Vipul Raheja</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have recently gained adoption in educational and professional contexts. Prior research has uncovered isolated cases of bias, particularly against English Language Learners (ELLs) however, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of such systems across broader sociolinguistic factors. In this work, we propose BAID, a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI detectors across various types of biases. As a part of the framework, we introduce over 200k samples spanning 7 major categories: demographics, age, educational grade level, dialect, formality, political leaning, and topic. We also generated synthetic versions of each sample with carefully crafted prompts to preserve the original content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Using this, we evaluate four open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors and find consistent disparities in detection performance, particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups. Our contributions provide a scalable, transparent approach for auditing AI detectors and emphasize the need for bias-aware evaluation before these tools are deployed for public use.</p>

<p>Abstract: As AI and web agents become pervasive in decision-making, it is critical to design intelligent systems that not only support sustainability efforts but also guard against misinformation. Greenwashing, i.e., misleading corporate sustainability claims, poses a major challenge to environmental progress. To address this challenge, we introduce EmeraldMind, a fact-centric framework integrating a domain-specific knowledge graph with retrieval-augmented generation to automate greenwashing detection. EmeraldMind builds the EmeraldGraph from diverse corporate ESG (environmental, social, and governance) reports, surfacing verifiable evidence, often missing in generic knowledge bases, and supporting large language models in claim assessment. The framework delivers justification-centric classifications, presenting transparent, evidence-backed verdicts and abstaining responsibly when claims cannot be verified. Experiments on a new greenwashing claims dataset demonstrate that EmeraldMind achieves competitive accuracy, greater coverage, and superior explanation quality compared to generic LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or retraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Shen, Xiaojun Wu, Linghua Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aims to simulate real-world clinical scenarios to systematically evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract core medical information from patient chief complaints laden with noise and redundancy, and to verify whether they exhibit a functional decline analogous to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). We employed a cross-sectional analysis design based on standardized medical probes, selecting four mainstream LLMs as research subjects: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max. An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment. All probes had gold-standard answers defined by clinical experts and were assessed via a double-blind, inverse rating scale by two independent clinicians. The results show that all tested models exhibited functional defects to varying degrees, with Qwen3-Max demonstrating the best overall performance and Gemini 2.5 the worst. Under conditions of extreme noise, most models experienced a functional collapse. Notably, GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in the risk assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This research is the first to empirically confirm that LLMs exhibit features resembling metabolic dysfunction when processing clinical information, proposing the innovative concept of "AI-Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (AI-MASLD)". These findings offer a crucial safety warning for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, emphasizing that current LLMs must be used as auxiliary tools under human expert supervision, as there remains a significant gap between their theoretical knowledge and practical clinical application.</p>

<p>Abstract: Benchmarks are a cornerstone of modern machine learning, enabling reproducibility, comparison, and scientific progress. However, AI benchmarks are increasingly complex, requiring dynamic, AI-focused workflows. Rapid evolution in model architectures, scale, datasets, and deployment contexts makes evaluation a moving target. Large language models often memorize static benchmarks, causing a gap between benchmark results and real-world performance.
  Beyond traditional static benchmarks, continuous adaptive benchmarking frameworks are needed to align scientific assessment with deployment risks. This calls for skills and education in AI Benchmark Carpentry. From our experience with MLCommons, educational initiatives, and programs like the DOE's Trillion Parameter Consortium, key barriers include high resource demands, limited access to specialized hardware, lack of benchmark design expertise, and uncertainty in relating results to application domains. Current benchmarks often emphasize peak performance on top-tier hardware, offering limited guidance for diverse, real-world scenarios.
  Benchmarking must become dynamic, incorporating evolving models, updated data, and heterogeneous platforms while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability. Democratization requires both technical innovation and systematic education across levels, building sustained expertise in benchmark design and use. Benchmarks should support application-relevant comparisons, enabling informed, context-sensitive decisions. Dynamic, inclusive benchmarking will ensure evaluation keeps pace with AI evolution and supports responsible, reproducible, and accessible AI deployment. Community efforts can provide a foundation for AI Benchmark Carpentry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chutian Ma, Grigorii Pomazkin, Giacinto Paolo Saggese, Paul Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: Energy demand prediction is critical for grid operators, industrial energy
  consumers, and service providers. Energy demand is influenced by multiple
  factors, including weather conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
  speed, solar radiation), and calendar information (e.g. hour of day and
  month of year), which further affect daily work and life schedules. These
  factors are causally interdependent, making the problem more complex than
  simple correlation-based learning techniques satisfactorily allow for. We
  propose a structural causal model that explains the causal relationship
  between these variables. A full analysis is performed to validate our causal
  beliefs, also revealing important insights consistent with prior studies.
  For example, our causal model reveals that energy demand responds to
  temperature fluctuations with season-dependent sensitivity. Additionally, we
  find that energy demand exhibits lower variance in winter due to the
  decoupling effect between temperature changes and daily activity patterns.
  We then build a Bayesian model, which takes advantage of the causal insights
  we learned as prior knowledge. The model is trained and tested on unseen
  data and yields state-of-the-art performance in the form of a 3.84 percent MAPE on
  the test set. The model also demonstrates strong robustness, as the
  cross-validation across two years of data yields an average MAPE of 3.88 percent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Cofala, Christian Kalfar, Jingge Xiao, Johanna Schrader, Michelle Tang, Wolfgang Nejdl</p>
<p>Abstract: Therapeutic decision-making in clinical medicine constitutes a high-stakes domain in which AI guidance interacts with complex interactions among patient characteristics, disease processes, and pharmacological agents. Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ethan Obie Romero-Severson, Tara Harvey, Nick Generous, Phillip M. Mach</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how AI systems are used by people in real situations that mirror aspects of both legitimate and illegitimate use is key to predicting the risks and benefits of AI systems. This is especially true in biological applications, where skill rather than knowledge is often the primary barrier for an untrained person. The challenge is that these studies are difficult to execute well and can take months to plan and run.
  Here we report the results of a pilot study that attempted to empirically measure the magnitude of \emph{skills-based uplift} caused by access to an AI reasoning model, compared with a control group that had only internet access. Participants -- drawn from a diverse pool of Los Alamos National Laboratory employees with no prior wet-lab experience -- were asked to transform \ecoli{} with a provided expression construct, induce expression of a reporter peptide, and have expression confirmed by mass spectrometry.
  We recorded quantitative outcomes (e.g., successful completion of experimental segments) and qualitative observations about how participants interacted with the AI system, the internet, laboratory equipment, and one another. We present the results of the study and lessons learned in designing and executing this type of study, and we discuss these results in the context of future studies of the evolving relationship between AI and global biosecurity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao An</p>
<p>Abstract: Through extensive experience training professionals and individual users in AI tool adoption since the GPT-3 era, I have observed a consistent pattern: the same AI tool produces dramatically different results depending on who uses it. While some frame AI as a replacement for human intelligence, and others warn of cognitive decline, this position paper argues for a third perspective grounded in practical observation: AI as a cognitive amplifier that magnifies existing human capabilities rather than substituting for them. Drawing on research in human-computer interaction, cognitive augmentation theory, and educational technology, alongside field observations from corporate training across writing, software development, and data analysis domains, I present a framework positioning AI tools as intelligence amplification systems where output quality depends fundamentally on user expertise and judgment. Through analysis of empirical studies on expert-novice differences and systematic observations from professional training contexts, I demonstrate that domain knowledge, quality judgment, and iterative refinement capabilities create substantial performance gaps between users. I propose a three-level model of AI engagement -- from passive acceptance through iterative collaboration to cognitive direction -- and argue that the transition between levels requires not technical training but development of domain expertise and metacognitive skills. This position has critical implications for workforce development and AI system design. Rather than focusing solely on AI literacy or technical prompt engineering, I advocate for integrated approaches that strengthen domain expertise, evaluative judgment, and reflective practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei He, Pranit Chawla, Yaser Souri, Subhojit Som, Xia Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer use agents (CUAs) can operate real-world digital interfaces but remain difficult to train due to the high cost of graphical user interface (GUI) interaction and the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. Existing datasets rely on human demonstrations, limiting scalability. A natural alternative is to synthesize data from strong CUAs, yet their rollouts are highly noisy, with incorrect or suboptimal actions consisting a large proportion of the steps, making naive imitation ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning. Using this pipeline, we construct WebSTAR, a dataset of 13.3K trajectories and 100K graded, reasoning-rich steps synthesized from OpenAI's computer-use-preview model. We train Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct models (7B and 32B) on WebSTAR. On WebVoyager, our 7B model surpasses SoTA open-source CUA model UI-TARS-1.5-7B by more than 15% with only supervised finetuning. Building on step-level grading, we further create WebSCORE, a dataset of graded step-level actions, and train StepRM, a 7B multimodal reward model distilled from o4-mini, which matches its grading quality while being far more efficient to deploy at scale. Our results establish step-level filtering as a key principle for scalable CUA training and construct two new datasets (WebSTAR, WebSCORE) and a lightweight reward model (StepRM) as practical tools to advance robust and efficient CUAs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheqi Hu, Xuanjing Chen, Jinlin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of AI-generated content (AIGC) across domains such as music, video, and literature, the demand for emotionally aware recommendation systems has become increasingly important. Traditional recommender systems primarily rely on user behavioral data such as clicks, views, or ratings, while neglecting users' real-time emotional and intentional states during content interaction. To address this limitation, this study proposes a Multi-Modal Emotion and Intent Recognition Model (MMEI) based on a BERT-based Cross-Modal Transformer with Attention-Based Fusion, integrated into a cloud-native personalized AIGC recommendation framework. The proposed system jointly processes visual (facial expression), auditory (speech tone), and textual (comments or utterances) modalities through pretrained encoders ViT, Wav2Vec2, and BERT, followed by an attention-based fusion module to learn emotion-intent representations. These embeddings are then used to drive personalized content recommendations through a contextual matching layer. Experiments conducted on benchmark emotion datasets (AIGC-INT, MELD, and CMU-MOSEI) and an AIGC interaction dataset demonstrate that the proposed MMEI model achieves a 4.3% improvement in F1-score and a 12.3% reduction in cross-entropy loss compared to the best fusion-based transformer baseline. Furthermore, user-level online evaluations reveal that emotion-driven recommendations increase engagement time by 15.2% and enhance satisfaction scores by 11.8%, confirming the model's effectiveness in aligning AI-generated content with users' affective and intentional states. This work highlights the potential of cross-modal emotional intelligence for next-generation AIGC ecosystems, enabling adaptive, empathetic, and context-aware recommendation experiences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farica Zhuang, Dinara Aliyeva, Shu Yang, Zixuan Wen, Duy Duong-Tran, Christos Davatzikos, Tianlong Chen, Song Wang, Li Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can benefit from integrating complementary information from multiple modalities, mirroring clinical practice. However, conventional fusion approaches often rely on simple concatenation of features, which cannot adaptively balance the contributions of biomarkers such as amyloid PET and MRI across brain regions. In this work, we propose MREF-AD, a Multimodal Regional Expert Fusion model for AD diagnosis. It is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that models meso-scale brain regions in each modality as an independent expert and employs two-level gating networks to learn subject-specific fusion weights. Beyond improving diagnostic performance, MREF-AD provides modality- and region-level insight into how structural and molecular imaging jointly contribute to disease diagnosis. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), MREF-AD achieves state-of-the-art performance over baselines while providing enhanced interpretability of brain region-specific biomarker relevance, underscoring its utility as a general framework for adaptive and interpretable multimodal fusion in neuroimaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matvey Nepomnyaschiy, Oleg Pereziabov, Anvar Tliamov, Stanislav Mikhailov, Ilya Afanasyev</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective human-agent interaction (HAI) relies on accurate and adaptive perception of human emotional states. While multimodal deep learning models - leveraging facial expressions, speech, and textual cues - offer high accuracy in emotion recognition, their training and maintenance are often computationally intensive and inflexible to modality changes. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for training multimodal emotion recognition systems, where each modality encoder and the fusion classifier operate as autonomous agents coordinated by a central supervisor. This architecture enables modular integration of new modalities (e.g., audio features via emotion2vec), seamless replacement of outdated components, and reduced computational overhead during training. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept implementation supporting vision, audio, and text modalities, with the classifier serving as a shared decision-making agent. Our framework not only improves training efficiency but also contributes to the design of more flexible, scalable, and maintainable perception modules for embodied and virtual agents in HAI scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueqi Ma, Jun Wang, Yanbei Jiang, Sarah Monazam Erfani, Tongliang Liu, James Bailey</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks, but remain largely opaque in terms of their internal mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial to improve their reasoning abilities. Drawing inspiration from the interplay between neural processes and human cognition, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the roles and behaviors of attention heads, which are key components of LLMs. We introduce CogQA, a dataset that decomposes complex questions into step-by-step subquestions with a chain-of-thought design, each associated with specific cognitive functions such as retrieval or logical reasoning. By applying a multi-class probing method, we identify the attention heads responsible for these functions. Our analysis across multiple LLM families reveals that attention heads exhibit functional specialization, characterized as cognitive heads. These cognitive heads exhibit several key properties: they are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across different cognitive functions, and display interactive and hierarchical structures. We further show that cognitive heads play a vital role in reasoning tasks - removing them leads to performance degradation, while augmenting them enhances reasoning accuracy. These insights offer a deeper understanding of LLM reasoning and suggest important implications for model design, training, and fine-tuning strategies.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10980">Reducing Fragmentation and Starvation in GPU Clusters through Dynamic Multi-Objective Scheduling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Akhmadillo Mamirov</p>
<p>Abstract: GPU clusters have become essential for training and deploying modern AI systems, yet real deployments continue to report average utilization near 50%. This inefficiency is largely caused by fragmentation, heterogeneous workloads, and the limitations of static scheduling policies. This work presents a systematic evaluation of these issues and introduces three specialized dynamic schedulers: Hybrid Priority (HPS), Predictive Backfill (PBS), and Smart Batch (SBS). These schedulers are designed to improve utilization, fairness, and overall throughput in multi-tenant GPU clusters. We evaluate all schedulers using a controlled simulation of 1,000 AI jobs on a 64-GPU, 8-node cluster that includes a realistic mix of training, inference, and research workloads. Static baselines (FIFO, SJF, Shortest, Shortest-GPU) achieve 45 to 67% GPU utilization and 12.5 to 18.3 jobs per hour and experience severe starvation, with as many as 156 jobs waiting longer than 30 minutes. The dynamic schedulers significantly outperform these policies. HPS achieves the highest utilization (78.2%), highest throughput (25.8 jobs per hour), and the lowest fairness variance among dynamic methods (457), reducing starvation to 12 jobs. PBS improves fragmentation handling and reaches 76.1% utilization, while SBS increases efficiency for structurally similar jobs and reaches 74.6% utilization. Across all key metrics, including throughput, job wait times, fairness variance, and starvation, dynamic multi-objective schedulers consistently outperform single-objective heuristics. These results show that targeted and transparent scheduling strategies can meaningfully increase GPU efficiency in heterogeneous AI clusters and provide a practical foundation for future production scheduling frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Symmetry-Loss, a brain-inspired algorithmic principle that enforces invariance and equivariance through a differentiable constraint derived from environmental symmetries. The framework models learning as the iterative refinement of an effective symmetry group, paralleling developmental processes in which cortical representations align with the world's structure. By minimizing structural surprise, i.e. deviations from symmetry consistency, Symmetry-Loss operationalizes a Free-Energy--like objective for representation learning. This formulation bridges predictive-coding and group-theoretic perspectives, showing how efficient, stable, and compositional representations can emerge from symmetry-based self-organization. The result is a general computational mechanism linking developmental learning in the brain with principled representation learning in artificial systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Igor Pivovarov, Sergey Shumsky</p>
<p>Abstract: The existence of 'what' and 'where' pathways of information processing in the brain was proposed almost 30 years ago, but there is still a lack of a clear mathematical model that could show how these pathways work together. We propose a biologically inspired mathematical model that uses this idea to identify and separate the self from the environment and then build and use a self-model for better predictions. This is a model of neocortical columns governed by the basal ganglia to make predictions and choose the next action, where some columns act as 'what' columns and others act as 'where' columns. Based on this model, we present a reinforcement learning agent that learns purposeful behavior in a virtual environment. We evaluate the agent on the Atari games Pong and Breakout, where it successfully learns to play. We conclude that the ability to separate the self from the environment gives advantages to the agent and therefore such a model could appear in living organisms during evolution. We propose Self-Awareness Principle 1: the ability to separate the self from the world is a necessary but insufficient condition for self-awareness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evgenii Vityaev</p>
<p>Abstract: In the process of evolution, the brain has achieved such perfection that artificial intelligence systems do not have and which needs its own mathematics. The concept of cognitome, introduced by the academician K.V. Anokhin, as the cognitive structure of the mind -- a high-order structure of the brain and a neural hypernetwork, is considered as the basis for modeling. Consciousness then is a special form of dynamics in this hypernetwork -- a large-scale integration of its cognitive elements. The cognitome, in turn, consists of interconnected COGs (cognitive groups of neurons) of two types -- functional systems and cellular ensembles. K.V. Anokhin sees the task of the fundamental theory of the brain and mind in describing these structures, their origin, functions and processes in them. The paper presents mathematical models of these structures based on new mathematical results, as well as models of different cognitive processes in terms of these models. In addition, it is shown that these models can be derived based on a fairly general principle of the brain works: \textit{the brain discovers all possible causal relationships in the external world and draws all possible conclusions from them}. Based on these results, the paper presents models of: ``natural" classification; theory of functional brain systems by P.K. Anokhin; prototypical theory of categorization by E. Roche; theory of causal models by Bob Rehter; theory of consciousness as integrated information by G. Tononi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianli Jin, Ziyang Lin, Qianli Dong, Yi Chen, Jayanth Srinivasa, Myungjin Lee, Zhaowei Tan, Fan Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: With the proliferation of edge AI applications, satisfying user quality of experience (QoE) requirements, such as model inference latency, has become a first class objective, as these models operate in resource constrained settings and directly interact with users. Yet, modern AI models routinely exceed the resource capacity of individual devices, necessitating distributed execution across heterogeneous devices over variable and contention prone networks. Existing planners for hybrid (e.g., data and pipeline) parallelism largely optimize for throughput or device utilization, overlooking QoE, leading to severe resource inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary energy drain) or QoE violations under runtime dynamics.
  We present Dora, a framework for QoE aware hybrid parallelism in distributed edge AI training and inference. Dora jointly optimizes heterogeneous computation, contention prone networks, and multi dimensional QoE objectives via three key mechanisms: (i) a heterogeneity aware model partitioner that determines and assigns model partitions across devices, forming a compact set of QoE compliant plans; (ii) a contention aware network scheduler that further refines these candidate plans by maximizing compute communication overlap; and (iii) a runtime adapter that adaptively composes multiple plans to maximize global efficiency while respecting overall QoEs. Across representative edge deployments, including smart homes, traffic analytics, and small edge clusters, Dora achieves 1.1--6.3 times faster execution and, alternatively, reduces energy consumption by 21--82 percent, all while maintaining QoE under runtime dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanpeng Chen, Weihao Gao, Shunyu Wang, Yanan Zhu, Hong Meng, Yuexian Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating precise 3D molecular geometries is crucial for drug discovery and material science. While prior efforts leverage 1D representations like SELFIES to ensure molecular validity, they fail to fully exploit the rich chemical knowledge entangled within 1D models, leading to a disconnect between 1D syntactic generation and 3D geometric realization. To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that "sculpts" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization. Experiments demonstrate that MolSculpt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in \textit{de novo} 3D molecule generation and conditional 3D molecule generation, showing superior 3D fidelity and stability on both the GEOM-DRUGS and QM9 datasets.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have significantly enhanced the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform complex question-answering (QA) tasks. In this paper, we introduce MedBioRAG, a retrieval-augmented model designed to improve biomedical QA performance through a combination of semantic and lexical search, document retrieval, and supervised fine-tuning. MedBioRAG efficiently retrieves and ranks relevant biomedical documents, enabling precise and context-aware response generation. We evaluate MedBioRAG across text retrieval, close-ended QA, and long-form QA tasks using benchmark datasets such as NFCorpus, TREC-COVID, MedQA, PubMedQA, and BioASQ. Experimental results demonstrate that MedBioRAG outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) models and the GPT-4o base model in all evaluated tasks. Notably, our approach improves NDCG and MRR scores for document retrieval, while achieving higher accuracy in close-ended QA and ROUGE scores in long-form QA. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of semantic search-based retrieval and LLM fine-tuning in biomedical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco L\"assig</p>
<p>Abstract: Representations pervade our daily experience, from letters representing sounds to bit strings encoding digital files. While such representations require externally defined decoders to convey meaning, conscious experience appears fundamentally different: a neural state corresponding to perceiving a red square cannot alternatively encode the experience of a green square. This intrinsic property of consciousness suggests that conscious representations must be unambiguous in a way that conventional representations are not. We formalize this intuition using information theory, defining representational ambiguity as the conditional entropy H(I|R) over possible interpretations I given a representation R. Through experiments on neural networks trained to classify MNIST digits, we demonstrate that relational structures in network connectivity can unambiguously encode representational content. Using both learned decoders and direct geometric matching, we achieve perfect (100%) accuracy for dropout-trained networks and 38% for standard backpropagation in identifying output neuron class identity, despite identical task performance, demonstrating that representational ambiguity can arise orthogonally to behavioral accuracy. We further show that spatial position information of input neurons can be decoded from network connectivity with R2 up to 0.844. These results provide a quantitative method for measuring representational ambiguity in neural systems and demonstrate that neural networks can exhibit the low-ambiguity representations posited as necessary (though not sufficient) by theoretical accounts of consciousness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank Zhigang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Memristor (resistor with memory), inductor with memory (meminductor) and capacitor with memory (memcapacitor) have different roles to play in novel computing architectures. We found that a coil with a magnetic core is an inductor with memory (meminductor) in terms of its inductance L(q) being a function of the charge q. The history of the current passing through the coil is remembered by the magnetization inside the magnetic core. Such a meminductor can play a unique role (that cannot be played by a memristor) in neuromorphic computing, deep learning and brain inspired since the time constant of a neuromorphic RLC circuit is jointly determined by the inductance and capacitance, rather than the resistance. As an experimental verification, this newly invented meminductor was used to reproduce the observed biological behaviour of amoebae (the memorizing, timing and anticipating mechanisms). In conclusion, a beyond memristor computing paradigm is theoretically sensible and experimentally practical.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the quest for fairness in artificial intelligence, novel approaches to enhance it in facial image based gender classification algorithms using text guided methodologies are presented. The core methodology involves leveraging semantic information from image captions during model training to improve generalization capabilities. Two key strategies are presented: Image Text Matching (ITM) guidance and Image Text fusion. ITM guidance trains the model to discern fine grained alignments between images and texts to obtain enhanced multimodal representations. Image text fusion combines both modalities into comprehensive representations for improved fairness. Exensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate these approaches effectively mitigate bias and improve accuracy across gender racial groups compared to existing methods. Additionally, the unique integration of textual guidance underscores an interpretable and intuitive training paradigm for computer vision systems. By scrutinizing the extent to which semantic information reduces disparities, this research offers valuable insights into cultivating more equitable facial analysis algorithms. The proposed methodologies contribute to addressing the pivotal challenge of demographic bias in gender classification from facial images. Furthermore, this technique operates in the absence of demographic labels and is application agnostic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolin Yang, Jiayuan Rao, Haoning Wu, Weidi Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Soccer understanding has recently garnered growing research interest due to its domain-specific complexity and unique challenges. Unlike prior works that typically rely on isolated, task-specific expert models, this work aims to propose a unified model to handle diverse soccer visual understanding tasks, ranging from fine-grained perception (e.g., athlete detection) to semantic reasoning (e.g., event classification). Specifically, our contributions are threefold: (i) we present SoccerMaster, the first soccer-specific vision foundation model that unifies diverse understanding tasks within a single framework via supervised multi-task pretraining; (ii) we develop an automated data curation pipeline to generate scalable spatial annotations, and integrate them with various existing soccer video datasets to construct SoccerFactory, a comprehensive pretraining data resource; and (iii) we conduct extensive evaluations demonstrating that SoccerMaster consistently outperforms task-specific expert models across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting its breadth and superiority. The data, code, and model will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Jiang, Jin Chen, Qingwen Bu, Li Chen, Modi Shi, Yanjie Zhang, Delong Li, Chuanzhe Suo, Chuang Wang, Zhihui Peng, Hongyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Humanoid robots require precise locomotion and dexterous manipulation to perform challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Yet existing approaches, modular or end-to-end, are deficient in manipulation-aware locomotion. This confines the robot to a limited workspace, preventing it from performing large-space loco-manipulation. We attribute this to: (1) the challenge of acquiring loco-manipulation knowledge due to the scarcity of humanoid teleoperation data, and (2) the difficulty of faithfully and reliably executing locomotion commands, stemming from the limited precision and stability of existing RL controllers. To acquire richer loco-manipulation knowledge, we propose a unified latent learning framework that enables Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system to learn from low-cost action-free egocentric videos. Moreover, an efficient human data collection pipeline is devised to augment the dataset and scale the benefits. To more precisely execute the desired locomotion commands, we present a loco-manipulation-oriented (LMO) RL policy specifically tailored for accurate and stable core loco-manipulation movements, such as advancing, turning, and squatting. Building on these components, we introduce WholeBodyVLA, a unified framework for humanoid loco-manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, WholeBodyVLA is one of its kind enabling large-space humanoid loco-manipulation. It is verified via comprehensive experiments on the AgiBot X2 humanoid, outperforming prior baseline by 21.3%. It also demonstrates strong generalization and high extensibility across a broad range of tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guorui Xiao, Enhao Zhang, Nicole Sullivan, Will Hansen, Magdalena Balazinska</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional DBMSs execute user- or application-provided SQL queries over relational data with strong semantic guarantees and advanced query optimization, but writing complex SQL is hard and focuses only on structured tables. Contemporary multimodal systems (which operate over relations but also text, images, and even videos) either expose low-level controls that force users to use (and possibly create) machine learning UDFs manually within SQL or offload execution entirely to black-box LLMs, sacrificing usability or explainability. We propose KathDB, a new system that combines relational semantics with the reasoning power of foundation models over multimodal data. Furthermore, KathDB includes human-AI interaction channels during query parsing, execution, and result explanation, such that users can iteratively obtain explainable answers across data modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Driggers-Ellis, Detravious Brinkley, Ray Chen, Aashish Dhawan, Daisy Zhe Wang, Christan Grant</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi30k is frequently cited in the multimodal machine translation (MMT) literature, offering parallel text data for training and fine-tuning deep learning models. However, it is limited to four languages: Czech, English, French, and German. This restriction has led many researchers to focus their investigations only on these languages. As a result, MMT research on diverse languages has been stalled because the official Multi30k dataset only represents European languages in Latin scripts. Previous efforts to extend Multi30k exist, but the list of supported languages, represented language families, and scripts is still very short. To address these issues, we propose MultiScript30k, a new Multi30k dataset extension for global languages in various scripts, created by translating the English version of Multi30k (Multi30k-En) using NLLB200-3.3B. The dataset consists of over \(30000\) sentences and provides translations of all sentences in Multi30k-En into Ar, Es, Uk, Zh\_Hans and Zh\_Hant. Similarity analysis shows that Multi30k extension consistently achieves greater than \(0.8\) cosine similarity and symmetric KL divergence less than \(0.000251\) for all languages supported except Zh\_Hant which is comparable to the previous Multi30k extensions ArEnMulti30k and Multi30k-Uk. COMETKiwi scores reveal mixed assessments of MultiScript30k as a translation of Multi30k-En in comparison to the related work. ArEnMulti30k scores nearly equal MultiScript30k-Ar, but Multi30k-Uk scores $6.4\%$ greater than MultiScript30k-Uk per split.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junmin Zhong, Jon F. Harrison, Jennie Si, Jun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Honey bees play a crucial role in pollination, contributing significantly to global agriculture and ecosystems. Accurately estimating hive populations is essential for understanding the effects of environmental factors on bee colonies, yet traditional methods of counting bees are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error, particularly in large-scale studies. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based solution for automating bee population counting using CSRNet and introduce ASUBEE, the FIRST high-resolution dataset specifically designed for this task. Our method employs density map estimation to predict bee populations, effectively addressing challenges such as occlusion and overlapping bees that are common in hive monitoring. We demonstrate that CSRNet achieves superior performance in terms of time efficiency, with a computation time of just 1 second per image, while delivering accurate counts even in complex and densely populated hive scenarios. Our findings show that deep learning approaches like CSRNet can dramatically enhance the efficiency of hive population assessments, providing a valuable tool for researchers and beekeepers alike. This work marks a significant advancement in applying AI technologies to ecological research, offering scalable and precise monitoring solutions for honey bee populations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyuna Kwon, Babak Sadigh, Sebastien Hamel, Vincenzo Lordi, John Klepeis, Fei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Atomistic simulations generate large volumes of noisy structural data, but extracting phase labels, order parameters (OPs), and defect information in a way that is universal, robust, and interpretable remains challenging. Existing tools such as PTM and CNA are restricted to a small set of hand-crafted lattices (e.g.\ FCC/BCC/HCP), degrade under strong thermal disorder or defects, and produce hard, template-based labels without per-atom probability or confidence scores. Here we introduce a log-probability foundation model that unifies denoising, phase classification, and OP extraction within a single probabilistic framework. We reuse the MACE-MP foundation interatomic potential on crystal structures mapped to AFLOW prototypes, training it to predict per-atom, per-phase logits $l$ and to aggregate them into a global log-density $\log \hat{P}_\theta(\boldsymbol{r})$ whose gradient defines a conservative score field. Denoising corresponds to gradient ascent on this learned log-density, phase labels follow from $\arg\max_c l_{ac}$, and the $l$ values act as continuous, defect-sensitive and interpretable OPs quantifying the Euclidean distance to ideal phases. We demonstrate universality across hundreds of prototypes, robustness under strong thermal and defect-induced disorder, and accurate treatment of complex systems such as ice polymorphs, ice--water interfaces, and shock-compressed Ti.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duo Zhou, Jorge Chavez, Hesun Chen, Grani A. Hanasusanto, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art neural network (NN) verifiers demonstrate that applying the branch-and-bound (BaB) procedure with fast bounding techniques plays a key role in tackling many challenging verification properties. In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks. Clip-and-Verify is part of the $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN verifier (http://abcrown.org), the VNN-COMP 2025 winner. Code available at https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/Clip_and_Verify.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Kamp, Roos Bakker, Dominique Blok</p>
<p>Abstract: Good quality explanations strengthen the understanding of language models and data. Feature attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradient, are a type of post-hoc explainer that can provide token-level insights. However, explanations on the same input may vary greatly due to underlying biases of different methods. Users may be aware of this issue and mistrust their utility, while unaware users may trust them inadequately. In this work, we delve beyond the superficial inconsistencies between attribution methods, structuring their biases through a model- and method-agnostic framework of three evaluation metrics. We systematically assess both the lexical and position bias (what and where in the input) for two transformers; first, in a controlled, pseudo-random classification task on artificial data; then, in a semi-controlled causal relation detection task on natural data. We find that lexical and position biases are structurally unbalanced in our model comparison, with models that score high on one type score low on the other. We also find signs that methods producing anomalous explanations are more likely to be biased themselves.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evren Ayberk Munis, Deniz Y{\i}lmaz, Arianna Muti, \c{C}a\u{g}r{\i} Toraman</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are widely used across domains, yet there are concerns about their factual reliability and biases. Factual knowledge probing offers a systematic means to evaluate these aspects. Most existing benchmarks focus on single-entity facts and monolingual data. We therefore present FIBER, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating factual knowledge in single- and multi-entity settings. The dataset includes sentence completion, question-answering, and object-count prediction tasks in English, Italian, and Turkish. Using FIBER, we examine whether the prompt language induces inference bias in entity selection and how large language models perform on multi-entity versus single-entity questions. The results indicate that the language of the prompt can influence the model's generated output, particularly for entities associated with the country corresponding to that language. However, this effect varies across different topics such that 31% of the topics exhibit factual inference bias score greater than 0.5. Moreover, the level of bias differs across languages such that Turkish prompts show higher bias compared to Italian in 83% of the topics, suggesting a language-dependent pattern. Our findings also show that models face greater difficulty when handling multi-entity questions than the single-entity questions. Model performance differs across both languages and model sizes. The highest mean average precision is achieved in English, while Turkish and Italian lead to noticeably lower scores. Larger models, including Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, show consistently better performance than smaller 3B-4B models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhang, Conor Hassan, Julien Martinelli, Daolang Huang, Samuel Kaski</p>
<p>Abstract: Balancing competing objectives is omnipresent across disciplines, from drug design to autonomous systems. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization is a promising solution for such expensive, black-box problems: it fits probabilistic surrogates and selects new designs via an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. In practice, it requires tailored choices of surrogate and acquisition that rarely transfer to the next problem, is myopic when multi-step planning is often required, and adds refitting overhead, particularly in parallel or time-sensitive loops. We present TAMO, a fully amortized, universal policy for multi-objective black-box optimization. TAMO uses a transformer architecture that operates across varying input and objective dimensions, enabling pretraining on diverse corpora and transfer to new problems without retraining: at test time, the pretrained model proposes the next design with a single forward pass. We pretrain the policy with reinforcement learning to maximize cumulative hypervolume improvement over full trajectories, conditioning on the entire query history to approximate the Pareto frontier. Across synthetic benchmarks and real tasks, TAMO produces fast proposals, reducing proposal time by 50-1000x versus alternatives while matching or improving Pareto quality under tight evaluation budgets. These results show that transformers can perform multi-objective optimization entirely in-context, eliminating per-task surrogate fitting and acquisition engineering, and open a path to foundation-style, plug-and-play optimizers for scientific discovery workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Li, Yuelin Han, Adam Wierman, Shaolei Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness and action smoothness are two crucial considerations in many online optimization problems, but they have yet to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\to\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lennard Manuel, Hamid Gadirov, Steffen Frey</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing and visualizing scientific ensemble datasets with high dimensionality and complexity poses significant challenges. Dimensionality reduction techniques and autoencoders are powerful tools for extracting features, but they often struggle with such high-dimensional data. This paper presents an enhanced autoencoder framework that incorporates a clustering loss, based on the soft silhouette score, alongside a contrastive loss to improve the visualization and interpretability of ensemble datasets. First, EfficientNetV2 is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled portions of the scientific ensemble datasets. By jointly optimizing the reconstruction, clustering, and contrastive objectives, our method encourages similar data points to group together while separating distinct clusters in the latent space. UMAP is subsequently applied to this latent representation to produce 2D projections, which are evaluated using the silhouette score. Multiple types of autoencoders are evaluated and compared based on their ability to extract meaningful features. Experiments on two scientific ensemble datasets - channel structures in soil derived from Markov chain Monte Carlo, and droplet-on-film impact dynamics - show that models incorporating clustering or contrastive loss marginally outperform the baseline approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tool calling agents are an emerging paradigm in LLM deployment, with major platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini adding connectors and autonomous capabilities. However, the inherent unreliability of LLMs introduces fundamental security risks when these agents operate over sensitive user services. Prior approaches either rely on manually written policies that require security expertise, or place LLMs in the confinement loop, which lacks rigorous security guarantees. We present MiniScope, a framework that enables tool calling agents to operate on user accounts while confining potential damage from unreliable LLMs. MiniScope introduces a novel way to automatically and rigorously enforce least privilege principles by reconstructing permission hierarchies that reflect relationships among tool calls and combining them with a mobile-style permission model to balance security and ease of use. To evaluate MiniScope, we create a synthetic dataset derived from ten popular real-world applications, capturing the complexity of realistic agentic tasks beyond existing simplified benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that MiniScope incurs only 1-6% latency overhead compared to vanilla tool calling agents, while significantly outperforming the LLM based baseline in minimizing permissions as well as computational and operational costs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reproducibility remains a cornerstone of scientific progress, yet complex multimodal models often lack transparent implementation details and accessible training infrastructure. In this work, we present a detailed reproduction and critical analysis of the Monkey Vision-Language Model (VLM) (Li et al. 2023b) published in CVPR24, a recent approach to high-resolution image understanding via image tiling. The original paper proposed splitting large images into tiles to recover fine-grained visual details while maintaining computational efficiency. Our study replicates this strategy using open checkpoints and reimplements the training pipeline. We confirm the key finding of the original Monkey VLM work, namely that tiling effectively recovers local details. We then extend this work further, by investigating the effect of the inclusion of the global context, which provide practical insights for future high-resolution multimodal modeling. However, we also report deviations in the results, with the magnitude of these effects depending heavily on task type and tile granularity.</p>

A modified version of amc performs well on the TRACS Kaggle challenge, achieving a macro $F_1$ score of 0.84 on the held-out test set. amc is valuable for other telescopes beyond TRACS; we developed the initial software for identifying papers that featured scientific results by NASA missions. Additionally, we investigate how amc can also be used to interrogate historical datasets and surface potential label errors.

<p>Abstract: We present Adaptive Soft Rolling KV Freeze with Entropy-Guided Recovery (ASR-KF-EGR), a training-free inference-time framework for efficient large language model generation. Our method introduces a reversible soft-freeze mechanism that temporarily suspends key-value (KV) updates for low-importance tokens identified within a sliding attention window. Unlike eviction-based approaches that permanently discard context, ASR-KF-EGR preserves all tokens in off-GPU storage and restores them on demand. We extend the framework with sublinear freeze scheduling, where freeze duration grows sublinearly with repeated low-importance detections, preventing over-aggressive compression. Preliminary experiments on LLaMA-3 8B demonstrate 55-67% reduction in active KV cache size while maintaining generation quality and passing needle-in-haystack retrieval tests. The method is architecture-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and provides a practical solution for memory-constrained deployment of long-context LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabrijel Boduljak, Yushi Lan, Christian Rupprecht, Andrea Vedaldi</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting from partial observations is central to world modeling. Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB. With matched architecture and compute, our method produces sharper and more accurate predictions than regression across all modalities. Our results suggest that stochastic conditional generation of VFM features offers a promising and scalable foundation for future world models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) refers to the ability of a model to learn new tasks from examples in its input without any parameter updates. In contrast to previous theories of ICL relying on toy models and data settings, recently it has been shown that an abstraction of a transformer block can be seen as implicitly updating the weights of its feedforward network according to the context (Dherin et al., 2025). Here, we provide a simple generalisation of this result for (i) all sequence positions beyond the last, (ii) any transformer block beyond the first, and (iii) more realistic residual blocks including layer normalisation. We empirically verify our theory on simple in-context linear regression tasks and investigate the relationship between the implicit updates related to different tokens within and between blocks. These results help to bring the theory of Dherin et al. (2025) even closer to practice, with potential for validation on large-scale models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Wu, Ruiyu Fang, Liting Jiang, Shuangyong Song, Xiaomeng Huang, Shiquan Wang, Zhongqiu Li, Lingling Shi, Mengjiao Bao, Yongxiang Li, Hao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-intent spoken language understanding (SLU) involves two tasks: multiple intent detection and slot filling, which jointly handle utterances containing more than one intent. Owing to this characteristic, which closely reflects real-world applications, the task has attracted increasing research attention, and substantial progress has been achieved. However, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and systematic review of existing studies on multi-intent SLU. To this end, this paper presents a survey of recent advances in multi-intent SLU. We provide an in-depth overview of previous research from two perspectives: decoding paradigms and modeling approaches. On this basis, we further compare the performance of representative models and analyze their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and outline promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will offer valuable insights and serve as a useful reference for advancing research in multi-intent SLU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth Jayashankar, Joshua Kim, Michael B. Sullivan, Wenting Zheng, Dimitrios Skarlatos</p>
<p>Abstract: Encrypted AI using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) provides strong privacy guarantees; but its slow performance has limited practical deployment. Recent works proposed ASICs to accelerate FHE, but require expensive advanced manufacturing processes that constrain their accessibility. GPUs are a far more accessible platform, but achieving ASIC-level performance using GPUs has remained elusive. Furthermore, state-of-the-art approaches primarily focus on small models that fit comfortably within a single device. Supporting large models such as LLMs in FHE introduces a dramatic increase in computational complexity that requires optimized GPU kernels, along with managing terabyte-scale memory footprints that far exceed the capacity of a single GPU. This paper presents Cerium, a multi-GPU framework for FHE inference on large models. Cerium integrates a domain-specific language, an optimizing compiler, and a runtime system to automatically generate high-performance GPU kernels, manage terabyte-scale memory footprints, and parallelize computation across multiple GPUs. It introduces new IR constructs, compiler passes, sparse polynomial representations, memory-efficient data layouts, and communication-aware parallelization techniques that together enable encrypted inference for models ranging from small CNNs to Llama3-8B. We build Cerium on NVIDIA GPUs and demonstrate significant performance gains. For small models, Cerium outperforms expert-written hand-optimized GPU libraries by up to 2.25 times. Cerium achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art FHE ASICs, outright matching prior FHE ASIC CraterLake. It is the first GPU system to execute bootstrapping in under 10 milliseconds, achieving 7.5 milliseconds, and is the first to demonstrate encrypted inference for BERT-Base and Llama3-8B in 8 seconds and 134 seconds, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Serious illness can deprive patients of the capacity to speak for themselves. As populations age and caregiver networks shrink, the need for reliable support in Advance Care Planning (ACP) grows. To probe this fraught design space of using proxy agents for high-risk, high-subjectivity decisions, we built an experience prototype (\acpagent{}) and asked 15 participants in 4 workshops to train it to be their personal proxy in ACP decisions. We analysed their coping strategies and feature requests and mapped the results onto axes of agent autonomy and human control. Our findings argue for a potential new role of AI in ACP where agents act as personal advocates for individuals, building mutual intelligibility over time. We conclude with design recommendations to balance the risks and benefits of such an agent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingsen Ma, Dianyun Wang, Ran Jing, Yujun Sun, Zhenbo Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate when processing long and noisy retrieval contexts because they rely on spurious correlations rather than genuine causal relationships. We propose CIP, a lightweight and plug-and-play causal prompting framework that mitigates hallucinations at the input stage. CIP constructs a causal relation sequence among entities, actions, and events and injects it into the prompt to guide reasoning toward causally relevant evidence. Through causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning, CIP suppresses non causal reasoning paths, improving factual grounding and interpretability. Experiments across seven mainstream language models, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Llama 3.1, show that CIP consistently enhances reasoning quality and reliability, achieving 2.6 points improvement in Attributable Rate, 0.38 improvement in Causal Consistency Score, and a fourfold increase in effective information density. API level profiling further shows that CIP accelerates contextual understanding and reduces end to end response latency by up to 55.1 percent. These results suggest that causal reasoning may serve as a promising paradigm for improving the explainability, stability, and efficiency of large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nattaya Mairittha, Gabriel Phorncharoenmusikul, Sorawit Worapradidth</p>
<p>Abstract: The integrity of contemporary AI systems is undermined by a critical design flaw: the misappropriation of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) models to mask systems that are fundamentally reliant on human labor. We term this structural reliance Human-Instead-of-AI (HISOAI). HISOAI systems represent an ethical failure and an unsustainable economic dependency, where human workers function as hidden operational fallbacks rather than strategic collaborators. To rectify this, we propose the AI-First, Human-Empowered (AFHE) paradigm. AFHE mandates a technological design where the AI component must achieve a minimum, quantifiable level of functional independence prior to deployment. This standard is formalized through the AI Autonomy Coefficient (alpha), a metric that determines the proportion of tasks that the AI successfully processes without mandatory human substitution. We introduce the AFHE Deployment Algorithm, an algorithmic gate that requires the system to meet a specified alpha threshold across both offline and shadow testing. By enforcing this structural separation, the AFHE framework redefines the human's role to focus exclusively on high-value tasks, including ethical oversight, boundary pushing, and strategic model tuning, thereby ensuring true system transparency and operational independence. This work advocates for a critical shift toward metric-driven, structurally sound AI architecture, moving the industry beyond deceptive human dependency toward verifiable autonomy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasaman Hashem Pour, Nazanin Mahjourian, Vinh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Manual generation of G-code is important for learning the operation of CNC machines. Prior work in G-code verification uses Large-Language Models (LLMs), which primarily examine errors in the written programming. However, CNC machining requires extensive use and knowledge of the Human-Machine Interface (HMI), which displays machine status and errors. LLMs currently lack the capability to leverage knowledge of HMIs due to their inability to access the vision modality. This paper proposes a few-shot VLM-based verification approach that simultaneously evaluates the G-code and the HMI display for errors and safety status. The input dataset includes paired G-code text and associated HMI screenshots from a 15-slant-PRO lathe, including both correct and error-prone cases. To enable few-shot learning, the VLM is provided with a structured JSON schema based on prior heuristic knowledge. After determining the prompts, instances of G-code and HMI that either contain errors or are error free are used as few-shot examples to guide the VLM. The model was then evaluated in comparison to a zero-shot VLM through multiple scenarios of incorrect G-code and HMI errors with respect to per-slot accuracy. The VLM showed that few-shot prompting led to overall enhancement of detecting HMI errors and discrepancies with the G-code for more comprehensive debugging. Therefore, the proposed framework was demonstrated to be suitable for verification of manually generated G-code that is typically developed in CNC training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingxu Yan, Ye Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic graphs are prevalent in real-world scenarios, where continuous structural changes induce catastrophic forgetting in graph neural networks (GNNs). While continual learning has been extended to dynamic graphs, existing methods overlook the effects of topological changes on existing nodes. To address it, we propose a novel framework for continual learning on dynamic graphs, named Condensation-Concatenation-based Continual Learning (CCC). Specifically, CCC first condenses historical graph snapshots into compact semantic representations while aiming to preserve the original label distribution and topological properties. Then it concatenates these historical embeddings with current graph representations selectively. Moreover, we refine the forgetting measure (FM) to better adapt to dynamic graph scenarios by quantifying the predictive performance degradation of existing nodes caused by structural updates. CCC demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines across four real-world datasets in extensive experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Wang, Zhenxing Niu, Haoxuan Ji, Guangyu He, Haichang Gao, Gang Hua</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, machine unlearning approaches have been proposed to remove sensitive information from well-trained large models. However, most existing methods are tailored for LLMs, while MLLM-oriented unlearning remains at its early stage. Inspired by recent studies exploring the internal mechanisms of MLLMs, we propose to disentangle the visual and textual knowledge embedded within MLLMs and introduce a dedicated approach to selectively erase target visual knowledge while preserving textual knowledge. Unlike previous unlearning methods that rely on output-level supervision, our approach introduces a Visual Knowledge Distillation (VKD) scheme, which leverages intermediate visual representations within the MLLM as supervision signals. This design substantially enhances both unlearning effectiveness and model utility. Moreover, since our method only fine-tunes the visual components of the MLLM, it offers significant efficiency advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, we are the first to evaluate the robustness of MLLM unlearning against relearning attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanu Singh, Pranamesh Chakraborty, Long T. Truong</p>
<p>Abstract: Road traffic accidents represent a leading cause of mortality globally, with incidence rates rising due to increasing population, urbanization, and motorization. Rising accident rates raise concerns about traffic surveillance effectiveness. Traditional computer vision methods for accident detection struggle with limited spatiotemporal understanding and poor cross-domain generalization. Recent advances in transformer architectures excel at modeling global spatial-temporal dependencies and parallel computation. However, applying these models to automated traffic accident detection is limited by small, non-diverse datasets, hindering the development of robust, generalizable systems. To address this gap, we curated a comprehensive and balanced dataset that captures a wide spectrum of traffic environments, accident types, and contextual variations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we propose an accident detection model based on a transformer architecture using pre-extracted spatial video features. The architecture employs convolutional layers to extract local correlations across diverse patterns within a frame, while leveraging transformers to capture sequential-temporal dependencies among the retrieved features. Moreover, most existing studies neglect the integration of motion cues, which are essential for understanding dynamic scenes, especially during accidents. These approaches typically rely on static features or coarse temporal information. In this study, multiple methods for incorporating motion cues were evaluated to identify the most effective strategy. Among the tested input approaches, concatenating RGB features with optical flow achieved the highest accuracy at 88.3%. The results were further compared with vision language models (VLM) such as GPT, Gemini, and LLaVA-NeXT-Video to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Gupta, Y. Raghu Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: The automated translation of C code to Java code is a notoriously difficult task, fraught with challenges stemming from fundamental paradigm shifts (procedural vs. Object Oriented), memory models (manual pointers vs. Garbage Collection), and incompatible data types. This paper investigates the efficacy of 19 small, quantized LLMs (under 20 billion parameters) for the C to Java translation task. We use a novel, hybrid pipeline that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for semantic decomposition and employs a highly constrained, rule based prompting strategy. The results are stark: a clear multi tiered performance divide emerged. The vast majority of models (Tier 3, e.g., llama3.1, gemma3, starcoder2) failed 100\% of the tests, proving incapable of generating even basic, runnable Java boilerplate. A small middle tier (Tier 2, e.g., mistral-nemo and mistral) produced runnable code but was plagued by dangerous semantic failures and wrong translations. Only three models (Tier 1: phi4, deepseek-coder-v2, codeqwen) proved viable, passing over 50\% of the test suite. Even these top models failed on the most complex C concepts, such as function pointers, sizeof, and enum logic, revealing a hard ceiling for the reasoning capabilities of current quantized models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kwun Sy Lee, Jiawei Chen, Fuk Sheng Ford Chung, Tianyu Zhao, Zhenyuan Chen, Debby D. Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable in silico molecular toxicity prediction is a cornerstone of modern drug discovery, offering a scalable alternative to experimental screening. However, the black-box nature of state-of-the-art models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as high-stakes safety decisions demand verifiable structural insights alongside predictive performance. To address this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework designed to jointly enhance accuracy and interpretability. Our architecture integrates a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. By imposing an L1 sparsity penalty on these modules, the framework is constrained to focus on a minimal set of salient molecular fragments for each distinct toxicity endpoint. The resulting framework is trained end-to-end and is readily adaptable to various transformer-based backbones. Evaluated on the ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 benchmark datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both single-task and standard MTL baselines. Crucially, the sparse attention weights provide chemically intuitive visualizations that reveal the specific fragments influencing predictions, thereby enhancing insight into the model's decision-making process.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Flowception, a novel non-autoregressive and variable-length video generation framework. Flowception learns a probability path that interleaves discrete frame insertions with continuous frame denoising. Compared to autoregressive methods, Flowception alleviates error accumulation/drift as the frame insertion mechanism during sampling serves as an efficient compression mechanism to handle long-term context. Compared to full-sequence flows, our method reduces FLOPs for training three-fold, while also being more amenable to local attention variants, and allowing to learn the length of videos jointly with their content. Quantitative experimental results show improved FVD and VBench metrics over autoregressive and full-sequence baselines, which is further validated with qualitative results. Finally, by learning to insert and denoise frames in a sequence, Flowception seamlessly integrates different tasks such as image-to-video generation and video interpolation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Skeleton-Cache, the first training-free test-time adaptation framework for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition (SZAR), aimed at improving model generalization to unseen actions during inference. Skeleton-Cache reformulates inference as a lightweight retrieval process over a non-parametric cache that stores structured skeleton representations, combining both global and fine-grained local descriptors. To guide the fusion of descriptor-wise predictions, we leverage the semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assign class-specific importance weights. By integrating these structured descriptors with LLM-guided semantic priors, Skeleton-Cache dynamically adapts to unseen actions without any additional training or access to training data. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD II demonstrate that Skeleton-Cache consistently boosts the performance of various SZAR backbones under both zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning has rapidly advanced visual understanding, largely via multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that use powerful LLMs as cognitive cores. In visual generation, however, these powerful core models are typically reduced to global text encoders for diffusion models, leaving most of their reasoning and planning ability unused. This creates a gap: current multimodal LLMs can parse complex layouts, attributes, and knowledge-intensive scenes, yet struggle to generate images or videos with equally precise and structured control. We propose MetaCanvas, a lightweight framework that lets MLLMs reason and plan directly in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces and interface tightly with diffusion generators. We empirically implement MetaCanvas on three different diffusion backbones and evaluate it across six tasks, including text-to-image generation, text/image-to-video generation, image/video editing, and in-context video generation, each requiring precise layouts, robust attribute binding, and reasoning-intensive control. MetaCanvas consistently outperforms global-conditioning baselines, suggesting that treating MLLMs as latent-space planners is a promising direction for narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melih Catal, Pooja Rani, Harald C. Gall</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models specialized for code (CodeLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating code snippets, documentation, and test cases. However, despite their promising capabilities, CodeLLMs can inadvertently memorize and reproduce snippets from their training data, which poses risks of privacy breaches and intellectual property violations. These risks restrict the deployment of CodeLLMs in sensitive domains and limit their training datasets to publicly available sources. To mitigate the memorization risk without compromising their task performance, we apply Differential Privacy (DP) to CodeLLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of DP in CodeLLMs. DP adds calibrated noise to the training process to protect individual data points while still allowing the model to learn useful patterns. To this end, we first identify and understand the driving reasons of the memorization behaviour of the CodeLLMs during their fine-tuning. Then, to address this issue, we empirically evaluate the effect of DP on mitigating memorization while preserving code generation capabilities. Our findings show that DP substantially reduces memorization in CodeLLMs across all the tested snippet types. The snippet types most prone to memorization are also the most effectively mitigated by DP. Furthermore, we observe that DP slightly increases perplexity but preserves, and can even enhance, the code generation capabilities of CodeLLMs, which makes it feasible to apply DP in practice without significantly compromising model utility. Finally, we analyze the impact of DP on training efficiency and energy consumption, finding that DP does not significantly affect training time or energy usage, making it a practical choice for privacy-preserving CodeLLMs training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning, but suffer from hallucination: the generation of factually incorrect content. While numerous methods have been developed to reduce hallucinations, their impact on creative generations remains unexplored. This gap is particularly critical for AI-assisted scientific discovery, which requires both factual accuracy and creative hypothesis generation. We investigate how three hallucination-reduction techniques: Chain of Verification (CoVe), Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), affect creativity in LLMs. Evaluating multiple model families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral) at varying scales (1B - 70B parameters) on two creativity benchmarks (NeoCoder and CS4), we find that these methods have opposing effects on divergent creativity. CoVe enhances divergent thinking, DoLa suppresses it, and RAG shows minimal impact. Our findings provide guidance for selecting appropriate hallucination-reduction methods in scientific applications, where the balance between factual accuracy and creative exploration is crucial.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-precision scientific simulation faces a long-standing trade-off between computational efficiency and physical fidelity. To address this challenge, we propose NeuralOGCM, an ocean modeling framework that fuses differentiable programming with deep learning. At the core of NeuralOGCM is a fully differentiable dynamical solver, which leverages physics knowledge as its core inductive bias. The learnable physics integration captures large-scale, deterministic physical evolution, and transforms key physical parameters (e.g., diffusion coefficients) into learnable parameters, enabling the model to autonomously optimize its physical core via end-to-end training. Concurrently, a deep neural network learns to correct for subgrid-scale processes and discretization errors not captured by the physics model. Both components work in synergy, with their outputs integrated by a unified ODE solver. Experiments demonstrate that NeuralOGCM maintains long-term stability and physical consistency, significantly outperforming traditional numerical models in speed and pure AI baselines in accuracy. Our work paves a new path for building fast, stable, and physically-plausible models for scientific computing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting predicts future values from past data. In real-world settings, some anomalous events have lasting effects and influence the forecast, while others are short-lived and should be ignored. Standard forecasting models fail to make this distinction, often either overreacting to noise or missing persistent shifts. We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes. This encourages invariance to irrelevant perturbations while preserving sensitivity to meaningful distributional shifts. Experiments on the Traffic and Electricity benchmarks, as well as on a real-world cash-demand dataset, demonstrate that Co-TSFA improves performance under anomalous conditions while maintaining accuracy on normal data. An anonymized GitHub repository with the implementation of Co-TSFA is provided and will be made public upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chong Tang, Hao Dai, Jagmohan Chauhan</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for real-time DNN applications on edge devices necessitates faster inference of increasingly complex models. Although many devices include specialized accelerators (e.g., mobile GPUs), dynamic control-flow operators and unsupported kernels often fall back to CPU execution. Existing frameworks handle these fallbacks poorly, leaving CPU cores idle and causing high latency and memory spikes. We introduce Parallax, a framework that accelerates mobile DNN inference without model refactoring or custom operator implementations. Parallax first partitions the computation DAG to expose parallelism, then employs branch-aware memory management with dedicated arenas and buffer reuse to reduce runtime footprint. An adaptive scheduler executes branches according to device memory constraints, meanwhile, fine-grained subgraph control enables heterogeneous inference of dynamic models. By evaluating on five representative DNNs across three different mobile devices, Parallax achieves up to 46% latency reduction, maintains controlled memory overhead (26.5% on average), and delivers up to 30% energy savings compared with state-of-the-art frameworks, offering improvements aligned with the responsiveness demands of real-time mobile inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Feng, Shuqing Ma, Xiaoqian Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) is extremely challenging due to the complexity of ship-radiated noise and the variability of ocean environments. Although deep learning (DL) approaches have achieved promising results, most existing models implicitly assume that underwater acoustic data lie in a Euclidean space. This assumption, however, is unsuitable for the inherently complex topology of underwater acoustic signals, which exhibit non-stationary, non-Gaussian, and nonlinear characteristics. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the UATR-GTransformer, a non-Euclidean DL model that integrates Transformer architectures with graph neural networks (GNNs). The model comprises three key components: a Mel patchify block, a GTransformer block, and a classification head. The Mel patchify block partitions the Mel-spectrogram into overlapping patches, while the GTransformer block employs a Transformer Encoder to capture mutual information between split patches to generate Mel-graph embeddings. Subsequently, a GNN enhances these embeddings by modeling local neighborhood relationships, and a feed-forward network (FFN) further performs feature transformation. Experiments results based on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the UATR-GTransformer achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, interpretability analysis reveals that the proposed model effectively extracts rich frequency-domain information, highlighting its potential for applications in ocean engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Pennino, Maurizio Gabbrielli</p>
<p>Abstract: The standard paradigm for training deep learning models on sensor data assumes that more data is always better. However, raw sensor streams are often imbalanced and contain significant redundancy, meaning that not all data points contribute equally to model generalization. In this paper, we show that, in some cases, "less is more" when considering datasets. We do this by reframing the data selection problem: rather than tuning model hyperparameters, we fix the model and optimize the composition of the training data itself. We introduce a framework for discovering the optimal "training diet" from a large, unlabeled time series corpus. Our framework first uses a large-scale encoder and k-means clustering to partition the dataset into distinct, behaviorally consistent clusters. These clusters represent the fundamental 'ingredients' available for training. We then employ the Optuna optimization framework to search the high-dimensional space of possible data mixtures. For each trial, Optuna proposes a specific sampling ratio for each cluster, and a new training set is constructed based on this recipe. A smaller target model is then trained and evaluated. Our experiments reveal that this data-centric search consistently discovers data mixtures that yield models with significantly higher performance compared to baselines trained on the entire dataset. Specifically - evaluated on PMSM dataset - our method improved performance from a baseline MSE of 1.70 to 1.37, a 19.41% improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable interpretation of multimodal data in dentistry is essential for automated oral healthcare, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained dental visual details and lack sufficient reasoning ability for precise diagnosis. To address these limitations, we present DentalGPT, a specialized dental MLLM developed through high-quality domain knowledge injection and reinforcement learning. Specifically, the largest annotated multimodal dataset for dentistry to date was constructed by aggregating over 120k dental images paired with detailed descriptions that highlight diagnostically relevant visual features, making it the multimodal dataset with the most extensive collection of dental images to date. Training on this dataset significantly enhances the MLLM's visual understanding of dental conditions, while the subsequent reinforcement learning stage further strengthens its capability for multimodal complex reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on intraoral and panoramic benchmarks, along with dental subsets of medical VQA benchmarks, show that DentalGPT achieves superior performance in disease classification and dental VQA tasks, outperforming many state-of-the-art MLLMs despite having only 7B parameters. These results demonstrate that high-quality dental data combined with staged adaptation provides an effective pathway for building capable and domain-specialized dental MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The calving fronts of marine-terminating glaciers undergo constant changes. These changes significantly affect the glacier's mass and dynamics, demanding continuous monitoring. To address this need, deep learning models were developed that can automatically delineate the calving front in Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. However, these models often struggle to correctly classify areas affected by seasonal conditions such as ice melange or snow-covered surfaces. To address this issue, we propose to process multiple frames from a satellite image time series of the same glacier in parallel and exchange temporal information between the corresponding feature maps to stabilize each prediction. We integrate our approach into the current state-of-the-art architecture Tyrion and accomplish a new state-of-the-art performance on the CaFFe benchmark dataset. In particular, we achieve a Mean Distance Error of 184.4 m and a mean Intersection over Union of 83.6.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Tabakov, Asen Popov, Dimitar Dimitrov, S. Ensiye Kiyamousavi, Vladimir Hristov, Boris Kraychev</p>
<p>Abstract: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models generalize poorly, particularly when tasks require new compositions of skills or objects. We introduce Atomic Action Slicing (AAS), a planner-aligned approach that decomposes long-horizon demonstrations into short, typed atomic actions that are easier for planners to use and policies to learn. Using LIBERO demonstrations, AAS produces a validated dataset of 2,124 atomic segments labeled with action type, temporal span, and confidence. A stronger segmenter (Gemini 2.5 Pro) closely matches planner-defined plans and remains robust under keyframe jitter, while smaller models perform worse on multi-object tasks. Fine-tuning CLIP-RT+ on our atomic dataset improves task success from 94.2% to 95.3% on LIBERO-Goal and 83.8% to 88.8% on LIBERO-Long.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bj\"orn Deiseroth, Max Henning H\"oth, Kristian Kersting, Letitia Parcalabescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models rely on retrieved evidence to guide large language model (LLM) generators, yet current systems treat retrieval as a weak heuristic rather than verifiable evidence. As a result, LLMs answer without support, hallucinate under incomplete or misleading context, and rely on spurious evidence. We introduce a training framework that treats the entire RAG pipeline -- both the retriever and the generator -- as an interactive proof system via an adaptation of the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions of unkown provenance: Merlin provides helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify and modify the evidence most influential to Arthur. Consequently, Arthur learns to (i) answer when the context support the answer, (ii) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (iii) rely on the specific context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a rigorous evaluation framework to disentangle explanation fidelity from baseline predictive errors. This allows us to introduce and measure the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A certified mutual-information guarantees relative to model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Across three RAG datasets and two model families of varying sizes, M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, and reject behavior, as well as reduced hallucinations -- without needing manually annotated unanswerable questions. The retriever likewise improves recall and MRR through automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives. Our results demonstrate that autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision provides a principled and practical path toward reliable RAG systems that treat retrieved documents not as suggestions, but as verifiable evidence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keerthana Murugaraj, Salima Lamsiyah, Marten During, Martin Theobald</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting coherent and human-understandable themes from large collections of unstructured historical newspaper archives presents significant challenges due to topic evolution, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) noise, and the sheer volume of text. Traditional topic-modeling methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), often fall short in capturing the complexity and dynamic nature of discourse in historical texts. To address these limitations, we employ BERTopic. This neural topic-modeling approach leverages transformerbased embeddings to extract and classify topics, which, despite its growing popularity, still remains underused in historical research. Our study focuses on articles published between 1955 and 2018, specifically examining discourse on nuclear power and nuclear safety. We analyze various topic distributions across the corpus and trace their temporal evolution to uncover long-term trends and shifts in public discourse. This enables us to more accurately explore patterns in public discourse, including the co-occurrence of themes related to nuclear power and nuclear weapons and their shifts in topic importance over time. Our study demonstrates the scalability and contextual sensitivity of BERTopic as an alternative to traditional approaches, offering richer insights into historical discourses extracted from newspaper archives. These findings contribute to historical, nuclear, and social-science research while reflecting on current limitations and proposing potential directions for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brenda Nogueira, Werner Geyer, Andrew Anderson, Toby Jia-Jun Li, Dongwhi Kim, Nuno Moniz, Nitesh V. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in academic writing practices. Although numerous studies have explored how researchers employ these tools for scientific writing, their concrete implementation, limitations, and design challenges within the literature review process remain underexplored. In this paper, we report a user study with researchers across multiple disciplines to characterize current practices, benefits, and \textit{pain points} in using LLMs to investigate related work. We identified three recurring gaps: (i) lack of trust in outputs, (ii) persistent verification burden, and (iii) requiring multiple tools. This motivates our proposal of six design goals and a high-level framework that operationalizes them through improved related papers visualization, verification at every step, and human-feedback alignment with generation-guided explanations. Overall, by grounding our work in the practical, day-to-day needs of researchers, we designed a framework that addresses these limitations and models real-world LLM-assisted writing, advancing trust through verifiable actions and fostering practical collaboration between researchers and AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Titaya Mairittha, Tanakon Sawanglok, Panuwit Raden, Jirapast Buntub, Thanapat Warunee, Napat Asawachaisuvikrom, Thanaphum Saiwongin</p>
<p>Abstract: While voice-based AI systems have achieved remarkable generative capabilities, their interactions often feel conversationally broken. This paper examines the interactional friction that emerges in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) pipelines. By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity. We conclude that building natural spoken AI is an infrastructure design challenge, requiring a shift from optimizing isolated components to carefully choreographing the seams between them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongsheng Huang, Peibo Duan, Yujie Wu, Kai Sun, Zhipeng Liu, Changsheng Zhang, Bin Zhang, Mingkun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), regarded as the third generation of artificial neural networks, are expected to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience. However, most mainstream SNN research directly adopts the rigid, chain-like hierarchical architecture of traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), ignoring key structural characteristics of the brain. Biological neurons are stochastically interconnected, forming complex neural pathways that exhibit Neuron-Expandability, Pathway-Reusability, and Dynamic-Configurability. In this paper, we introduce a new SNN paradigm, named Cognition-aware SNN (CogniSNN), by incorporating Random Graph Architecture (RGA). Furthermore, we address the issues of network degradation and dimensional mismatch in deep pathways by introducing an improved pure spiking residual mechanism alongside an adaptive pooling strategy. Then, we design a Key Pathway-based Learning without Forgetting (KP-LwF) approach, which selectively reuses critical neural pathways while retaining historical knowledge, enabling efficient multi-task transfer. Finally, we propose a Dynamic Growth Learning (DGL) algorithm that allows neurons and synapses to grow dynamically along the internal temporal dimension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogniSNN achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, current state-of-the-art SNNs on neuromorphic datasets and Tiny-ImageNet. The Pathway-Reusability enhances the network's continuous learning capability across different scenarios, while the dynamic growth algorithm improves robustness against interference and mitigates the fixed-timestep constraints during neuromorphic chip deployment. This work demonstrates the potential of SNNs with random graph structures in advancing brain-inspired intelligence and lays the foundation for their practical application on neuromorphic hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed El Fallaki Idrissi, Jad Mounayer, Sebastian Rodriguez, Fodil Meraghni, Francisco Chinesta</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel paradigm in simulation-based engineering sciences by introducing a new framework called Generative Parametric Design (GPD). The GPD framework enables the generation of new designs along with their corresponding parametric solutions given as a reduced basis. To achieve this, two Rank Reduction Autoencoders (RRAEs) are employed, one for encoding and generating the design or geometry, and the other for encoding the sparse Proper Generalized Decomposition (sPGD) mode solutions. These models are linked in the latent space using regression techniques, allowing efficient transitions between design and their associated sPGD modes. By empowering design exploration and optimization, this framework also advances digital and hybrid twin development, enhancing predictive modeling and real-time decision-making in engineering applications. The developed framework is demonstrated on two-phase microstructures, in which the multiparametric solutions account for variations in two key material parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Yao, Marc Juarez</p>
<p>Abstract: Model fingerprint detection techniques have emerged as a promising approach for attributing AI-generated images to their source models, but their robustness under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models. We also identify a utility-robustness trade-off: methods with the highest attribution accuracy are often vulnerable to attacks. Although some techniques exhibit robustness in specific settings, none achieves high robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models. These findings highlight the need for techniques balancing robustness and accuracy, and identify the most promising approaches for advancing this goal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sacha Braun, David Holzm\"uller, Michael I. Jordan, Francis Bach</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating conditional coverage remains one of the most persistent challenges in assessing the reliability of predictive systems. Although conformal methods can give guarantees on marginal coverage, no method can guarantee to produce sets with correct conditional coverage, leaving practitioners without a clear way to interpret local deviations. To overcome sample-inefficiency and overfitting issues of existing metrics, we cast conditional coverage estimation as a classification problem. Conditional coverage is violated if and only if any classifier can achieve lower risk than the target coverage. Through the choice of a (proper) loss function, the resulting risk difference gives a conservative estimate of natural miscoverage measures such as L1 and L2 distance, and can even separate the effects of over- and under-coverage, and non-constant target coverages. We call the resulting family of metrics excess risk of the target coverage (ERT). We show experimentally that the use of modern classifiers provides much higher statistical power than simple classifiers underlying established metrics like CovGap. Additionally, we use our metric to benchmark different conformal prediction methods. Finally, we release an open-source package for ERT as well as previous conditional coverage metrics. Together, these contributions provide a new lens for understanding, diagnosing, and improving the conditional reliability of predictive systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Through multi-agent competition and the sparse high-level objective of winning a race, we find that both agile flight (e.g., high-speed motion pushing the platform to its physical limits) and strategy (e.g., overtaking or blocking) emerge from agents trained with reinforcement learning. We provide evidence in both simulation and the real world that this approach outperforms the common paradigm of training agents in isolation with rewards that prescribe behavior, e.g., progress on the raceline, in particular when the complexity of the environment increases, e.g., in the presence of obstacles. Moreover, we find that multi-agent competition yields policies that transfer more reliably to the real world than policies trained with a single-agent progress-based reward, despite the two methods using the same simulation environment, randomization strategy, and hardware. In addition to improved sim-to-real transfer, the multi-agent policies also exhibit some degree of generalization to opponents unseen at training time. Overall, our work, following in the tradition of multi-agent competitive game-play in digital domains, shows that sparse task-level rewards are sufficient for training agents capable of advanced low-level control in the physical world.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Adiletta, Kathryn Adiletta, Kemal Derya, Berk Sunar</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for enhanced security and privacy measures in Machine Learning (ML). LLMs are increasingly being used to process untrusted text inputs and even generate executable code, often while having access to sensitive system controls. To address these security concerns, several companies have introduced guard models, which are smaller, specialized models designed to protect text generation models from adversarial or malicious inputs. In this work, we advance the study of adversarial inputs by introducing Super Suffixes, suffixes capable of overriding multiple alignment objectives across various models with different tokenization schemes. We demonstrate their effectiveness, along with our joint optimization technique, by successfully bypassing the protection mechanisms of Llama Prompt Guard 2 on five different text generation models for malicious text and code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to reveal that Llama Prompt Guard 2 can be compromised through joint optimization.
  Additionally, by analyzing the changing similarity of a model's internal state to specific concept directions during token sequence processing, we propose an effective and lightweight method to detect Super Suffix attacks. We show that the cosine similarity between the residual stream and certain concept directions serves as a distinctive fingerprint of model intent. Our proposed countermeasure, DeltaGuard, significantly improves the detection of malicious prompts generated through Super Suffixes. It increases the non-benign classification rate to nearly 100%, making DeltaGuard a valuable addition to the guard model stack and enhancing robustness against adversarial prompt attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Particulate, a feed-forward approach that, given a single static 3D mesh of an everyday object, directly infers all attributes of the underlying articulated structure, including its 3D parts, kinematic structure, and motion constraints. At its core is a transformer network, Part Articulation Transformer, which processes a point cloud of the input mesh using a flexible and scalable architecture to predict all the aforementioned attributes with native multi-joint support. We train the network end-to-end on a diverse collection of articulated 3D assets from public datasets. During inference, Particulate lifts the network's feed-forward prediction to the input mesh, yielding a fully articulated 3D model in seconds, much faster than prior approaches that require per-object optimization. Particulate can also accurately infer the articulated structure of AI-generated 3D assets, enabling full-fledged extraction of articulated 3D objects from a single (real or synthetic) image when combined with an off-the-shelf image-to-3D generator. We further introduce a new challenging benchmark for 3D articulation estimation curated from high-quality public 3D assets, and redesign the evaluation protocol to be more consistent with human preferences. Quantitative and qualitative results show that Particulate significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: We expand the Probability Bracket Notation (PBN), a symbolic framework inspired by the Dirac notation in quantum mechanics, to multivariable probability systems and static Bayesian networks (BNs). By defining joint, marginal, and conditional probability distributions (PDs), as well as marginal and conditional expectations, we demonstrate how to express dependencies among multiple random variables and manipulate them algebraically in PBN. Using the well-known Student BN as an example of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), we illustrate how to apply PBN to analyze predictions, inferences (using both bottom-up and top-down approaches), and expectations. We then extend PBN to BNs with continuous variables. After reviewing linear Gaussian networks, we introduce a customized Healthcare BN that includes both continuous and discrete random variables, utilizes user-specific data, and provides tailored predictions via discrete-display (DD) nodes that proxy for their continuous-variable parents. Compared to traditional probability notation, PBN offers an operator-driven framework that unifies and simplifies the analysis of probabilistic models, with potential as both an educational tool and a practical platform for causal reasoning, inference, expectation, data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</p>

Employing the Difference-in-Differences method, we discovered two distinct scenarios following ChatGPT's launch: displacement effects featuring reduced work volume and earnings, exemplified by translation & localization OLM; productivity effects featuring increased work volume and earnings, exemplified by web development OLM. To understand these opposite effects in a unified framework, we developed a Cournot competition model to identify an inflection point for each market. Before this point, human workers benefit from AI enhancements; beyond this point, human workers would be replaced. Further analyzing the progression from ChatGPT 3.5 to 4.0, we found three effect scenarios, reinforcing our inflection point conjecture. Heterogeneous analyses reveal that U.S. web developers tend to benefit more from ChatGPT's launch compared to their counterparts in other regions. Experienced translators seem more likely to exit the market than less experienced translators.</p>

Constrained decoding approaches mitigate this problem by greedily restricting what tokens an LLM can output at each step to guarantee that the output matches a given constraint. Specifically, in grammar-constrained decoding (GCD), the LLM's output must follow a given grammar. In this paper, we demonstrate that GCD techniques (and in general constrained decoding techniques) can distort the LLM's distribution, leading to outputs that are grammatical but appear with likelihoods that are not proportional to the ones given by the LLM, and so ultimately are low-quality. We call the problem of aligning sampling with a grammar constraint, grammar-aligned decoding (GAD), and propose adaptive sampling with approximate expected futures (ASAp), a decoding algorithm that guarantees the output to be grammatical while provably producing outputs that match the conditional probability of the LLM's distribution conditioned on the given grammar constraint. Our algorithm uses prior sample outputs to soundly overapproximate the future grammaticality of different output prefixes. Our evaluation on code generation and structured NLP tasks shows how ASAp often produces outputs with higher likelihood (according to the LLM's distribution) than existing GCD techniques, while still enforcing the desired grammatical constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicoleta Tantalaki, Athena Vakali</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, we delegate many of our decisions to Artificial Intelligence (AI) that acts either in solo or as a human companion in decisions made to support several sensitive domains, like healthcare, financial services and law enforcement. AI systems, even carefully designed to be fair, are heavily criticized for delivering misjudged and discriminated outcomes against individuals and groups. Numerous work on AI algorithmic fairness is devoted on Machine Learning pipelines which address biases and quantify fairness under a pure computational view. However, the continuous unfair and unjust AI outcomes, indicate that there is urgent need to understand AI as a sociotechnical system, inseparable from the conditions in which it is designed, developed and deployed. Although, the synergy of humans and machines seems imperative to make AI work, the significant impact of human and societal factors on AI bias is currently overlooked. We address this critical issue by following a radical new methodology under which human cognitive biases become core entities in our AI fairness overview. Inspired by the cognitive science definition and taxonomy of human heuristics, we identify how harmful human actions influence the overall AI lifecycle, and reveal human to AI biases hidden pathways. We introduce a new mapping, which justifies the human heuristics to AI biases reflections and we detect relevant fairness intensities and inter-dependencies. We envision that this approach will contribute in revisiting AI fairness under deeper human-centric case studies, revealing hidden biases cause and effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongxian Yang, Jiayu Qian, Zegao Peng, Haoyu Zhang, Yu-An Huang, KC Tan, Zhi-An Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models excel in domains like mathematics where intermediate reasoning is straightforward to verify, but struggle to self-correct in medicine fields where evaluating intermediate reasoning is cumbersome and expensive. This verification bottleneck hinders the development of reliable AI reasoners for high-stakes application. Here we propose Med-REFL, a novel framework that learns fine-grained reflection without human labels or model distillation. Med-REFL introduces a deterministic structural assessment of the reasoning space to automatically generate preference data for reflection. By globally evaluating all explored reasoning paths in a tree-of-thoughts, our method quantifies the value of corrective actions, enabling the automated construction of direct preference optimization pairs. This trains the model to recognize and amend its own reasoning fallacies. Extensive experiments show Med-REFL delivers robust gains across diverse models architectures and medical benchmarks, boosting a general-purpose Llama3.1-8B by +5.82% and the state-of-the-art Huatuo-o1 by +4.13% on the MedQA benchmark. Our Med-REFL-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-8B models while even competing with models twice its size. Crucially, targeted ablations prove its success generalizes to other domains such as logical reasoning and mitigates the `fake reflection' phenomenon in LRMs. Ultimately, our framework provides a scalable solution to the verification bottleneck, paving the way for more reliable AI reasoners in high-stakes domains like medicine.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Wang, Junming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in business applications, particularly in enterprise decision support and strategic planning, yet current approaches often struggle to reconcile intricate operational analyses with overarching strategic goals across diverse market environments, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced collaboration across organizational levels. This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging LLMs for advanced decision-making in complex corporate environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes. Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization, supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent, client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate complex business landscapes more effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of medical benchmarks. Yet underneath the seemingly promising results lie salient growth areas, especially in cutting-edge frontiers such as multimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a series of adversarial stress tests to systematically assess the robustness of flagship models and medical benchmarks. Our study reveals prevalent brittleness in the presence of simple adversarial transformations: leading systems can guess the right answer even with key inputs removed, yet may get confused by the slightest prompt alterations, while fabricating convincing yet flawed reasoning traces. Using clinician-guided rubrics, we demonstrate that popular medical benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure. Our study reveals significant competency gaps of frontier AI in attaining real-world readiness for health applications. If we want AI to earn trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold AI systems accountable to ensure robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real medical demands.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent reasoning steps while violating simple mathematical or logical constraints. We introduce MedRule-KG, a compact typed knowledge graph coupled with a symbolic verifier, designed to enforce mathematically interpretable rules in reasoning tasks. MedRule-KG encodes entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules, while the verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee consistency. On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields 1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyang Yu, Jiayi Zhang, Huixue Su, Yufan Zhao, Yifan Wu, Mingyi Deng, Jinyu Xiang, Yizhang Lin, Lingxiao Tang, Yuyu Luo, Bang Liu, Chenglin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ha-Na Jo, Jung-Sun Lee, Eunyeong Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: Dysarthria impairs motor control of speech, often resulting in reduced intelligibility and frequent misarticulations. Although interest in brain-computer interface technologies is growing, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based communication support for individuals with dysarthria remains limited. To address this gap, we recorded EEG data from one participant with dysarthria during a Korean automatic speech task and labeled each trial as correct or misarticulated. Spectral analysis revealed that misarticulated trials exhibited elevated frontal-central delta and alpha power, along with reduced temporal gamma activity. Building on these observations, we developed a soft multitask learning framework designed to suppress these nonspecific spectral responses and incorporated a maximum mean discrepancy-based alignment module to enhance class discrimination while minimizing domain-related variability. The proposed model achieved F1-scores of 52.7 % for correct and 41.4 % for misarticulated trials-an improvement of 2 % and 11 % over the baseline-demonstrating more stable intention decoding even under articulation errors. These results highlight the potential of EEG-based assistive systems for communication in language impaired individuals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darvin Yi, Teng Liu, Mattie Terzolo, Lance Hasson, Ayan Sinha, Pablo Mendes, Andrew Rabinovich</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly undertake digital work, reliable frameworks are needed to evaluate their real-world competence, adaptability, and capacity for human collaboration. Existing benchmarks remain largely static, synthetic, or domain-limited, providing limited insight into how agents perform in dynamic, economically meaningful environments. We introduce UpBench, a dynamically evolving benchmark grounded in real jobs drawn from the global Upwork labor marketplace. Each task corresponds to a verified client transaction, anchoring evaluation in genuine work activity and financial outcomes. UpBench employs a rubric-based evaluation framework, in which expert freelancers decompose each job into detailed, verifiable acceptance criteria and assess AI submissions with per-criterion feedback. This structure enables fine-grained analysis of model strengths, weaknesses, and instruction-following fidelity beyond binary pass/fail metrics. Human expertise is integrated throughout the data pipeline (from job curation and rubric construction to evaluation) ensuring fidelity to real professional standards and supporting research on human-AI collaboration. By regularly refreshing tasks to reflect the evolving nature of online work, UpBench provides a scalable, human-centered foundation for evaluating agentic systems in authentic labor-market contexts, offering a path toward a collaborative framework, where AI amplifies human capability through partnership rather than replacement.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study how to impose domain-consistent structure on large language models (LLMs) used for scientific reasoning and early-stage drug discovery. We present MedRule-KG, a compact knowledge-graph scaffold paired with a lightweight verifier that steers generation toward mathematically and biomedically valid outputs. The system injects curated symbolic facts into prompts and then enforces rule satisfaction with a deterministic checker. We formalize generation as constrained inference, introduce a soft guidance surrogate suitable for decoding, and perform a thorough statistical analysis with uncertainty quantification. Across 90 tasks spanning reaction feasibility, metabolic compatibility, and toxicity screening, MedRule-KG reduces violation counts by 83.2\% relative to a strong chain-of-thought baseline while improving exact match. Results remain stable under stratification and scale with dataset size, and the verifier adds negligible latency, making the approach practical for interactive design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifu Guo, Zishan Xu, Zhiyuan Yao, Yuquan Lu, Jiaye Lin, Sen Hu, Zhenheng Tang, Huacan Wang, Ronghao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing multimodal reasoning models and frameworks suffer from fundamental architectural limitations: most lack the human-like ability to autonomously explore diverse reasoning pathways-whether in direct inference, tool-driven visual exploration, programmatic visual manipulation, or intrinsic visual imagination. Consequently, they struggle to adapt to dynamically changing capability requirements in real-world tasks. Meanwhile, humans exhibit a complementary set of thinking abilities when addressing such tasks, whereas existing methods typically cover only a subset of these dimensions. Inspired by this, we propose Octopus: Agentic Multimodal Reasoning with Six-Capability Orchestration, a new paradigm for multimodal agentic reasoning. We define six core capabilities essential for multimodal reasoning and organize a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, Octopus-Bench, accordingly. Octopus is capable of autonomously exploring during reasoning and dynamically selecting the most appropriate capability based on the current state. Experimental results show that Octopus achieves the best performance on the vast majority of tasks in Octopus-Bench, highlighting the crucial role of capability coordination in agentic multimodal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinpeng Wang, Chao Li, Ting Ye, Mengyuan Zhang, Wei Liu, Jian Luan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable mathematical and scientific reasoning remains an open challenge for large vision-language models. Standard final-answer evaluation often masks reasoning errors, allowing silent failures to persist. To address this gap, we introduce TRACE, a framework for Transparent Reasoning And Consistency Evaluation that diagnoses reasoning trajectories rather than only end results. At its core, TRACE leverages Auxiliary Reasoning Sets, compact sub question answer pairs that decompose complex problems, evaluate intermediate steps through consistency-based metrics, and expose failures overlooked by standard evaluation. Our experiments show that consistency across ARS correlates with final-answer correctness and helps pinpoint the reasoning steps where failures arise, offering actionable signals for model improvement. Furthermore, TRACE defines confidence regions that distinguish reliable from unreliable reasoning paths, supporting effective filtering, debugging, and model refinement.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06393">Less Is More for Multi-Step Logical Reasoning of LLM Generalisation Under Rule Removal, Paraphrasing, and Compression</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiming Bao, Xiaoxuan Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on many natural language tasks, yet their generalisation under structured perturbations of logical rule systems remains insufficiently characterised. We present a controlled evaluation framework that probes reasoning reliability through four stress tests: (1) rule deletion, removing redundant versus essential rules from a multi-step inference chain; (2) contradictory evidence injection; (3) logic-preserving rewrites based on equivalence laws (contraposition, double negation, implication-to-disjunction, De Morgan, identity, and commutativity); and (4) multi-law equivalence stacking that composes 2--5 transformations. Across three representative model families -- BERT, Qwen2, and LLaMA-like models -- all models attain Acc$=1.0000$ on the base split and show no degradation under redundant rule deletion. In contrast, essential rule deletion yields a pronounced decrease to near-chance performance, and injecting explicit contradictions reduces accuracy to 0.0000. Under logic-preserving rewrites, accuracy is largely preserved for single-law transformations with only small degradations in a few cases, whereas multi-law stacking exposes model-dependent sensitivity: BERT matches the base condition, TinyLlama shows only marginal degradation, and Qwen2 exhibits a substantial drop.
  Overall, the results indicate that contemporary LLMs are generally stable under semantic-preserving reformulations, yet remain brittle to missing or inconsistent evidence and may degrade under composed logical transformations depending on the model family. The proposed framework provides a concise diagnostic tool for isolating these failure modes and for evaluating logical generalisation beyond surface-form variation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical care follows complex clinical pathways that extend beyond isolated physician-patient encounters, emphasizing decision-making and transitions between different stages. Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical scenarios. We introduce CP-Env, a controllable agentic hospital environment designed to evaluate LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways. CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios ranging from triage and specialist consultation to diagnostic testing and multidisciplinary team meetings for agent interaction. Following real hospital adaptive flow of healthcare, it enables branching, long-horizon task execution. We propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics. Results reveal that most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. Interestingly, excessive reasoning steps can sometimes prove counterproductive, while top models tend to exhibit reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge. CP-Env advances medical AI agents development through comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waleed Razzaq, Izis Kanjaraway, Yun-Bo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention improves representation learning over RNNs, but its discrete nature limits continuous-time (CT) modeling. We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \textit{content-target} and \textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared with several CT baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lim Chien Her, Ming Yan, Yunshu Bai, Ruihao Li, Hao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) offers scalable methods for algorithmically creating complex, customizable worlds. However, controlling these pipelines requires the precise configuration of opaque technical parameters. We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiteng Zhao, Junhao Shen, Yiming Zhang, Songyang Gao, Kuikun Liu, Tianyou Ma, Fan Zheng, Dahua Lin, Wenwei Zhang, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems. However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ishaan Kaushal, Amaresh Chakrabarti</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Unified Smart Factory Model (USFM), a comprehensive framework designed to translate high-level sustainability goals into measurable factory-level indicators with a systematic information map of manufacturing activities. The manufacturing activities were modelled as set of manufacturing, assembly and auxiliary processes using Object Process Methodology, a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) language. USFM integrates Manufacturing Process and System, Data Process, and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Selection and Assessment in a single framework. Through a detailed case study of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly factory, the paper demonstrates how environmental sustainability KPIs can be selected, modelled, and mapped to the necessary data, highlighting energy consumption and environmental impact metrics. The model's systematic approach can reduce redundancy, minimize the risk of missing critical information, and enhance data collection. The paper concluded that the USFM bridges the gap between sustainability goals and practical implementation, providing significant benefits for industries specifically SMEs aiming to achieve sustainability targets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Lu, Yao Zhu, Jindong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) mines activity patterns from the time-series sensory data. In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR. Our implementation is released and can be found at https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/HAROOD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyed S. Mohammadi, Nuno F. Duarte, Dimitris Dimou, Yiming Wang, Matteo Taiana, Pietro Morerio, Atabak Dehban, Plinio Moreno, Alexandre Bernardino, Alessio Del Bue, Jose Santos-Victor</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world robotic grasping can be done robustly if a complete 3D Point Cloud Data (PCD) of an object is available. However, in practice, PCDs are often incomplete when objects are viewed from few and sparse viewpoints before the grasping action, leading to the generation of wrong or inaccurate grasp poses. We propose a novel grasping strategy, named 3DSGrasp, that predicts the missing geometry from the partial PCD to produce reliable grasp poses. Our proposed PCD completion network is a Transformer-based encoder-decoder network with an Offset-Attention layer. Our network is inherently invariant to the object pose and point's permutation, which generates PCDs that are geometrically consistent and completed properly. Experiments on a wide range of partial PCD show that 3DSGrasp outperforms the best state-of-the-art method on PCD completion tasks and largely improves the grasping success rate in real-world scenarios. The code and dataset will be made available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianlv Chen, Shitao Xiao, Peitian Zhang, Kun Luo, Defu Lian, Zheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new embedding model called M3-Embedding, which is distinguished for its versatility in \textit{Multi-Linguality}, \textit{Multi-Functionality}, and \textit{Multi-Granularity}. It provides a uniform support for the semantic retrieval of more than 100 working languages. It can simultaneously accomplish the three common retrieval functionalities: dense retrieval, multi-vector retrieval, and sparse retrieval. Besides, it is also capable of processing inputs of different granularities, spanning from short sentences to long documents of up to 8,192 tokens. The effective training of M3-Embedding presents a series of technical contributions. Notably, we propose a novel self-knowledge distillation approach, where the relevance scores from different retrieval functionalities can be integrated as the teacher signal to enhance the training quality. We also optimize the batching strategy, which enables a large batch size and high training throughput to improve the discriminativeness of embeddings. M3-Embedding exhibits a superior performance in our experiment, leading to new state-of-the-art results on multilingual, cross-lingual, and long-document retrieval benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Areej Alsaafin, Abubakr Shafique, Saghir Alfasly, Krishna R. Kalari, H. R. Tizhoosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with healthcare data is rapidly transforming medical diagnostics and driving progress toward precision medicine. However, effectively leveraging multimodal data, particularly digital pathology whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic sequencing, remains a significant challenge due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of these modalities and the need for scalable and interpretable frameworks. Existing diagnostic models typically operate on unimodal data, overlooking critical cross-modal interactions that can yield richer clinical insights. We introduce MarbliX (Multimodal Association and Retrieval with Binary Latent Indexed matriX), a self-supervised framework that learns to embed WSIs and immunogenomic profiles into compact, scalable binary codes, termed ``monogram.'' By optimizing a triplet contrastive objective across modalities, MarbliX captures high-resolution patient similarity in a unified latent space, enabling efficient retrieval of clinically relevant cases and facilitating case-based reasoning. \textcolor{black}{In lung cancer, MarbliX achieves 85-89\% across all evaluation metrics, outperforming histopathology (69-71\%) and immunogenomics (73-76\%). In kidney cancer, real-valued monograms yield the strongest performance (F1: 80-83\%, Accuracy: 87-90\%), with binary monograms slightly lower (F1: 78-82\%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyang Qiao, Zhizhong Zhang, Xin Tan, Yanyun Qu, Shouhong Ding, Yuan Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Instruction Tuning (CIT) is adopted to continually instruct Large Models to follow human intent data by data. It is observed that existing gradient update would heavily destroy the performance on previous datasets during CIT process. Instead, Exponential Moving Average (EMA), owns the ability to trace previous parameters, which can aid in decreasing forgetting. Nonetheless, its stable balance weight fails to deal with the ever-changing datasets, leading to the out-of-balance between plasticity and stability. In this paper, we propose a general continual instruction tuning framework to address the challenge. Starting from the trade-off prerequisite and EMA update, we propose the plasticity and stability ideal condition. Based on Taylor expansion in the loss function, we find the optimal balance weight can be automatically determined by the gradients and learned parameters. Therefore, we propose a stable-plasticity balanced coefficient to avoid knowledge interference. Based on the semantic similarity of the instructions, we can determine whether to retrain or expand the training parameters and allocate the most suitable parameters for the testing instances. Extensive experiments across multiple continual instruction tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only enhances anti-forgetting capabilities but also significantly improves overall continual tuning performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Hegde, Satyajeet Das, Gautam Salhotra, Gaurav S. Sukhatme</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has become a promising approach for both manipulation and locomotion. Diffusion models are now widely used to train large, generalized policies that predict controls or trajectories, leveraging their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, this generality comes at the cost of larger model sizes and slower inference, an acute limitation for robotic tasks requiring high control frequencies. Moreover, Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular trajectory-generation approach, suffers from a trade-off between performance and action horizon: fewer diffusion queries lead to larger trajectory chunks, which in turn accumulate tracking errors. To overcome these challenges, we introduce WARPD (World model Assisted Reactive Policy Diffusion), a method that generates closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) directly, instead of open-loop trajectories. By learning behavioral distributions in parameter space rather than trajectory space, WARPD offers two major advantages: (1) extended action horizons with robustness to perturbations, while maintaining high task performance, and (2) significantly reduced inference costs. Empirically, WARPD outperforms DP in long-horizon and perturbed environments, and achieves multitask performance on par with DP while requiring only ~ 1/45th of the inference-time FLOPs per step.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyun Xu, Zhuoran Liu, Stefanos Koffas, Stjepan Picek</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research on backdoor stealthiness focuses mainly on indistinguishable triggers in input space and inseparable backdoor representations in feature space, aiming to circumvent backdoor defenses that examine these respective spaces. However, existing backdoor attacks are typically designed to resist a specific type of backdoor defense without considering the diverse range of defense mechanisms. Based on this observation, we pose a natural question: Are current backdoor attacks truly a real-world threat when facing diverse practical defenses?
  To answer this question, we examine 12 common backdoor attacks that focus on input-space or feature-space stealthiness and 17 diverse representative defenses. Surprisingly, we reveal a critical blind spot: Backdoor attacks designed to be stealthy in input and feature spaces can be mitigated by examining backdoored models in parameter space. To investigate the underlying causes behind this common vulnerability, we study the characteristics of backdoor attacks in the parameter space. Notably, we find that input- and feature-space attacks introduce prominent backdoor-related neurons in parameter space, which are not thoroughly considered by current backdoor attacks. Taking comprehensive stealthiness into account, we propose a novel supply-chain attack called Grond. Grond limits the parameter changes by a simple yet effective module, Adversarial Backdoor Injection (ABI), which adaptively increases the parameter-space stealthiness during the backdoor injection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grond outperforms all 12 backdoor attacks against state-of-the-art (including adaptive) defenses on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and a subset of ImageNet. In addition, we show that ABI consistently improves the effectiveness of common backdoor attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mumin Jia, Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: Human cognition is punctuated by abrupt, spontaneous shifts between topics-driven by emotional, contextual, or associative cues-a phenomenon known as spontaneous thought in neuroscience. In contrast, self-attention based models depend on structured patterns over their inputs to predict each next token, lacking spontaneity. Motivated by this distinction, we characterize spontaneous topic changes in self-attention architectures, revealing both their similarities and their divergences from spontaneous human thought. First, we establish theoretical results under a simplified, single-layer self-attention model with suitable conditions by defining the topic as a set of Token Priority Graphs (TPGs). Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) the model maintains the priority order of tokens related to the input topic, (2) a spontaneous topic change can occur only if lower-priority tokens outnumber all higher-priority tokens of the input topic, and (3) unlike human cognition, the longer context length or the more ambiguous input topic reduces the likelihood of spontaneous change. Second, we empirically validate that these dynamics persist in modern, state-of-the-art LLMs, underscoring a fundamental disparity between human cognition and AI behaviour in the context of spontaneous topic changes. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored these questions with a focus as closely aligned to human thought.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nasim Soltani, Michael Loehning, Kaushik Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native receivers prove significant performance improvement in high noise regimes and can potentially reduce communication overhead compared to the traditional receiver. However, their performance highly depends on the representativeness of the training dataset. A major issue is the uncertainty of whether the training dataset covers all test environments and waveform configurations, and thus, whether the trained model is robust in practical deployment conditions. To this end, we propose a joint measurement-recovery framework for AI-native transceivers post deployment, called VERITAS, that continuously looks for distribution shifts in the received signals and triggers finite re-training spurts. VERITAS monitors the wireless channel using 5G pilots fed to an auxiliary neural network that detects out-of-distribution channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread. As soon as such a change is detected, a traditional (reference) receiver is activated, which runs for a period of time in parallel to the AI-native receiver. Finally, VERTIAS compares the bit probabilities of the AI-native and the reference receivers for the same received data inputs, and decides whether or not a retraining process needs to be initiated. Our evaluations reveal that VERITAS can detect changes in the channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread with 99%, 97%, and 69% accuracies, respectively, followed by timely initiation of retraining for 86%, 93.3%, and 94.8% of inputs in channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread test sets, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has established discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm for speech representation. These tokens, characterized by their discrete, compact, and concise nature, are not only advantageous for efficient transmission and storage, but also inherently compatible with the language modeling framework, enabling seamless integration of speech into text-dominated LLM architectures. Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: acoustic tokens and semantic tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches. This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types. Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aircraft manufacturing is the jewel in the crown of industry, in which generating high-fidelity airfoil geometries with controllable and editable representations remains a fundamental challenge. Existing deep learning methods, which typically rely on predefined parametric representations (e.g., B\'ezier) or discrete point sets, face an inherent trade-off between expressive power and resolution adaptability. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FuncGenFoil, a novel function-space generative model that directly reconstructs airfoil geometries as function curves. Our method inherits the advantages of arbitrary-resolution sampling and smoothness from parametric functions, as well as the strong expressiveness of discrete point-based representations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FuncGenFoil improves upon state-of-the-art methods in airfoil generation, achieving a relative 74.4% reduction in label error and a 23.2% increase in diversity on the AF-200K dataset. Our results highlight the advantages of function-space modeling for aerodynamic shape optimization, offering a powerful and flexible framework for high-fidelity airfoil design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Chhikara</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable proficiency in natural language tasks, yet their frequent overconfidence-misalignment between predicted confidence and true correctness-poses significant risks in critical decision-making applications. We present a comprehensive analysis on calibration in LLMs across nine LLMs and three factual Question-Answering (QA) datasets, systematically comparing standard free-generation settings against structured distractor-augmented prompts. Our evaluation reveals that explicitly incorporating distractors can substantially mitigate miscalibration, achieving relative accuracy improvements up to 460% and ECE reductions up to 90%. Despite general trends, we uncover nuanced findings: large RLHF-tuned models display inherent calibration strengths but can paradoxically suffer increased miscalibration on easier queries, whereas smaller models benefit disproportionately from distractor prompts but remain significantly miscalibrated. Through detailed analyses across question types, we identify persistent calibration failures, particularly in person-based queries. We conclude with concrete recommendations-targeted fine-tuning, structured prompting, and strategic model choice-to ensure reliable, trustworthy LLM deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Peyrard, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Statistical inference, a central tool of science, revolves around the study and the usage of statistical estimators: functions that map finite samples to predictions about unknown distribution parameters. In the frequentist framework, estimators are evaluated based on properties such as bias, variance (for parameter estimation), accuracy, power, and calibration (for hypothesis testing). However, crafting estimators with desirable properties is often analytically challenging, and sometimes impossible, e.g., there exists no universally unbiased estimator for the standard deviation. In this work, we introduce meta-statistical learning, an amortized learning framework that recasts estimator design as an optimization problem via supervised learning. This takes a fully empirical approach to discovering statistical estimators; entire datasets are input to permutation-invariant neural networks, such as Set Transformers, trained to predict the target statistical property. The trained model is the estimator, and can be analyzed through the classical frequentist lens. We demonstrate the approach on two tasks: learning a normality test (classification) and estimating mutual information (regression), achieving strong results even with small models. Looking ahead, this paradigm opens a path to automate the discovery of generalizable and flexible statistical estimators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhewei Kang, Xuandong Zhao, Dawn Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Best-of-N selection is a key technique for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through increased test-time computation. Current state-of-the-art methods often employ computationally intensive reward models for response evaluation and selection. Reward-free alternatives, like self-consistency and universal self-consistency, are limited in their ability to handle open-ended generation tasks or scale effectively. To address these limitations, we propose self-certainty, a novel and efficient metric that leverages the inherent probability distribution of LLM outputs to estimate response quality without requiring external reward models. We hypothesize that higher distributional self-certainty, aggregated across multiple samples, correlates with improved response accuracy, as it reflects greater confidence in the generated output. Through extensive experiments on various reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that self-certainty (1) scales effectively with increasing sample size N, akin to reward models but without the computational overhead; (2) complements chain-of-thought, improving reasoning performance beyond greedy decoding; and (3) generalizes to open-ended tasks where traditional self-consistency methods fall short. Our findings establish self-certainty as a practical and efficient way for improving LLM reasoning capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/backprop07/Self-Certainty</p>

<p>Abstract: Holistic 3D modeling of molecularly defined brain structures is crucial for understanding complex brain functions. Using emerging tissue profiling technologies, researchers charted comprehensive atlases of mammalian brain with sub-cellular resolution and spatially resolved transcriptomic data. However, these tera-scale volumetric atlases pose computational challenges for modeling intricate brain structures within the native spatial context. We propose \textbf{Tera-MIND}, a novel generative framework capable of simulating \textbf{Tera}-scale \textbf{M}ouse bra\textbf{IN}s in 3D using a patch-based and boundary-aware \textbf{D}iffusion model. Taking spatial gene expression as conditional input, we generate virtual mouse brains with comprehensive cellular morphological detail at teravoxel scale. Through the lens of 3D \textit{gene}-\textit{gene} self-attention, we identify spatial molecular interactions for key transcriptomic pathways, including glutamatergic and dopaminergic neuronal systems. Lastly, we showcase the translational applicability of Tera-MIND on previously unseen human brain samples.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roham Koohestani, Philippe de Bekker, Beg\"um Ko\c{c}, Maliheh Izadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for unified evaluation and reproducibility. The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering (AI4SE) has produced numerous benchmarks for tasks such as code generation and bug repair. However, this proliferation has led to major challenges: (1) fragmented knowledge across tasks, (2) difficulty in selecting contextually relevant benchmarks, (3) lack of standardization in benchmark creation, and (4) flaws that limit utility. Addressing these requires a dual approach: systematically mapping existing benchmarks for informed selection and defining unified guidelines for robust, adaptable benchmark development.
  We conduct a review of 247 studies, identifying 273 AI4SE benchmarks since 2014. We categorize them, analyze limitations, and expose gaps in current practices. Building on these insights, we introduce BenchScout, an extensible semantic search tool for locating suitable benchmarks. BenchScout employs automated clustering with contextual embeddings of benchmark-related studies, followed by dimensionality reduction. In a user study with 22 participants, BenchScout achieved usability, effectiveness, and intuitiveness scores of 4.5, 4.0, and 4.1 out of 5.
  To improve benchmarking standards, we propose BenchFrame, a unified framework for enhancing benchmark quality. Applying BenchFrame to HumanEval yielded HumanEvalNext, featuring corrected errors, improved language conversion, higher test coverage, and greater difficulty. Evaluating 10 state-of-the-art code models on HumanEval, HumanEvalPlus, and HumanEvalNext revealed average pass-at-1 drops of 31.22% and 19.94%, respectively, underscoring the need for continuous benchmark refinement. We further examine BenchFrame's scalability through an agentic pipeline and confirm its generalizability on the MBPP dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuting Hu, Chenhui Xu, Ruiyang Qin, Dancheng Liu, Amir Nassereldine, Yiyu Shi, Jinjun Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial perception deficits can compromise autonomous vehicle safety by disrupting environmental understanding. Existing protocols typically default to entirely risk-avoidant actions such as immediate stops, which are detrimental to navigation goals and lack flexibility for rare driving scenarios. Yet, in cases of minor risk, halting the vehicle may be unnecessary, and more adaptive responses are preferable. In this paper, we propose LLM-RCO, a risk-averse framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to integrate human-like driving commonsense into autonomous systems facing perception deficits. LLM-RCO features four key modules interacting with the dynamic driving environment: hazard inference, short-term motion planner, action condition verifier, and safety constraint generator, enabling proactive and context-aware actions in such challenging conditions. To enhance the driving decision-making of LLMs, we construct DriveLM-Deficit, a dataset of 53,895 video clips featuring deficits of safety-critical objects, annotated for LLM fine-tuning in hazard detection and motion planning. Extensive experiments in adverse driving conditions with the CARLA simulator demonstrate that LLM-RCO promotes proactive maneuvers over purely risk-averse actions in perception deficit scenarios, underscoring its value for boosting autonomous driving resilience against perception loss challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhoutong Ye, Mingze Sun, Huan-ang Gao, Xutong Wang, Xiangyang Wang, Yu Mei, Chang Liu, Qinwei Li, Chengwen Zhang, Qinghuan Lan, Chun Yu, Yuanchun Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential as generalists in vision-language (VL) tasks. However, adoption of LMMs in real-world tasks is hindered by their poor performance in tasks that require a combination of VL capabilities, as well as in tasks that involve the grounding of complex text or visual instructions. To thoroughly investigate this gap and its underlying causes, we propose MOAT, a diverse benchmark with 1005 complex real-world vision questions that are straightforward for humans but challenging for LMMs. Specifically, the tasks in MOAT require LMMs to engage in generalist problem solving by integrating VL capabilities such as reading text, counting, understanding spatial relations, grounding textual and visual instructions, etc. All these abilities fit into a taxonomy proposed by us that contains 9 VL capabilities, enabling MOAT to provide a fine-grained view of LMMs' strengths and weaknesses. Besides, MOAT is the first benchmark to explicitly evaluate LMMs' ability to ground complex text and visual instructions, which is essential for many real-world applications. We evaluated 17 proprietary and open source LMMs, finding that the best performing LMM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieved only 44% accuracy, far below what would be acceptable in real-world applications. To guide future model development, we analyze common trends in our results and discuss the underlying causes of poor performance, focusing on the impact of text-centric reasoning, which VL capabilities form bottlenecks in complex tasks, and the potential harmful effects of tiling.

<p>Abstract: To address the bottleneck of accurate user intent interpretation within the current video generation community, we present Any2Caption, a novel framework for controllable video generation under any condition. The key idea is to decouple various condition interpretation steps from the video synthesis step. By leveraging modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), Any2Caption interprets diverse inputs--text, images, videos, and specialized cues such as region, motion, and camera poses--into dense, structured captions that offer backbone video generators with better guidance. We also introduce Any2CapIns, a large-scale dataset with 337K instances and 407K conditions for any-condition-to-caption instruction tuning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate significant improvements of our system in controllability and video quality across various aspects of existing video generation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Wang, Junda Wu, Yu Xia, Tong Yu, Ruiyi Zhang, Ryan Rossi, Subrata Mitra, Lina Yao, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to indirect prompt injection attacks, in which the model inadvertently responds to task messages injected within the prompt context. This vulnerability stems from LLMs' inability to distinguish between data and instructions within a prompt. In this paper, we propose CachePrune, a defense method that identifies and prunes task-triggering neurons from the KV cache of the input prompt context. By pruning such neurons, we encourage the LLM to interpret the input prompt context purely as data rather than as cues for instruction following. To identify these neurons, we introduce a neural attribution mechanism guided by a preferential attribution loss, which enables effective attribution with only a few samples while preserving response quality after pruning. We further enhance the efficacy of neural attribution by leveraging an observed triggering effect inherent in the model's response generation behavior. Notably, our approach does not impose additional formatting on the prompt or introduce extra test-time LLM calls. Experiments show that CachePrune can significantly reduce attack success rates while maintaining clean response quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: The SPARQL query language is the standard method to access knowledge graphs (KGs). However, formulating SPARQL queries is a significant challenge for non-expert users, and remains time-consuming for the experienced ones. Best practices recommend to document KGs with competency questions and example queries to contextualise the knowledge they contain and illustrate their potential applications. In practice, however, this is either not the case or the examples are provided in limited numbers. Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used in conversational agents and are proving to be an attractive solution with a wide range of applications, from simple question-answering about common knowledge to generating code in a targeted programming language. However, training and testing these models to produce high quality SPARQL queries from natural language questions requires substantial datasets of question-query pairs. In this paper, we present Q${}^2$Forge that addresses the challenge of generating new competency questions for a KG and corresponding SPARQL queries. It iteratively validates those queries with human feedback and LLM as a judge. Q${}^2$Forge is open source, generic, extensible and modular, meaning that the different modules of the application (CQ generation, query generation and query refinement) can be used separately, as an integrated pipeline, or replaced by alternative services. The result is a complete pipeline from competency question formulation to query evaluation, supporting the creation of reference query sets for any target KG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanyu Liu, Ge Li, Jia Li, Hao Zhu, Kechi Zhang, Yihong Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question. Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks) suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2) Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3) Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control, making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.
  To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLMs reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification, and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.
  We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying difficulty. It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with problem difficulty. We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B. We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of +14.0 and +28.1, respectively. (2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench). (3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%. We release the source code, data, and models to support future research.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00731">iPINNER: An Iterative Physics-Informed Neural Network with Ensemble Kalman Filter</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Binghang Lu, Changhong Mou, Guang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical laws into the training process. However, the performance of PINNs is often hindered in real-world scenarios involving noisy observational data and missing physics, particularly in inverse problems. In this work, we propose an iterative multi-objective PINN ensemble Kalman filter (iPINNER) framework that improves the robustness and accuracy of PINNs in both forward and inverse problems by using the \textit{ensemble Kalman filter} and the \textit{non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm} III (NSGA-III). Specifically, NSGA-III is used as a multi-objective optimizer that can generate various ensemble members of PINNs along the optimal Pareto front, while accounting the model uncertainty in the solution space. These ensemble members are then utilized within the EnKF to assimilate noisy observational data. The EnKF's analysis is subsequently used to refine the data loss component for retraining the PINNs, thereby iteratively updating their parameters. The iterative procedure generates improved solutions to the PDEs. The proposed method is tested on two benchmark problems: the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed diffusion-wave equation (TFMDWE). The numerical results show it outperforms standard PINNs in handling noisy data and missing physics.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present MoCA-Video, a training-free framework for semantic mixing in videos. Operating in the latent space of a frozen video diffusion model, MoCA-Video utilizes class-agnostic segmentation with diagonal denoising scheduler to localize and track the target object across frames. To ensure temporal stability under semantic shifts, we introduce momentum-based correction to approximate novel hybrid distributions beyond trained data distribution, alongside a light gamma residual module that smooths out visual artifacts. We evaluate model's performance using SSIM, LPIPS, and a proposed metric, \metricnameabbr, which quantifies semantic alignment between reference and output. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our model consistently outperforms both training-free and trained baselines, achieving superior semantic mixing and temporal coherence without retraining. Results establish that structured manipulation of diffusion noise trajectories enables controllable and high-quality video editing under semantic shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Annabelle Sujun Tang, Christopher Priebe, Rohan Mahapatra, Lianhui Qin, Hadi Esmaeilzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread accessibility and rapid innovation. Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimizations to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed Reasoning Compiler) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-informed transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback. MCTS incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tommaso Belvedere (RAINBOW, IRISA), Michael Ziegltrum (UCL), Giulio Turrisi (IIT), Valerio Modugno (UCL)</p>
<p>Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time, highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands. This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency operation suitable for complex robotic systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions and objects of similar appearance, where avoiding double counting and identifying reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model, to enable automated open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for this novel task built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

<p>Abstract: Segmentation Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly advanced grounded visual understanding, yet they remain prone to pixel-grounding hallucinations, producing masks for incorrect objects or for objects that are entirely absent. Existing evaluations rely almost entirely on text- or label-based perturbations, which check only whether the predicted mask matches the queried label. Such evaluations overlook the spatial footprint and severity of hallucination and therefore fail to reveal vision-driven hallucinations, which are more challenging and more prevalent. To address this gap, we formalize the task of Counterfactual Segmentation Reasoning (CSR), where a model must segment the referenced object in the factual image and abstain in its counterfactual counterpart. To support this task, we curate HalluSegBench, the first large-scale benchmark to diagnose referring and reasoning expression segmentation hallucinations using controlled visual counterfactuals, alongside new evaluation metrics that measure hallucination severity and disentangle vision- and language-driven failure modes. We further introduce RobustSeg, a segmentation VLM trained with counterfactual fine-tuning (CFT) to learn when to segment and when to abstain. Experimental results confirm RobustSeg reduces hallucinations by 30%, while improving segmentation performance on FP-RefCOCO(+/g).</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, current benchmarks fall short in evaluating their scalability, robustness, and coordination capabilities in complex, dynamic, real-world tasks. Existing environments typically focus on small-scale, fully observable, or low-complexity domains, limiting their utility for developing and assessing next-generation multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks. We introduce CREW-Wildfire, an open-source benchmark designed to close this gap. Built atop the human-AI teaming CREW simulation platform, CREW-Wildfire offers procedurally generated wildfire response scenarios featuring large maps, heterogeneous agents, partial observability, stochastic dynamics, and long-horizon planning objectives. The environment supports both low-level control and high-level natural language interactions through modular Perception and Execution modules. We implement and evaluate several state-of-the-art LLM-based multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks, uncovering significant performance gaps that highlight the unsolved challenges in large-scale coordination, communication, spatial reasoning, and long-horizon planning under uncertainty. By providing more realistic complexity, scalable architecture, and behavioral evaluation metrics, CREW-Wildfire establishes a critical foundation for advancing research in scalable multi-agent Agentic intelligence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suzie Kim, Hye-Bin Shin, Seong-Whan Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation, rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback (RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous, implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2 robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Li, Hongjian Dou, Zhenyu Zhang, Kai Li, Shaoguo Liu, Tingting Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work, we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities. Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.</p>

Using the large-scale OULAD dataset, we simulate a privacy-centric scenario where models are trained on early academic performance and digital engagement patterns. Our work investigates the practical trade-offs between model complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and the impact of local data balancing. The resulting federated model achieves strong predictive power (ROC AUC approximately 85%), demonstrating that FL is a practical and scalable solution for early-warning systems that inherently respects student data sovereignty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushan Mitra, Dan Zhang, Hannah Kim, Estevam Hruschka</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines, in terms of plan preference. We further demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable component for improving agentic planning in open-domain dialogue systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huy Le, Nhat Chung, Tung Kieu, Jingkang Yang, Ngan Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Hicham Masri, Filipe R. Cogo, Abdul Ali Bangash, Bram Adams, Ahmed E. Hassan</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid adoption of foundation models (e.g., large language models) has given rise to promptware, i.e., software built using natural language prompts. Effective management of prompts, such as organization and quality assurance, is essential yet challenging. In this study, we perform an empirical analysis of 24,800 open-source prompts from 92 GitHub repositories to investigate prompt management practices and quality attributes. Our findings reveal critical challenges such as considerable inconsistencies in prompt formatting, substantial internal and external prompt duplication, and frequent readability and spelling issues. Based on these findings, we provide actionable recommendations for developers to enhance the usability and maintainability of open-source prompts within the rapidly evolving promptware ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Math, Rainer Lienhart</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences where outcome labels such as diseases or system failures arise from preceding events like symptoms or error codes is critical. Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghui Wu, Zhen Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates multimodal semantic non-orthogonal transmission and fusion in hybrid analog-digital massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). A Transformer-based cross-modal source-channel semantic-aware network (CSC-SA-Net) framework is conceived, where channel state information (CSI) reference signal (RS), feedback, analog-beamforming/combining, and baseband semantic processing are data-driven end-to-end (E2E) optimized at the base station (BS) and user equipments (UEs). CSC-SA-Net comprises five sub-networks: BS-side CSI-RS network (BS-CSIRS-Net), UE-side channel semantic-aware network (UE-CSANet), BS-CSANet, UE-side multimodal semantic fusion network (UE-MSFNet), and BS-MSFNet. Specifically, we firstly E2E train BS-CSIRS-Net, UE-CSANet, and BS-CSANet to jointly design CSI-RS, feedback, analog-beamforming/combining with maximum {\emph{physical-layer's}} spectral-efficiency. Meanwhile, we E2E train UE-MSFNet and BS-MSFNet for optimizing {\emph{application-layer's}} source semantic downstream tasks. On these pre-trained models, we further integrate application-layer semantic processing with physical-layer tasks to E2E train five subnetworks. Extensive simulations show that the proposed CSC-SA-Net outperforms traditional separated designs, revealing the advantage of cross-modal channel-source semantic fusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albina Klepach, Egor E. Nuzhin, Alexey A. Tsukanov, Nikolay V. Brilliantov</p>
<p>Abstract: Manipulation of large systems of active particles is a serious challenge across diverse domains, including crowd management, control of robotic swarms, and coordinated material transport. The development of advanced control strategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of scalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the need of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves controlling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents tend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy for a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces acting on the system. To describe the guidance of active particles by a leader we introduce the generalized Vicsek model. This novel method is then applied to the problem of the effective evacuation by a robot-rescuer (leader) of large groups of people from hazardous places. We demonstrate, that while a straightforward application of RL yields suboptimal results, even for advanced architectures, our approach provides a robust and efficient evacuation strategy.

<p>Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions (e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at 130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens), models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training. Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks. These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoqiang Kang, Yizhe Zhang, Nikki Lijing Kuang, Nicklas Majamaki, Navdeep Jaitly, Yi-An Ma, Lianhui Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Lee, Ian Chuang, Dechen Gao, Kai Fukazawa, Iman Soltani</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.52x improvement in sample efficiency and can solve challenging tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark that the baseline fails to learn, without modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyao Ai, Yichen Tang, Changyue Wang, Jianming Long, Weihang Su, Yiqun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore how physical scale and population size shape the emergence of complex behaviors in open-ended ecological environments. In our setting, agents are unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but instead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and selection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population around them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single high-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve across large populations due to natural competition and environmental pressures. We use modern hardware along with a new multi-agent simulator to scale the environment and population to sizes much larger than previously attempted, reaching populations of over 60,000 agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We identify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction, vision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival pressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the emergence of these behaviors and find that some of them appear only in sufficiently large environments and populations, and that larger scales increase the stability and consistency of these emergent behaviors. While there is a rich history of research in evolutionary settings, our scaling results on modern hardware provide promising new directions to explore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of increasingly abundant computational resources and efficient machine frameworks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyuan Zhai, Jiacheng Cui, Zhehao Zhang, Junyu Xue, Yang Deng, Kui Wu, Guoming Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-domain HVAC energy prediction is essential for scalable building energy management, particularly because collecting extensive labeled data for every new building is both costly and impractical. Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shibing Mo, Haoyang Ruan, Kai Wu, Jing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities, but aligning their outputs with human preferences typically requires expensive supervised fine-tuning. Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander W. Goodall, Edwin Hamel-De le Court, Francesco Belardinelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huawei Zhang, Chunwei Xia, Zheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) underpin emerging mobile and embedded AI applications like meeting and video summarization and document analysis, which often require processing multiple long-context inputs. Running an LM locally on-device improves privacy, enables offline use, and reduces cost, but long-context inference quickly hits a \emph{memory capacity wall} as the key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with context length and batch size. Existing KV-cache offloading schemes are designed to transfer cache data from GPU memory to CPU memory; however, they are not suitable for embedded and mobile systems, where the CPU and GPU (or NPU) typically share a unified memory and the non-volatile secondary storage (disk) offers limited I/O bandwidth. We present KVSwap, a software framework tailored for local devices that achieves high memory efficiency while effectively leveraging disk storage. KVSwap stores the full cache on disk, uses highly compact in-memory metadata to predict which entries to preload, overlaps computation with hardware-aware disk access, and orchestrates read patterns to match storage device characteristics. Our evaluation shows that across representative LMs and storage types, KVSwap delivers higher throughput under tight memory budgets while maintaining generation quality over existing KV cache offloading schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm in image generation. Discretizing image data into tokens is a critical step for effectively integrating images with Transformer and other architectures. Although the Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCM) pioneered the use of pre-trained diffusion models for image tokenization, it strictly relies on the traditional discrete-time DDPM architecture. Consequently, it fails to adapt to modern continuous-time variants-such as Flow Matching and Consistency Models-and suffers from inefficient sampling in high-noise regions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Generalized Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (gDDCM). We establish a unified theoretical framework and introduce a generic "De-noise and Back-trace" sampling strategy. By integrating a deterministic ODE denoising step with a residual-aligned noise injection step, our method resolves the challenge of adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce a backtracking parameter $p$ and significantly enhance tokenization ability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and LSUN Bedroom datasets demonstrate that gDDCM achieves comprehensive compatibility with mainstream diffusion variants and significantly outperforms DDCM in terms of reconstruction quality and perceptual fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiuxiu Qi, Yu Yang, Jiannong Cao, Luyao Bai, Chongshan Fan, Chengtai Cao, Hongpeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunyun Wang, Zheng Duan, Xinyue Liao, Ke-Jia Chen, Songcan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) tackles the realistic scenario where deployed models encounter both domain shifts and novel object categories. Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate modeling of time-varying underwater acoustic channels is essential for the design, evaluation, and deployment of reliable underwater communication systems. Conventional physics models require detailed environmental knowledge, while stochastic replay methods are constrained by the limited diversity of measured channels and often fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, reducing their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose StableUASim, a pre-trained conditional latent diffusion surrogate model that captures the stochastic dynamics of underwater acoustic communication channels. Leveraging generative modeling, StableUASim produces diverse and statistically realistic channel realizations, while supporting conditional generation from specific measurement samples. Pre-training enables rapid adaptation to new environments using minimal additional data, and the autoencoder latent representation facilitates efficient channel analysis and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that StableUASim accurately reproduces key channel characteristics and communication performance, providing a scalable, data-efficient, and physically consistent surrogate model for both system design and machine learning-driven underwater applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with reward models has advanced alignment of generative models to human aesthetic and perceptual preferences. However, jointly optimizing multiple rewards often incurs an alignment tax, improving one dimension while degrading others. To address this, we introduce two complementary methods: MapReduce LoRA and Reward-aware Token Embedding (RaTE). MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them to refine a shared base model; RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control. Experiments on Text-to-Image generation (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX.1-dev) show improvements of 36.1%, 4.6%, and 55.7%, and 32.7%, 4.3%, and 67.1% on GenEval, PickScore, and OCR, respectively. On Text-to-Video generation (HunyuanVideo), visual and motion quality improve by 48.1% and 90.0%, respectively. On the language task, Helpful Assistant, with Llama-2 7B, helpful and harmless improve by 43.4% and 136.7%, respectively. Our framework sets a new state-of-the-art multi-preference alignment recipe across modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barak Or</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a central challenge for large-scale, distributed AI. While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair.
  A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies.
  By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haobin Ke, Sen Zhang, Qingqing Ye, Xun Ran, Haibo Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Signed graphs with positive and negative edges can model complex relationships in social networks. Leveraging on balance theory that deduces edge signs from multi-hop node pairs, signed graph learning can generate node embeddings that preserve both structural and sign information. However, training on sensitive signed graphs raises significant privacy concerns, as model parameters may leak private link information. Existing protection methods with differential privacy (DP) typically rely on edge or gradient perturbation for unsigned graph protection. Yet, they are not well-suited for signed graphs, mainly because edge perturbation tends to cascading errors in edge sign inference under balance theory, while gradient perturbation increases sensitivity due to node interdependence and gradient polarity change caused by sign flips, resulting in larger noise injection. In this paper, motivated by the robustness of adversarial learning to noisy interactions, we present ASGL, a privacy-preserving adversarial signed graph learning method that preserves high utility while achieving node-level DP. We first decompose signed graphs into positive and negative subgraphs based on edge signs, and then design a gradient-perturbed adversarial module to approximate the true signed connectivity distribution. In particular, the gradient perturbation helps mitigate cascading errors, while the subgraph separation facilitates sensitivity reduction. Further, we devise a constrained breadth-first search tree strategy that fuses with balance theory to identify the edge signs between generated node pairs. This strategy also enables gradient decoupling, thereby effectively lowering gradient sensitivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that ASGL achieves favorable privacy-utility trade-offs across multiple downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Procopio, Marco Esposito, Sara Raggiunto, Andrey Gizdov, Alberto Belli, Paola Pierleoni</p>
<p>Abstract: We study on-device time-series analysis for gait detection in Parkinson's disease (PD) from short windows of triaxial acceleration, targeting resource-constrained wearables and edge nodes. We compare magnitude thresholding to three 1D CNNs for time-series analysis: a literature baseline (separable convolutions) and two ultra-light models - one purely separable and one with residual connections. Using the BioStampRC21 dataset, 2 s windows at 30 Hz, and subject-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on 16 PwPD with chest-worn IMUs, our residual separable model (Model 2, 533 params) attains PR-AUC = 94.5%, F1 = 91.2%, MCC = 89.4%, matching or surpassing the baseline (5,552 params; PR-AUC = 93.7%, F1 = 90.5%, MCC = 88.5%) with approximately 10x fewer parameters. The smallest model (Model 1, 305 params) reaches PR-AUC = 94.0%, F1 = 91.0%, MCC = 89.1%. Thresholding obtains high recall (89.0%) but low precision (76.5%), yielding many false positives and high inter-subject variance. Sensor-position analysis (train-on-all) shows chest and thighs are most reliable; forearms degrade precision/recall due to non-gait arm motion; naive fusion of all sites does not outperform the best single site. Both compact CNNs execute within tight memory/latency budgets on STM32-class MCUs (sub-10 ms on low-power boards), enabling on-sensor gating of transmission/storage. Overall, ultra-light separable CNNs provide a superior accuracy-efficiency-generalization trade-off to fixed thresholds for wearable PD gait detection and underscore the value of tailored time-series models for edge deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ningning Chen, Weicai Ye, Ying Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce HBLLM, a wavelet-enhanced high-fidelity $1$-bit post-training quantization method for Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging Haar wavelet transforms to enhance expressive capacity through frequency decomposition, HBLLM significantly improves quantization fidelity while maintaining minimal overhead. This approach features two innovative structure-aware grouping strategies: (1) frequency-aware multi-parameter intra-row grouping and (2) $\ell_2$-norm-based saliency-driven column selection. For non-salient weights, a shared mean is employed across quantization groups within each frequency band to optimize storage efficiency. Experiments conducted on the OPT and LLaMA models demonstrate that HBLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in $1$-bit quantization, attaining a perplexity of $6.71$ on LLaMA$2$-$13$B with an average weight storage of only $1.08$ bits.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songqiao Su, Xiaofei Sun, Xiaoya Li, Albert Wang, Jiwei Li, Chris Shum</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose CUDA-L2, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically optimize Half-precision General Matrix Multiply (HGEMM) CUDA kernels. Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used torch.matmul to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., cuBLAS, cuBLASLt. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0% over torch.matmul on average; +19.2% over cuBLAS using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8% over cuBLASLt-heuristic, which queries cuBLASLt library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4% over the most competitive cuBLASLt-AutoTuning model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from cuBLASLt's suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7%, +26.0%, +22.4%, and +15.9% for torch.matmul, cuBLAS, cuBLASLt-heuristic, and cuBLASLt-AutoTuning respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Awad, Mahmoud Akrm, Walid Gomaa</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darshan Fofadiya</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive Language Models (LLMs) trained on Next-Token Prediction (NTP) often suffer from Topic Drift where the generation wanders away from the initial prompt due to a reliance on local associations rather than global planning. While scaling model size mitigates this, the fundamental myopia of the NTP objective remains. In this work, we introduce the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture that separates semantic planning from syntactic generation. We introduce an auxiliary Idea Head trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution for a future context window, creating a latent ``Concept Vector'' that actively gates the main vocabulary during generation. We propose a differentiable gating mechanism that suppresses semantically irrelevant tokens, effectively pruning the search space in real-time. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that while the Idea-Gated model achieves comparable validation perplexity to a standard GPT-2 baseline, it exhibits significantly superior Domain Retention. Qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals that the gating mechanism successfully locks generation into specific semantic clusters (e.g., Finance, Science) and resists associative drift, offering a parameter-efficient path toward more controllable language modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as autonomous decision-makers in interactive and multi-agent systems and human societies, understanding their strategic behaviour has profound implications for safety, coordination, and the design of AI-driven social and economic infrastructures. Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ci Zhang, Huayu Li, Changdi Yang, Jiangnan Xia, Yanzhi Wang, Xiaolong Ma, Jin Lu, Ao Li, Geng Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies show that using diffusion models for time series signal reconstruction holds great promise. However, such approaches remain largely unexplored in the domain of medical time series. The unique characteristics of the physiological time series signals, such as multivariate, high temporal variability, highly noisy, and artifact-prone, make deep learning-based approaches still challenging for tasks such as imputation. Hence, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based noise estimator within a score-based diffusion framework. Specifically, the Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module is designed to enable each channel to adaptively select desired receptive fields throughout the diffusion process. Moreover, recent literature has found that when generating a physiological signal, performing multiple inferences and averaging the reconstructed signals can effectively reduce reconstruction errors, but at the cost of significant computational and latency overhead. We design a Fusion MoE module and innovatively leverage the nature of MoE module to generate K noise signals in parallel, fuse them using a routing mechanism, and complete signal reconstruction in a single inference step. This design not only improves performance over previous methods but also eliminates the substantial computational cost and latency associated with multiple inference processes. Extensive results demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms diffusion-based SOTA works on different tasks and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uisang Lee, Changhoon Chung, Junmo Lee, Soo-Mook Moon</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of Ethereum has made it more important to quickly and accurately detect smart contract vulnerabilities. While machine-learning-based methods have shown some promise, many still rely on rule-based preprocessing designed by domain experts. Rule-based preprocessing methods often discard crucial context from the source code, potentially causing certain vulnerabilities to be overlooked and limiting adaptability to newly emerging threats. We introduce BugSweeper, an end-to-end deep learning framework that detects vulnerabilities directly from the source code without manual engineering. BugSweeper represents each Solidity function as a Function-Level Abstract Syntax Graph (FLAG), a novel graph that combines its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with enriched control-flow and data-flow semantics. Then, our two-stage Graph Neural Network (GNN) analyzes these graphs. The first-stage GNN filters noise from the syntax graphs, while the second-stage GNN conducts high-level reasoning to detect diverse vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on real-world contracts show that BugSweeper significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art detection methods. By removing the need for handcrafted rules, our approach offers a robust, automated, and scalable solution for securing smart contracts without any dependence on security experts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern deep learning methods have achieved impressive results across tasks from disease classification, estimating continuous biomarkers, to generating realistic medical images. Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference. Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Wang, Bowen Yang, Chenyi Li, Yuan Zhang, Shihao Zhou, Bin Dong, Zaiwen Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the problem of translating informal mathematical proofs expressed in natural language into formal proofs in Lean4 under a constrained computational budget. Our approach is grounded in two key insights. First, informal proofs tend to proceed via a sequence of logical transitions - often implications or equivalences - without explicitly specifying intermediate results or auxiliary lemmas. In contrast, formal systems like Lean require an explicit representation of each proof state and the tactics that connect them. Second, each informal reasoning step can be viewed as an abstract transformation between proof states, but identifying the corresponding formal tactics often requires nontrivial domain knowledge and precise control over proof context. To bridge this gap, we propose a two stage framework. Rather than generating formal tactics directly, we first extract a Chain of States (CoS), a sequence of intermediate formal proof states aligned with the logical structure of the informal argument. We then generate tactics to transition between adjacent states in the CoS, thereby constructing the full formal proof. This intermediate representation significantly reduces the complexity of tactic generation and improves alignment with informal reasoning patterns. We build dedicated datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluation, and introduce an interactive framework to support tactic generation from formal states. Empirical results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher proof success rates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world AI software engineering demands coding agents that can reason over massive repositories, maintain durable memory across and within long sessions, and robustly coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenfei Guan, Jilin Mei, Tong Shen, Xumin Wu, Shuo Wang, Cheng Min, Yu Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has advanced vectorized road extraction in urban settings, yet off-road environments remain underexplored and challenging. A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.
  This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a global off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.
  Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability. Together, the dataset and path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in the wild.

<p>Abstract: Textual data used to train large language models (LLMs) exhibits multifaceted bias manifestations encompassing harmful language and skewed demographic distributions. Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.</p>

For solving ultra-hard problems like those in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), the required reasoning complexity surpasses the space that an LRM can explore in a single round. Previous works attempt to extend the reasoning context of LRMs but remain prompt-based and built upon proprietary models, lacking systematic structures and training pipelines. Therefore, this paper introduces Intern-S1-MO, a long-horizon math agent that conducts multi-round hierarchical reasoning, composed of an LRM-based multi-agent system including reasoning, summary, and verification. By maintaining a compact memory in the form of lemmas, Intern-S1-MO can more freely explore the lemma-rich reasoning spaces in multiple reasoning stages, thereby breaking through the context constraints for IMO-level math problems. Furthermore, we propose OREAL-H, an RL framework for training the LRM using the online explored trajectories to simultaneously bootstrap the reasoning ability of LRM and elevate the overall performance of Intern-S1-MO. Experiments show that Intern-S1-MO can obtain 26 out of 35 points on the non-geometry problems of IMO2025, matching the performance of silver medalists. It also surpasses the current advanced LRMs on inference benchmarks such as HMMT2025, AIME2025, and CNMO2025. In addition, our agent officially participates in CMO2025 and achieves a score of 102/126 under the judgment of human experts, reaching the gold medal level.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal-difference (TD) methods learn state and action values efficiently by bootstrapping from their own future value predictions, but such a self-bootstrapping mechanism is prone to bootstrapping bias, where the errors in the value targets accumulate across steps and result in biased value estimates. Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences ("chunks") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods. Code: github.com/ColinQiyangLi/dqc.</p>
