<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengfei Ma, Xiang song, Wen Tao, Mufei Li, Jiani Zhang, Xiaoqin Pan, Jianxin Lin, Bosheng Song, xiangxiang Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to alleviate the inherent incompleteness of knowledge graphs (KGs), which is a critical task for various applications, such as recommendations on the web. Although knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have demonstrated superior predictive performance on KGC tasks, these models infer missing links in a black-box manner that lacks transparency and accountability, preventing researchers from developing accountable models. Existing KGE-based explanation methods focus on exploring key paths or isolated edges as explanations, which is information-less to reason target prediction. Additionally, the missing ground truth leads to these explanation methods being ineffective in quantitatively evaluating explored explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose KGExplainer, a model-agnostic method that identifies connected subgraph explanations and distills an evaluator to assess them quantitatively. KGExplainer employs a perturbation-based greedy search algorithm to find key connected subgraphs as explanations within the local structure of target predictions. To evaluate the quality of the explored explanations, KGExplainer distills an evaluator from the target KGE model. By forwarding the explanations to the evaluator, our method can examine the fidelity of them. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KGExplainer yields promising improvement and achieves an optimal ratio of 83.3% in human evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiefeng Zhou, Zhen Li, Yong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Random walk is an explainable approach for modeling natural processes at the molecular level. The Random Permutation Set Theory (RPST) serves as a framework for uncertainty reasoning, extending the applicability of Dempster-Shafer Theory. Recent explorations indicate a promising link between RPST and random walk. In this study, we conduct an analysis and construct a random walk model based on the properties of RPST, with Monte Carlo simulations of such random walk. Our findings reveal that the random walk generated through RPST exhibits characteristics similar to those of a Gaussian random walk and can be transformed into a Wiener process through a specific limiting scaling procedure. This investigation establishes a novel connection between RPST and random walk theory, thereby not only expanding the applicability of RPST, but also demonstrating the potential for combining the strengths of both approaches to improve problem-solving abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerrod Wigmore, Brooke Shrader, Eytan Modiano</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful approach to training neural network control policies for stochastic queuing networks (SQN). However, traditional DRL methods rely on offline simulations or static datasets, limiting their real-world application in SQN control. This work proposes Online Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Controls (ODRLC) as an alternative, where an intelligent agent interacts directly with a real environment and learns an optimal control policy from these online interactions. SQNs present a challenge for ODRLC due to the unbounded nature of the queues within the network resulting in an unbounded state-space. An unbounded state-space is particularly challenging for neural network policies as neural networks are notoriously poor at extrapolating to unseen states. To address this challenge, we propose an intervention-assisted framework that leverages strategic interventions from known stable policies to ensure the queue sizes remain bounded. This framework combines the learning power of neural networks with the guaranteed stability of classical control policies for SQNs. We introduce a method to design these intervention-assisted policies to ensure strong stability of the network. Furthermore, we extend foundational DRL theorems for intervention-assisted policies and develop two practical algorithms specifically for ODRLC of SQNs. Finally, we demonstrate through experiments that our proposed algorithms outperform both classical control approaches and prior ODRLC algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Ciatto, Andrea Agiollo, Matteo Magnini, Andrea Omicini</p>
<p>Abstract: Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes andproperties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multi- ple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is semi-automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianshu Zhang, Xiang Yue, Yifei Li, Huan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-structured tables are ubiquitous. There has been a variety of tasks that aim to automatically interpret, augment, and query tables. Current methods often require pretraining on tables or special model architecture design, are restricted to specific table types, or have simplifying assumptions about tables and tasks. This paper makes the first step towards developing open-source large language models (LLMs) as generalists for a diversity of table-based tasks. Towards that end, we construct TableInstruct, a new dataset with a variety of realistic tables and tasks, for instruction tuning and evaluating LLMs. We further develop the first open-source generalist model for tables, TableLlama, by fine-tuning Llama 2 (7B) with LongLoRA to address the long context challenge. We experiment under both in-domain setting and out-of-domain setting. On 7 out of 8 in-domain tasks, TableLlama achieves comparable or better performance than the SOTA for each task, despite the latter often has task-specific design. On 6 out-of-domain datasets, it achieves 5-44 absolute point gains compared with the base model, showing that training on TableInstruct enhances the model's generalizability. We open-source our dataset and trained model to boost future work on developing open generalist models for tables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Drishti Goel, Fiza Husain, Aditya Singh, Supriyo Ghosh, Anjaly Parayil, Chetan Bansal, Xuchao Zhang, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Incident management for large cloud services is a complex and tedious process and requires significant amount of manual efforts from on-call engineers (OCEs). OCEs typically leverage data from different stages of the software development lifecycle [SDLC] (e.g., codes, configuration, monitor data, service properties, service dependencies, trouble-shooting documents, etc.) to generate insights for detection, root causing and mitigating of incidents. Recent advancements in large language models [LLMs] (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4, Gemini) created opportunities to automatically generate contextual recommendations to the OCEs assisting them to quickly identify and mitigate critical issues. However, existing research typically takes a silo-ed view for solving a certain task in incident management by leveraging data from a single stage of SDLC. In this paper, we demonstrate that augmenting additional contextual data from different stages of SDLC improves the performance of two critically important and practically challenging tasks: (1) automatically generating root cause recommendations for dependency failure related incidents, and (2) identifying ontology of service monitors used for automatically detecting incidents. By leveraging 353 incident and 260 monitor dataset from Microsoft, we demonstrate that augmenting contextual information from different stages of the SDLC improves the performance over State-of-The-Art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erblin Isaku, Christoph Laaber, Hassan Sartaj, Shaukat Ali, Thomas Schwitalla, Jan F. Nyg{\aa}rd</p>
<p>Abstract: The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) uses an automated cancer registration support system (CaReSS) to support core cancer registry activities, i.e, data capture, data curation, and producing data products and statistics for various stakeholders. GURI is a core component of CaReSS, which is responsible for validating incoming data with medical rules. Such medical rules are manually implemented by medical experts based on medical standards, regulations, and research. Since large language models (LLMs) have been trained on a large amount of public information, including these documents, they can be employed to generate tests for GURI. Thus, we propose an LLM-based test generation and differential testing approach (LLMeDiff) to test GURI. We experimented with four different LLMs, two medical rule engine implementations, and 58 real medical rules to investigate the hallucination, success, time efficiency, and robustness of the LLMs to generate tests, and these tests' ability to find potential issues in GURI. Our results showed that GPT-3.5 hallucinates the least, is the most successful, and is generally the most robust; however, it has the worst time efficiency. Our differential testing revealed 22 medical rules where implementation inconsistencies were discovered (e.g., regarding handling rule versions). Finally, we provide insights for practitioners and researchers based on the results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gutha Jaya Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Serial-parallel redundancy is a reliable way to ensure service and systems will be available in cloud computing. That method involves making copies of the same system or program, with only one remaining active. When an error occurs, the inactive copy can step in as a backup right away, this provides continuous performance and uninterrupted operation. This approach is called parallel redundancy, otherwise known as active-active redundancy, and its exceptional when it comes to strategy. It creates duplicates of a system or service that are all running at once. By doing this fault tolerance increases since if one copy fails, the workload can be distributed across any replica thats functioning properly. Reliability allocation depends on features in a system and the availability and fault tolerance you want from it. Serial redundancy or parallel redundancies can be applied to increase the dependability of systems and services. To demonstrate how well this concept works, we looked into fixed serial parallel reliability redundancy allocation issues followed by using an innovative hybrid optimization technique to find the best possible allocation for peak dependability. We then measured our findings against other research.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03673">RL for Consistency Models: Faster Reward Guided Text-to-Image Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Oertell, Jonathan D. Chang, Yiyi Zhang, Kiant\'e Brantley, Wen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has improved guided image generation with diffusion models by directly optimizing rewards that capture image quality, aesthetics, and instruction following capabilities. However, the resulting generative policies inherit the same iterative sampling process of diffusion models that causes slow generation. To overcome this limitation, consistency models proposed learning a new class of generative models that directly map noise to data, resulting in a model that can generate an image in as few as one sampling iteration. In this work, to optimize text-to-image generative models for task specific rewards and enable fast training and inference, we propose a framework for fine-tuning consistency models via RL. Our framework, called Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Model (RLCM), frames the iterative inference process of a consistency model as an RL procedure. RLCM improves upon RL fine-tuned diffusion models on text-to-image generation capabilities and trades computation during inference time for sample quality. Experimentally, we show that RLCM can adapt text-to-image consistency models to objectives that are challenging to express with prompting, such as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as aesthetic quality. Comparing to RL finetuned diffusion models, RLCM trains significantly faster, improves the quality of the generation measured under the reward objectives, and speeds up the inference procedure by generating high quality images with as few as two inference steps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanishk Gandhi, Denise Lee, Gabriel Grand, Muxin Liu, Winson Cheng, Archit Sharma, Noah D. Goodman</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models are rarely shown fruitful mistakes while training. They then struggle to look beyond the next token, suffering from a snowballing of errors and struggling to predict the consequence of their actions several steps ahead. In this paper, we show how language models can be taught to search by representing the process of search in language, as a flattened string -- a stream of search (SoS). We propose a unified language for search that captures an array of different symbolic search strategies. We demonstrate our approach using the simple yet difficult game of Countdown, where the goal is to combine input numbers with arithmetic operations to reach a target number. We pretrain a transformer-based language model from scratch on a dataset of streams of search generated by heuristic solvers. We find that SoS pretraining increases search accuracy by 25% over models trained to predict only the optimal search trajectory. We further finetune this model with two policy improvement methods: Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA) and Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR). The finetuned SoS models solve 36% of previously unsolved problems, including problems that cannot be solved by any of the heuristic solvers. Our results indicate that language models can learn to solve problems via search, self-improve to flexibly use different search strategies, and potentially discover new ones.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03685">Cooperative Evolutionary Pressure and Diminishing Returns Might Explain the Fermi Paradox: On What Super-AIs Are Like</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Vallstrom</p>
<p>Abstract: With an evolutionary approach, the basis of morality can be explained as adaptations to problems of cooperation. With 'evolution' taken in a broad sense, evolving AIs that satisfy the conditions for evolution to apply will be subject to the same cooperative evolutionary pressure as biological entities. Here the adaptiveness of increased cooperation as material safety and wealth increase is discussed -- for humans, for other societies, and for AIs. Diminishing beneficial returns from increased access to material resources also suggests the possibility that, on the whole, there will be no incentive to for instance colonize entire galaxies, thus providing a possible explanation of the Fermi paradox, wondering where everybody is. It is further argued that old societies could engender, give way to, super-AIs, since it is likely that super-AIs are feasible, and fitter. Closing is an aside on effective ways for morals and goals to affect life and society, emphasizing environments, cultures, and laws, and exemplified by how to eat.
  Appended are an algorithm for colonizing for example a galaxy quickly, models of the evolution of cooperation and fairness under diminishing returns, and software for simulating signaling development. It is also noted that there can be no exponential colonization or reproduction, for mathematical reasons, as each entity takes up a certain amount of space.</p>

<p>Abstract: In today's digital world, cyberbullying is a serious problem that can harm the mental and physical health of people who use social media. This paper explains just how serious cyberbullying is and how it really affects indi-viduals exposed to it. It also stresses how important it is to find better ways to detect cyberbullying so that online spaces can be safer. Plus, it talks about how making more accurate tools to spot cyberbullying will be really helpful in the future. Our paper introduces a deep learning-based ap-proach, primarily employing BERT and BiLSTM architectures, to effective-ly address cyberbullying. This approach is designed to analyse large vol-umes of posts and predict potential instances of cyberbullying in online spaces. Our results demonstrate the superiority of the hateBERT model, an extension of BERT focused on hate speech detection, among the five mod-els, achieving an accuracy rate of 89.16%. This research is a significant con-tribution to "Computational Intelligence for Social Transformation," prom-ising a safer and more inclusive digital landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weichao Lan, Yiu-ming Cheung, Qing Xu, Buhua Liu, Zhikai Hu, Mengke Li, Zhenghua Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a widely used technique in the field of model compression, which aims to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a lightweight student model for efficient network development. In addition to the supervision of ground truth, the vanilla KD method regards the predictions of the teacher as soft labels to supervise the training of the student model. Based on vanilla KD, various approaches have been developed to further improve the performance of the student model. However, few of these previous methods have considered the reliability of the supervision from teacher models. Supervision from erroneous predictions may mislead the training of the student model. This paper therefore proposes to tackle this problem from two aspects: Label Revision to rectify the incorrect supervision and Data Selection to select appropriate samples for distillation to reduce the impact of erroneous supervision. In the former, we propose to rectify the teacher's inaccurate predictions using the ground truth. In the latter, we introduce a data selection technique to choose suitable training samples to be supervised by the teacher, thereby reducing the impact of incorrect predictions to some extent. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and show that our method can be combined with other distillation approaches, improving their performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingxiang Liu, Sheng Sun, Yuxuan Liang, Jingjing Xue, Min Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The existing federated learning (FL) methods for spatio-temporal forecasting fail to capture the inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, which calls for personalized FL (PFL) methods to model the spatio-temporally variant patterns. While contrastive learning approach is promising in addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity, the existing methods are noneffective in determining negative pairs and can hardly apply to PFL paradigm. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel PFL method, named Federated dUal sEmantic aLignment-based contraStive learning (FUELS), which can adaptively align positive and negative pairs based on semantic similarity, thereby injecting precise spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the latent representation space by auxiliary contrastive tasks. From temporal perspective, a hard negative filtering module is introduced to dynamically align heterogeneous temporal representations for the supplemented intra-client contrastive task. From spatial perspective, we design lightweight-but-efficient prototypes as client-level semantic representations, based on which the server evaluates spatial similarity and yields client-customized global prototypes for the supplemented inter-client contrastive task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUELS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with communication cost decreasing by around 94%.</p>

We make the assumption that pipelines can be considered as a style component of data and propose to use different generative models, among which, Diffusion Models (DM) to convert data between pipelines. We design a new DM-based unsupervised multi-domain image-to-image transition framework and constrain the generation of 3D fMRI statistic maps using the latent space of an auxiliary classifier that distinguishes statistic maps from different pipelines. We extend traditional sampling techniques used in DM to improve the transition performance. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods are successful: pipelines can indeed be transferred, providing an important source of data augmentation for future medical studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Sigcha, Luigi Borz\`i, Ignacio Pav\'on, N\'elson Costa, Susana Costa, Pedro Arezes, Juan-Manuel L\'opez, Guillermo De Arcas</p>
<p>Abstract: Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most incapacitating symptoms in Parkinsons disease, affecting more than 50 percent of patients in advanced stages of the disease. The presence of FOG may lead to falls and a loss of independence with a consequent reduction in the quality of life. Wearable technology and artificial intelligence have been used for automatic FOG detection to optimize monitoring. However, differences between laboratory and daily-life conditions present challenges for the implementation of reliable detection systems. Consequently, improvement of FOG detection methods remains important to provide accurate monitoring mechanisms intended for free-living and real-time use. This paper presents advances in automatic FOG detection using a single body-worn triaxial accelerometer and a novel classification algorithm based on Transformers and convolutional networks. This study was performed with data from 21 patients who manifested FOG episodes while performing activities of daily living in a home setting. Results indicate that the proposed FOG-Transformer can bring a significant improvement in FOG detection using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO CV). These results bring opportunities for the implementation of accurate monitoring systems for use in ambulatory or home settings.</p>

While the CLTR models can be theoretically unbiased when the user behavior assumption is correct and the propensity estimation is accurate, their effectiveness is usually empirically evaluated via simulation-based experiments due to a lack of widely-available, large-scale, real click logs. However, the mainstream simulation-based experiments are somewhat limited as they often feature a single, deterministic production ranker and simplified user simulation models to generate the synthetic click logs. As a result, the robustness of CLTR models in complex and diverse situations is largely unknown and needs further investigation.
  To address this problem, in this paper, we aim to investigate the robustness of existing CLTR models in a reproducibility study with extensive simulation-based experiments that (1) use both deterministic and stochastic production rankers, each with different ranking performance, and (2) leverage multiple user simulation models with different user behavior assumptions. We find that the DLA models and IPS-DCM show better robustness under various simulation settings than IPS-PBM and PRS with offline propensity estimation. Besides, the existing CLTR models often fail to outperform the naive click baselines when the production ranker has relatively high ranking performance or certain randomness, which suggests an urgent need for developing new CLTR algorithms that work for these settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julien Narboux (University of Strasbourg, France), Walther Neuper (JKU, Johannes Kepler University), Pedro Quaresma (University of Coimbra, Portugal)</p>
<p>Abstract: The ThEdu series pursues the smooth transition from an intuitive way of doing mathematics at secondary school to a more formal approach to the subject in STEM education, while favouring software support for this transition by exploiting the power of theorem-proving technologies. What follows is a brief description of how the present volume contributes to this enterprise.
  The 12th International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software(ThEdu'23), was a satellite event of the 29th international Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE 2023), July 1-4, 2023, Rome, Italy. ThEdu'23 was very successful, with one invited talk, by Yves Bertot (Inria, France), "The challenges of using Type Theory to teach Mathematics", and seven regular contributions. An open call  for papers was then issued, to which eight contributions were submitted. Seven submissions have been accepted by our reviewers, who jointly produced at least three careful reports on each of the contributions. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume.
  We, the volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will further promote the development of theorem-proving based software, and that it will allow to improve the mutual understanding between computer scientists, mathematicians and stakeholders in education.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Waltz, Ostap Okhrin, Michael Schultz</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban air mobility is an innovative mode of transportation in which electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles operate between nodes called vertiports. We outline a self-organized vertiport arrival system based on deep reinforcement learning. The airspace around the vertiport is assumed to be circular, and the vehicles can freely operate inside. Each aircraft is considered an individual agent and follows a shared policy, resulting in decentralized actions that are based on local information. We investigate the development of the reinforcement learning policy during training and illustrate how the algorithm moves from suboptimal local holding patterns to a safe and efficient final policy. The latter is validated in simulation-based scenarios and also deployed on small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles to showcase its real-world usability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angus Nicolson, Lisa Schut, J. Alison Noble, Yarin Gal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent interpretability methods propose using concept-based explanations to translate the internal representations of deep learning models into a language that humans are familiar with: concepts. This requires understanding which concepts are present in the representation space of a neural network. One popular method for finding concepts is Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), which are learnt using a probe dataset of concept exemplars. In this work, we investigate three properties of CAVs. CAVs may be: (1) inconsistent between layers, (2) entangled with different concepts, and (3) spatially dependent. Each property provides both challenges and opportunities in interpreting models. We introduce tools designed to detect the presence of these properties, provide insight into how they affect the derived explanations, and provide recommendations to minimise their impact. Understanding these properties can be used to our advantage. For example, we introduce spatially dependent CAVs to test if a model is translation invariant with respect to a specific concept and class. Our experiments are performed on ImageNet and a new synthetic dataset, Elements. Elements is designed to capture a known ground truth relationship between concepts and classes. We release this dataset to facilitate further research in understanding and evaluating interpretability methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dario Padovano, Alessio Carpegna, Alessandro Savino, Stefano Di Carlo</p>
<p>Abstract: One of today's main concerns is to bring Artificial Intelligence power to embedded systems for edge applications. The hardware resources and power consumption required by state-of-the-art models are incompatible with the constrained environments observed in edge systems, such as IoT nodes and wearable devices. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can represent a solution in this sense: inspired by neuroscience, they reach unparalleled power and resource efficiency when run on dedicated hardware accelerators. However, when designing such accelerators, the amount of choices that can be taken is huge. This paper presents SpikExplorer, a modular and flexible Python tool for hardware-oriented Automatic Design Space Exploration to automate the configuration of FPGA accelerators for SNNs. Using Bayesian optimizations, SpikerExplorer enables hardware-centric multi-objective optimization, supporting factors such as accuracy, area, latency, power, and various combinations during the exploration process. The tool searches the optimal network architecture, neuron model, and internal and training parameters, trying to reach the desired constraints imposed by the user. It allows for a straightforward network configuration, providing the full set of explored points for the user to pick the trade-off that best fits the needs. The potential of SpikExplorer is showcased using three benchmark datasets. It reaches 95.8% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, with a power consumption of 180mW/image and a latency of 0.12 ms/image, making it a powerful tool for automatically optimizing SNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Corby Rosset, Ching-An Cheng, Arindam Mitra, Michael Santacroce, Ahmed Awadallah, Tengyang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies post-training large language models (LLMs) using preference feedback from a powerful oracle to help a model iteratively improve over itself. The typical approach for post-training LLMs involves Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which traditionally separates reward learning and subsequent policy optimization. However, such a reward maximization approach is limited by the nature of "point-wise" rewards (such as Bradley-Terry model), which fails to express complex intransitive or cyclic preference relations. While advances on RLHF show reward learning and policy optimization can be merged into a single contrastive objective for stability, they yet still remain tethered to the reward maximization framework. Recently, a new wave of research sidesteps the reward maximization presumptions in favor of directly optimizing over "pair-wise" or general preferences. In this paper, we introduce Direct Nash Optimization (DNO), a provable and scalable algorithm that marries the simplicity and stability of contrastive learning with theoretical generality from optimizing general preferences. Because DNO is a batched on-policy algorithm using a regression-based objective, its implementation is straightforward and efficient. Moreover, DNO enjoys monotonic improvement across iterations that help it improve even over a strong teacher (such as GPT-4). In our experiments, a resulting 7B parameter Orca-2.5 model aligned by DNO achieves the state-of-the-art win-rate against GPT-4-Turbo of 33% on AlpacaEval 2.0 (even after controlling for response length), an absolute gain of 26% (7% to 33%) over the initializing model. It outperforms models with far more parameters, including Mistral Large, Self-Rewarding LM (70B parameters), and older versions of GPT-4.</p>

<p>Abstract: We describe the University of Amsterdam Intelligent Data Engineering Lab team's entry for the SemEval-2024 Task 6 competition. The SHROOM-INDElab system builds on previous work on using prompt programming and in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) to build classifiers for hallucination detection, and extends that work through the incorporation of context-specific definition of task, role, and target concept, and automated generation of examples for use in a few-shot prompting approach. The resulting system achieved fourth-best and sixth-best performance in the model-agnostic track and model-aware tracks for Task 6, respectively, and evaluation using the validation sets showed that the system's classification decisions were consistent with those of the crowd-sourced human labellers. We further found that a zero-shot approach provided better accuracy than a few-shot approach using automatically generated examples.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahjabin Nahar, Haeseung Seo, Eun-Ju Lee, Aiping Xiong, Dongwon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption and transformative effects of large language models (LLMs) have sparked concerns regarding their capacity to produce inaccurate and fictitious content, referred to as `hallucinations'. Given the potential risks associated with hallucinations, humans should be able to identify them. This research aims to understand the human perception of LLM hallucinations by systematically varying the degree of hallucination (genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination) and examining its interaction with warning (i.e., a warning of potential inaccuracies: absent vs. present). Participants (N=419) from Prolific rated the perceived accuracy and engaged with content (e.g., like, dislike, share) in a Q/A format. Results indicate that humans rank content as truthful in the order genuine > minor hallucination > major hallucination and user engagement behaviors mirror this pattern. More importantly, we observed that warning improves hallucination detection without significantly affecting the perceived truthfulness of genuine content. We conclude by offering insights for future tools to aid human detection of hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustubh Dhole, Eugene Agichtein</p>
<p>Abstract: Query Reformulation(QR) is a set of techniques used to transform a user's original search query to a text that better aligns with the user's intent and improves their search experience. Recently, zero-shot QR has been shown to be a promising approach due to its ability to exploit knowledge inherent in large language models. By taking inspiration from the success of ensemble prompting strategies which have benefited many tasks, we investigate if they can help improve query reformulation. In this context, we propose an ensemble based prompting technique, GenQREnsemble which leverages paraphrases of a zero-shot instruction to generate multiple sets of keywords ultimately improving retrieval performance. We further introduce its post-retrieval variant, GenQREnsembleRF to incorporate pseudo relevant feedback. On evaluations over four IR benchmarks, we find that GenQREnsemble generates better reformulations with relative nDCG@10 improvements up to 18% and MAP improvements upto 24% over the previous zero-shot state-of-art. On the MSMarco Passage Ranking task, GenQREnsembleRF shows relative gains of 5% MRR using pseudo-relevance feedback, and 9% nDCG@10 using relevant feedback documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunxiao Li (John), Charlie Liu (John), Jonathan Chung (John),  Zhengyang (John),  Lu, Piyush Jha, Vijay Ganesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Restart policy is an important technique used in modern Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers, wherein some parts of the solver state are erased at certain intervals during the run of the solver. In most solvers, variable activities are preserved across restart boundaries, resulting in solvers continuing to search parts of the assignment tree that are not far from the one immediately prior to a restart. To enable the solver to search possibly "distant" parts of the assignment tree, we study the effect of resets, a variant of restarts which not only erases the assignment trail, but also randomizes the activity scores of the variables of the input formula after reset, thus potentially enabling a better global exploration of the search space.
  In this paper, we model the problem of whether to trigger reset as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose two reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive reset policies using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson sampling algorithms. These two algorithms balance the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by adaptively choosing arms (reset vs. no reset) based on their estimated rewards during the solver's run. We implement our reset policies in four baseline SOTA CDCL solvers and compare the baselines against the reset versions on Satcoin benchmarks and SAT Competition instances. Our results show that RL-based reset versions outperform the corresponding baseline solvers on both Satcoin and the SAT competition instances, suggesting that our RL policy helps to dynamically and profitably adapt the reset frequency for any given input instance. We also introduce the concept of a partial reset, where at least a constant number of variable activities are retained across reset boundaries. Building on previous results, we show that there is an exponential separation between O(1) vs. $\Omega(n)$-length partial resets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anli du Preez, Peter A. Beling, Tyler Cody</p>
<p>Abstract: The machine learning formulation of online learning is incomplete from a systems theoretic perspective. Typically, machine learning research emphasizes domains and tasks, and a problem solving worldview. It focuses on algorithm parameters, features, and samples, and neglects the perspective offered by considering system structure and system behavior or dynamics. Online learning is an active field of research and has been widely explored in terms of statistical theory and computational algorithms, however, in general, the literature still lacks formal system theoretical frameworks for modeling online learning systems and resolving systems-related concept drift issues. Furthermore, while the machine learning formulation serves to classify methods and literature, the systems theoretic formulation presented herein serves to provide a framework for the top-down design of online learning systems, including a novel definition of online learning and the identification of key design parameters. The framework is formulated in terms of input-output systems and is further divided into system structure and system behavior. Concept drift is a critical challenge faced in online learning, and this work formally approaches it as part of the system behavior characteristics. Healthcare provider fraud detection using machine learning is used as a case study throughout the paper to ground the discussion in a real-world online learning challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabyasachi Sahoo, Mostafa ElAraby, Jonas Ngnawe, Yann Pequignot, Frederic Precioso, Christian Gagne</p>
<p>Abstract: Test Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses the problem of distribution shift by enabling pretrained models to learn new features on an unseen domain at test time. However, it poses a significant challenge to maintain a balance between learning new features and retaining useful pretrained features. In this paper, we propose Layerwise EArly STopping (LEAST) for TTA to address this problem. The key idea is to stop adapting individual layers during TTA if the features being learned do not appear beneficial for the new domain. For that purpose, we propose using a novel gradient-based metric to measure the relevance of the current learnt features to the new domain without the need for supervised labels. More specifically, we propose to use this metric to determine dynamically when to stop updating each layer during TTA. This enables a more balanced adaptation, restricted to layers benefiting from it, and only for a certain number of steps. Such an approach also has the added effect of limiting the forgetting of pretrained features useful for dealing with new domains. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Layerwise Early Stopping improves the performance of existing TTA approaches across multiple datasets, domain shifts, model architectures, and TTA losses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Safety and robustness are crucial factors in developing trustworthy autonomous vehicles. One essential aspect of addressing these factors is to equip vehicles with the capability to predict future trajectories for all moving objects in the surroundings and quantify prediction uncertainties. In this paper, we propose the Sequential Neural Variational Agent (SeNeVA), a generative model that describes the distribution of future trajectories for a single moving object. Our approach can distinguish Out-of-Distribution data while quantifying uncertainty and achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the Argoverse 2 and INTERACTION datasets. Specifically, a 0.446 meters minimum Final Displacement Error, a 0.203 meters minimum Average Displacement Error, and a 5.35% Miss Rate are achieved on the INTERACTION test set.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elham Amin Mansour, Ozan Unal, Suman Saha, Benjamin Bejar, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing relevance of panoptic segmentation is tied to the advancements in autonomous driving and AR/VR applications. However, the deployment of such models has been limited due to the expensive nature of dense data annotation, giving rise to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). A key challenge in panoptic UDA is reducing the domain gap between a labeled source and an unlabeled target domain while harmonizing the subtasks of semantic and instance segmentation to limit catastrophic interference. While considerable progress has been achieved, existing approaches mainly focus on the adaptation of semantic segmentation. In this work, we focus on incorporating instance-level adaptation via a novel instance-aware cross-domain mixing strategy IMix. IMix significantly enhances the panoptic quality by improving instance segmentation performance. Specifically, we propose inserting high-confidence predicted instances from the target domain onto source images, retaining the exhaustiveness of the resulting pseudo-labels while reducing the injected confirmation bias. Nevertheless, such an enhancement comes at the cost of degraded semantic performance, attributed to catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this issue, we regularize our semantic branch by employing CLIP-based domain alignment (CDA), exploiting the domain-robustness of natural language prompts. Finally, we present an end-to-end model incorporating these two mechanisms called LIDAPS, achieving state-of-the-art results on all popular panoptic UDA benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Wu, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Teng-Yun Hsiao, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a two-stage memory retrieval dynamics for modern Hopfield models, termed $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$, with enhanced memory capacity. Our key contribution is a learnable feature map $\Phi$ which transforms the Hopfield energy function into a kernel space. This transformation ensures convergence between the local minima of energy and the fixed points of retrieval dynamics within the kernel space. Consequently, the kernel norm induced by $\Phi$ serves as a novel similarity measure. It utilizes the stored memory patterns as learning data to enhance memory capacity across all modern Hopfield models. Specifically, we accomplish this by constructing a separation loss $\mathcal{L}_\Phi$ that separates the local minima of kernelized energy by separating stored memory patterns in kernel space. Methodologically, $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$ memory retrieval process consists of: \textbf{(Stage~I.)} minimizing separation loss for a more uniformed memory (local minimum) distribution, followed by \textbf{(Stage~II.)} standard Hopfield energy minimization for memory retrieval. This results in a significant reduction of possible meta-stable states in the Hopfield energy function, thus enhancing memory capacity by preventing memory confusion. Empirically, with real-world datasets, we demonstrate that $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$ outperforms all existing modern Hopfield models and SOTA similarity measures, achieving substantial improvements in both associative memory retrieval and deep learning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce an Outlier-Efficient Modern Hopfield Model (termed $\mathtt{OutEffHop}$) and use it to address the outlier-induced challenge of quantizing gigantic transformer-based models. Our main contribution is a novel associative memory model facilitating \textit{outlier-efficient} associative memory retrievals. Interestingly, this memory model manifests a model-based interpretation of an outlier-efficient attention mechanism ($\text{Softmax}_1$): it is an approximation of the memory retrieval process of $\mathtt{OutEffHop}$. Methodologically, this allows us to debut novel outlier-efficient Hopfield layers a powerful attention alternative with superior post-quantization performance. Theoretically, the Outlier-Efficient Modern Hopfield Model retains and improves the desirable properties of the standard modern Hopfield models, including fixed point convergence and exponential storage capacity. Empirically, we demonstrate the proposed model's efficacy across large-scale transformer-based and Hopfield-based models (including BERT, OPT, ViT and STanHop-Net), benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods including $\mathtt{Clipped\_Softmax}$ and $\mathtt{Gated\_Attention}$. Notably, $\mathtt{OutEffHop}$ achieves on average $\sim$22+\% reductions in both average kurtosis and maximum infinity norm of model outputs accross 4 models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the \textbf{B}i-Directional \textbf{S}parse \textbf{Hop}field Network (\textbf{BiSHop}), a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning. BiSHop handles the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the recent established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms. Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules. Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with adaptable sparsity. Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each scale. Empirically, through experiments on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D perception systems have significantly improved their ability to perform visual recognition tasks such as segmentation. However, these systems still heavily rely on explicit human instruction to identify target objects or categories, lacking the capability to actively reason and comprehend implicit user intentions. We introduce a novel segmentation task known as reasoning part segmentation for 3D objects, aiming to output a segmentation mask based on complex and implicit textual queries about specific parts of a 3D object. To facilitate evaluation and benchmarking, we present a large 3D dataset comprising over 60k instructions paired with corresponding ground-truth part segmentation annotations specifically curated for reasoning-based 3D part segmentation. We propose a model that is capable of segmenting parts of 3D objects based on implicit textual queries and generating natural language explanations corresponding to 3D object segmentation requests. Experiments show that our method achieves competitive performance to models that use explicit queries, with the additional abilities to identify part concepts, reason about them, and complement them with world knowledge.

Block-coordinate descent, where an optimization problem is decomposed into $k$ blocks of decision variables and each of the blocks is optimized (with the others fixed) in a sequence, is a technique used in some large-scale optimization problems such as airline scheduling, however its use in multi-objective optimization is less studied. We propose a block-coordinate version of GSEMO and compare its running time to the standard GSEMO algorithm. Theoretical and empirical results on a bi-objective test function, a variant of LOTZ, serve to demonstrate the existence of cases where block-coordinate descent is faster.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03868">Extract, Define, Canonicalize: An LLM-based Framework for Knowledge Graph Construction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Zhang, Harold Soh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we are interested in automated methods for knowledge graph creation (KGC) from input text. Progress on large language models (LLMs) has prompted a series of recent works applying them to KGC, e.g., via zero/few-shot prompting. Despite successes on small domain-specific datasets, these models face difficulties scaling up to text common in many real-world applications. A principal issue is that in prior methods, the KG schema has to be included in the LLM prompt to generate valid triplets; larger and more complex schema easily exceed the LLMs' context window length. To address this problem, we propose a three-phase framework named Extract-Define-Canonicalize (EDC): open information extraction followed by schema definition and post-hoc canonicalization. EDC is flexible in that it can be applied to settings where a pre-defined target schema is available and when it is not; in the latter case, it constructs a schema automatically and applies self-canonicalization. To further improve performance, we introduce a trained component that retrieves schema elements relevant to the input text; this improves the LLMs' extraction performance in a retrieval-augmented generation-like manner. We demonstrate on three KGC benchmarks that EDC is able to extract high-quality triplets without any parameter tuning and with significantly larger schemas compared to prior works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Guo, Daming Shi, Junjie Yu, Wenhui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of multi-agent systems, especially the success of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), is reshaping our future across diverse domains like autonomous vehicle networks. However, MARL still faces significant challenges, particularly in achieving zero-shot scalability, which allows trained MARL models to be directly applied to unseen tasks with varying numbers of agents. In addition, real-world multi-agent systems usually contain agents with different functions and strategies, while the existing scalable MARL methods only have limited heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a novel MARL framework named Scalable and Heterogeneous Proximal Policy Optimization (SHPPO), integrating heterogeneity into parameter-shared PPO-based MARL networks. we first leverage a latent network to adaptively learn strategy patterns for each agent. Second, we introduce a heterogeneous layer for decision-making, whose parameters are specifically generated by the learned latent variables. Our approach is scalable as all the parameters are shared except for the heterogeneous layer, and gains both inter-individual and temporal heterogeneity at the same time. We implement our approach based on the state-of-the-art backbone PPO-based algorithm as SHPPO, while our approach is agnostic to the backbone and can be seamlessly plugged into any parameter-shared MARL method. SHPPO exhibits superior performance over the baselines such as MAPPO and HAPPO in classic MARL environments like Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) and Google Research Football (GRF), showcasing enhanced zero-shot scalability and offering insights into the learned latent representation's impact on team performance by visualization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonwoo Kim, Gyoungjin Gim, Yungi Kim, Jihoo Kim, Byungju Kim, Wonseok Lee, Chanjun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a novel learning approach designed to enhance both mathematical reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on integrating the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and the Program-of-Thought (PoT) learning, hypothesizing that prioritizing the learning of mathematical reasoning ability is helpful for the amplification of problem-solving ability. Thus, the initial learning with CoT is essential for solving challenging mathematical problems. To this end, we propose a sequential learning approach, named SAAS (Solving Ability Amplification Strategy), which strategically transitions from CoT learning to PoT learning. Our empirical study, involving an extensive performance comparison using several benchmarks, demonstrates that our SAAS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. The results underscore the effectiveness of our sequential learning approach, marking a significant advancement in the field of mathematical reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the smart grid, the prosumers can sell unused electricity back to the power grid, assuming the prosumers own renewable energy sources and storage units. The maximizing of their profits under a dynamic electricity market is a problem that requires intelligent planning. To address this, we propose a framework based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using recurrent rewards. By using the information about the rewards modeled effectively with PPO to maximize our objective, we were able to get over 30\% improvement over the other naive algorithms in accumulating total profits. This shows promise in getting reinforcement learning algorithms to perform tasks required to plan their actions in complex domains like financial markets. We also introduce a novel method for embedding longs based on soliton waves that outperformed normal embedding in our use case with random floating point data augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gawon Choi, Hyemin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: In robotics, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming prevalent, especially for understanding human commands. In particular, LLMs are utilized as domain-agnostic task planners for high-level human commands. LLMs are capable of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and this allows LLMs to be task planners. However, we need to consider that modern robots still struggle to perform complex actions, and the domains where robots can be deployed are limited in practice. This leads us to pose a question: If small LMs can be trained to reason in chains within a single domain, would even small LMs be good task planners for the robots? To train smaller LMs to reason in chains, we build `COmmand-STeps datasets' (COST) consisting of high-level commands along with corresponding actionable low-level steps, via LLMs. We release not only our datasets but also the prompt templates used to generate them, to allow anyone to build datasets for their domain. We compare GPT3.5 and GPT4 with the finetuned GPT2 for task domains, in tabletop and kitchen environments, and the result shows that GPT2-medium is comparable to GPT3.5 for task planning in a specific domain. Our dataset, code, and more output samples can be found in https://github.com/Gawon-Choi/small-LMs-Task-Planning</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maryam Ahmed, Tooba Bibi, Rizwan Ahmed Khan, Sidra Nasir</p>
<p>Abstract: The study introduces an integrated framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for the enhanced diagnosis of breast cancer using the CBIS-DDSM dataset. Utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet50 architecture, our investigation not only provides effective differentiation of mammographic images into benign and malignant categories but also addresses the opaque "black-box" nature of deep learning models by employing XAI methodologies, namely Grad-CAM, LIME, and SHAP, to interpret CNN decision-making processes for healthcare professionals. Our methodology encompasses an elaborate data preprocessing pipeline and advanced data augmentation techniques to counteract dataset limitations, and transfer learning using pre-trained networks, such as VGG-16, DenseNet and ResNet was employed. A focal point of our study is the evaluation of XAI's effectiveness in interpreting model predictions, highlighted by utilising the Hausdorff measure to assess the alignment between AI-generated explanations and expert annotations quantitatively. This approach plays a critical role for XAI in promoting trustworthiness and ethical fairness in AI-assisted diagnostics. The findings from our research illustrate the effective collaboration between CNNs and XAI in advancing diagnostic methods for breast cancer, thereby facilitating a more seamless integration of advanced AI technologies within clinical settings. By enhancing the interpretability of AI-driven decisions, this work lays the groundwork for improved collaboration between AI systems and medical practitioners, ultimately enriching patient care. Furthermore, the implications of our research extend well beyond the current methodologies, advocating for subsequent inquiries into the integration of multimodal data and the refinement of AI explanations to satisfy the needs of clinical practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric construction for deep learning compatible modern Hopfield models and utilize this framework to debut an efficient variant. Our key contribution stems from interpreting the memory storage and retrieval processes in modern Hopfield models as a nonparametric regression problem subject to a set of query-memory pairs. Crucially, our framework not only recovers the known results from the original dense modern Hopfield model but also fills the void in the literature regarding efficient modern Hopfield models, by introducing \textit{sparse-structured} modern Hopfield models with sub-quadratic complexity. We establish that this sparse model inherits the appealing theoretical properties of its dense analogue -- connection with transformer attention, fixed point convergence and exponential memory capacity -- even without knowing details of the Hopfield energy function. Additionally, we showcase the versatility of our framework by constructing a family of modern Hopfield models as extensions, including linear, random masked, top-$K$ and positive random feature modern Hopfield models. Empirically, we validate the efficacy of our framework in both synthetic and realistic settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suma K V, Deepali Koppad, Preethi Kumar, Neha A Kantikar, Surabhi Ramesh</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, advancements in deep learning techniques have considerably enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of medical diagnostics. In this work, a novel approach using multi-task learning (MTL) for the simultaneous classification of lung sounds and lung diseases is proposed. Our proposed model leverages MTL with four different deep learning models such as 2D CNN, ResNet50, MobileNet and Densenet to extract relevant features from the lung sound recordings. The ICBHI 2017 Respiratory Sound Database was employed in the current study. The MTL for MobileNet model performed better than the other models considered, with an accuracy of74\% for lung sound analysis and 91\% for lung diseases classification. Results of the experimentation demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in classifying both lung sounds and lung diseases concurrently.
  In this study,using the demographic data of the patients from the database, risk level computation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is also carried out. For this computation, three machine learning algorithms namely Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest classifierswere employed. Among these ML algorithms, the Random Forest classifier had the highest accuracy of 92\%.This work helps in considerably reducing the physician's burden of not just diagnosing the pathology but also effectively communicating to the patient about the possible causes or outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fred Philippy, Shohreh Haddadan, Siwen Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: In NLP, zero-shot classification (ZSC) is the task of assigning labels to textual data without any labeled examples for the target classes. A common method for ZSC is to fine-tune a language model on a Natural Language Inference (NLI) dataset and then use it to infer the entailment between the input document and the target labels. However, this approach faces certain challenges, particularly for languages with limited resources. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution that leverages dictionaries as a source of data for ZSC. We focus on Luxembourgish, a low-resource language spoken in Luxembourg, and construct two new topic relevance classification datasets based on a dictionary that provides various synonyms, word translations and example sentences. We evaluate the usability of our dataset and compare it with the NLI-based approach on two topic classification tasks in a zero-shot manner. Our results show that by using the dictionary-based dataset, the trained models outperform the ones following the NLI-based approach for ZSC. While we focus on a single low-resource language in this study, we believe that the efficacy of our approach can also transfer to other languages where such a dictionary is available.</p>

<p>Abstract: While there has been significant progress in customizing text-to-image generation models, generating images that combine multiple personalized concepts remains challenging. In this work, we introduce Concept Weaver, a method for composing customized text-to-image diffusion models at inference time. Specifically, the method breaks the process into two steps: creating a template image aligned with the semantics of input prompts, and then personalizing the template using a concept fusion strategy. The fusion strategy incorporates the appearance of the target concepts into the template image while retaining its structural details. The results indicate that our method can generate multiple custom concepts with higher identity fidelity compared to alternative approaches. Furthermore, the method is shown to seamlessly handle more than two concepts and closely follow the semantic meaning of the input prompt without blending appearances across different subjects.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates how various randomization techniques impact Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Randomization, like weight noise and dropout, aids in reducing overfitting and enhancing generalization, but their interactions are poorly understood. The study categorizes randomness techniques into four types and proposes new methods: adding noise to the loss function and random masking of gradient updates. Using Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) for hyperparameter optimization, it explores optimal configurations across MNIST, FASHION-MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets. Over 30,000 configurations are evaluated, revealing data augmentation and weight initialization randomness as main performance contributors. Correlation analysis shows different optimizers prefer distinct randomization types. The complete implementation and dataset are available on GitHub.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities have increased the eagerness of companies to integrate AI into software systems. While AI can be used to have a positive impact on several dimensions of sustainability, this is often overshadowed by its potential negative influence. While many studies have explored sustainability factors in isolation, there is insufficient holistic coverage of potential sustainability benefits or costs that practitioners need to consider during decision-making for AI adoption. We therefore aim to synthesize trade-offs related to sustainability in the context of integrating AI into software systems. We want to make the sustainability benefits and costs of integrating AI more transparent and accessible for practitioners.
  The study was conducted in collaboration with a Dutch financial organization. We first performed a rapid review that led to the inclusion of 151 research papers. Afterward, we conducted six semi-structured interviews to enrich the data with industry perspectives. The combined results showcase the potential sustainability benefits and costs of integrating AI. The labels synthesized from the review regarding potential sustainability benefits were clustered into 16 themes, with "energy management" being the most frequently mentioned one. 11 themes were identified in the interviews, with the top mentioned theme being "employee wellbeing". Regarding sustainability costs, the review discovered seven themes, with "deployment issues" being the most popular one, followed by "ethics & society". "Environmental issues" was the top theme from the interviews. Our results provide valuable insights to organizations and practitioners for understanding the potential sustainability implications of adopting AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Ghaith Altarabichi, S{\l}awomir Nowaczyk, Sepideh Pashami, Peyman Sheikholharam Mashhadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are often challenging to apply in real-world settings since evolutionary computations involve a large number of evaluations of a typically expensive fitness function. For example, an evaluation could involve training a new machine learning model. An approximation (also known as meta-model or a surrogate) of the true function can be used in such applications to alleviate the computation cost. In this paper, we propose a two-stage surrogate-assisted evolutionary approach to address the computational issues arising from using Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection in a wrapper setting for large datasets. We define 'Approximation Usefulness' to capture the necessary conditions to ensure correctness of the EA computations when an approximation is used. Based on this definition, we propose a procedure to construct a lightweight qualitative meta-model by the active selection of data instances. We then use a meta-model to carry out the feature selection task. We apply this procedure to the GA-based algorithm CHC (Cross generational elitist selection, Heterogeneous recombination and Cataclysmic mutation) to create a Qualitative approXimations variant, CHCQX. We show that CHCQX converges faster to feature subset solutions of significantly higher accuracy (as compared to CHC), particularly for large datasets with over 100K instances. We also demonstrate the applicability of the thinking behind our approach more broadly to Swarm Intelligence (SI), another branch of the Evolutionary Computation (EC) paradigm with results of PSOQX, a qualitative approximation adaptation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. A GitHub repository with the complete implementation is available.</p>

To address the difficulty of training policies from scratch in MORL, we introduce demonstration-guided multi-objective reinforcement learning (DG-MORL). This novel approach utilizes prior demonstrations, aligns them with user preferences via corner weight support, and incorporates a self-evolving mechanism to refine suboptimal demonstrations. Our empirical studies demonstrate DG-MORL's superiority over existing MORL algorithms, establishing its robustness and efficacy, particularly under challenging conditions.

<p>Abstract: In the BCI field, introspection and interpretation of brain signals are desired for providing feedback or to guide rapid paradigm prototyping but are challenging due to the high noise level and dimensionality of the signals. Deep neural networks are often introspected by transforming their learned feature representations into 2- or 3-dimensional subspace visualizations using projection algorithms like Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Unfortunately, these methods are computationally expensive, making the projection of data streams in real-time a non-trivial task. In this study, we introduce a novel variant of UMAP, called approximate UMAP (aUMAP). It aims at generating rapid projections for real-time introspection. To study its suitability for real-time projecting, we benchmark the methods against standard UMAP and its neural network counterpart parametric UMAP. Our results show that approximate UMAP delivers projections that replicate the projection space of standard UMAP while decreasing projection speed by an order of magnitude and maintaining the same training time.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Score identity Distillation (SiD), an innovative data-free method that distills the generative capabilities of pretrained diffusion models into a single-step generator. SiD not only facilitates an exponentially fast reduction in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) during distillation but also approaches or even exceeds the FID performance of the original teacher diffusion models. By reformulating forward diffusion processes as semi-implicit distributions, we leverage three score-related identities to create an innovative loss mechanism. This mechanism achieves rapid FID reduction by training the generator using its own synthesized images, eliminating the need for real data or reverse-diffusion-based generation, all accomplished within significantly shortened generation time. Upon evaluation across four benchmark datasets, the SiD algorithm demonstrates high iteration efficiency during distillation and surpasses competing distillation approaches, whether they are one-step or few-step, data-free, or dependent on training data, in terms of generation quality. This achievement not only redefines the benchmarks for efficiency and effectiveness in diffusion distillation but also in the broader field of diffusion-based generation. Our PyTorch implementation will be publicly accessible on GitHub.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to significantly contribute to patient care, diagnostics, and administrative processes. Emerging biomedical LLMs address healthcare-specific challenges, including privacy demands and computational constraints. However, evaluation of these models has primarily been limited to non-clinical tasks, which do not reflect the complexity of practical clinical applications. Additionally, there has been no thorough comparison between biomedical and general-domain LLMs for clinical tasks. To fill this gap, we present the Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation (CLUE), a benchmark tailored to evaluate LLMs on real-world clinical tasks. CLUE includes two novel datasets derived from MIMIC IV discharge letters and four existing tasks designed to test the practical applicability of LLMs in healthcare settings. Our evaluation covers several biomedical and general domain LLMs, providing insights into their clinical performance and applicability. CLUE represents a step towards a standardized approach to evaluating and developing LLMs in healthcare to align future model development with the real-world needs of clinical application.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models, specifically those based on diffusion models like Imagen and Stable Diffusion, have made substantial advancements. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the delicate refinement of text prompts. Users assign weights or alter the injection time steps of certain words in the text prompts to improve the quality of generated images. However, the success of fine-control prompts depends on the accuracy of the text prompts and the careful selection of weights and time steps, which requires significant manual intervention. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}diting (PAE) method. Besides refining the original prompts for image generation, we further employ an online reinforcement learning strategy to explore the weights and injection time steps of each word, leading to the dynamic fine-control prompts. The reward function during training encourages the model to consider aesthetic score, semantic consistency, and user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively improves the original prompts, generating visually more appealing images while maintaining semantic alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xize Liang, Chao Chen, Jie Wang, Yue Wu, Zhihang Fu, Zhihao Shi, Feng Wu, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The preference alignment aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to generate responses that conform to human values, which is essential for developing general AI systems. Ranking-based methods -- a promising class of alignment approaches -- learn human preferences from datasets containing response pairs by optimizing the log-likelihood margins between preferred and dis-preferred responses. However, due to the inherent differences in annotators' preferences, ranking labels of comparisons for response pairs are unavoidably noisy. This seriously hurts the reliability of existing ranking-based methods. To address this problem, we propose a provably noise-tolerant preference alignment method, namely RObust Preference Optimization (ROPO). To the best of our knowledge, ROPO is the first preference alignment method with noise-tolerance guarantees. The key idea of ROPO is to dynamically assign conservative gradient weights to response pairs with high label uncertainty, based on the log-likelihood margins between the responses. By effectively suppressing the gradients of noisy samples, our weighting strategy ensures that the expected risk has the same gradient direction independent of the presence and proportion of noise. Experiments on three open-ended text generation tasks with four base models ranging in size from 2.8B to 13B demonstrate that ROPO significantly outperforms existing ranking-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> K Naveen Kumar, C Krishna Mohan, Aravind Machiry</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning paradigm enabling participants to collectively train a shared machine learning model while preserving the privacy of their sensitive data. Nevertheless, the inherent decentralized and data-opaque characteristics of FL render its susceptibility to data poisoning attacks. These attacks introduce malformed or malicious inputs during local model training, subsequently influencing the global model and resulting in erroneous predictions. Current FL defense strategies against data poisoning attacks either involve a trade-off between accuracy and robustness or necessitate the presence of a uniformly distributed root dataset at the server. To overcome these limitations, we present FedZZ, which harnesses a zone-based deviating update (ZBDU) mechanism to effectively counter data poisoning attacks in FL. Further, we introduce a precision-guided methodology that actively characterizes these client clusters (zones), which in turn aids in recognizing and discarding malicious updates at the server. Our evaluation of FedZZ across two widely recognized datasets: CIFAR10 and EMNIST, demonstrate its efficacy in mitigating data poisoning attacks, surpassing the performance of prevailing state-of-the-art methodologies in both single and multi-client attack scenarios and varying attack volumes. Notably, FedZZ also functions as a robust client selection strategy, even in highly non-IID and attack-free scenarios. Moreover, in the face of escalating poisoning rates, the model accuracy attained by FedZZ displays superior resilience compared to existing techniques. For instance, when confronted with a 50% presence of malicious clients, FedZZ sustains an accuracy of 67.43%, while the accuracy of the second-best solution, FL-Defender, diminishes to 43.36%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengting Li, Chuang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained remarkable achievement in computer vision tasks, and the success of DNNs often depends greatly on the richness of data. However, the acquisition process of data and high-quality ground truth requires a lot of manpower and money. In the long, tedious process of data annotation, annotators are prone to make mistakes, resulting in incorrect labels of images, i.e., noisy labels. The emergence of noisy labels is inevitable. Moreover, since research shows that DNNs can easily fit noisy labels, the existence of noisy labels will cause significant damage to the model training process. Therefore, it is crucial to combat noisy labels for computer vision tasks, especially for classification tasks. In this survey, we first comprehensively review the evolution of different deep learning approaches for noisy label combating in the image classification task. In addition, we also review different noise patterns that have been proposed to design robust algorithms. Furthermore, we explore the inner pattern of real-world label noise and propose an algorithm to generate a synthetic label noise pattern guided by real-world data. We test the algorithm on the well-known real-world dataset CIFAR-10N to form a new real-world data-guided synthetic benchmark and evaluate some typical noise-robust methods on the benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we introduce CT-LLM, a 2B large language model (LLM) that illustrates a pivotal shift towards prioritizing the Chinese language in developing LLMs. Uniquely initiated from scratch, CT-LLM diverges from the conventional methodology by primarily incorporating Chinese textual data, utilizing an extensive corpus of 1,200 billion tokens, including 800 billion Chinese tokens, 300 billion English tokens, and 100 billion code tokens. This strategic composition facilitates the model's exceptional proficiency in understanding and processing Chinese, a capability further enhanced through alignment techniques. Demonstrating remarkable performance on the CHC-Bench, CT-LLM excels in Chinese language tasks, and showcases its adeptness in English through SFT. This research challenges the prevailing paradigm of training LLMs predominantly on English corpora and then adapting them to other languages, broadening the horizons for LLM training methodologies. By open-sourcing the full process of training a Chinese LLM, including a detailed data processing procedure with the obtained Massive Appropriate Pretraining Chinese Corpus (MAP-CC), a well-chosen multidisciplinary Chinese Hard Case Benchmark (CHC-Bench), and the 2B-size Chinese Tiny LLM (CT-LLM), we aim to foster further exploration and innovation in both academia and industry, paving the way for more inclusive and versatile language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaith Rjoub, Saidul Islam, Jamal Bentahar, Mohammed Amin Almaiah, Rana Alrawashdeh</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to an explosion of data generated by interconnected devices, presenting both opportunities and challenges for intelligent decision-making in complex environments. Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches often struggle to fully harness this data due to their limited ability to process and interpret the intricate patterns and dependencies inherent in IoT applications. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates transformer architectures with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to address these challenges. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism of transformers, our approach enhances RL agents' capacity for understanding and acting within dynamic IoT environments, leading to improved decision-making processes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various IoT scenarios, from smart home automation to industrial control systems, showing marked improvements in decision-making efficiency and adaptability. Our contributions include a detailed exploration of the transformer's role in processing heterogeneous IoT data, a comprehensive evaluation of the framework's performance in diverse environments, and a benchmark against traditional RL methods. The results indicate significant advancements in enabling RL agents to navigate the complexities of IoT ecosystems, highlighting the potential of our approach to revolutionize intelligent automation and decision-making in the IoT landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lanpei Li, Enrico Donato, Vincenzo Lomonaco, Egidio Falotico</p>
<p>Abstract: Dexterous manipulation, often facilitated by multi-fingered robotic hands, holds solid impact for real-world applications. Soft robotic hands, due to their compliant nature, offer flexibility and adaptability during object grasping and manipulation. Yet, benefits come with challenges, particularly in the control development for finger coordination. Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be employed to train object-specific in-hand manipulation policies, but limiting adaptability and generalizability. We introduce a Continual Policy Distillation (CPD) framework to acquire a versatile controller for in-hand manipulation, to rotate different objects in shape and size within a four-fingered soft gripper. The framework leverages Policy Distillation (PD) to transfer knowledge from expert policies to a continually evolving student policy network. Exemplar-based rehearsal methods are then integrated to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enhance generalization. The performance of the CPD framework over various replay strategies demonstrates its effectiveness in consolidating knowledge from multiple experts and achieving versatile and adaptive behaviours for in-hand manipulation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enrico Donato, Egidio Falotico, Thomas George Thuruthel</p>
<p>Abstract: Perception is essential for the active interaction of physical agents with the external environment. The integration of multiple sensory modalities, such as touch and vision, enhances this perceptual process, creating a more comprehensive and robust understanding of the world. Such fusion is particularly useful for highly deformable bodies such as soft robots. Developing a compact, yet comprehensive state representation from multi-sensory inputs can pave the way for the development of complex control strategies. This paper introduces a perception model that harmonizes data from diverse modalities to build a holistic state representation and assimilate essential information. The model relies on the causality between sensory input and robotic actions, employing a generative model to efficiently compress fused information and predict the next observation. We present, for the first time, a study on how touch can be predicted from vision and proprioception on soft robots, the importance of the cross-modal generation and why this is essential for soft robotic interactions in unstructured environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Methods for learning latent user representations from historical behavior logs have gained traction for recommendation tasks in e-commerce, content streaming, and other settings. However, this area still remains relatively underexplored in video and mobile gaming contexts. In this work, we present a novel method for overcoming this limitation by extending a long-range Transformer model from the natural language processing domain to player behavior data. We discuss specifics of behavior tracking in games and propose preprocessing and tokenization approaches by viewing in-game events in an analogous way to words in sentences, thus enabling learning player representations in a self-supervised manner in the absence of ground-truth annotations. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in fitting the distribution of behavior events by evaluating intrinsic language modeling metrics. Furthermore, we qualitatively analyze the emerging structure of the learned embedding space and show its value for generating insights into behavior patterns to inform downstream applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can computers perceive the physical properties of objects solely through vision? Research in cognitive science and vision science has shown that humans excel at identifying materials and estimating their physical properties based purely on visual appearance. In this paper, we present a novel approach for dense prediction of the physical properties of objects using a collection of images. Inspired by how humans reason about physics through vision, we leverage large language models to propose candidate materials for each object. We then construct a language-embedded point cloud and estimate the physical properties of each 3D point using a zero-shot kernel regression approach. Our method is accurate, annotation-free, and applicable to any object in the open world. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various physical property reasoning tasks, such as estimating the mass of common objects, as well as other properties like friction and hardness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangwon Jang, Jaehyeong Jo, Kimin Lee, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating a personalized subject based on a few reference images. However, current methods struggle with handling multiple subjects simultaneously, often resulting in mixed identities with combined attributes from different subjects. In this work, we present MuDI, a novel framework that enables multi-subject personalization by effectively decoupling identities from multiple subjects. Our main idea is to utilize segmented subjects generated by the Segment Anything Model for both training and inference, as a form of data augmentation for training and initialization for the generation process. Our experiments demonstrate that MuDI can produce high-quality personalized images without identity mixing, even for highly similar subjects as shown in Figure 1. In human evaluation, MuDI shows twice as many successes for personalizing multiple subjects without identity mixing over existing baselines and is preferred over 70% compared to the strongest baseline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Saxon, Fatima Jahara, Mahsa Khoshnoodi, Yujie Lu, Aditya Sharma, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With advances in the quality of text-to-image (T2I) models has come interest in benchmarking their prompt faithfulness-the semantic coherence of generated images to the prompts they were conditioned on. A variety of T2I faithfulness metrics have been proposed, leveraging advances in cross-modal embeddings and vision-language models (VLMs). However, these metrics are not rigorously compared and benchmarked, instead presented against few weak baselines by correlation to human Likert scores over a set of easy-to-discriminate images.
  We introduce T2IScoreScore (TS2), a curated set of semantic error graphs containing a prompt and a set increasingly erroneous images. These allow us to rigorously judge whether a given prompt faithfulness metric can correctly order images with respect to their objective error count and significantly discriminate between different error nodes, using meta-metric scores derived from established statistical tests. Surprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art VLM-based metrics (e.g., TIFA, DSG, LLMScore, VIEScore) we tested fail to significantly outperform simple feature-based metrics like CLIPScore, particularly on a hard subset of naturally-occurring T2I model errors. TS2 will enable the development of better T2I prompt faithfulness metrics through more rigorous comparison of their conformity to expected orderings and separations under objective criteria.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Seyde, Peter Werner, Wilko Schwarting, Markus Wulfmeier, Daniela Rus</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches have shown surprisingly strong capabilities of bang-bang policies for solving continuous control benchmarks. The underlying coarse action space discretizations often yield favourable exploration characteristics while final performance does not visibly suffer in the absence of action penalization in line with optimal control theory. In robotics applications, smooth control signals are commonly preferred to reduce system wear and energy efficiency, but action costs can be detrimental to exploration during early training. In this work, we aim to bridge this performance gap by growing discrete action spaces from coarse to fine control resolution, taking advantage of recent results in decoupled Q-learning to scale our approach to high-dimensional action spaces up to dim(A) = 38. Our work indicates that an adaptive control resolution in combination with value decomposition yields simple critic-only algorithms that yield surprisingly strong performance on continuous control tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Several companies--such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI--have deployed techniques to watermark AI-generated content to enable proactive detection. However, existing literature mainly focuses on user-agnostic detection. Attribution aims to further trace back the user of a generative-AI service who generated a given content detected as AI-generated. Despite its growing importance, attribution is largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by providing the first systematic study on watermark-based, user-aware detection and attribution of AI-generated content. Specifically, we theoretically study the detection and attribution performance via rigorous probabilistic analysis. Moreover, we develop an efficient algorithm to select watermarks for the users to enhance attribution performance. Both our theoretical and empirical results show that watermark-based detection and attribution inherit the accuracy and (non-)robustness properties of the watermarking method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songhui Yue, Xiaoyan Hong, Randy K. Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: The automation of High-Level Context (HLC) reasoning across intelligent systems at scale is imperative because of the unceasing accumulation of contextual data, the trend of the fusion of data from multiple sources (e.g., sensors, intelligent systems), and the intrinsic complexity and dynamism of context-based decision-making processes. To mitigate the challenges posed by these issues, we propose a novel Hierarchical Ontology-State Modeling (HOSM) framework CSM-H-R, which programmatically combines ontologies and states at the modeling phase and runtime phase for attaining the ability to recognize meaningful HLC. It builds on the model of our prior work on the Context State Machine (CSM) engine by incorporating the H (Hierarchy) and R (Relationship and tRansition) dimensions to take care of the dynamic aspects of context. The design of the framework supports the sharing and interoperation of context among intelligent systems and the components for handling CSMs and the management of hierarchy, relationship, and transition. Case studies are developed for IntellElevator and IntellRestaurant, two intelligent applications in a smart campus setting. The prototype implementation of the framework experiments on translating the HLC reasoning into vector and matrix computing and presents the potential of using advanced probabilistic models to reach the next level of automation in integrating intelligent systems; meanwhile, privacy protection support is achieved in the application domain by anonymization through indexing and reducing information correlation. An implementation of the framework is available at https://github.com/songhui01/CSM-H-R.</p>

This has often been framed in terms of a dichotomy between connectionist and symbolic cognitive models. Here, we highlight a recently emerging line of work that suggests a novel reconciliation of these approaches, by exploiting an inductive bias that we term the relational bottleneck. In that approach, neural networks are constrained via their architecture to focus on relations between perceptual inputs, rather than the attributes of individual inputs. We review a family of models that employ this approach to induce abstractions in a data-efficient manner, emphasizing their potential as candidate models for the acquisition of abstract concepts in the human mind and brain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wolfgang Stammer, Felix Friedrich, David Steinmann, Manuel Brack, Hikaru Shindo, Kristian Kersting</p>
<p>Abstract: Current AI research mainly treats explanations as a means for model inspection. Yet, this neglects findings from human psychology that describe the benefit of self-explanations in an agent's learning process. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel approach in the context of image classification, termed Learning by Self-Explaining (LSX). LSX utilizes aspects of self-refining AI and human-guided explanatory machine learning. The underlying idea is that a learner model, in addition to optimizing for the original predictive task, is further optimized based on explanatory feedback from an internal critic model. Intuitively, a learner's explanations are considered "useful" if the internal critic can perform the same task given these explanations. We provide an overview of important components of LSX and, based on this, perform extensive experimental evaluations via three different example instantiations. Our results indicate improvements via Learning by Self-Explaining on several levels: in terms of model generalization, reducing the influence of confounding factors, and providing more task-relevant and faithful model explanations. Overall, our work provides evidence for the potential of self-explaining within the learning phase of an AI model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have shown their extraordinary capacity to solve reasoning tasks, even on tasks that require a complex process involving multiple sub-steps. However, given the vast possible generation space of all the tasks, how the pretrained model learns the reasoning ability remains an open question. We firstly propose that an intrinsic structural constraint on the generated sequence of language-based reasoning -- we called it template-content structure (T-C structure) -- is the key to explain why LLMs can solve a large number of complex reasoning problems with limited training data by showing this structure can reduce the possible space from exponential level to linear level. Furthermore, by generalizing this structure to the hierarchical case, we demonstrate that models can achieve task composition, further reducing the space needed to learn from linear to logarithmic, thereby effectively learning on complex reasoning involving multiple steps. We provide both examples and formal theory of our T-C structure. We also experimentally validate the existence of the T-C structure in some current LLMs and its effectiveness for reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: To allow for tractable probabilistic inference with respect to domain sizes, lifted probabilistic inference exploits symmetries in probabilistic graphical models. However, checking whether two factors encode equivalent semantics and hence are exchangeable is computationally expensive. In this paper, we efficiently solve the problem of detecting exchangeable factors in a factor graph. In particular, we introduce the detection of exchangeable factors (DEFT) algorithm, which allows us to drastically reduce the computational effort for checking whether two factors are exchangeable in practice. While previous approaches iterate all $O(n!)$ permutations of a factor's argument list in the worst case (where $n$ is the number of arguments of the factor), we prove that DEFT efficiently identifies restrictions to drastically reduce the number of permutations and validate the efficiency of DEFT in our empirical evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning Lu, Shengcai Liu, Zhirui Zhang, Qi Wang, Haifeng Liu, Ke Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Word-level textual adversarial attacks have demonstrated notable efficacy in misleading Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Despite their success, the underlying reasons for their effectiveness and the fundamental characteristics of adversarial examples (AEs) remain obscure. This work aims to interpret word-level attacks by examining their $n$-gram frequency patterns. Our comprehensive experiments reveal that in approximately 90\% of cases, word-level attacks lead to the generation of examples where the frequency of $n$-grams decreases, a tendency we term as the $n$-gram Frequency Descend ($n$-FD). This finding suggests a straightforward strategy to enhance model robustness: training models using examples with $n$-FD. To examine the feasibility of this strategy, we employed the $n$-gram frequency information, as an alternative to conventional loss gradients, to generate perturbed examples in adversarial training. The experiment results indicate that the frequency-based approach performs comparably with the gradient-based approach in improving model robustness. Our research offers a novel and more intuitive perspective for understanding word-level textual adversarial attacks and proposes a new direction to improve model robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a degenerative valve condition that causes substantial morbidity and mortality. This condition is under-diagnosed and under-treated. In clinical practice, AS is diagnosed with expert review of transthoracic echocardiography, which produces dozens of ultrasound images of the heart. Only some of these views show the aortic valve. To automate screening for AS, deep networks must learn to mimic a human expert's ability to identify views of the aortic valve then aggregate across these relevant images to produce a study-level diagnosis. We find previous approaches to AS detection yield insufficient accuracy due to relying on inflexible averages across images. We further find that off-the-shelf attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) performs poorly. We contribute a new end-to-end MIL approach with two key methodological innovations. First, a supervised attention technique guides the learned attention mechanism to favor relevant views. Second, a novel self-supervised pretraining strategy applies contrastive learning on the representation of the whole study instead of individual images as commonly done in prior literature. Experiments on an open-access dataset and an external validation set show that our approach yields higher accuracy while reducing model size.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI has made significant strides in computer vision, particularly in text-driven image/video synthesis (T2I/T2V). Despite the notable advancements, it remains challenging in human-centric content synthesis such as realistic dance generation. Current methodologies, primarily tailored for human motion transfer, encounter difficulties when confronted with real-world dance scenarios (e.g., social media dance), which require to generalize across a wide spectrum of poses and intricate human details. In this paper, we depart from the traditional paradigm of human motion transfer and emphasize two additional critical attributes for the synthesis of human dance content in social media contexts: (i) Generalizability: the model should be able to generalize beyond generic human viewpoints as well as unseen human subjects, backgrounds, and poses; (ii) Compositionality: it should allow for the seamless composition of seen/unseen subjects, backgrounds, and poses from different sources. To address these challenges, we introduce DISCO, which includes a novel model architecture with disentangled control to improve the compositionality of dance synthesis, and an effective human attribute pre-training for better generalizability to unseen humans. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that DisCc can generate high-quality human dance images and videos with diverse appearances and flexible motions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Berglund, Meg Tong, Max Kaufmann, Mikita Balesni, Asa Cooper Stickland, Tomasz Korbak, Owain Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: We expose a surprising failure of generalization in auto-regressive large language models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form "A is B", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction "B is A". This is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on "Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman to travel to space", it will not automatically be able to answer the question, "Who was the first woman to travel to space?". Moreover, the likelihood of the correct answer ("Valentina Tershkova") will not be higher than for a random name. Thus, models do not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set: if "A is B" occurs, "B is A" is more likely to occur. It is worth noting, however, that if "A is B" appears in-context, models can deduce the reverse relationship. We provide evidence for the Reversal Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as "Uriah Hawthorne is the composer of Abyssal Melodies" and showing that they fail to correctly answer "Who composed Abyssal Melodies?". The Reversal Curse is robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data augmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about real-world celebrities, such as "Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee Pfeiffer]" and the reverse "Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?". GPT-4 correctly answers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the latter.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiying Yu, Quan Sun, Xiaosong Zhang, Yufeng Cui, Fan Zhang, Yue Cao, Xinlong Wang, Jingjing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models demonstrate remarkable generalist ability to perform diverse multimodal tasks in a zero-shot manner. Large-scale web-based image-text pairs contribute fundamentally to this success, but suffer from excessive noise. Recent studies use alternative captions synthesized by captioning models and have achieved notable benchmark performance. However, our experiments reveal significant Scalability Deficiency and World Knowledge Loss issues in models trained with synthetic captions, which have been largely obscured by their initial benchmark success. Upon closer examination, we identify the root cause as the overly-simplified language structure and lack of knowledge details in existing synthetic captions. To provide higher-quality and more scalable multimodal pretraining data, we propose CapsFusion, an advanced framework that leverages large language models to consolidate and refine information from both web-based image-text pairs and synthetic captions. Extensive experiments show that CapsFusion captions exhibit remarkable all-round superiority over existing captions in terms of model performance (e.g., 18.8 and 18.3 improvements in CIDEr score on COCO and NoCaps), sample efficiency (requiring 11-16 times less computation than baselines), world knowledge depth, and scalability. These effectiveness, efficiency and scalability advantages position CapsFusion as a promising candidate for future scaling of LMM training.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI-based image generation has continued to rapidly improve, producing increasingly more realistic images with fewer obvious visual flaws. AI-generated images are being used to create fake online profiles which in turn are being used for spam, fraud, and disinformation campaigns. As the general problem of detecting any type of manipulated or synthesized content is receiving increasing attention, here we focus on a more narrow task of distinguishing a real face from an AI-generated face. This is particularly applicable when tackling inauthentic online accounts with a fake user profile photo. We show that by focusing on only faces, a more resilient and general-purpose artifact can be detected that allows for the detection of AI-generated faces from a variety of GAN- and diffusion-based synthesis engines, and across image resolutions (as low as 128 x 128 pixels) and qualities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaurav Sahu, Olga Vechtomova, Issam H. Laradji</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a widely used technique in scenarios where labeled data is scarce and unlabeled data is abundant. While SSL is popular for image and text classification, it is relatively underexplored for the task of extractive text summarization. Standard SSL methods follow a teacher-student paradigm to first train a classification model and then use the classifier's confidence values to select pseudo-labels for the subsequent training cycle; however, such classifiers are not suitable to measure the accuracy of pseudo-labels as they lack specific tuning for evaluation, which leads to confidence values that fail to capture the semantics and correctness of the generated summary. To address this problem, we propose a prompt-based pseudo-labeling strategy with LLMs that picks unlabeled examples with more accurate pseudo-labels than using just the classifier's probability outputs. Our approach also includes a relabeling mechanism that improves the quality of pseudo-labels. We evaluate our method on three text summarization datasets: TweetSumm, WikiHow, and ArXiv/PubMed. We empirically show that a prompting-based LLM that scores and generates pseudo-labels outperforms existing SSL methods on ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores on all the datasets. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive G-Eval scores (evaluation with GPT-4) as a fully supervised method that uses 100% of the labeled data with only 16.67% of the labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bibek Upadhayay, Vahid Behzadan</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating multilingual LLMs poses a significant challenge. Pretraining or fine-tuning LLMs to adopt new languages is evidently very costly. Furthermore, there exist limitations concerning benchmark datasets and the metrics used to measure model performance in multilingual settings. This paper proposes cost-effective solutions to both aforementioned challenges. Firstly, we introduce the Multilingual Instruction-Tuning Dataset (MITS), comprised of Alpaca-52K, Dolly-15K, and Vicuna Benchmark translations into 132 languages. Secondly, we propose a new method called \emph{TaCo: Translation-Assisted Cross-Linguality}, which utilizes translations in a chain-of-thought process to instruction-tune LLMs on new languages through a curriculum-learning process. As a proof of concept, we experimented with the instruction-tuned Guanaco-33B model, performing further instruction tuning using our proposed TaCo method in three low-resource languages and one high-resource language. Our results indicate that the TaCo method impresses GPT-4 with an 82\% score for a low-resource language in the Vicuna Benchmark dataset, doubling the performance in contrast to instruction tuning alone. Furthermore, TaCo shows promise in creating multilingual LLMs, even for low-resource languages. We have released our datasets and model adapters\footnote{https://github.com/UNHSAILLab/TaCo} , encouraging the research community to utilize these resources to advance work on multilingual LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vihari Piratla, Juyeon Heo, Katherine M. Collins, Sukriti Singh, Adrian Weller</p>
<p>Abstract: Model explanations can be valuable for interpreting and debugging predictive models. We study a specific kind called Concept Explanations, where the goal is to interpret a model using human-understandable concepts. Although popular for their easy interpretation, concept explanations are known to be noisy. We begin our work by identifying various sources of uncertainty in the estimation pipeline that lead to such noise. We then propose an uncertainty-aware Bayesian estimation method to address these issues, which readily improved the quality of explanations. We demonstrate with theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation that explanations computed by our method are robust to train-time choices while also being label-efficient. Further, our method proved capable of recovering relevant concepts amongst a bank of thousands, in an evaluation with real-datasets and off-the-shelf models, demonstrating its scalability. We believe the improved quality of uncertainty-aware concept explanations make them a strong candidate for more reliable model interpretation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Gianola, Marco Montali, Sarah Winkler</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world processes operate on objects that are inter-dependent. To accurately reflect the nature of such processes, object-centric process mining techniques are needed, notably conformance checking. However, while the object-centric perspective has recently gained traction, few concrete process mining techniques have been presented so far. Moreover, existing approaches are severely limited in their abilities to keep track of object identity and object dependencies. Consequently, serious problems in logs remain undetected. In this paper, we present a new formalism that combines the key modelling features of two existing approaches, in particular the ability of object-centric Petri nets to capture one-to-many relations and the one of Petri nets with identifiers to compare and synchronize objects based on their identity. We call the resulting formalism 'object-centric Petri nets with identifiers', and define alignments and the conformance checking task for this setting. We propose a conformance checking approach for such nets based on an encoding in satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), and illustrate how it can be effectively used to overcome shortcomings of earlier work. To assess its practicality, we perform an evaluation on data from the literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conventional computing paradigm struggles to fulfill the rapidly growing demands from emerging applications, especially those for machine intelligence, because much of the power and energy is consumed by constant data transfers between logic and memory modules. A new paradigm, called "computational random-access memory (CRAM)" has emerged to address this fundamental limitation. CRAM performs logic operations directly using the memory cells themselves, without having the data ever leave the memory. The energy and performance benefits of CRAM for both conventional and emerging applications have been well established by prior numerical studies. However, there lacks an experimental demonstration and study of CRAM to evaluate its computation accuracy, which is a realistic and application-critical metrics for its technological feasibility and competitiveness. In this work, a CRAM array based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is experimentally demonstrated. First, basic memory operations as well as 2-, 3-, and 5-input logic operations are studied. Then, a 1-bit full adder with two different designs is demonstrated. Based on the experimental results, a suite of modeling has been developed to characterize the accuracy of CRAM computation. Further analysis of scalar addition, multiplication, and matrix multiplication shows promising results. These results are then applied to a complete application: a neural network based handwritten digit classifier, as an example to show the connection between the application performance and further MTJ development. The classifier achieved almost-perfect classification accuracy, with reasonable projections of future MTJ development. With the confirmation of MTJ-based CRAM's accuracy, there is a strong case that this technology will have a significant impact on power- and energy-demanding applications of machine intelligence.</p>

Our investigation proves that MPS rival traditional deep learning models such as autoencoders and GANs in terms of performance, while providing much richer model interpretability. Our approach naturally facilitates the extraction of feature-wise probabilities, Von Neumann Entropy, and mutual information, offering a compelling narrative for classification of anomalies and fostering an unprecedented level of transparency and interpretability, something fundamental to understand the rationale behind artificial intelligence decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> J. E. Eicher, R. F. Irgoli\v{c}</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like gpt-3.5-turbo and claude-instant-1.2 have become instrumental in interpreting and executing semantic-based tasks. Unfortunately, these models' inherent biases, akin to human cognitive biases, adversely affect their performance. Particularly affected is object selection from lists; a fundamental operation in digital navigation and decision-making. This research critically examines these biases and quantifies the effects on a representative list selection task. To explore these biases, we conducted a series of controlled experiments, manipulating temperature, list length, object identity, object type, prompt complexity, and model. This enabled us to isolate and measure the influence of the biases on selection behavior. Our findings show that bias structure is strongly dependent on the model, with object type modulating the magnitude of the effect. With a strong primacy effect, causing the first objects in a list to be disproportionately represented in outputs. Furthermore the usage of guard rails, a prompt engineering method of ensuring a response structure, can increase bias and decrease instruction adherence when combined with a selection task. The bias is ablated when the guard rail step is separated from the list sampling step, lowering the complexity of each individual task. The implications of this research are two-fold, practically providing a guide for designing unbiased LLM applications and theoretically suggesting that LLMs experience a form of cognitive load compensated for by increasing bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the computational limits of the memory retrieval dynamics of modern Hopfield models from the fine-grained complexity analysis. Our key contribution is the characterization of a phase transition behavior in the efficiency of all possible modern Hopfield models based on the norm of patterns. Specifically, we establish an upper bound criterion for the norm of input query patterns and memory patterns. Only below this criterion, sub-quadratic (efficient) variants of the modern Hopfield model exist, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). To showcase our theory, we provide a formal example of efficient constructions of modern Hopfield models using low-rank approximation when the efficient criterion holds. This includes a derivation of a lower bound on the computational time, scaling linearly with $\max\{$\# of stored memory patterns, length of input query sequence$\}$. In addition, we prove its memory retrieval error bound and exponential memory capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nate Gillman, Michael Freeman, Daksh Aggarwal, Chia-Hong Hsu, Calvin Luo, Yonglong Tian, Chen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: As synthetic data becomes higher quality and proliferates on the internet, machine learning models are increasingly trained on a mix of human- and machine-generated data. Despite the successful stories of using synthetic data for representation learning, using synthetic data for generative model training creates "self-consuming loops" which may lead to training instability or even collapse, unless certain conditions are met. Our paper aims to stabilize self-consuming generative model training. Our theoretical results demonstrate that by introducing an idealized correction function, which maps a data point to be more likely under the true data distribution, self-consuming loops can be made exponentially more stable. We then propose self-correction functions, which rely on expert knowledge (e.g. the laws of physics programmed in a simulator), and aim to approximate the idealized corrector automatically and at scale. We empirically validate the effectiveness of self-correcting self-consuming loops on the challenging human motion synthesis task, and observe that it successfully avoids model collapse, even when the ratio of synthetic data to real data is as high as 100%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous mobile agents (e.g., UAVs and UGVs) are typically expected to incur low power/energy consumption for solving machine learning tasks (such as object recognition), as these mobile agents are usually powered by portable batteries. These requirements can be fulfilled by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), since their bio-inspired spike-based operations offer high accuracy and ultra low-power/energy computation. Currently, most of the SNN architectures are derived from Artificial Neural Networks whose neurons' architectures and operations are different from SNNs, or developed without considering memory budgets from the underlying processing hardware of autonomous mobile agents. These limitations hinder SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. Toward this, we propose SpikeNAS, a novel fast memory-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for SNNs that quickly finds an appropriate SNN architecture with high accuracy under the given memory budgets from autonomous mobile agents. To do this, our SpikeNAS employs several key steps: analyzing the impacts of network operations on the accuracy, enhancing the network architecture to improve the learning quality, and developing a fast memory-aware search algorithm. The experimental results show that our SpikeNAS improves the searching time and maintains high accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art while meeting the given memory budgets (e.g., 4.4x faster search with 1.3% accuracy improvement for CIFAR100, using an Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada GPU machine), thereby quickly providing the appropriate SNN architecture for the memory-constrained autonomous mobile agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryandito Diandaru, Lucky Susanto, Zilu Tang, Ayu Purwarianti, Derry Wijaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong machine translation capabilities on languages they are trained on. However, the impact of factors beyond training data size on translation performance remains a topic of debate, especially concerning languages not directly encountered during training. Our study delves into Llama2's translation capabilities. By modeling a linear relationship between linguistic feature distances and machine translation scores, we ask ourselves if there are potentially better central languages for LLMs other than English. Our experiments show that the 7B Llama2 model yields above 10 BLEU when translating into all languages it has seen, which rarely happens for languages it has not seen. Most translation improvements into unseen languages come from scaling up the model size rather than instruction tuning or increasing shot count. Furthermore, our correlation analysis reveals that syntactic similarity is not the only linguistic factor that strongly correlates with machine translation scores. Interestingly, we discovered that under specific circumstances, some languages (e.g. Swedish, Catalan), despite having significantly less training data, exhibit comparable correlation levels to English. These insights challenge the prevailing landscape of LLMs, suggesting that models centered around languages other than English could provide a more efficient foundation for multilingual applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoxuan Bai, Jingxuan Yang, Weiduo Gong, Yi Zhang, Qiujing Lu, Shuo Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent systems are increasingly integral to our daily lives, yet rare safety-critical events present significant latent threats to their practical deployment. Addressing this challenge hinges on accurately predicting the probability of safety-critical events occurring within a given time step from the current state, a metric we define as 'criticality'. The complexity of predicting criticality arises from the extreme data imbalance caused by rare events in high dimensional variables associated with the rare events, a challenge we refer to as the curse of rarity. Existing methods tend to be either overly conservative or prone to overlooking safety-critical events, thus struggling to achieve both high precision and recall rates, which severely limits their applicability. This study endeavors to develop a criticality prediction model that excels in both precision and recall rates for evaluating the criticality of safety-critical autonomous systems. We propose a multi-stage learning framework designed to progressively densify the dataset, mitigating the curse of rarity across stages. To validate our approach, we evaluate it in two cases: lunar lander and bipedal walker scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method surpasses traditional approaches, providing a more accurate and dependable assessment of criticality in intelligent systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of ChatGPT as a supportive tool in education, notably in programming courses, addresses the unique challenges of programming education by providing assistance with debugging, code generation, and explanations. Despite existing research validating ChatGPT's effectiveness, its application in university-level programming education and a detailed understanding of student interactions and perspectives remain limited. This paper explores ChatGPT's impact on learning in a Python programming course tailored for first-year students over eight weeks. By analyzing responses from surveys, open-ended questions, and student-ChatGPT dialog data, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of ChatGPT's utility and identify both its advantages and limitations as perceived by students. Our study uncovers a generally positive reception toward ChatGPT and offers insights into its role in enhancing the programming education experience.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mutlu Cukurova</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a multi dimensional view of AI's role in learning and education, emphasizing the intricate interplay between AI, analytics, and the learning processes. Here, I challenge the prevalent narrow conceptualization of AI as stochastic tools, as exemplified in generative AI, and argue for the importance of alternative conceptualisations of AI. I highlight the differences between human intelligence and artificial information processing, the cognitive diversity inherent in AI algorithms, and posit that AI can also serve as an instrument for understanding human learning. Early learning sciences and AI in Education research, which saw AI as an analogy for human intelligence, have diverged from this perspective, prompting a need to rekindle this connection. The paper presents three unique conceptualizations of AI in education: the externalization of human cognition, the internalization of AI models to influence human thought processes, and the extension of human cognition via tightly integrated human-AI systems. Examples from current research and practice are examined as instances of the three conceptualisations, highlighting the potential value and limitations of each conceptualisation for education, as well as the perils of overemphasis on externalising human cognition as exemplified in today's hype surrounding generative AI tools. The paper concludes with an advocacy for a broader educational approach that includes educating people about AI and innovating educational systems to remain relevant in an AI enabled world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amitangshu Mukherjee, Timur Ibrayev, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which alter their predictions by adding carefully crafted noise. Since human eyes are robust to such inputs, it is possible that the vulnerability stems from the standard way of processing inputs in one shot by processing every pixel with the same importance. In contrast, neuroscience suggests that the human vision system can differentiate salient features by (1) switching between multiple fixation points (saccades) and (2) processing the surrounding with a non-uniform external resolution (foveation). In this work, we advocate that the integration of such active vision mechanisms into current deep learning systems can offer robustness benefits. Specifically, we empirically demonstrate the inherent robustness of two active vision methods - GFNet and FALcon - under a black box threat model. By learning and inferencing based on downsampled glimpses obtained from multiple distinct fixation points within an input, we show that these active methods achieve (2-3) times greater robustness compared to a standard passive convolutional network under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. More importantly, we provide illustrative and interpretable visualization analysis that demonstrates how performing inference from distinct fixation points makes active vision methods less vulnerable to malicious inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) provides an efficient and tailored method for assessing the proficiency of examinees, by dynamically adjusting test questions based on their performance. Widely adopted across diverse fields like education, healthcare, sports, and sociology, CAT has revolutionized testing practices. While traditional methods rely on psychometrics and statistics, the increasing complexity of large-scale testing has spurred the integration of machine learning techniques. This paper aims to provide a machine learning-focused survey on CAT, presenting a fresh perspective on this adaptive testing method. By examining the test question selection algorithm at the heart of CAT's adaptivity, we shed light on its functionality. Furthermore, we delve into cognitive diagnosis models, question bank construction, and test control within CAT, exploring how machine learning can optimize these components. Through an analysis of current methods, strengths, limitations, and challenges, we strive to develop robust, fair, and efficient CAT systems. By bridging psychometric-driven CAT research with machine learning, this survey advocates for a more inclusive and interdisciplinary approach to the future of adaptive testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuu Jinnai, Tetsuro Morimura, Kaito Ariu, Kenshi Abe</p>
<p>Abstract: Best-of-N (BoN) sampling with a reward model has been shown to be an effective strategy for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences at the time of decoding. BoN sampling is susceptible to a problem known as reward hacking. Because the reward model is an imperfect proxy for the true objective, over-optimizing its value can compromise its performance on the true objective. A common solution to prevent reward hacking in preference learning techniques is to optimize a reward using proximity regularization (e.g., KL regularization), which ensures that the language model remains close to the reference model. In this research, we propose Regularized Best-of-N (RBoN), a variant of BoN that aims to mitigate reward hacking by incorporating a proximity term in response selection, similar to preference learning techniques. We evaluate two variants of RBoN on the AlpacaFarm dataset and find that they outperform BoN, especially when the proxy reward model has a low correlation with the true objective.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01365">Prompt-prompted Mixture of Experts for Efficient LLM Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry Dong, Beidi Chen, Yuejie Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), they have been applied to many fields due to their remarkable utility, but this comes at a considerable computational cost at deployment. Fortunately, some methods such as pruning or constructing a mixture of experts (MoE) aim at exploiting sparsity in transformer feedforward (FF) blocks to gain boosts in speed and reduction in memory requirements. However, these techniques can be very costly and inflexible in practice, as they often require training or are restricted to specific types of architectures. To address this, we introduce GRIFFIN, a novel training-free MoE that selects unique FF experts at the sequence level for efficient generation across a plethora of LLMs with different non-ReLU activation functions. This is possible due to a critical observation that many trained LLMs naturally produce highly structured FF activation patterns within a sequence, which we call flocking. Despite our method's simplicity, we show with 50% of the FF parameters, GRIFFIN maintains the original model's performance with little to no degradation on a variety of classification and generation tasks, all while improving latency (e.g. 1.25$\times$ speed-up in Llama 2 13B on an NVIDIA L40).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushen Li, Jinpeng Wang, Tao Dai, Jieming Zhu, Jun Yuan, Rui Zhang, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting click-through rates (CTR) is a fundamental task for Web applications, where a key issue is to devise effective models for feature interactions. Current methodologies predominantly concentrate on modeling feature interactions within an individual sample, while overlooking the potential cross-sample relationships that can serve as a reference context to enhance the prediction. To make up for such deficiency, this paper develops a Retrieval-Augmented Transformer (RAT), aiming to acquire fine-grained feature interactions within and across samples. By retrieving similar samples, we construct augmented input for each target sample. We then build Transformer layers with cascaded attention to capture both intra- and cross-sample feature interactions, facilitating comprehensive reasoning for improved CTR prediction while retaining efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness of RAT and suggest its advantage in long-tail scenarios. The code has been open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/YushenLi807/WWW24-RAT}.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02456">PhonologyBench: Evaluating Phonological Skills of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashima Suvarna, Harshita Khandelwal, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Phonology, the study of speech's structure and pronunciation rules, is a critical yet often overlooked component in Large Language Model (LLM) research. LLMs are widely used in various downstream applications that leverage phonology such as educational tools and poetry generation. Moreover, LLMs can potentially learn imperfect associations between orthographic and phonological forms from the training data. Thus, it is imperative to benchmark the phonological skills of LLMs. To this end, we present PhonologyBench, a novel benchmark consisting of three diagnostic tasks designed to explicitly test the phonological skills of LLMs in English: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, syllable counting, and rhyme word generation. Despite having no access to speech data, LLMs showcased notable performance on the PhonologyBench tasks. However, we observe a significant gap of 17% and 45% on Rhyme Word Generation and Syllable counting, respectively, when compared to humans. Our findings underscore the importance of studying LLM performance on phonological tasks that inadvertently impact real-world applications. Furthermore, we encourage researchers to choose LLMs that perform well on the phonological task that is closely related to the downstream application since we find that no single model consistently outperforms the others on all the tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduard Frankford, Clemens Sauerwein, Patrick Bassner, Stephan Krusche, Ruth Breu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains, the education sector is set for transformation. The potential of AI-driven tools in enhancing the learning experience, especially in programming, is immense. However, the scientific evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) used in Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) as an AI-Tutor remains largely unexplored. Therefore, there is a need to understand how students interact with such AI-Tutors and to analyze their experiences. In this paper, we conducted an exploratory case study by integrating the GPT-3.5-Turbo model as an AI-Tutor within the APAS Artemis. Through a combination of empirical data collection and an exploratory survey, we identified different user types based on their interaction patterns with the AI-Tutor. Additionally, the findings highlight advantages, such as timely feedback and scalability. However, challenges like generic responses and students' concerns about a learning progress inhibition when using the AI-Tutor were also evident. This research adds to the discourse on AI's role in education.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02817">A Survey of Optimization-based Task and Motion Planning: From Classical To Learning Approaches</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhigen Zhao, Shuo Cheng, Yan Ding, Ziyi Zhou, Shiqi Zhang, Danfei Xu, Ye Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning and low-level motion planning to equip robots with the autonomy to effectively reason over long-horizon, dynamic tasks. Optimization-based TAMP focuses on hybrid optimization approaches that define goal conditions via objective functions and are capable of handling open-ended goals, robotic dynamics, and physical interaction between the robot and the environment. Therefore, optimization-based TAMP is particularly suited to solve highly complex, contact-rich locomotion and manipulation problems. This survey provides a comprehensive review on optimization-based TAMP, covering (i) planning domain representations, including action description languages and temporal logic, (ii) individual solution strategies for components of TAMP, including AI planning and trajectory optimization (TO), and (iii) the dynamic interplay between logic-based task planning and model-based TO. A particular focus of this survey is to highlight the algorithm structures to efficiently solve TAMP, especially hierarchical and distributed approaches. Additionally, the survey emphasizes the synergy between the classical methods and contemporary learning-based innovations such as large language models. Furthermore, the future research directions for TAMP is discussed in this survey, highlighting both algorithmic and application-specific challenges.</p>

The agent learns a parameterized-action-conditioned dynamics model and plans with a modified Model Predictive Path Integral control. We theoretically quantify the difference between the generated trajectory and the optimal trajectory during planning in terms of the value they achieved through the lens of Lipschitz Continuity. Our empirical results on several standard benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic performance than state-of-the-art PAMDP methods.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03493">A Methodology to Study the Impact of Spiking Neural Network Parameters considering Event-Based Automotive Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Iqra Bano, Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Alberto Marchisio, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems are considered as the future of human mobility and transportation. Solving computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection/segmentation, with high accuracy and low power/energy consumption, is highly needed to realize AD systems in real life. These requirements can potentially be satisfied by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, the state-of-the-art works in SNN-based AD systems still focus on proposing network models that can achieve high accuracy, and they have not systematically studied the roles of SNN parameters when used for learning event-based automotive data. Therefore, we still lack understanding of how to effectively develop SNN models for AD systems. Toward this, we propose a novel methodology to systematically study and analyze the impact of SNN parameters considering event-based automotive data, then leverage this analysis for enhancing SNN developments. To do this, we first explore different settings of SNN parameters that directly affect the learning mechanism (i.e., batch size, learning rate, neuron threshold potential, and weight decay), then analyze the accuracy results. Afterward, we propose techniques that jointly improve SNN accuracy and reduce training time. Experimental results show that our methodology can improve the SNN models for AD systems than the state-of-the-art, as it achieves higher accuracy (i.e., 86%) for the NCARS dataset, and it can also achieve iso-accuracy (i.e., ~85% with standard deviation less than 0.5%) while speeding up the training time by 1.9x. In this manner, our research work provides a set of guidelines for SNN parameter enhancements, thereby enabling the practical developments of SNN-based AD systems.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03635">WorDepth: Variational Language Prior for Monocular Depth Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyao Zeng, Daniel Wang, Fengyu Yang, Hyoungseob Park, Yangchao Wu, Stefano Soatto, Byung-Woo Hong, Dong Lao, Alex Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from a single image is an ill-posed problem with inherent ambiguities, i.e. scale. Predicting a 3D scene from text description(s) is similarly ill-posed, i.e. spatial arrangements of objects described. We investigate the question of whether two inherently ambiguous modalities can be used in conjunction to produce metric-scaled reconstructions. To test this, we focus on monocular depth estimation, the problem of predicting a dense depth map from a single image, but with an additional text caption describing the scene. To this end, we begin by encoding the text caption as a mean and standard deviation; using a variational framework, we learn the distribution of the plausible metric reconstructions of 3D scenes corresponding to the text captions as a prior. To "select" a specific reconstruction or depth map, we encode the given image through a conditional sampler that samples from the latent space of the variational text encoder, which is then decoded to the output depth map. Our approach is trained alternatingly between the text and image branches: in one optimization step, we predict the mean and standard deviation from the text description and sample from a standard Gaussian, and in the other, we sample using a (image) conditional sampler. Once trained, we directly predict depth from the encoded text using the conditional sampler. We demonstrate our approach on indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) scenarios, where we show that language can consistently improve performance in both.</p>
