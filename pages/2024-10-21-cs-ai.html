<p>Abstract: KnowWhereGraph is one of the largest fully publicly available geospatial knowledge graphs. It includes data from 30 layers on natural hazards (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires), climate variables (e.g., air temperature, precipitation), soil properties, crop and land-cover types, demographics, and human health, various place and region identifiers, among other themes. These have been leveraged through the graph by a variety of applications to address challenges in food security and agricultural supply chains; sustainability related to soil conservation practices and farm labor; and delivery of emergency humanitarian aid following a disaster. In this paper, we introduce the ontology that acts as the schema for KnowWhereGraph. This broad overview provides insight into the requirements and design specifications for the graph and its schema, including the development methodology (modular ontology modeling) and the resources utilized to implement, materialize, and deploy KnowWhereGraph with its end-user interfaces and public query SPARQL endpoint.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel Ma, Jingyi Qu, Andreea Bobu, Dylan Hadfield-Menell</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an online method for embodied agents to learn and accomplish diverse user goals. While offline methods like RLHF can represent various goals but require large datasets, our approach achieves similar flexibility with online efficiency. We extract natural language goal representations from conversations with Large Language Models (LLMs). We prompt an LLM to role play as a human with different goals and use the corresponding likelihoods to run Bayesian inference over potential goals. As a result, our method can represent uncertainty over complex goals based on unrestricted dialog. We evaluate our method in grocery shopping and home robot assistance domains using a text-based interface and AI2Thor simulation respectively. Results show our method outperforms ablation baselines that lack either explicit goal representation or probabilistic inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanming Zhang, Akshith Kota, Eric Papenhausen, Klaus Mueller</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal networks are widely used in many fields to model the complex relationships between variables. A recent approach has sought to construct causal networks by leveraging the wisdom of crowds through the collective participation of humans. While this can yield detailed causal networks that model the underlying phenomena quite well, it requires a large number of individuals with domain understanding. We adopt a different approach: leveraging the causal knowledge that large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, have learned by ingesting massive amounts of literature. Within a dedicated visual analytics interface, called CausalChat, users explore single variables or variable pairs recursively to identify causal relations, latent variables, confounders, and mediators, constructing detailed causal networks through conversation. Each probing interaction is translated into a tailored GPT-4 prompt and the response is conveyed through visual representations which are linked to the generated text for explanations. We demonstrate the functionality of CausalChat across diverse data contexts and conduct user studies involving both domain experts and laypersons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyong Huang, Heli Sun, Qunshu Gao, Wenjie Huang, Ruichen Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of the internet, the richness of User-Generated Contentcontinues to increase, making Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) a research hotspot. Existing studies have achieved certain results in MABSA, but they have not effectively addressed the analytical challenges in scenarios where multiple entities and sentiments coexist. This paper innovatively introduces Large Language Models (LLMs) for event decomposition and proposes a reinforcement learning framework for Multimodal Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA-RL) framework. This framework decomposes the original text into a set of events using LLMs, reducing the complexity of analysis, introducing reinforcement learning to optimize model parameters. Experimental results show that MABSA-RL outperforms existing advanced methods on two benchmark datasets. This paper provides a new research perspective and method for multimodal aspect-level sentiment analysis.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14219">Formal Explanations for Neuro-Symbolic AI</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sushmita Paul, Jinqiang Yu, Jip J. Dekker, Alexey Ignatiev, Peter J. Stuckey</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the practical success of Artificial Intelligence (AI), current neural AI algorithms face two significant issues. First, the decisions made by neural architectures are often prone to bias and brittleness. Second, when a chain of reasoning is required, neural systems often perform poorly. Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence is a promising approach that tackles these (and other) weaknesses by combining the power of neural perception and symbolic reasoning. Meanwhile, the success of AI has made it critical to understand its behaviour, leading to the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). While neuro-symbolic AI systems have important advantages over purely neural AI, we still need to explain their actions, which are obscured by the interactions of the neural and symbolic components. To address the issue, this paper proposes a formal approach to explaining the decisions of neuro-symbolic systems. The approach hinges on the use of formal abductive explanations and on solving the neuro-symbolic explainability problem hierarchically. Namely, it first computes a formal explanation for the symbolic component of the system, which serves to identify a subset of the individual parts of neural information that needs to be explained. This is followed by explaining only those individual neural inputs, independently of each other, which facilitates succinctness of hierarchical formal explanations and helps to increase the overall performance of the approach. Experimental results for a few complex reasoning tasks demonstrate practical efficiency of the proposed approach, in comparison to purely neural systems, from the perspective of explanation size, explanation time, training time, model sizes, and the quality of explanations reported.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Tang, Xianghe Pang, Zexi Liu, Bohan Tang, Rui Ye, Xiaowen Dong, Yanfeng Wang, Siheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training is essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions. Inspired by the recent success of using LLMs to simulate human society, we leverage multi-agent simulation to automatically generate diverse text-based scenarios, capturing a wide range of real-world human needs. We propose MATRIX, a multi-agent simulator that creates realistic and scalable scenarios. Leveraging these outputs, we introduce a novel scenario-driven instruction generator MATRIX-Gen for controllable and highly realistic data synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively generates both general and domain-specific data. Notably, on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, Llama-3-8B-Base, post-trained on datasets synthesized by MATRIX-Gen with just 20K instruction-response pairs, outperforms Meta's Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, which was trained on over 10M pairs; see our project at https://github.com/ShuoTang123/MATRIX-Gen.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Hu, Hongyu Fu, Jinge Wang, Yifeng Wang, Zhikun Li, Renjun Xu, Yu Lu, Yaochu Jin, Lili Pan, Zhenzhong Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific innovation is pivotal for humanity, and harnessing large language models (LLMs) to generate research ideas could transform discovery. However, existing LLMs often produce simplistic and repetitive suggestions due to their limited ability in acquiring external knowledge for innovation. To address this problem, we introduce an enhanced planning and search methodology designed to boost the creative potential of LLM-based systems. Our approach involves an iterative process to purposely plan the retrieval of external knowledge, progressively enriching the idea generation with broader and deeper insights. Validation through automated and human assessments indicates that our framework substantially elevates the quality of generated ideas, particularly in novelty and diversity. The number of unique novel ideas produced by our framework is 3.4 times higher than without it. Moreover, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art, generating at least 2.5 times more top-rated ideas based on 170 seed papers in a Swiss Tournament evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaiyuan Yao, Longchao Da, Vishnu Nandam, Justin Turnau, Zhiwei Liu, Linsey Pang, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of autonomous vehicles into urban traffic has great potential to improve efficiency by reducing congestion and optimizing traffic flow systematically. In this paper, we introduce CoMAL (Collaborative Multi-Agent LLMs), a framework designed to address the mixed-autonomy traffic problem by collaboration among autonomous vehicles to optimize traffic flow. CoMAL is built upon large language models, operating in an interactive traffic simulation environment. It utilizes a Perception Module to observe surrounding agents and a Memory Module to store strategies for each agent. The overall workflow includes a Collaboration Module that encourages autonomous vehicles to discuss the effective strategy and allocate roles, a reasoning engine to determine optimal behaviors based on assigned roles, and an Execution Module that controls vehicle actions using a hybrid approach combining rule-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAL achieves superior performance on the Flow benchmark. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of different language models and compare our framework with reinforcement learning approaches. It highlights the strong cooperative capability of LLM agents and presents a promising solution to the mixed-autonomy traffic challenge.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14371">Interpretable end-to-end Neurosymbolic Reinforcement Learning agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nils Grandien, Quentin Delfosse, Kristian Kersting</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents rely on shortcut learning, preventing them from generalizing to slightly different environments. To address this problem, symbolic method, that use object-centric states, have been developed. However, comparing these methods to deep agents is not fair, as these last operate from raw pixel-based states. In this work, we instantiate the symbolic SCoBots framework. SCoBots decompose RL tasks into intermediate, interpretable representations, culminating in action decisions based on a comprehensible set of object-centric relational concepts. This architecture aids in demystifying agent decisions. By explicitly learning to extract object-centric representations from raw states, object-centric RL, and policy distillation via rule extraction, this work places itself within the neurosymbolic AI paradigm, blending the strengths of neural networks with symbolic AI. We present the first implementation of an end-to-end trained SCoBot, separately evaluate of its components, on different Atari games. The results demonstrate the framework's potential to create interpretable and performing RL systems, and pave the way for future research directions in obtaining end-to-end interpretable RL agents.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14516">Do LLMs &quot;know&quot; internally when they follow instructions?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyeon Heo, Christina Heinze-Deml, Oussama Elachqar, Shirley Ren, Udhay Nallasamy, Andy Miller, Kwan Ho Ryan Chan, Jaya Narain</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-following is crucial for building AI agents with large language models (LLMs), as these models must adhere strictly to user-provided constraints and guidelines. However, LLMs often fail to follow even simple and clear instructions. To improve instruction-following behavior and prevent undesirable outputs, a deeper understanding of how LLMs' internal states relate to these outcomes is required. Our analysis of LLM internal states reveal a dimension in the input embedding space linked to successful instruction-following. We demonstrate that modifying representations along this dimension improves instruction-following success rates compared to random changes, without compromising response quality. Further investigation reveals that this dimension is more closely related to the phrasing of prompts rather than the inherent difficulty of the task or instructions. This discovery also suggests explanations for why LLMs sometimes fail to follow clear instructions and why prompt engineering is often effective, even when the content remains largely unchanged. This work provides insight into the internal workings of LLMs' instruction-following, paving the way for reliable LLM agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Responsibility is one of the key notions in machine ethics and in the area of autonomous systems. It is a multi-faceted notion involving counterfactual reasoning about actions and strategies. In this paper, we study different variants of responsibility in a strategic setting based on LTLf.

This connection provides the building blocks for a computational grounding of responsibility including complexity characterizations and sound, complete, and optimal algorithms for attributing and anticipating responsibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Yang, Jiaoyan Chen, Uli Sattler</p>
<p>Abstract: OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies, which are able to represent both relational and type facts as standard knowledge graphs and complex domain knowledge in Description Logic (DL) axioms, are widely adopted in domains such as healthcare and bioinformatics. Inspired by the success of knowledge graph embeddings, embedding OWL ontologies has gained significant attention in recent years. Current methods primarily focus on learning embeddings for atomic concepts and roles, enabling the evaluation based on normalized axioms through specially designed score functions. However, they often neglect the embedding of complex concepts, making it difficult to infer with more intricate axioms. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in advanced reasoning tasks, such as Ontology Learning and ontology-mediated Query Answering. In this paper, we propose EL++-closed ontology embeddings which are able to represent any logical expressions in DL via composition. Furthermore, we develop TransBox, an effective EL++-closed ontology embedding method that can handle many-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that TransBox often achieves state-of-the-art performance across various real-world datasets for predicting complex axioms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyeon Heo, Miao Xiong, Christina Heinze-Deml, Jaya Narain</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) could be valuable personal AI agents across various domains, provided they can precisely follow user instructions. However, recent studies have shown significant limitations in LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, raising concerns about their reliability in high-stakes applications. Accurately estimating LLMs' uncertainty in adhering to instructions is critical to mitigating deployment risks. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic evaluation of the uncertainty estimation abilities of LLMs in the context of instruction-following. Our study identifies key challenges with existing instruction-following benchmarks, where multiple factors are entangled with uncertainty stems from instruction-following, complicating the isolation and comparison across methods and models. To address these issues, we introduce a controlled evaluation setup with two benchmark versions of data, enabling a comprehensive comparison of uncertainty estimation methods under various conditions. Our findings show that existing uncertainty methods struggle, particularly when models make subtle errors in instruction following. While internal model states provide some improvement, they remain inadequate in more complex scenarios. The insights from our controlled evaluation setups provide a crucial understanding of LLMs' limitations and potential for uncertainty estimation in instruction-following tasks, paving the way for more trustworthy AI agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Ai, Wen Deng, Hongyi Chen, Jiayi Du, Tao Meng, Yuntao Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) is essential for enhancing knowledge graphs and improving information retrieval and question-answering systems. Existing methods often focus on integrating modalities through their complementarity but overlook the specificity of each modality, which can obscure crucial features and reduce alignment accuracy. To solve this, we propose the Multi-modal Consistency and Specificity Fusion Framework (MCSFF), which innovatively integrates both complementary and specific aspects of modalities. We utilize Scale Computing's hyper-converged infrastructure to optimize IT management and resource allocation in large-scale data processing. Our framework first computes similarity matrices for each modality using modality embeddings to preserve their unique characteristics. Then, an iterative update method denoises and enhances modality features to fully express critical information. Finally, we integrate the updated information from all modalities to create enriched and precise entity representations. Experiments show our method outperforms current state-of-the-art MMEA baselines on the MMKG dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladimir Fanaskov, Ivan Oseledets</p>
<p>Abstract: In "Large Associative Memory Problem in Neurobiology and Machine Learning," Dmitry Krotov and John Hopfield introduced a general technique for the systematic construction of neural ordinary differential equations with non-increasing energy or Lyapunov function. We study this energy function and identify that it is vulnerable to the problem of dead neurons. Each point in the state space where the neuron dies is contained in a non-compact region with constant energy. In these flat regions, energy function alone does not completely determine all degrees of freedom and, as a consequence, can not be used to analyze stability or find steady states or basins of attraction. We perform a direct analysis of the dynamical system and show how to resolve problems caused by flat directions corresponding to dead neurons: (i) all information about the state vector at a fixed point can be extracted from the energy and Hessian matrix (of Lagrange function), (ii) it is enough to analyze stability in the range of Hessian matrix, (iii) if steady state touching flat region is stable the whole flat region is the basin of attraction. The analysis of the Hessian matrix can be complicated for realistic architectures, so we show that for a slightly altered dynamical system (with the same structure of steady states), one can derive a diverse family of Lyapunov functions that do not have flat regions corresponding to dead neurons. In addition, these energy functions allow one to use Lagrange functions with Hessian matrices that are not necessarily positive definite and even consider architectures with non-symmetric feedforward and feedback connections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Torrielli</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the challenges associated with bias, toxicity, unreliability, and lack of robustness in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. It emphasizes that these issues primarily stem from the quality and diversity of data on which LLMs are trained, rather than the model architectures themselves. As LLMs are increasingly integrated into various real-world applications, their potential to negatively impact society by amplifying existing biases and generating harmful content becomes a pressing concern. The paper calls for interdisciplinary efforts to address these challenges. Additionally, it highlights the need for collaboration between researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders to establish governance frameworks, oversight, and accountability mechanisms to mitigate the harmful consequences of biased LLMs. By proactively addressing these challenges, the AI community can harness the enormous potential of LLMs for the betterment of society without perpetuating harmful biases or exacerbating existing inequalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming-Mu Kuo, Xiangfang Li, Lijun Qian, Pamela Obiomon, Xishuang Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized adaptive learning (PAL) stands out by closely monitoring individual students' progress and tailoring their learning paths to their unique knowledge and needs. A crucial technique for effective PAL implementation is knowledge tracing, which models students' evolving knowledge to predict their future performance. Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced knowledge tracing through Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). However, there is limited research on DKT for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This study builds a comprehensive dataset to investigate DKT for implementing PAL in STEM education at HBCUs, utilizing multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) DKT models to examine knowledge tracing performance. The dataset includes 352,148 learning records for 17,181 undergraduate students across eight colleges at Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU). The SOTA DKT models employed include DKT, DKT+, DKVMN, SAKT, and KQN. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DKT models in accurately predicting students' academic outcomes. Specifically, the SAKT and KQN models outperform others in terms of accuracy and AUC. These findings have significant implications for faculty members and academic advisors, providing valuable insights for identifying students at risk of academic underperformance before the end of the semester. Furthermore, this allows for proactive interventions to support students' academic progress, potentially enhancing student retention and graduation rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mirna Al-Shetairy, Hanan Hindy, Dina Khattab, Mostafa M. Aref</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, interest in vision-language tasks has grown, especially those involving chart interactions. These tasks are inherently multimodal, requiring models to process chart images, accompanying text, underlying data tables, and often user queries. Traditionally, Chart Understanding (CU) relied on heuristics and rule-based systems. However, recent advancements that have integrated transformer architectures significantly improved performance. This paper reviews prominent research in CU, focusing on State-of-The-Art (SoTA) frameworks that employ transformers within End-to-End (E2E) solutions. Relevant benchmarking datasets and evaluation techniques are analyzed. Additionally, this article identifies key challenges and outlines promising future directions for advancing CU solutions. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search is conducted across Google Scholar, focusing on publications from Jan'20 to Jun'24. After rigorous screening and quality assessment, 32 studies are selected for in-depth analysis. The CU tasks are categorized into a three-layered paradigm based on the cognitive task required. Recent advancements in the frameworks addressing various CU tasks are also reviewed. Frameworks are categorized into single-task or multi-task based on the number of tasks solvable by the E2E solution. Within multi-task frameworks, pre-trained and prompt-engineering-based techniques are explored. This review overviews leading architectures, datasets, and pre-training tasks. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in OCR dependency, handling low-resolution images, and enhancing visual reasoning. Future directions include addressing these challenges, developing robust benchmarks, and optimizing model efficiency. Additionally, integrating explainable AI techniques and exploring the balance between real and synthetic data are crucial for advancing CU research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxiang Liu, Bowen Peng, Li Liu, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Transferable targeted adversarial attacks (TTAs) against deep neural networks have been proven significantly more challenging than untargeted ones, yet they remain relatively underexplored. This paper sheds new light on performing highly efficient yet transferable targeted attacks leveraging the simple gradient-based baseline. Our research underscores the critical importance of image transformations within gradient calculations, marking a shift from the prevalent emphasis on loss functions to address the gradient vanishing problem. Moreover, we have developed two effective blind estimators that facilitate the design of transformation strategies to enhance targeted transferability under black-box conditions. The adversarial examples' self-transferability to geometric transformations has been identified as strongly correlated with their black-box transferability, featuring these basic operations as potent yet overlapped proxies for facilitating targeted transferability. The surrogate self-alignment assessments further highlight simple scaling transformation's exceptional efficacy, which rivals that of most advanced methods. Building on these insights, we introduce a scaling-centered transformation strategy termed Strong, Self-transferable, faSt, and Simple Scale Transformation (S4ST) to enhance transferable targeted attacks. In experiments conducted on the ImageNet-Compatible benchmark dataset, our proposed S4ST attains a SOTA average targeted transfer success rate across various challenging black-box models, outperforming the previous leading method by over 14% while requiring only 25% of the execution time. Additionally, our approach eclipses SOTA attacks considerably and exhibits remarkable effectiveness against real-world APIs. This work marks a significant leap forward in TTAs, revealing the realistic threats they pose and providing a practical generation method for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Udari Madhushani Sehwag, Kelly Patel, Francesca Mosca, Vineeth Ravi, Jessica Staddon</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the importance of developing generative AI models that can effectively resist scams, current literature lacks a structured framework for evaluating their vulnerability to such threats. In this work, we address this gap by constructing a benchmark based on the FINRA taxonomy and systematically assessing Large Language Models' (LLMs') vulnerability to a variety of scam tactics. First, we incorporate 37 well-defined base scam scenarios reflecting the diverse scam categories identified by FINRA taxonomy, providing a focused evaluation of LLMs' scam detection capabilities. Second, we utilize representative proprietary (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) and open-source (Llama) models to analyze their performance in scam detection. Third, our research provides critical insights into which scam tactics are most effective against LLMs and how varying persona traits and persuasive techniques influence these vulnerabilities. We reveal distinct susceptibility patterns across different models and scenarios, underscoring the need for targeted enhancements in LLM design and deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rami Darwish, Mahmoud Abdelsalam, Sajad Khorsandroo</p>
<p>Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the fastest-growing computing industries. By the end of 2027, more than 29 billion devices are expected to be connected. These smart devices can communicate with each other with and without human intervention. This rapid growth has led to the emergence of new types of malware. However, traditional malware detection methods, such as signature-based and heuristic-based techniques, are becoming increasingly ineffective against these new types of malware. Therefore, it has become indispensable to find practical solutions for detecting IoT malware. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches have proven effective in dealing with these new IoT malware variants, exhibiting high detection rates. In this paper, we bridge the gap in research between the IoT malware analysis and the wide adoption of deep learning in tackling the problems in this domain. As such, we provide a comprehensive review on deep learning based malware analysis across various categories of the IoT domain (i.e. Extended Internet of Things (XIoT)), including Industrial IoT (IIoT), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT).</p>

<p>Abstract: The safety and robustness of large language models (LLMs) based applications remain critical challenges in artificial intelligence. Among the key threats to these applications are prompt hacking attacks, which can significantly undermine the security and reliability of LLM-based systems. In this work, we offer a comprehensive and systematic overview of three distinct types of prompt hacking: jailbreaking, leaking, and injection, addressing the nuances that differentiate them despite their overlapping characteristics. To enhance the evaluation of LLM-based applications, we propose a novel framework that categorizes LLM responses into five distinct classes, moving beyond the traditional binary classification. This approach provides more granular insights into the AI's behavior, improving diagnostic precision and enabling more targeted enhancements to the system's safety and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinfeng Li, Yangfan Xie, Tianyu Du, Zhiqiang Shen, Zhenghan Qin, Hao Peng, Xinkui Zhao, Xianwei Zhu, Jianwei Yin, Xuhong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Proprietary large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional generalization ability across various tasks. Additionally, deploying LLMs on edge devices is trending for efficiency and privacy reasons. However, edge deployment of proprietary LLMs introduces new security threats: attackers who obtain an edge-deployed LLM can easily use it as a base model for various tasks due to its high generalization ability, which we call foundational capability stealing. Unfortunately, existing model protection mechanisms are often task-specific and fail to protect general-purpose LLMs, as they mainly focus on protecting task-related parameters using trusted execution environments (TEEs). Although some recent TEE-based methods are able to protect the overall model parameters in a computation-efficient way, they still suffer from prohibitive communication costs between TEE and CPU/GPU, making it impractical to deploy for edge LLMs. To protect the foundational capabilities of edge LLMs, we propose CoreGuard, a computation- and communication-efficient model protection approach against model stealing on edge devices. The core component of CoreGuard is a lightweight and propagative authorization module residing in TEE. Extensive experiments show that CoreGuard achieves the same security protection as the black-box security guarantees with negligible overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Wang, Wanwan Wang, Yimin Huang, Zhaopeng Peng, Ziqi Yang, Cheng Wang, Xiaoliang Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been commonly utilized for social recommendation systems. However, real-world scenarios often present challenges related to user privacy and business constraints, inhibiting direct access to valuable social information from other platforms. While many existing methods have tackled matrix factorization-based social recommendations without direct social data access, developing GNN-based federated social recommendation models under similar conditions remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, we propose a novel vertical federated social recommendation method leveraging privacy-preserving two-party graph convolution networks (P4GCN) to enhance recommendation accuracy without requiring direct access to sensitive social information. First, we introduce a Sandwich-Encryption module to ensure comprehensive data privacy during the collaborative computing process. Second, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the privacy guarantees, considering the participation of both curious and honest parties. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that P4GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haodong Zhao, Jinming Hu, Peixuan Li, Fangqi Li, Jinrui Sha, Peixuan Chen, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as critical intellectual property (IP) assets that necessitate protection. Although various watermarking strategies have been proposed, they remain vulnerable to Linear Functionality Equivalence Attacks (LFEA), which can invalidate most existing white-box watermarks without prior knowledge of the watermarking scheme or training data. This paper further analyzes and extends the attack scenarios of LFEA to the commonly employed black-box settings for PLMs by considering Last-Layer outputs (dubbed LL-LFEA). We discover that the null space of the output matrix remains invariant against LL-LFEA attacks. Based on this finding, we propose NSmark, a task-agnostic, black-box watermarking scheme capable of resisting LL-LFEA attacks. NSmark consists of three phases: (i) watermark generation using the digital signature of the owner, enhanced by spread spectrum modulation for increased robustness; (ii) watermark embedding through an output mapping extractor that preserves PLM performance while maximizing watermark capacity; (iii) watermark verification, assessed by extraction rate and null space conformity. Extensive experiments on both pre-training and downstream tasks confirm the effectiveness, reliability, fidelity, and robustness of our approach.

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of fake news in the digital age has raised critical concerns, particularly regarding its impact on societal trust and democratic processes. Diverging from conventional agent-based simulation approaches, this work introduces an innovative approach by employing a large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent simulation to replicate complex interactions within information ecosystems. We investigate key factors that facilitate news propagation, such as agent personalities and network structures, while also evaluating strategies to combat misinformation. Through simulations across varying network structures, we demonstrate the potential of LLM-based agents in modeling the dynamics of misinformation spread, validating the influence of agent traits on the diffusion process. Our findings emphasize the advantages of LLM-based simulations over traditional techniques, as they uncover underlying causes of information spread -- such as agents promoting discussions -- beyond the predefined rules typically employed in existing agent-based models. Additionally, we evaluate three countermeasure strategies, discovering that brute-force blocking influential agents in the network or announcing news accuracy can effectively mitigate misinformation. However, their effectiveness is influenced by the network structure, highlighting the importance of considering network structure in the development of future misinformation countermeasures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Wei, Jing Sun, Zijian Zhang, Xianhao Zhang, Meng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of blockchain technologies has greatly accelerated the development and deployment of smart contracts. However, their inherent vulnerabilities and susceptibility to bugs have led to significant financial losses, underscoring the challenges in securing smart contracts. While traditional auditing methods are crucial, they often fall short in addressing the increasing complexity and volume of smart contracts. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for enhancing software auditing by automatically identifying security vulnerabilities. Despite their potential, the practical application of these models is hindered by substantial computational demands. This paper investigates the feasibility of using smaller, fine-tuned models to achieve comparable or even superior results in smart contract auditing. We introduce the FTSmartAudit framework, which is designed to develop cost-effective, specialized models for smart contract auditing through the fine-tuning of LLMs. Our contributions include: (1) a single-task learning framework that streamlines data preparation, training, evaluation, and continuous learning; (2) a robust dataset generation method utilizing domain-special knowledge distillation to produce high-quality datasets from advanced models like GPT-4o; (3) an adaptive learning strategy to maintain model accuracy and robustness; (4) the proven effectiveness of fine-tuned models in detecting specific vulnerabilities and complex logical errors; and (5) a framework that can be extended to other domains requiring LLM solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that smaller models can surpass state-of-the-art commercial models and tools in detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts.</p>

<p>Abstract: The performance of neural networks scales with both their size and the amount of data they have been trained on. This is shown in both language and image generation. However, this requires scaling-friendly network architectures as well as large-scale datasets. Even though scaling-friendly architectures like transformers have emerged for 3D vision tasks, the GPT-moment of 3D vision remains distant due to the lack of training data. In this paper, we introduce ARKit LabelMaker, the first large-scale, real-world 3D dataset with dense semantic annotations. Specifically, we complement ARKitScenes dataset with dense semantic annotations that are automatically generated at scale. To this end, we extend LabelMaker, a recent automatic annotation pipeline, to serve the needs of large-scale pre-training. This involves extending the pipeline with cutting-edge segmentation models as well as making it robust to the challenges of large-scale processing. Further, we push forward the state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet and ScanNet200 dataset with prevalent 3D semantic segmentation models, demonstrating the efficacy of our generated dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: In e-commerce, high consideration search missions typically require careful and elaborate decision making, and involve a substantial research investment from customers. We consider the task of identifying High Consideration (HC) queries. Identifying such queries enables e-commerce sites to better serve user needs using targeted experiences such as curated QA widgets that help users reach purchase decisions. We explore the task by proposing an Engagement-based Query Ranking (EQR) approach, focusing on query ranking to indicate potential engagement levels with query-related shopping knowledge content during product search. Unlike previous studies on predicting trends, EQR prioritizes query-level features related to customer behavior, finance, and catalog information rather than popularity signals. We introduce an accurate and scalable method for EQR and present experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness. Offline experiments show strong ranking performance. Human evaluation shows a precision of 96% for HC queries identified by our model. The model was commercially deployed, and shown to outperform human-selected queries in terms of downstream customer impact, as measured through engagement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Financial decision-making hinges on the analysis of relevant information embedded in the enormous volume of documents in the financial domain. To address this challenge, we developed FinQAPT, an end-to-end pipeline that streamlines the identification of relevant financial reports based on a query, extracts pertinent context, and leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform downstream tasks. To evaluate the pipeline, we experimented with various techniques to optimize the performance of each module using the FinQA dataset. We introduced a novel clustering-based negative sampling technique to enhance context extraction and a novel prompting method called Dynamic N-shot Prompting to boost the numerical question-answering capabilities of LLMs. At the module level, we achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on FinQA, attaining an accuracy of 80.6\%. However, at the pipeline level, we observed decreased performance due to challenges in extracting relevant context from financial reports. We conducted a detailed error analysis of each module and the end-to-end pipeline, pinpointing specific challenges that must be addressed to develop a robust solution for handling complex financial tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing tools to detect text generated by a large language model (LLM) have met with certain success, but their performance can drop when dealing with texts in new domains. To tackle this issue, we train a ranking classifier called RoBERTa-Ranker, a modified version of RoBERTa, as a baseline model using a dataset we constructed that includes a wider variety of texts written by humans and generated by various LLMs. We then present a method to fine-tune RoBERTa-Ranker that requires only a small amount of labeled data in a new domain. Experiments show that this fine-tuned domain-aware model outperforms the popular DetectGPT and GPTZero on both in-domain and cross-domain texts, where AI-generated texts may either be in a different domain or generated by a different LLM not used to generate the training datasets. This approach makes it feasible and economical to build a single system to detect AI-generated texts across various domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Kazemi, Iman Soltani</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate the problem of Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) navigation in a dense marine environment with a high-intensity current flow. The complexities arising from static and dynamic obstacles and the disturbance forces caused by current flow render existing navigation protocols inadequate for ensuring safety and avoiding collisions at sea. To learn a safe and efficient robot policy, we propose a novel methodology that leverages attention mechanisms to capture heterogeneous interactions of the agents with the static and moving obstacles and the flow disturbances from the environment in space and time. In particular, we refine a temporal function with MarineFormer, a Transformer navigation policy for spatially variable Marine environment, trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL). MarineFormer uses foundational spatio-temporal graph attention with transformer architecture to process spatial attention and temporal sequences in an environment that simulates a 2D turbulent marine condition. We propose architectural modifications that improve the stability and learning speed of the recurrent models. The flow velocity estimation, which can be derived from flow simulations or sensors, is incorporated into a model-free RL framework to prevent the robot from entering into high-intensity current flow regions including intense vortices, while potentially leveraging the flow to assist in transportation. The investigated 2D marine environment encompasses flow singularities, including vortices, sinks, and sources, representing fundamental planar flow patterns associated with flood or maritime thunderstorms. Our proposed method is trained with a new reward model to deal with static and dynamic obstacles and disturbances from the current flow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivam Vats, Devesh K. Jha, Maxim Likhachev, Oliver Kroemer, Diego Romeres</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-based planners and controllers are commonly used to solve complex manipulation problems as they can efficiently optimize diverse objectives and generalize to long horizon tasks. However, they are limited by the fidelity of their model which oftentimes leads to failures during deployment. To enable a robot to recover from such failures, we propose to use hierarchical reinforcement learning to learn a separate recovery policy. The recovery policy is triggered when a failure is detected based on sensory observations and seeks to take the robot to a state from which it can complete the task using the nominal model-based controllers. Our approach, called RecoveryChaining, uses a hybrid action space, where the model-based controllers are provided as additional \emph{nominal} options which allows the recovery policy to decide how to recover, when to switch to a nominal controller and which controller to switch to even with \emph{sparse rewards}. We evaluate our approach in three multi-step manipulation tasks with sparse rewards, where it learns significantly more robust recovery policies than those learned by baselines. Finally, we successfully transfer recovery policies learned in simulation to a physical robot to demonstrate the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer with our method.</p>

It has been theoretically proved that ICL is enabled by the capability of Transformers to perform gradient-descent algorithms (Von Oswald et al., 2023a; Bai et al., 2024). This work takes a step further and shows that Transformers can perform learning-to-optimize (L2O) algorithms. Specifically, for the ICL sparse recovery (formulated as LASSO) tasks, we show that a K-layer Transformer can perform an L2O algorithm with a provable convergence rate linear in K. This provides a new perspective explaining the superior ICL capability of Transformers, even with only a few layers, which cannot be achieved by the standard gradient-descent algorithms. Moreover, unlike the conventional L2O algorithms that require the measurement matrix involved in training to match that in testing, the trained Transformer is able to solve sparse recovery problems generated with different measurement matrices. Besides, Transformers as an L2O algorithm can leverage structural information embedded in the training tasks to accelerate its convergence during ICL, and generalize across different lengths of demonstration pairs, where conventional L2O algorithms typically struggle or fail. Such theoretical findings are supported by our experimental results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Chengyi Xing, Saad Khan, Miaoya Zhong, Mark R. Cutkosky</p>
<p>Abstract: Aquatic mammals, such as pinnipeds, utilize their whiskers to detect and discriminate objects and analyze water movements, inspiring the development of robotic whiskers for sensing contacts, surfaces, and water flows. We present the design and application of underwater whisker sensors based on Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) technology. These passive whiskers are mounted along the robot$'$s exterior to sense its surroundings through light, non-intrusive contacts. For contact tracking, we employ a sim-to-real learning framework, which involves extensive data collection in simulation followed by a sim-to-real calibration process to transfer the model trained in simulation to the real world. Experiments with whiskers immersed in water indicate that our approach can track contact points with an accuracy of $<2$ mm, without requiring precise robot proprioception. We demonstrate that the approach also generalizes to unseen objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Pan, Kai Junge, Josie Hughes</p>
<p>Abstract: To advance autonomous dexterous manipulation, we propose a hybrid control method that combines the relative advantages of a fine-tuned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and diffusion models. The VLA model provides language commanded high-level planning, which is highly generalizable, while the diffusion model handles low-level interactions which offers the precision and robustness required for specific objects and environments. By incorporating a switching signal into the training-data, we enable event based transitions between these two models for a pick-and-place task where the target object and placement location is commanded through language. This approach is deployed on our anthropomorphic ADAPT Hand 2, a 13DoF robotic hand, which incorporates compliance through series elastic actuation allowing for resilience for any interactions: showing the first use of a multi-fingered hand controlled with a VLA model. We demonstrate this model switching approach results in a over 80\% success rate compared to under 40\% when only using a VLA model, enabled by accurate near-object arm motion by the VLA model and a multi-modal grasping motion with error recovery abilities from the diffusion model.</p>

<p>Abstract: To validate the second-by-second dynamics of turbines in field experiments, it is necessary to accurately reconstruct the winds going into the turbine. Current time-resolved inflow reconstruction techniques estimate wind behavior in unobserved regions using relatively simple spectral-based models of the atmosphere. Here, we develop a technique for time-resolved inflow reconstruction that is rooted in a large-eddy simulation model of the atmosphere. Our "large-eddy reconstruction" technique blends observations and atmospheric model information through a diffusion model machine learning algorithm, allowing us to generate probabilistic ensembles of reconstructions for a single 10-min observational period. Our generated inflows can be used directly by aeroelastic codes or as inflow boundary conditions in a large-eddy simulation. We verify the second-by-second reconstruction capability of our technique in three synthetic field campaigns, finding positive Pearson correlation coefficient values (0.20>r>0.85) between ground-truth and reconstructed streamwise velocity, as well as smaller positive correlation coefficient values for unobserved fields (spanwise velocity, vertical velocity, and temperature). We validate our technique in three real-world case studies by driving large-eddy simulations with reconstructed inflows and comparing to independent inflow measurements. The reconstructions are visually similar to measurements, follow desired power spectra properties, and track second-by-second behavior (0.25 > r > 0.75).</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a goal-oriented conversational AI system enhanced with American Sign Language (ASL) instructions, presenting the first implementation of such a system on a worldwide multimodal conversational AI platform. Accessible through a touch-based interface, our system receives input from users and seamlessly generates ASL instructions by leveraging retrieval methods and cognitively based gloss translations. Central to our design is a sign translation module powered by Large Language Models, alongside a token-based video retrieval system for delivering instructional content from recipes and wikiHow guides. Our development process is deeply rooted in a commitment to community engagement, incorporating insights from the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community, as well as experts in cognitive and ASL learning sciences. The effectiveness of our signing instructions is validated by user feedback, achieving ratings on par with those of the system in its non-signing variant. Additionally, our system demonstrates exceptional performance in retrieval accuracy and text-generation quality, measured by metrics such as BERTScore.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Hegde, Gautam Salhotra, Gaurav S. Sukhatme</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost - namely, larger model size and slower inference. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (i.e., diffusing trajectories): fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. Thus, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints.
  To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to learn a distribution over policies for robotic tasks, rather than over trajectories. Our approach encodes demonstration trajectories into a latent space and then decodes them into policies using a hypernetwork. We employ a diffusion denoising model within this latent space to learn its distribution. We demonstrate that LWD can reconstruct the behaviors of the original policies that generated the trajectory dataset. LWD offers the benefits of considerably smaller policy networks during inference and requires fewer diffusion model queries. When tested on the Metaworld MT10 benchmark, LWD achieves a higher success rate compared to a vanilla multi-task policy, while using models up to ~18x smaller during inference. Additionally, since LWD generates closed-loop policies, we show that it outperforms Diffusion Policy in long action horizon settings, with reduced diffusion queries during rollout.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naghmeh Farzi, Laura Dietz</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems relies on human-annotated relevance labels, which can be both biased and costly at scale. In this context, large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by allowing us to directly prompt them to assign relevance labels for passages associated with each query. In this study, we explore alternative methods to directly prompt LLMs for assigned relevance labels, by exploring two hypotheses:
  Hypothesis 1 assumes that it is helpful to break down "relevance" into specific criteria - exactness, coverage, topicality, and contextual fit. We explore different approaches that prompt large language models (LLMs) to obtain criteria-level grades for all passages, and we consider various ways to aggregate criteria-level grades into a relevance label. Hypothesis 2 assumes that differences in linguistic style between queries and passages may negatively impact the automatic relevance label prediction. We explore whether improvements can be achieved by first synthesizing a summary of the passage in the linguistic style of a query, and then using this summary in place of the passage to assess its relevance.
  We include an empirical evaluation of our approaches based on data from the LLMJudge challenge run in Summer 2024, where our "Four Prompts" approach obtained the highest scores in Kendall's tau.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Rezazadeh, Zichao Li, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their context windows, yet challenges in effective long-term memory management remain. We introduce MemTree, an algorithm that leverages a dynamic, tree-structured memory representation to optimize the organization, retrieval, and integration of information, akin to human cognitive schemas. MemTree organizes memory hierarchically, with each node encapsulating aggregated textual content, corresponding semantic embeddings, and varying abstraction levels across the tree's depths. Our algorithm dynamically adapts this memory structure by computing and comparing semantic embeddings of new and existing information to enrich the model's context-awareness. This approach allows MemTree to handle complex reasoning and extended interactions more effectively than traditional memory augmentation methods, which often rely on flat lookup tables. Evaluations on benchmarks for multi-turn dialogue understanding and document question answering show that MemTree significantly enhances performance in scenarios that demand structured memory management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Translating text that contains entity names is a challenging task, as cultural-related references can vary significantly across languages. These variations may also be caused by transcreation, an adaptation process that entails more than transliteration and word-for-word translation. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-cultural translation on two fronts: (i) we introduce XC-Translate, the first large-scale, manually-created benchmark for machine translation that focuses on text that contains potentially culturally-nuanced entity names, and (ii) we propose KG-MT, a novel end-to-end method to integrate information from a multilingual knowledge graph into a neural machine translation model by leveraging a dense retrieval mechanism. Our experiments and analyses show that current machine translation systems and large language models still struggle to translate texts containing entity names, whereas KG-MT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin, obtaining a 129% and 62% relative improvement compared to NLLB-200 and GPT-4, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hariprasath Govindarajan, Per Sid\'en, Jacob Roll, Fredrik Lindsten</p>
<p>Abstract: A prominent self-supervised learning paradigm is to model the representations as clusters, or more generally as a mixture model. Learning to map the data samples to compact representations and fitting the mixture model simultaneously leads to the representation collapse problem. Regularizing the distribution of data points over the clusters is the prevalent strategy to avoid this issue. While this is sufficient to prevent full representation collapse, we show that a partial prototype collapse problem still exists in the DINO family of methods, that leads to significant redundancies in the prototypes. Such prototype redundancies serve as shortcuts for the method to achieve a marginal latent class distribution that matches the prescribed prior. We show that by encouraging the model to use diverse prototypes, the partial prototype collapse can be mitigated. Effective utilization of the prototypes enables the methods to learn more fine-grained clusters, encouraging more informative representations. We demonstrate that this is especially beneficial when pre-training on a long-tailed fine-grained dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuval Ran-Milo, Eden Lumbroso, Edo Cohen-Karlik, Raja Giryes, Amir Globerson, Nadav Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured state space models (SSMs), the core engine behind prominent neural networks such as S4 and Mamba, are linear dynamical systems adhering to a specified structure, most notably diagonal. In contrast to typical neural network modules, whose parameterizations are real, SSMs often use complex parameterizations. Theoretically explaining the benefits of complex parameterizations for SSMs is an open problem. The current paper takes a step towards its resolution, by establishing formal gaps between real and complex diagonal SSMs. Firstly, we prove that while a moderate dimension suffices in order for a complex SSM to express all mappings of a real SSM, a much higher dimension is needed for a real SSM to express mappings of a complex SSM. Secondly, we prove that even if the dimension of a real SSM is high enough to express a given mapping, typically, doing so requires the parameters of the real SSM to hold exponentially large values, which cannot be learned in practice. In contrast, a complex SSM can express any given mapping with moderate parameter values. Experiments corroborate our theory, and suggest a potential extension of the theory that accounts for selectivity, a new architectural feature yielding state of the art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Geographical, gender and stereotypical biases in computer vision models pose significant challenges to their performance and fairness. {In this study, we present an approach named FaceSaliencyAug aimed at addressing the gender bias in} {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Leveraging the salient regions} { of faces detected by saliency, the propose approach mitigates geographical and stereotypical biases } {in the datasets. FaceSaliencyAug} randomly selects masks from a predefined search space and applies them to the salient region of face images, subsequently restoring the original image with masked salient region. {The proposed} augmentation strategy enhances data diversity, thereby improving model performance and debiasing effects. We quantify dataset diversity using Image Similarity Score (ISS) across five datasets, including Flickr Faces HQ (FFHQ), WIKI, IMDB, Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW), UTK Faces, and Diverse Dataset. The proposed approach demonstrates superior diversity metrics, as evaluated by ISS-intra and ISS-inter algorithms. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating gender bias on CEO, Engineer, Nurse, and School Teacher datasets. We use the Image-Image Association Score (IIAS) to measure gender bias in these occupations. Our experiments reveal a reduction in gender bias for both CNNs and ViTs, indicating the efficacy of our method in promoting fairness and inclusivity in computer vision models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded their potential for real-world applications, enabling these models to perform complex reasoning on images. In the widely used fully autoregressive transformer-based models like LLaVA, projected visual tokens are prepended to textual tokens. Oftentimes, visual tokens are significantly more than prompt tokens, resulting in increased computational overhead during both training and inference. In this paper, we propose Visual Compact Token Registers (Victor), a method that reduces the number of visual tokens by summarizing them into a smaller set of register tokens. Victor adds a few learnable register tokens after the visual tokens and summarizes the visual information into these registers using the first few layers in the language tower of VLMs. After these few layers, all visual tokens are discarded, significantly improving computational efficiency for both training and inference. Notably, our method is easy to implement and requires a small number of new trainable parameters with minimal impact on model performance. In our experiment, with merely 8 visual registers--about 1% of the original tokens--Victor shows less than a 4% accuracy drop while reducing the total training time by 43% and boosting the inference throughput by 3.3X.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning is revolutionizing nutrition science by enabling systems to learn from data and make intelligent decisions. However, the complexity of these models often leads to challenges in understanding their decision-making processes, necessitating the development of explainability techniques to foster trust and increase model transparency. An under-explored type of explanation is cohort explanation, which provides explanations to groups of instances with similar characteristics. Unlike traditional methods that focus on individual explanations or global model behavior, cohort explainability bridges the gap by providing unique insights at an intermediate granularity. We propose a novel framework for identifying cohorts within a dataset based on local feature importance scores, aiming to generate concise descriptions of the clusters via tags. We evaluate our framework on a food-based inflammation prediction model and demonstrated that the framework can generate reliable explanations that match domain knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: The goal of machine learning is generalization. While the No Free Lunch Theorem states that we cannot obtain theoretical guarantees for generalization without further assumptions, in practice we observe that simple models which explain the training data generalize best: a principle called Occam's razor. Despite the need for simple models, most current approaches in machine learning only minimize the training error, and at best indirectly promote simplicity through regularization or architecture design. Here, we draw a connection between Occam's razor and in-context learning: an emergent ability of certain sequence models like Transformers to learn at inference time from past observations in a sequence. In particular, we show that the next-token prediction loss used to train in-context learners is directly equivalent to a data compression technique called prequential coding, and that minimizing this loss amounts to jointly minimizing both the training error and the complexity of the model that was implicitly learned from context. Our theory and the empirical experiments we use to support it not only provide a normative account of in-context learning, but also elucidate the shortcomings of current in-context learning methods, suggesting ways in which they can be improved.

<p>Abstract: In this study, we investigate the under-explored intervention planning aimed at disseminating accurate information within dynamic opinion networks by leveraging learning strategies. Intervention planning involves identifying key nodes (search) and exerting control (e.g., disseminating accurate/official information through the nodes) to mitigate the influence of misinformation. However, as network size increases, the problem becomes computationally intractable. To address this, we first introduce a novel ranking algorithm (search) to identify key nodes for disseminating accurate information, which facilitates the training of neural network (NN) classifiers for scalable and generalized solutions. Second, we address the complexity of label generation (through search) by developing a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based dynamic planning framework. We investigate NN-based RL planners tailored for dynamic opinion networks governed by two propagation models for the framework. Each model incorporates both binary and continuous opinion and trust representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that our ranking algorithm-based classifiers provide plans that enhance infection rate control, especially with increased action budgets. Moreover, reward strategies focusing on key metrics, such as the number of susceptible nodes and infection rates, outperform those prioritizing faster blocking strategies. Additionally, our findings reveal that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-based planners facilitate scalable centralized plans that achieve lower infection rates (higher control) across various network scenarios (e.g., Watts-Strogatz topology, varying action budgets, varying initial infected nodes, and varying degree of infected nodes).</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Text-to-Speech (VTTS) aims to take the spatial environmental image as the prompt to synthesize the reverberation speech for the spoken content. Previous research focused on the RGB modality for global environmental modeling, overlooking the potential of multi-source spatial knowledge like depth, speaker position, and environmental semantics. To address the issues, we propose a novel multi-source spatial knowledge understanding scheme for immersive VTTS, termed MS$^2$KU-VTTS. Specifically, we first prioritize RGB image as the dominant source and consider depth image, speaker position knowledge from object detection, and semantic captions from image understanding LLM as supplementary sources. Afterwards, we propose a serial interaction mechanism to deeply engage with both dominant and supplementary sources. The resulting multi-source knowledge is dynamically integrated based on their contributions.This enriched interaction and integration of multi-source spatial knowledge guides the speech generation model, enhancing the immersive spatial speech experience.Experimental results demonstrate that the MS$^2$KU-VTTS surpasses existing baselines in generating immersive speech.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Chaorong, Ling Xudong, Yang Qiang, Qin Fengqing, Huang Yuanyuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have made remarkable strides in precipitation prediction, yet they continue to struggle with capturing the spatial details of the features of radar images, particularly over high precipitation intensity areas. This shortcoming is evident in the form of low forecast accuracy in the spatial positioning of radar echo images across varying precipitation intensity regions. To address this challenge, we introduce the multi-task latent diffusion model(MTLDM), a novel approach for precipitation prediction. The basic concept of the MTLDM is based on the understanding that the radar image representing precipitation is the result of multiple factors. Therefore, we adopt a divide-and-conquer approach, that is, we decompose the radar image using decomposition technology and then predict the decomposed sub-images separately. We conceptualize the precipitation image as a composition of various components corresponding to different precipitation intensities. The MTLDM decomposes the precipitation image into these distinct components and employs a dedicated task to predict each one. This method enables spatiotemporally consistent prediction of real-world precipitation areas up to 5-80 min in advance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple evaluation metrics.</p>

However, acquiring and sharing the second-order oracle is compute and communication intensive. % and sharing this information incurs heavy communication overhead. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a fully first-order decentralized method for decentralized Bilevel optimization, $\text{C}^2$DFB which is both compute- and communicate-efficient. In $\text{C}^2$DFB, each learning node optimizes a min-min-max problem to approximate hypergradient by exclusively using gradients information. To reduce the traffic load at the inner-loop of solving the lower-level problem, $\text{C}^2$DFB incorporates a lightweight communication protocol for efficiently transmitting compressed residuals of local parameters. % during the inner loops. Rigorous theoretical analysis ensures its convergence % of the algorithm, indicating a first-order oracle calls of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$. Experiments on hyperparameter tuning and hyper-representation tasks validate the superiority of $\text{C}^2$DFB across various typologies and heterogeneous data distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel Ma, Lyndon Lam, Benjamin A. Spiegel, Aditya Ganeshan, Roma Patel, Ben Abbatematteo, David Paulius, Stefanie Tellex, George Konidaris</p>
<p>Abstract: It is imperative that robots can understand natural language commands issued by humans. Such commands typically contain verbs that signify what action should be performed on a given object and that are applicable to many objects. We propose a method for generalizing manipulation skills to novel objects using verbs. Our method learns a probabilistic classifier that determines whether a given object trajectory can be described by a specific verb. We show that this classifier accurately generalizes to novel object categories with an average accuracy of 76.69% across 13 object categories and 14 verbs. We then perform policy search over the object kinematics to find an object trajectory that maximizes classifier prediction for a given verb. Our method allows a robot to generate a trajectory for a novel object based on a verb, which can then be used as input to a motion planner. We show that our model can generate trajectories that are usable for executing five verb commands applied to novel instances of two different object categories on a real robot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Van Tuan Nguyen, Razvan Beuran</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel federated learning approach for improving IoT network intrusion detection. The rise of IoT has expanded the cyber attack surface, making traditional centralized machine learning methods insufficient due to concerns about data availability, computational resources, transfer costs, and especially privacy preservation. A semi-supervised federated learning model was developed to overcome these issues, combining the Shrink Autoencoder and Centroid one-class classifier (SAE-CEN). This approach enhances the performance of intrusion detection by effectively representing normal network data and accurately identifying anomalies in the decentralized strategy. Additionally, a mean square error-based aggregation algorithm (MSEAvg) was introduced to improve global model performance by prioritizing more accurate local models. The results obtained in our experimental setup, which uses various settings relying on the N-BaIoT dataset and Dirichlet distribution, demonstrate significant improvements in real-world heterogeneous IoT networks in detection accuracy from 93.98$\pm$2.90 to 97.30$\pm$0.49, reduced learning costs when requiring only 50\% of gateways participating in the training process, and robustness in large-scale networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kavinayan P. Sivakumar, Yi Shen, Zachary Bell, Scott Nivison, Boyuan Chen, Michael M. Zavlanos</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study an inverse reinforcement learning problem that involves learning the reward function of a learning agent using trajectory data collected while this agent is learning its optimal policy. To address this problem, we propose an inverse reinforcement learning method that allows us to estimate the policy parameters of the learning agent which can then be used to estimate its reward function. Our method relies on a new variant of the behavior cloning algorithm, which we call bundle behavior cloning, and uses a small number of trajectories generated by the learning agent's policy at different points in time to learn a set of policies that match the distribution of actions observed in the sampled trajectories. We then use the cloned policies to train a neural network model that estimates the reward function of the learning agent. We provide a theoretical analysis to show a complexity result on bound guarantees for our method that beats standard behavior cloning as well as numerical experiments for a reinforcement learning problem that validate the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingqi Zhou, Sheng Wang, Jingwei Dong, Lei Li, Jiahui Gao, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have witnessed significant progress on visual understanding tasks. However, they often prioritize language knowledge over image information on visual reasoning tasks, incurring performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we first identify the drawbacks of existing solutions (i.e., insufficient and irrelevant visual descriptions, and limited multi-modal capacities). We then decompose visual reasoning process into two stages: visual perception (i.e., eyesight) and textual reasoning (i.e., wisdom), and introduce a novel visual reasoning framework named ProReason. This framework features multi-run proactive perception and decoupled vision-reasoning capabilities. Briefly, given a multi-modal question, ProReason iterates proactive information collection and reasoning until the answer can be concluded with necessary and sufficient visual descriptions. Notably, the disassociation of capabilities allows seamless integration of existing large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the reasoning deficits of LVLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ProReason outperforms both existing multi-step reasoning frameworks and passive peer methods on a wide range of benchmarks for both open-source and closed-source models. In addition, with the assistance of LLMs, ProReason achieves a performance improvement of up to 15% on MMMU benchmark. Our insights into existing solutions and the decoupled perspective for feasible integration of LLMs illuminate future research on visual reasoning techniques, especially LLM-assisted ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Zhang, Jiayi Lin, Haibo Tong, Bingxuan Hou, Dongyu Zhang, Jialin Li, Junli Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable abilities with instruction tuning. However, they fail to achieve ideal tasks when lacking high-quality instruction tuning data on target tasks. Multi-Aspect Controllable Text Generation (MCTG) is a representative task for this dilemma, where aspect datasets are usually biased and correlated. Existing work exploits additional model structures and strategies for solutions, limiting adaptability to LLMs. To activate MCTG ability of LLMs, we propose a lightweight MCTG pipeline based on data augmentation. We analyze bias and correlations in traditional datasets, and address these concerns with augmented control attributes and sentences. Augmented datasets are feasible for instruction tuning. In our experiments, LLMs perform better in MCTG after data augmentation, with a 20% accuracy rise and less aspect correlations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhe Ding, Yang Ma, Pengda Qin, Jianlong Wu, Yuhong Li, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently received substantial interest, which shows their emerging potential as general-purpose models for various vision-language tasks. MLLMs involve significant external knowledge within their parameters; however, it is challenging to continually update these models with the latest knowledge, which involves huge computational costs and poor interpretability. Retrieval augmentation techniques have proven to be effective plugins for both LLMs and MLLMs. In this study, we propose multimodal adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (RA-BLIP), a novel retrieval-augmented framework for various MLLMs. Considering the redundant information within vision modality, we first leverage the question to instruct the extraction of visual information through interactions with one set of learnable queries, minimizing irrelevant interference during retrieval and generation. Besides, we introduce a pre-trained multimodal adaptive fusion module to achieve question text-to-multimodal retrieval and integration of multimodal knowledge by projecting visual and language modalities into a unified semantic space. Furthermore, we present an Adaptive Selection Knowledge Generation (ASKG) strategy to train the generator to autonomously discern the relevance of retrieved knowledge, which realizes excellent denoising performance. Extensive experiments on open multimodal question-answering datasets demonstrate that RA-BLIP achieves significant performance and surpasses the state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Xu, Xuezhe Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Interestingly, LLMs yet struggle with some basic tasks that humans find trivial to handle, e.g., counting the number of character r's in the word "strawberry". There are several popular conjectures (e.g., tokenization, architecture and training data) regarding the reason for deficiency of LLMs in simple word-based counting problems, sharing the similar belief that such failure stems from model pretraining hence probably inevitable during deployment. In this paper, we carefully design multiple evaluation settings to investigate validity of prevalent conjectures. Meanwhile, we measure transferability of advanced mathematical and coding reasoning capabilities from specialized LLMs to simple counting tasks. Although specialized LLMs suffer from counting problems as well, we find conjectures about inherent deficiency of LLMs invalid and further seek opportunities to elicit knowledge and capabilities from LLMs that are beneficial to counting tasks. Compared with strategies such as finetuning and in-context learning that are commonly adopted to enhance performance on new or challenging tasks, we show that engaging reasoning is the most robust and efficient way to help LLMs better perceive tasks with more accurate responses.
  We hope our conjecture validation design could provide insights into the study of future critical failure modes of LLMs. Based on challenges in transferring advanced capabilities to much simpler tasks, we call for more attention to model capability acquisition and evaluation. We also highlight the importance of cultivating consciousness of "reasoning before responding" during model pretraining.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) research on AI Safety and social bias in AI has focused on safety for humans and social bias against human minorities. However, some AI ethicists have argued that the moral significance of nonhuman animals has been ignored in AI research. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is speciesism, i.e., discrimination against nonhuman animals, in NLP research. First, we explain why nonhuman animals are relevant in NLP research. Next, we survey the findings of existing research on speciesism in NLP researchers, data, and models and further investigate this problem in this study. The findings of this study suggest that speciesism exists within researchers, data, and models, respectively. Specifically, our survey and experiments show that (a) among NLP researchers, even those who study social bias in AI, do not recognize speciesism or speciesist bias; (b) among NLP data, speciesist bias is inherent in the data annotated in the datasets used to evaluate NLP models; (c) OpenAI GPTs, recent NLP models, exhibit speciesist bias by default. Finally, we discuss how we can reduce speciesism in NLP research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Zhang, Dujian Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and hold immense potential for advancing Artificial Intelligence. However, the core architecture of most mainstream LLMs -- the Transformer -- has inherent limitations in computational depth, rendering them theoretically incapable of solving many reasoning tasks that demand increasingly deep computations. Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a technique to address these architectural limitations, as evidenced by several theoretical studies. It offers a promising approach to solving complex reasoning tasks that were previously beyond the capabilities of these models. Despite its successes, CoT and its variants (such as Tree of Thought, Graph of Thought, etc.) rely on a "one-prompt-for-all" approach, using a single prompt structure (e.g., "think step by step") for a wide range of tasks -- from counting and sorting to solving mathematical and algorithmic problems. This approach poses significant challenges for models to generate the correct reasoning steps, as the model must navigate through a vast prompt template space to find the appropriate template for each task. In this work, we build upon previous theoretical analyses of CoT to demonstrate how the one-prompt-for-all approach can negatively affect the computability of LLMs. We partition the solution search space into two: the prompt space and the answer space. Our findings show that task-specific supervision is essential for navigating the prompt space accurately and achieving optimal performance. Through experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal a gap in reasoning performance when supervision is applied versus when it is not.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing automated essay scoring (AES) has solely relied on essay text without using explanatory rationales for the scores, thereby forgoing an opportunity to capture the specific aspects evaluated by rubric indicators in a fine-grained manner. This paper introduces Rationale-based Multiple Trait Scoring (RMTS), a novel approach for multi-trait essay scoring that integrates prompt-engineering-based large language models (LLMs) with a fine-tuning-based essay scoring model using a smaller large language model (S-LLM). RMTS uses an LLM-based trait-wise rationale generation system where a separate LLM agent generates trait-specific rationales based on rubric guidelines, which the scoring model uses to accurately predict multi-trait scores. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including ASAP, ASAP++, and Feedback Prize, show that RMTS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and vanilla S-LLMs in trait-specific scoring. By assisting quantitative assessment with fine-grained qualitative rationales, RMTS enhances the trait-wise reliability, providing partial explanations about essays.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic data has been widely used to train large language models, but their generative nature inevitably introduces noisy, non-informative, and misleading learning signals. In this paper, we propose Montessori-Instruct, a novel data synthesis framework that tailors the data synthesis ability of the teacher language model toward the student language model's learning process. Specifically, we utilize local data influence of synthetic training data points on students to characterize students' learning preferences. Then, we train the teacher model with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate synthetic data tailored toward student learning preferences. Experiments with Llama3-8B-Instruct (teacher) and Llama3-8B (student) on Alpaca Eval and MT-Bench demonstrate that Montessori-Instruct significantly outperforms standard synthesis methods by 18.35\% and 46.24\% relatively. Our method also beats data synthesized by a stronger teacher model, GPT-4o. Further analysis confirms the benefits of teacher's learning to generate more influential training data in the student's improved learning, the advantages of local data influence in accurately measuring student preferences, and the robustness of Montessori-Instruct across different student models.

<p>Abstract: Joint Multimodal Entity-Relation Extraction (JMERE) is a challenging task that aims to extract entities and their relations from text-image pairs in social media posts. Existing methods for JMERE require large amounts of labeled data. However, gathering and annotating fine-grained multimodal data for JMERE poses significant challenges. Initially, we construct diverse and comprehensive multimodal few-shot datasets fitted to the original data distribution. To address the insufficient information in the few-shot setting, we introduce the \textbf{K}nowledge-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{C}ross-modal \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{M}odel (KECPM) for JMERE. This method can effectively address the problem of insufficient information in the few-shot setting by guiding a large language model to generate supplementary background knowledge. Our proposed method comprises two stages: (1) a knowledge ingestion stage that dynamically formulates prompts based on semantic similarity guide ChatGPT generating relevant knowledge and employs self-reflection to refine the knowledge; (2) a knowledge-enhanced language model stage that merges the auxiliary knowledge with the original input and utilizes a transformer-based model to align with JMERE's required output format. We extensively evaluate our approach on a few-shot dataset derived from the JMERE dataset, demonstrating its superiority over strong baselines in terms of both micro and macro F$_1$ scores. Additionally, we present qualitative analyses and case studies to elucidate the effectiveness of our model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Brenner, Christoph J\"urgen Hemmer, Zahra Monfared, Daniel Durstewitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamical systems (DS) theory is fundamental for many areas of science and engineering. It can provide deep insights into the behavior of systems evolving in time, as typically described by differential or recursive equations. A common approach to facilitate mathematical tractability and interpretability of DS models involves decomposing nonlinear DS into multiple linear DS separated by switching manifolds, i.e. piecewise linear (PWL) systems. PWL models are popular in engineering and a frequent choice in mathematics for analyzing the topological properties of DS. However, hand-crafting such models is tedious and only possible for very low-dimensional scenarios, while inferring them from data usually gives rise to unnecessarily complex representations with very many linear subregions. Here we introduce Almost-Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs) which automatically and robustly produce most parsimonious PWL representations of DS from time series data, using as few PWL nonlinearities as possible. AL-RNNs can be efficiently trained with any SOTA algorithm for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR), and naturally give rise to a symbolic encoding of the underlying DS that provably preserves important topological properties. We show that for the Lorenz and R\"ossler systems, AL-RNNs discover, in a purely data-driven way, the known topologically minimal PWL representations of the corresponding chaotic attractors. We further illustrate on two challenging empirical datasets that interpretable symbolic encodings of the dynamics can be achieved, tremendously facilitating mathematical and computational analysis of the underlying systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance and are widely deployed in various applications, while the serving of LLM inference has raised concerns about user experience and serving throughput. Accordingly, service level objectives (SLOs) and goodput-the number of requests that meet SLOs per second-are introduced to evaluate the performance of LLM serving. However, existing metrics fail to capture the nature of user experience. We observe two ridiculous phenomena in existing metrics: 1) delaying token delivery can smooth the tail time between tokens (tail TBT) of a request and 2) dropping the request that fails to meet the SLOs midway can improve goodput.
  In this paper, we revisit SLO and goodput metrics in LLM serving and propose a unified metric framework smooth goodput including SLOs and goodput to reflect the nature of user experience in LLM serving. The framework can adapt to specific goals of different tasks by setting parameters. We re-evaluate the performance of different LLM serving systems under multiple workloads based on this unified framework and provide possible directions for future optimization of existing strategies. We hope that this framework can provide a unified standard for evaluating LLM serving and foster researches in the field of LLM serving optimization to move in a cohesive direction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Protecting the intellectual property of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) is very important, because training LLMs costs extensive computational resources and data. Therefore, model owners and third parties need to identify whether a suspect model is a subsequent development of the victim model. To this end, we propose a training-free REEF to identify the relationship between the suspect and victim models from the perspective of LLMs' feature representations. Specifically, REEF computes and compares the centered kernel alignment similarity between the representations of a suspect model and a victim model on the same samples. This training-free REEF does not impair the model's general capabilities and is robust to sequential fine-tuning, pruning, model merging, and permutations. In this way, REEF provides a simple and effective way for third parties and models' owners to protect LLMs' intellectual property together.

<p>Abstract: The difficulties of underwater image degradation due to light scattering, absorption, and fog-like particles which lead to low resolution and poor visibility are discussed in this study report. We suggest a sophisticated hybrid strategy that combines Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR) defogging methods with Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) to address these problems. The Retinex algorithm mimics human visual perception to reduce uneven lighting and fogging, while the SRCNN component improves the spatial resolution of underwater photos.Through the combination of these methods, we are able to enhance the clarity, contrast, and colour restoration of underwater images, offering a reliable way to improve image quality in difficult underwater conditions. The research conducts extensive experiments on real-world underwater datasets to further illustrate the efficacy of the suggested approach. In terms of sharpness, visibility, and feature retention, quantitative evaluation which use metrics like the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) demonstrates notable advances over conventional techniques.In real-time underwater applications like marine exploration, underwater robotics, and autonomous underwater vehicles, where clear and high-resolution imaging is crucial for operational success, the combination of deep learning and conventional image processing techniques offers a computationally efficient framework with superior results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihan Yang, Caiqi Zhang, Zhisong Zhang, Xinting Huang, Sen Yang, Nigel Collier, Dong Yu, Deqing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they still struggle with generating factually incorrect content (i.e., hallucinations). A promising approach to mitigate this issue is enabling models to express uncertainty when unsure. Previous research on uncertainty modeling has primarily focused on short-form QA, but realworld applications often require much longer responses. In this work, we introduce the task of Long-form Generation with Uncertainty(LoGU). We identify two key challenges: Uncertainty Suppression, where models hesitate to express uncertainty, and Uncertainty Misalignment, where models convey uncertainty inaccurately. To tackle these challenges, we propose a refinement-based data collection framework and a two-stage training pipeline. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, refining uncertainty based on atomic claims. The collected data are then used in training through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance uncertainty expression. Extensive experiments on three long-form instruction following datasets show that our method significantly improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and maintains the comprehensiveness of responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wadhah Zai El Amri, Malte Kuhlmann, Nicol\'as Navarro-Guerrero</p>
<p>Abstract: Tactile perception is essential for human interaction with the environment and is becoming increasingly crucial in robotics. Tactile sensors like the BioTac mimic human fingertips and provide detailed interaction data. Despite its utility in applications like slip detection and object identification, this sensor is now deprecated, making many existing datasets obsolete. This article introduces a novel method for translating data between tactile sensors by exploiting sensor deformation information rather than output signals. We demonstrate the approach by translating BioTac signals into the DIGIT sensor. Our framework consists of three steps: first, converting signal data into corresponding 3D deformation meshes; second, translating these 3D deformation meshes from one sensor to another; and third, generating output images using the converted meshes. Our approach enables the continued use of valuable datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vojtech Kovarik, Nathaniel Sauerberg, Lewis Hammond, Vincent Conitzer</p>
<p>Abstract: AI agents will be predictable in certain ways that traditional agents are not. Where and how can we leverage this predictability in order to improve social welfare? We study this question in a game-theoretic setting where one agent can pay a fixed cost to simulate the other in order to learn its mixed strategy. As a negative result, we prove that, in contrast to prior work on pure-strategy simulation, enabling mixed-strategy simulation may no longer lead to improved outcomes for both players in all so-called "generalised trust games". In fact, mixed-strategy simulation does not help in any game where the simulatee's action can depend on that of the simulator. We also show that, in general, deciding whether simulation introduces Pareto-improving Nash equilibria in a given game is NP-hard. As positive results, we establish that mixed-strategy simulation can improve social welfare if the simulator has the option to scale their level of trust, if the players face challenges with both trust and coordination, or if maintaining some level of privacy is essential for enabling cooperation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharv Murgai, Hrishikesh Bhagwat, Raj Abhijit Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat</p>
<p>Abstract: Carbon emissions are rising at an alarming rate, posing a significant threat to global efforts to mitigate climate change. Electric vehicles have emerged as a promising solution, but their reliance on lithium-ion batteries introduces the critical challenge of battery degradation. Accurate prediction and forecasting of battery degradation over both short and long time spans are essential for optimizing performance, extending battery life, and ensuring effective long-term energy management. This directly influences the reliability, safety, and sustainability of EVs, supporting their widespread adoption and aligning with key UN SDGs. In this paper, we present a novel approach to the prediction and long-term forecasting of battery degradation using Scientific Machine Learning framework which integrates domain knowledge with neural networks, offering more interpretable and scientifically grounded solutions for both predicting short-term battery health and forecasting degradation over extended periods. This hybrid approach captures both known and unknown degradation dynamics, improving predictive accuracy while reducing data requirements. We incorporate ground-truth data to inform our models, ensuring that both the predictions and forecasts reflect practical conditions. The model achieved MSE of 9.90 with the UDE and 11.55 with the NeuralODE, in experimental data, a loss of 1.6986 with the UDE, and a MSE of 2.49 in the NeuralODE, demonstrating the enhanced precision of our approach. This integration of data-driven insights with SciML's strengths in interpretability and scalability allows for robust battery management. By enhancing battery longevity and minimizing waste, our approach contributes to the sustainability of energy systems and accelerates the global transition toward cleaner, more responsible energy solutions, aligning with the UN's SDG agenda.</p>

<p>Abstract: Regulatory frameworks for the use of AI are emerging. However, they trail behind the fast-evolving malicious AI technologies that can quickly cause lasting societal damage. In response, we introduce a pioneering Assistive AI framework designed to enhance human decision-making capabilities. This framework aims to establish a trust network across various fields, especially within legal contexts, serving as a proactive complement to ongoing regulatory efforts. Central to our framework are the principles of privacy, accountability, and credibility. In our methodology, the foundation of reliability of information and information sources is built upon the ability to uphold accountability, enhance security, and protect privacy. This approach supports, filters, and potentially guides communication, thereby empowering individuals and communities to make well-informed decisions based on cutting-edge advancements in AI. Our framework uses the concept of Boards as proxies to collectively ensure that AI-assisted decisions are reliable, accountable, and in alignment with societal values and legal standards. Through a detailed exploration of our framework, including its main components, operations, and sample use cases, the paper shows how AI can assist in the complex process of decision-making while maintaining human oversight. The proposed framework not only extends regulatory landscapes but also highlights the synergy between AI technology and human judgement, underscoring the potential of AI to serve as a vital instrument in discerning reality from fiction and thus enhancing the decision-making process. Furthermore, we provide domain-specific use cases to highlight the applicability of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enneng Yang, Li Shen, Zhenyi Wang, Guibing Guo, Xingwei Wang, Xiaocun Cao, Jie Zhang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging-based multitask learning (MTL) offers a promising approach for performing MTL by merging multiple expert models without requiring access to raw training data. However, in this paper, we examine the merged model's representation distribution and uncover a critical issue of "representation bias". This bias arises from a significant distribution gap between the representations of the merged and expert models, leading to the suboptimal performance of the merged MTL model. To address this challenge, we first propose a representation surgery solution called Surgery. Surgery is a lightweight, task-specific module that aligns the final layer representations of the merged model with those of the expert models, effectively alleviating bias and improving the merged model's performance. Despite these improvements, a performance gap remains compared to the traditional MTL method. Further analysis reveals that representation bias phenomena exist at each layer of the merged model, and aligning representations only in the last layer is insufficient for fully reducing systemic bias because biases introduced at each layer can accumulate and interact in complex ways. To tackle this, we then propose a more comprehensive solution, deep representation surgery (also called SurgeryV2), which mitigates representation bias across all layers, and thus bridges the performance gap between model merging-based MTL and traditional MTL. Finally, we design an unsupervised optimization objective to optimize both the Surgery and SurgeryV2 modules. Our experimental results show that incorporating these modules into state-of-the-art (SOTA) model merging schemes leads to significant performance gains. Notably, our SurgeryV2 scheme reaches almost the same level as individual expert models or the traditional MTL model. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/EnnengYang/SurgeryV2}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computational notebooks became indispensable tools for research-related development, offering unprecedented interactivity and flexibility in the development process. However, these benefits come at the cost of reproducibility and an increased potential for bugs. With the rise of code-fluent Large Language Models empowered with agentic techniques, smart bug-fixing tools with a high level of autonomy have emerged. However, those tools are tuned for classical script programming and still struggle with non-linear computational notebooks. In this paper, we present an AI agent designed specifically for error resolution in a computational notebook. We have developed an agentic system capable of exploring a notebook environment by interacting with it -- similar to how a user would -- and integrated the system into the JetBrains service for collaborative data science called Datalore. We evaluate our approach against the pre-existing single-action solution by comparing costs and conducting a user study. Users rate the error resolution capabilities of the agentic system higher but experience difficulties with UI. We share the results of the study and consider them valuable for further improving user-agent collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Godwin-Jones`</p>
<p>Abstract: There are obvious benefits to integrating generative AI (artificial intelligence) into language learning and teaching. Those include using AI as a language tutor, creating learning materials, or assessing learner output. However, due to how AI systems under-stand human language, based on a mathematical model using statistical probability, they lack the lived experience to be able to use language with the same social aware-ness as humans. Additionally, there are built-in linguistic and cultural biases based on their training data which is mostly in English and predominantly from Western sources. Those facts limit AI suitability for some language learning interactions. Stud-ies have clearly shown that systems such as ChatGPT often do not produce language that is pragmatically appropriate. The lack of linguistic and cultural authenticity has important implications for how AI is integrated into second language acquisition as well as in instruction targeting development of intercultural communication compe-tence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electricity forecasting has been a recurring research topic, as it is key to finding the right balance between production and consumption. While most papers are focused on the national or regional scale, few are interested in the household level. Desegregated forecast is a common topic in Machine Learning (ML) literature but lacks explainability that household energy forecasts require. This paper specifically targets the challenges of forecasting electricity use at the household level. This paper confronts common Machine Learning algorithms to electricity household forecasts, weighing the pros and cons, including accuracy and explainability with well-known key metrics. Furthermore, we also confront them in this paper with the business challenges specific to this sector such as explainability or outliers resistance. We introduce a custom decision tree, aiming at providing a fair estimate of the energy consumption, while being explainable and consistent with human intuition. We show that this novel method allows greater explainability without sacrificing much accuracy. The custom tree methodology can be used in various business use cases but is subject to limitations, such as a lack of resilience with outliers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Zhao, Xiaobao Wu, Cong-Duy Nguyen, Meihuizi Jia, Yichao Feng, Luu Anh Tuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and downstream tasks. However, PEFT has been proven vulnerable to malicious attacks. Research indicates that poisoned LLMs, even after PEFT, retain the capability to activate internalized backdoors when input samples contain predefined triggers. In this paper, we introduce a novel weak-to-strong unlearning algorithm to defend against backdoor attacks based on feature alignment knowledge distillation, named W2SDefense. Specifically, we first train a small-scale language model through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the clean teacher model. Then, this teacher model guides the large-scale poisoned student model in unlearning the backdoor, leveraging PEFT. Theoretical analysis suggests that W2SDefense has the potential to enhance the student model's ability to unlearn backdoor features, preventing the activation of the backdoor. We conduct experiments on text classification tasks involving three state-of-the-art language models and three different backdoor attack algorithms. Our empirical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of W2SDefense in defending against backdoor attacks without compromising model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modeling and producing lifelike clothed human images has attracted researchers' attention from different areas for decades, with the complexity from highly articulated and structured content. Rendering algorithms decompose and simulate the imaging process of a camera, while are limited by the accuracy of modeled variables and the efficiency of computation. Generative models can produce impressively vivid human images, however still lacking in controllability and editability. This paper studies photorealism enhancement of rendered images, leveraging generative power from diffusion models on the controlled basis of rendering. We introduce a novel framework to translate rendered images into their realistic counterparts, which consists of two stages: Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI) and Realistic Image Generation (RIG). In DKI, we adopt positive (real) domain finetuning and negative (rendered) domain embedding to inject knowledge into a pretrained Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model. In RIG, we generate the realistic image corresponding to the input rendered image, with a Texture-preserving Attention Control (TAC) to preserve fine-grained clothing textures, exploiting the decoupled features encoded in the UNet structure. Additionally, we introduce SynFashion dataset, featuring high-quality digital clothing images with diverse textures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method in rendered-to-real image translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiwen Li, Menghua Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Perturbation experiments allow biologists to discover causal relationships between variables of interest, but the sparsity and high dimensionality of these data pose significant challenges for causal structure learning algorithms. Biological knowledge graphs can bootstrap the inference of causal structures in these situations, but since they compile vastly diverse information, they can bias predictions towards well-studied systems. Alternatively, amortized causal structure learning algorithms encode inductive biases through data simulation and train supervised models to recapitulate these synthetic graphs. However, realistically simulating biology is arguably even harder than understanding a specific system. In this work, we take inspiration from both strategies and propose an amortized algorithm for refining domain knowledge, based on data observations. On real and synthetic datasets, we show that our approach outperforms baselines in recovering ground truth causal graphs and identifying errors in the prior knowledge with limited interventional data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangtao Kong, Kexin Huang, Ping Li, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual brain decoding aims to decode visual information from human brain activities. Despite the great progress, one critical limitation of current brain decoding research lies in the lack of generalization capability to unseen subjects. Prior works typically focus on decoding brain activity of individuals based on the observation that different subjects exhibit different brain activities, while it remains unclear whether brain decoding can be generalized to unseen subjects. This study aims to answer this question. We first consolidate an image-fMRI dataset consisting of stimulus-image and fMRI-response pairs, involving 177 subjects in the movie-viewing task of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). This dataset allows us to investigate the brain decoding performance with the increase of participants. We then present a learning paradigm that applies uniform processing across all subjects, instead of employing different network heads or tokenizers for individuals as in previous methods, which can accommodate a large number of subjects to explore the generalization capability across different subjects. A series of experiments are conducted and we have the following findings. First, the network exhibits clear generalization capabilities with the increase of training subjects. Second, the generalization capability is common to popular network architectures (MLP, CNN and Transformer). Third, the generalization performance is affected by the similarity between subjects. Our findings reveal the inherent similarities in brain activities across individuals. With the emerging of larger and more comprehensive datasets, it is possible to train a brain decoding foundation model in the future.Codes and models can be found at https://github.com/Xiangtaokong/TGBD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Does the process of training a neural network to solve a task tend to use all of the available weights even when the task could be solved with fewer weights? To address this question we study the effects of pruning fully connected, convolutional and residual models while varying their widths. We find that the proportion of weights that can be pruned without degrading performance is largely invariant to model size. Increasing the width of a model has little effect on the density of the pruned model relative to the increase in absolute size of the pruned network. In particular, we find substantial prunability across a large range of model sizes, where our biggest model is 50 times as wide as our smallest model. We explore three hypotheses that could explain these findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Gavrikov, Shashank Agnihotri, Margret Keuper, Janis Keuper</p>
<p>Abstract: Not all learnable parameters (e.g., weights) contribute equally to a neural network's decision function. In fact, entire layers' parameters can sometimes be reset to random values with little to no impact on the model's decisions. We revisit earlier studies that examined how architecture and task complexity influence this phenomenon and ask: is this phenomenon also affected by how we train the model? We conducted experimental evaluations on a diverse set of ImageNet-1k classification models to explore this, keeping the architecture and training data constant but varying the training pipeline. Our findings reveal that the training method strongly influences which layers become critical to the decision function for a given task. For example, improved training regimes and self-supervised training increase the importance of early layers while significantly under-utilizing deeper layers. In contrast, methods such as adversarial training display an opposite trend. Our preliminary results extend previous findings, offering a more nuanced understanding of the inner mechanics of neural networks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Wu, Xuming Fang, Dusit Niyato, Jiacheng Wang, Jingyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancements in wireless communication fields, including low-altitude economies, 6G, and Wi-Fi, the scale of wireless networks continues to expand, accompanied by increasing service quality demands. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization models can improve network performance by solving non-convex optimization problems intelligently. However, they heavily rely on online deployment and often require extensive initial training. Online DRL optimization models typically make accurate decisions based on current channel state distributions. When these distributions change, their generalization capability diminishes, which hinders the responsiveness essential for real-time and high-reliability wireless communication networks. Furthermore, different users have varying quality of service (QoS) requirements across diverse scenarios, and conventional online DRL methods struggle to accommodate this variability. Consequently, exploring flexible and customized AI strategies is critical. We propose a wireless network intent (WNI)-guided trajectory generation model based on a generative diffusion model (GDM). This model can be generated and fine-tuned in real time to achieve the objective and meet the constraints of target intent networks, significantly reducing state information exposure during wireless communication. Moreover, The WNI-guided optimization trajectory generation can be customized to address differentiated QoS requirements, enhancing the overall quality of communication in future intelligent networks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves greater stability in spectral efficiency variations and outperforms traditional DRL optimization models in dynamic communication systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kavinayan P. Sivakumar, Yan Zhang, Zachary Bell, Scott Nivison, Michael M. Zavlanos</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider a transfer reinforcement learning problem involving agents with different action spaces. Specifically, for any new unseen task, the goal is to use a successful demonstration of this task by an expert agent in its action space to enable a learner agent learn an optimal policy in its own different action space with fewer samples than those required if the learner was learning on its own. Existing transfer learning methods across different action spaces either require handcrafted mappings between those action spaces provided by human experts, which can induce bias in the learning procedure, or require the expert agent to share its policy parameters with the learner agent, which does not generalize well to unseen tasks. In this work, we propose a method that learns a subgoal mapping between the expert agent policy and the learner agent policy. Since the expert agent and the learner agent have different action spaces, their optimal policies can have different subgoal trajectories. We learn this subgoal mapping by training a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network for a distribution of tasks and then use this mapping to predict the learner subgoal sequence for unseen tasks, thereby improving the speed of learning by biasing the agent's policy towards the predicted learner subgoal sequence. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed learning scheme can effectively find the subgoal mapping underlying the given distribution of tasks. Moreover, letting the learner agent imitate the expert agent's policy with the learnt subgoal mapping can significantly improve the sample efficiency and training time of the learner agent in unseen new tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghan Lee, Kibok Lee, Taeyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in diffusion models for generative artificial intelligence have recently propagated to the time series (TS) domain, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, prior works on TS diffusion models often borrow the framework of existing works proposed in other domains without considering the characteristics of TS data, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose Adaptive Noise schedule for Time series diffusion models (ANT), which automatically predetermines proper noise schedules for given TS datasets based on their statistics representing non-stationarity. Our intuition is that an optimal noise schedule should satisfy the following desiderata: 1) It linearly reduces the non-stationarity of TS data so that all diffusion steps are equally meaningful, 2) the data is corrupted to the random noise at the final step, and 3) the number of steps is sufficiently large. The proposed method is practical for use in that it eliminates the necessity of finding the optimal noise schedule with a small additional cost to compute the statistics for given datasets, which can be done offline before training. We validate the effectiveness of our method across various tasks, including TS forecasting, refinement, and generation, on datasets from diverse domains.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive interpretability analysis of a Transformer-based Sign Language Translation (SLT) model, focusing on the translation from video-based Greek Sign Language to glosses and text. Leveraging the Greek Sign Language Dataset, we examine the attention mechanisms within the model to understand how it processes and aligns visual input with sequential glosses. Our analysis reveals that the model pays attention to clusters of frames rather than individual ones, with a diagonal alignment pattern emerging between poses and glosses, which becomes less distinct as the number of glosses increases. We also explore the relative contributions of cross-attention and self-attention at each decoding step, finding that the model initially relies on video frames but shifts its focus to previously predicted tokens as the translation progresses. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of SLT models, paving the way for the development of more transparent and reliable translation systems essential for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nefeli Andreou, Xi Wang, Victoria Fern\'andez Abrevaya, Marie-Paule Cani, Yiorgos Chrysanthou, Vicky Kalogeiton</p>
<p>Abstract: Our goal is to generate realistic human motion from natural language. Modern methods often face a trade-off between model expressiveness and text-to-motion alignment. Some align text and motion latent spaces but sacrifice expressiveness; others rely on diffusion models producing impressive motions, but lacking semantic meaning in their latent space. This may compromise realism, diversity, and applicability. Here, we address this by combining latent diffusion with a realignment mechanism, producing a novel, semantically structured space that encodes the semantics of language. Leveraging this capability, we introduce the task of textual motion inversion to capture novel motion concepts from a few examples. For motion synthesis, we evaluate LEAD on HumanML3D and KIT-ML and show comparable performance to the state-of-the-art in terms of realism, diversity, and text-motion consistency. Our qualitative analysis and user study reveal that our synthesized motions are sharper, more human-like and comply better with the text compared to modern methods. For motion textual inversion, our method demonstrates improved capacity in capturing out-of-distribution characteristics in comparison to traditional VAEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Cook, Charlie Grimshaw, Ben Wu, Sophie Dillon, Jack Hicks, Luke Jones, Thomas Smith, Matyas Szert, Xingyi Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targetting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Wolf, Tristan Payer, Catharina Silvia Lisson, Christoph Gerhard Lisson, Meinrad Beer, Michael G\"otz, Timo Ropinski</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training of deep learning models with contrastive learning is a widely used technique in image analysis. Current findings indicate a strong potential for contrastive pre-training on medical images. However, further research is necessary to incorporate the particular characteristics of these images. We hypothesize that the similarity of medical images hinders the success of contrastive learning in the medical imaging domain. To this end, we investigate different strategies based on deep embedding, information theory, and hashing in order to identify and reduce redundancy in medical pre-training datasets. The effect of these different reduction strategies on contrastive learning is evaluated on two pre-training datasets and several downstream classification tasks. In all of our experiments, dataset reduction leads to a considerable performance gain in downstream tasks, e.g., an AUC score improvement from 0.78 to 0.83 for the COVID CT Classification Grand Challenge, 0.97 to 0.98 for the OrganSMNIST Classification Challenge and 0.73 to 0.83 for a brain hemorrhage classification task. Furthermore, pre-training is up to nine times faster due to the dataset reduction. In conclusion, the proposed approach highlights the importance of dataset quality and provides a transferable approach to improve contrastive pre-training for classification downstream tasks on medical images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederic Kirstein, Terry Ruas, Robert Kratel, Bela Gipp</p>
<p>Abstract: Meeting summarization is crucial in digital communication, but existing solutions struggle with salience identification to generate personalized, workable summaries, and context understanding to fully comprehend the meetings' content. Previous attempts to address these issues by considering related supplementary resources (e.g., presentation slides) alongside transcripts are hindered by models' limited context sizes and handling the additional complexities of the multi-source tasks, such as identifying relevant information in additional files and seamlessly aligning it with the meeting content. This work explores multi-source meeting summarization considering supplementary materials through a three-stage large language model approach: identifying transcript passages needing additional context, inferring relevant details from supplementary materials and inserting them into the transcript, and generating a summary from this enriched transcript. Our multi-source approach enhances model understanding, increasing summary relevance by ~9% and producing more content-rich outputs. We introduce a personalization protocol that extracts participant characteristics and tailors summaries accordingly, improving informativeness by ~10%. This work further provides insights on performance-cost trade-offs across four leading model families, including edge-device capable options. Our approach can be extended to similar complex generative tasks benefitting from additional resources and personalization, such as dialogue systems and action planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravil Mussabayev, Rustam Mussabayev</p>
<p>Abstract: K-means clustering is a cornerstone of data mining, but its efficiency deteriorates when confronted with massive datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm that leverages the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic to optimize K-means clustering for big data. Our approach is based on the sequential optimization of the partial objective function landscapes obtained by restricting the Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering (MSSC) formulation to random samples from the original big dataset. Within each landscape, systematically expanding neighborhoods of the currently best (incumbent) solution are explored by reinitializing all degenerate and a varying number of additional centroids. Extensive and rigorous experimentation on a large number of real-world datasets reveals that by transforming the traditional local search into a global one, our algorithm significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of K-means clustering in big data environments, becoming the new state of the art in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Peng, Jinming Nian, Alexandre Evfimievski, Yi Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational AI agents use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide verifiable document-grounded responses to user inquiries. However, many natural questions do not have good answers: about 25\% contain false assumptions~\cite{Yu2023:CREPE}, and over 50\% are ambiguous~\cite{Min2020:AmbigQA}. RAG agents need high-quality data to improve their responses to confusing questions. This paper presents a novel synthetic data generation method to efficiently create a diverse set of context-grounded confusing questions from a given document corpus. We conduct an empirical comparative evaluation of several large language models as RAG agents to measure the accuracy of confusion detection and appropriate response generation. We contribute a benchmark dataset to the public domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanna Kim, Minkyoo Song, Seung Ho Na, Seungwon Shin, Kimin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have established them as agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with various tools. These LLM agents are often paired with web-based tools, enabling access to diverse sources and real-time information. Although these advancements offer significant benefits across various applications, they also increase the risk of malicious use, particularly in cyberattacks involving personal information. In this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in cyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1) how potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how cyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it becomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack scenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the generation of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of LLM agents in these attacks: LLM agents achieved a precision of up to 95.9% in collecting PII, up to 93.9% of impersonation posts created by LLM agents were evaluated as authentic, and the click rate for links in spear phishing emails created by LLM agents reached up to 46.67%. Additionally, our findings underscore the limitations of existing safeguards in contemporary commercial LLMs, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust security measures to prevent the misuse of LLM agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nazanin Nezami, Hadis Anahideh</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing costly black-box functions within a constrained evaluation budget presents significant challenges in many real-world applications. Surrogate Optimization (SO) is a common resolution, yet its proprietary nature introduced by the complexity of surrogate models and the sampling core (e.g., acquisition functions) often leads to a lack of explainability and transparency. While existing literature has primarily concentrated on enhancing convergence to global optima, the practical interpretation of newly proposed strategies remains underexplored, especially in batch evaluation settings. In this paper, we propose \emph{Inclusive} Explainability Metrics for Surrogate Optimization (IEMSO), a comprehensive set of model-agnostic metrics designed to enhance the transparency, trustworthiness, and explainability of the SO approaches. Through these metrics, we provide both intermediate and post-hoc explanations to practitioners before and after performing expensive evaluations to gain trust. We consider four primary categories of metrics, each targeting a specific aspect of the SO process: Sampling Core Metrics, Batch Properties Metrics, Optimization Process Metrics, and Feature Importance. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the significant potential of the proposed metrics across different benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel S. Y. Teo, Tan M. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become the key to unlocking unparalleled scalability in deep learning. SMoE has the potential to exponentially increase parameter count while maintaining the efficiency of the model by only activating a small subset of these parameters for a given sample. However, it has been observed that SMoE suffers from unstable training and has difficulty adapting to new distributions, leading to the model's lack of robustness to data contamination. To overcome these limitations, we first establish a connection between the dynamics of the expert representations in SMoEs and gradient descent on a multi-objective optimization problem. Leveraging our framework, we then integrate momentum into SMoE and propose a new family of SMoEs named MomentumSMoE. We theoretically prove and numerically demonstrate that MomentumSMoE is more stable and robust than SMoE. In particular, we verify the advantages of MomentumSMoE over SMoE on a variety of practical tasks including ImageNet-1K object recognition and WikiText-103 language modeling. We demonstrate the applicability of MomentumSMoE to many types of SMoE models, including those in the Sparse MoE model for vision (V-MoE) and the Generalist Language Model (GLaM). We also show that other advanced momentum-based optimization methods, such as Adam, can be easily incorporated into the MomentumSMoE framework for designing new SMoE models with even better performance, almost negligible additional computation cost, and simple implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thennal D K, Tim Fischer, Chris Biemann</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance as text embedding models when finetuned with supervised contrastive training. However, their large size balloons inference time and memory requirements. In this paper, we show that by pruning the last $p\%$ layers of an LLM before supervised training for only 1000 steps, we can achieve a proportional reduction in memory and inference time. We evaluate four different state-of-the-art LLMs on text embedding tasks and find that our method can prune up to 30\% of layers with negligible impact on performance and up to 80\% with only a modest drop. With only three lines of code, our method is easily implemented in any pipeline for transforming LLMs to text encoders. We also propose $\text{L}^3 \text{Prune}$, a novel layer-pruning strategy based on the model's initial loss that provides two optimal pruning configurations: a large variant with negligible performance loss and a small variant for resource-constrained settings. On average, the large variant prunes 21\% of the parameters with a $-0.3$ performance drop, and the small variant only suffers from a $-5.1$ decrease while pruning 74\% of the model. We consider these results strong evidence that LLMs are overparameterized for text embedding tasks, and can be easily pruned.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised validation of anomaly-detection models is a highly challenging task. While the common practices for model validation involve a labeled validation set, such validation sets cannot be constructed when the underlying datasets are unlabeled. The lack of robust and efficient unsupervised model-validation techniques presents an acute challenge in the implementation of automated anomaly-detection pipelines, especially when there exists no prior knowledge of the model's performance on similar datasets. This work presents a new paradigm to automated validation of anomaly-detection models, inspired by real-world, collaborative decision-making mechanisms. We focus on two commonly-used, unsupervised model-validation tasks -- model selection and model evaluation -- and provide extensive experimental results that demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our approach on both tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Alvarado Kristanto Julistiono, Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Navid Azizan</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized several domains of artificial intelligence, such as natural language processing and computer vision, by enabling models to selectively focus on relevant parts of the input data. While recent work has characterized the optimization dynamics of gradient descent (GD) in attention-based models and the structural properties of its preferred solutions, less is known about more general optimization algorithms such as mirror descent (MD). In this paper, we investigate the convergence properties and implicit biases of a family of MD algorithms tailored for softmax attention mechanisms, with the potential function chosen as the $p$-th power of the $\ell_p$-norm. Specifically, we show that these algorithms converge in direction to a generalized hard-margin SVM with an $\ell_p$-norm objective when applied to a classification problem using a softmax attention model. Notably, our theoretical results reveal that the convergence rate is comparable to that of traditional GD in simpler models, despite the highly nonlinear and nonconvex nature of the present problem. Additionally, we delve into the joint optimization dynamics of the key-query matrix and the decoder, establishing conditions under which this complex joint optimization converges to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions. Lastly, our numerical experiments on real data demonstrate that MD algorithms improve generalization over standard GD and excel in optimal token selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baran Atalar, Carlee Joe-Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the contextual combinatorial bandit setting where in each round, the learning agent, e.g., a recommender system, selects a subset of "arms," e.g., products, and observes rewards for both the individual base arms, which are a function of known features (called "context"), and the super arm (the subset of arms), which is a function of the base arm rewards. The agent's goal is to simultaneously learn the unknown reward functions and choose the highest-reward arms. For example, the "reward" may represent a user's probability of clicking on one of the recommended products. Conventional bandit models, however, employ restrictive reward function models in order to obtain performance guarantees. We make use of deep neural networks to estimate and learn the unknown reward functions and propose Neural UCB Clustering (NeUClust), which adopts a clustering approach to select the super arm in every round by exploiting underlying structure in the context space. Unlike prior neural bandit works, NeUClust uses a neural network to estimate the super arm reward and select the super arm, thus eliminating the need for a known optimization oracle. We non-trivially extend prior neural combinatorial bandit works to prove that NeUClust achieves $\widetilde{O}\left(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{T}\right)$ regret, where $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of a neural tangent kernel matrix, $T$ the number of rounds. Experiments on real world recommendation datasets show that NeUClust achieves better regret and reward than other contextual combinatorial and neural bandit algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study a fair division model where indivisible items arrive sequentially, and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably. Previous work on online fair division has shown impossibility results in achieving approximate envy-freeness under these constraints. In contrast, we consider an informed setting where the algorithm has complete knowledge of future items, and aim to ensure that the cumulative allocation at each round satisfies approximate envy-freeness -- which we define as temporal envy-freeness up to one item (TEF1). We focus on settings where items can be exclusively goods or exclusively chores. For goods, while TEF1 allocations may not always exist, we identify several special cases where they do -- two agents, two item types, generalized binary valuations, unimodal preferences -- and provide polynomial-time algorithms for these cases. We also prove that determining the existence of a TEF1 allocation is NP-hard. For chores, we establish analogous results for the special cases, but present a slightly weaker intractability result. We also establish the incompatibility between TEF1 and Pareto-optimality, with the implication that it is intractable to find a TEF1 allocation that maximizes any $p$-mean welfare, even for two agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elias Stengel-Eskin, Peter Hase, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to persuasion, which can pose risks when models are faced with an adversarial interlocutor. We take a first step towards defending models against persuasion while also arguing that defense against adversarial (i.e. negative) persuasion is only half of the equation: models should also be able to accept beneficial (i.e. positive) persuasion to improve their answers. We show that optimizing models for only one side results in poor performance on the other. In order to balance positive and negative persuasion, we introduce Persuasion-Balanced Training (or PBT), which leverages multi-agent recursive dialogue trees to create data and trains models via preference optimization to accept persuasion when appropriate. PBT consistently improves resistance to misinformation and resilience to being challenged while also resulting in the best overall performance on holistic data containing both positive and negative persuasion. Crucially, we show that PBT models are better teammates in multi-agent debates. We find that without PBT, pairs of stronger and weaker models have unstable performance, with the order in which the models present their answers determining whether the team obtains the stronger or weaker model's performance. PBT leads to better and more stable results and less order dependence, with the stronger model consistently pulling the weaker one up.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Ba, Michelle V. Mancenido, Rong Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: To enhance the generalization of machine learning models to unseen data, techniques such as dropout, weight decay ($L_2$ regularization), and noise augmentation are commonly employed. While regularization methods (i.e., dropout and weight decay) are geared toward adjusting model parameters to prevent overfitting, data augmentation increases the diversity of the input training set, a method purported to improve accuracy and calibration error. In this paper, we investigate the impact of each of these techniques on the parameter space of neural networks, with the goal of understanding how they alter the weight landscape in transfer learning scenarios. To accomplish this, we employ Random Matrix Theory to analyze the eigenvalue distributions of pre-trained models, fine-tuned using these techniques but using different levels of data diversity, for the same downstream tasks. We observe that diverse data influences the weight landscape in a similar fashion as dropout. Additionally, we compare commonly used data augmentation methods with synthetic data created by generative models. We conclude that synthetic data can bring more diversity into real input data, resulting in a better performance on out-of-distribution test instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Elsayed, Gautham Vasan, A. Rupam Mahmood</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural intelligence processes experience as a continuous stream, sensing, acting, and learning moment-by-moment in real time. Streaming learning, the modus operandi of classic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like Q-learning and TD, mimics natural learning by using the most recent sample without storing it. This approach is also ideal for resource-constrained, communication-limited, and privacy-sensitive applications. However, in deep RL, learners almost always use batch updates and replay buffers, making them computationally expensive and incompatible with streaming learning. Although the prevalence of batch deep RL is often attributed to its sample efficiency, a more critical reason for the absence of streaming deep RL is its frequent instability and failure to learn, which we refer to as stream barrier. This paper introduces the stream-x algorithms, the first class of deep RL algorithms to overcome stream barrier for both prediction and control and match sample efficiency of batch RL. Through experiments in Mujoco Gym, DM Control Suite, and Atari Games, we demonstrate stream barrier in existing algorithms and successful stable learning with our stream-x algorithms: stream Q, stream AC, and stream TD, achieving the best model-free performance in DM Control Dog environments. A set of common techniques underlies the stream-x algorithms, enabling their success with a single set of hyperparameters and allowing for easy extension to other algorithms, thereby reviving streaming RL.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting changes when only unnormalized pre- and post-change distributions are accessible. This situation happens in many scenarios in physics such as in ferromagnetism, crystallography, magneto-hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics, where the energy models are difficult to normalize.
  Our approach is based on the estimation of the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) statistics, which is known to produce optimal performance. We first present an intuitively appealing approximation method. Unfortunately, this produces a biased estimator of the CUSUM statistics and may cause performance degradation. We then propose the Log-Partition Approximation Cumulative Sum (LPA-CUSUM) algorithm based on thermodynamic integration (TI) in order to estimate the log-ratio of normalizing constants of pre- and post-change distributions. It is proved that this approach gives an unbiased estimate of the log-partition function and the CUSUM statistics, and leads to an asymptotically optimal performance. Moreover, we derive a relationship between the required sample size for thermodynamic integration and the desired detection delay performance, offering guidelines for practical parameter selection. Numerical studies are provided demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to enable autonomous navigation in unknown environments. Most research assume perfect sensor data, but real-world environments may contain natural and artificial sensor noise and denial. Here, we present a benchmark of both well-used and emerging DRL algorithms in a navigation task with configurable sensor denial effects. In particular, we are interested in comparing how different DRL methods (e.g. model-free PPO vs. model-based DreamerV3) are affected by sensor denial. We show that DreamerV3 outperforms other methods in the visual end-to-end navigation task with a dynamic goal - and other methods are not able to learn this. Furthermore, DreamerV3 generally outperforms other methods in sensor-denied environments. In order to improve robustness, we use adversarial training and demonstrate an improved performance in denied environments, although this generally comes with a performance cost on the vanilla environments. We anticipate this benchmark of different DRL methods and the usage of adversarial training to be a starting point for the development of more elaborate navigation strategies that are capable of dealing with uncertain and denied sensor readings.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Controller-Embedded Language Model Interactions (CELI), a framework that integrates control logic directly within language model (LM) prompts, facilitating complex, multi-stage task execution. CELI addresses limitations of existing prompt engineering and workflow optimization techniques by embedding control logic directly within the operational context of language models, enabling dynamic adaptation to evolving task requirements. Our framework transfers control from the traditional programming execution environment to the LMs, allowing them to autonomously manage computational workflows while maintaining seamless interaction with external systems and functions. CELI supports arbitrary function calls with variable arguments, bridging the gap between LMs' adaptive reasoning capabilities and conventional software paradigms' structured control mechanisms. To evaluate CELI's versatility and effectiveness, we conducted case studies in two distinct domains: code generation (HumanEval benchmark) and multi-stage content generation (Wikipedia-style articles). The results demonstrate notable performance improvements across a range of domains. CELI achieved a 4.9 percentage point improvement over the best reported score of the baseline GPT-4 model on the HumanEval code generation benchmark. In multi-stage content generation, 94.4% of CELI-produced Wikipedia-style articles met or exceeded first draft quality when optimally configured, with 44.4% achieving high quality. These outcomes underscore CELI's potential for optimizing AI-driven workflows across diverse computational domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Butera, Giovanni De Felice, Andrea Cini, Cesare Alippi</p>
<p>Abstract: In processing multiple time series, accounting for the individual features of each sequence can be challenging. To address this, modern deep learning methods for time series analysis combine a shared (global) model with local layers, specific to each time series, often implemented as learnable embeddings. Ideally, these local embeddings should encode meaningful representations of the unique dynamics of each sequence. However, when these are learned end-to-end as parameters of a forecasting model, they may end up acting as mere sequence identifiers. Shared processing blocks may then become reliant on such identifiers, limiting their transferability to new contexts. In this paper, we address this issue by investigating methods to regularize the learning of local learnable embeddings for time series processing. Specifically, we perform the first extensive empirical study on the subject and show how such regularizations consistently improve performance in widely adopted architectures. Furthermore, we show that methods preventing the co-adaptation of local and global parameters are particularly effective in this context. This hypothesis is validated by comparing several methods preventing the downstream models from relying on sequence identifiers, going as far as completely resetting the embeddings during training. The obtained results provide an important contribution to understanding the interplay between learnable local parameters and shared processing layers: a key challenge in modern time series processing models and a step toward developing effective foundation models for time series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raghuveer Thirukovalluru, Bhuwan Dhingra</p>
<p>Abstract: Training-free embedding methods directly leverage pretrained large language models (LLMs) to embed text, bypassing the costly and complex procedure of contrastive learning. Previous training-free embedding methods have mainly focused on optimizing embedding prompts and have overlooked the benefits of utilizing the generative abilities of LLMs. We propose a novel method, GenEOL, which uses LLMs to generate diverse transformations of a sentence that preserve its meaning, and aggregates the resulting embeddings of these transformations to enhance the overall sentence embedding. GenEOL significantly outperforms the existing training-free embedding methods by an average of 2.85 points across several LLMs on the sentence semantic text similarity (STS) benchmark. Our analysis shows that GenEOL stabilizes representation quality across LLM layers and is robust to perturbations of embedding prompts. GenEOL also achieves notable gains on multiple clustering, reranking and pair-classification tasks from the MTEB benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Positional bias in large language models (LLMs) hinders their ability to effectively process long inputs. A prominent example is the "lost in the middle" phenomenon, where LLMs struggle to utilize relevant information situated in the middle of the input. While prior research primarily focuses on single pieces of relevant information, real-world applications often involve multiple relevant information pieces. To bridge this gap, we present LongPiBench, a benchmark designed to assess positional bias involving multiple pieces of relevant information. Thorough experiments are conducted with five commercial and six open-source models. These experiments reveal that while most current models are robust against the "lost in the middle" issue, there exist significant biases related to the spacing of relevant information pieces. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating and reducing positional biases to advance LLM's capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanxing Chen, Yukun Huang, Bhuwan Dhingra</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that existing evaluations for fake news detection based on conventional sources, such as claims on fact-checking websites, result in an increasing accuracy over time for LLM-based detectors -- even after their knowledge cutoffs. This suggests that recent popular political claims, which form the majority of fake news on such sources, are easily classified using surface-level shallow patterns. Instead, we argue that a proper fake news detection dataset should test a model's ability to reason factually about the current world by retrieving and reading related evidence. To this end, we develop a novel pipeline that leverages natural language feedback from a RAG-based detector to iteratively modify real-time news into deceptive fake news that challenges LLMs. Our iterative rewrite decreases the binary classification AUC by an absolute 17.5 percent for a strong RAG GPT-4o detector. Our experiments reveal the important role of RAG in both detecting and generating fake news, as retrieval-free LLM detectors are vulnerable to unseen events and adversarial attacks, while feedback from RAG detection helps discover more deceitful patterns in fake news.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maitreya Prafulla Chitale, Uday Bindal, Rajakrishnan Rajkumar, Rahul Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Summarizing movie screenplays presents a unique set of challenges compared to standard document summarization. Screenplays are not only lengthy, but also feature a complex interplay of characters, dialogues, and scenes, with numerous direct and subtle relationships and contextual nuances that are difficult for machine learning models to accurately capture and comprehend. Recent attempts at screenplay summarization focus on fine-tuning transformer-based pre-trained models, but these models often fall short in capturing long-term dependencies and latent relationships, and frequently encounter the "lost in the middle" issue. To address these challenges, we introduce DiscoGraMS, a novel resource that represents movie scripts as a movie character-aware discourse graph (CaD Graph). This approach is well-suited for various downstream tasks, such as summarization, question-answering, and salience detection. The model aims to preserve all salient information, offering a more comprehensive and faithful representation of the screenplay's content. We further explore a baseline method that combines the CaD Graph with the corresponding movie script through a late fusion of graph and text modalities, and we present very initial promising results.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce BiGR, a novel conditional image generation model using compact binary latent codes for generative training, focusing on enhancing both generation and representation capabilities. BiGR is the first conditional generative model that unifies generation and discrimination within the same framework. BiGR features a binary tokenizer, a masked modeling mechanism, and a binary transcoder for binary code prediction. Additionally, we introduce a novel entropy-ordered sampling method to enable efficient image generation. Extensive experiments validate BiGR's superior performance in generation quality, as measured by FID-50k, and representation capabilities, as evidenced by linear-probe accuracy. Moreover, BiGR showcases zero-shot generalization across various vision tasks, enabling applications such as image inpainting, outpainting, editing, interpolation, and enrichment, without the need for structural modifications. Our findings suggest that BiGR unifies generative and discriminative tasks effectively, paving the way for further advancements in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukun Huang, Sanxing Chen, Hongyi Cai, Bhuwan Dhingra</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often augmented with external information as contexts, but this external information can sometimes be inaccurate or even intentionally misleading. We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate situated faithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external information based on their confidence in the internal knowledge and the external context. To benchmark this capability, we evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets, including a newly created dataset called RedditQA featuring in-the-wild incorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show that when provided with both correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source and proprietary models tend to overly rely on external information, regardless of its factual accuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two approaches: Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning (RCR). SCR enables models to self-access the confidence of external information relative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most accurate answer. RCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from the LLM and determines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results show that for LLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, SCR outperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2% over a direct input augmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like Llama-3-8B, RCR outperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence Reasoning Direct Preference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance on both seen and unseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9% on Llama-3-8B. In addition to quantitative results, we offer insights into the relative strengths of SCR and RCR. Our findings highlight promising avenues for improving situated faithfulness in LLMs. The data and code are released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qin Liu, Fei Wang, Chaowei Xiao, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing preference alignment is a one-size-fits-all alignment mechanism, where the part of the large language model (LLM) parametric knowledge with non-preferred features is uniformly blocked to all the users. However, this part of knowledge can be useful to advanced users whose expertise qualifies them to handle these information. The one-size-fits-all alignment mechanism undermines LLM's utility for these qualified users. To address this problem, we propose SudoLM, a framework that lets LLMs learn access control over specific parametric knowledge for users with different credentials via authorization alignment. SudoLM allows authorized users to unlock their access to all the parametric knowledge with an assigned SUDO key while blocking access to non-qualified users. Experiments on two application scenarios demonstrate that SudoLM effectively controls the user's access to the parametric knowledge and maintains its general utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumit Dalal, Deepa Tilwani, Kaushik Roy, Manas Gaur, Sarika Jain, Valerie Shalin, Amit Sheth</p>
<p>Abstract: The lack of explainability using relevant clinical knowledge hinders the adoption of Artificial Intelligence-powered analysis of unstructured clinical dialogue. A wealth of relevant, untapped Mental Health (MH) data is available in online communities, providing the opportunity to address the explainability problem with substantial potential impact as a screening tool for both online and offline applications. We develop a method to enhance attention in popular transformer models and generate clinician-understandable explanations for classification by incorporating external clinical knowledge. Inspired by how clinicians rely on their expertise when interacting with patients, we leverage relevant clinical knowledge to model patient inputs, providing meaningful explanations for classification. This will save manual review time and engender trust. We develop such a system in the context of MH using clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for diagnosing depression, a mental health disorder of global concern. We propose an application-specific language model called ProcesS knowledge-infused cross ATtention (PSAT), which incorporates CPGs when computing attention. Through rigorous evaluation on three expert-curated datasets related to depression, we demonstrate application-relevant explainability of PSAT. PSAT also surpasses the performance of nine baseline models and can provide explanations where other baselines fall short. We transform a CPG resource focused on depression, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (e.g. PHQ-9) and related questions, into a machine-readable ontology using SNOMED-CT. With this resource, PSAT enhances the ability of models like GPT-3.5 to generate application-relevant explanations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Capability ontologies are increasingly used to model functionalities of systems or machines. The creation of such ontological models with all properties and constraints of capabilities is very complex and can only be done by ontology experts. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that they can generate machine-interpretable models from natural language text input and thus support engineers / ontology experts. Therefore, this paper investigates how LLMs can be used to create capability ontologies. We present a study with a series of experiments in which capabilities with varying complexities are generated using different prompting techniques and with different LLMs. Errors in the generated ontologies are recorded and compared. To analyze the quality of the generated ontologies, a semi-automated approach based on RDF syntax checking, OWL reasoning, and SHACL constraints is used. The results of this study are very promising because even for complex capabilities, the generated ontologies are almost free of errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Zhang, Ziming Wang, Runtian Xing, Kui Xiao, Zhifei Li, Yan Zhang, Chang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis is a fundamental and critical task in learning assessment, which aims to infer students' proficiency on knowledge concepts from their response logs. Current works assume each knowledge concept will certainly be tested and covered by multiple exercises. However, whether online or offline courses, it's hardly feasible to completely cover all knowledge concepts in several exercises. Restricted tests lead to undiscovered knowledge deficits, especially untested knowledge concepts(UKCs). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Cognitive Diagnosis called Disentangling Heterogeneous Knowledge Cognitive Diagnosis(DisKCD) on untested knowledge. Specifically, we leverage course grades, exercise questions, and learning resources to learn the potential representations of students, exercises, and knowledge concepts. In particular, knowledge concepts are disentangled into tested and untested based on the limiting actual exercises. We construct a heterogeneous relation graph network via students, exercises, tested knowledge concepts(TKCs), and UKCs. Then, through a hierarchical heterogeneous message-passing mechanism, the fine-grained relations are incorporated into the embeddings of the entities. Finally, the embeddings will be applied to multiple existing cognitive diagnosis models to infer students' proficiency on UKCs. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed model can effectively improve the performance of the task of diagnosing students' proficiency on UKCs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingda Li, Xinyu Li, Yifan Chen, Wenfeng Xuan, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RALMs) demonstrate their superiority in terms of factuality, they do not consistently outperform the original retrieval-free Language Models (LMs). Our experiments reveal that this example-level performance inconsistency exists not only between retrieval-augmented and retrieval-free LM but also among different retrievers. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate the degeneration behavior of RALMs and theoretically decompose it into four categories. Further analysis based on our decomposition reveals that the innate difference in knowledge sources and the unpredictable degeneration of the reader model contribute most to the inconsistency. Drawing from our analysis, we introduce Ensemble of Retrievers (EoR), a trainable framework that can adaptively retrieve from different knowledge sources and effectively decrease unpredictable reader errors. Our experiments on Open Domain Question Answering show that EoR substantially improves performance over the RALM with a single retriever by considerably reducing inconsistent behaviors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Software robots have long been used in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to automate mundane and repetitive computer tasks. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their advanced reasoning capabilities, these agents are now able to handle more complex or previously unseen tasks. However, LLM-based automation techniques in recent literature frequently rely on HTML source code for input or application-specific API calls for actions, limiting their applicability to specific environments. We propose an LLM-based agent that mimics human behavior in solving computer tasks. It perceives its environment solely through screenshot images, which are then converted into text for an LLM to process. By leveraging the reasoning capability of the LLM, we eliminate the need for large-scale human demonstration data typically required for model training. The agent only executes keyboard and mouse operations on Graphical User Interface (GUI), removing the need for pre-provided APIs to function. To further enhance the agent's performance in this setting, we propose a novel prompting strategy called Context-Aware Action Planning (CAAP) prompting, which enables the agent to thoroughly examine the task context from multiple perspectives. Our agent achieves an average success rate of 94.5% on MiniWoB++ and an average task score of 62.3 on WebShop, outperforming all previous studies of agents that rely solely on screen images. This method demonstrates potential for broader applications, particularly for tasks requiring coordination across multiple applications on desktops or smartphones, marking a significant advancement in the field of automation agents.

<p>Abstract: To achieve a flexible and adaptable system, capability ontologies are increasingly leveraged to describe functions in a machine-interpretable way. However, modeling such complex ontological descriptions is still a manual and error-prone task that requires a significant amount of effort and ontology expertise. This contribution presents an innovative method to automate capability ontology modeling using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have proven to be well suited for such tasks. Our approach requires only a natural language description of a capability, which is then automatically inserted into a predefined prompt using a few-shot prompting technique. After prompting an LLM, the resulting capability ontology is automatically verified through various steps in a loop with the LLM to check the overall correctness of the capability ontology. First, a syntax check is performed, then a check for contradictions, and finally a check for hallucinations and missing ontology elements. Our method greatly reduces manual effort, as only the initial natural language description and a final human review and possible correction are necessary, thereby streamlining the capability ontology generation process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video language continual learning involves continuously adapting to information from video and text inputs, enhancing a model's ability to handle new tasks while retaining prior knowledge. This field is a relatively under-explored area, and establishing appropriate datasets is crucial for facilitating communication and research in this field. In this study, we present the first dedicated benchmark, ViLCo-Bench, designed to evaluate continual learning models across a range of video-text tasks. The dataset comprises ten-minute-long videos and corresponding language queries collected from publicly available datasets. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-efficient framework that incorporates self-supervised learning and mimics long-term and short-term memory effects. This framework addresses challenges including memory complexity from long video clips, natural language complexity from open queries, and text-video misalignment. We posit that ViLCo-Bench, with greater complexity compared to existing continual learning benchmarks, would serve as a critical tool for exploring the video-language domain, extending beyond conventional class-incremental tasks, and addressing complex and limited annotation issues.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently use autoregressive decoding, which lacks parallelism in inference and results in significantly slow inference speed. While methods such as Medusa constructs parallelized heads, they lack adequate information interaction across different prediction positions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Amphista, an enhanced speculative decoding framework that builds upon Medusa. Specifically, Amphista models an Auto-embedding Block capable of parallel inference, incorporating bi-directional attention to enable interaction between different drafting heads. Additionally, Amphista integrates Staged Adaptation Layers, which ensure a seamless transition of semantic information from the target model's autoregressive inference to the drafting heads' non-autoregressive inference, effectively achieving paradigm shift and feature fusion. Experimental results on Vicuna models using MT-Bench and Spec-Bench demonstrate that Amphista achieves substantial acceleration while maintaining generation quality. On MT-Bench, Amphista delivers up to 2.75$\times$ speedup over vanilla autoregressive decoding and 1.40$\times$ over Medusa on Vicuna 33B in wall-clock time.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of autonomous agents increasingly relies on Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) to perform tasks described in natural language with GUI environments, such as websites, desktop computers, or mobile phones. Existing benchmarks for MLM agents in interactive environments are limited by their focus on a single environment, lack of detailed and generalized evaluation methods, and the complexities of constructing tasks and evaluators. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Crab, the first agent benchmark framework designed to support cross-environment tasks, incorporating a graph-based fine-grained evaluation method and an efficient mechanism for task and evaluator construction. Our framework supports multiple devices and can be easily extended to any environment with a Python interface. Leveraging Crab, we developed a cross-platform Crab Benchmark-v0 comprising 120 tasks in computer desktop and mobile phone environments. We evaluated four advanced MLMs using different single and multi-agent system configurations on this benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishal Mirza, Rahul Kulkarni, Aakanksha Jadhav</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have been notable, yet widespread enterprise adoption remains limited due to various constraints. This paper examines bias in LLMs-a crucial issue affecting their usability, reliability, and fairness. Researchers are developing strategies to mitigate bias, including debiasing layers, specialized reference datasets like Winogender and Winobias, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). These techniques have been integrated into the latest LLMs. Our study evaluates gender bias in occupational scenarios and gender, age, and racial bias in crime scenarios across four leading LLMs released in 2024: Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B, Claude 3 Opus, and GPT-4o. Findings reveal that LLMs often depict female characters more frequently than male ones in various occupations, showing a 37% deviation from US BLS data. In crime scenarios, deviations from US FBI data are 54% for gender, 28% for race, and 17% for age. We observe that efforts to reduce gender and racial bias often lead to outcomes that may over-index one sub-class, potentially exacerbating the issue. These results highlight the limitations of current bias mitigation techniques and underscore the need for more effective approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xunjian Yin, Xinyi Wang, Liangming Pan, Xiaojun Wan, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of AI-driven agents across various tasks. However, existing agentic systems, whether based on fixed pipeline algorithms or pre-defined meta-learning frameworks, cannot search the whole agent design space due to the restriction of human-designed components, and thus might miss the globally optimal agent design. In this paper, we introduce G\"odel Agent, a self-evolving framework inspired by the G\"odel machine, enabling agents to recursively improve themselves without relying on predefined routines or fixed optimization algorithms. G\"odel Agent leverages LLMs to dynamically modify its own logic and behavior, guided solely by high-level objectives through prompting. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and complex agent tasks demonstrate that implementation of G\"odel Agent can achieve continuous self-improvement, surpassing manually crafted agents in performance, efficiency, and generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhijit Manatkar, Ashlesha Akella, Parthivi Gupta, Krishnasuri Narayanam</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering meaningful insights from a large dataset, known as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), is a challenging task that requires thorough exploration and analysis of the data. Automated Data Exploration (ADE) systems use goal-oriented methods with Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning towards full automation. However, these methods require human involvement to anticipate goals that may limit insight extraction, while fully automated systems demand significant computational resources and retraining for new datasets. We introduce QUIS, a fully automated EDA system that operates in two stages: insight generation (ISGen) driven by question generation (QUGen). The QUGen module generates questions in iterations, refining them from previous iterations to enhance coverage without human intervention or manually curated examples. The ISGen module analyzes data to produce multiple relevant insights in response to each question, requiring no prior training and enabling QUIS to adapt to new datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tangwen Qian, Junhe Li, Yile Chen, Gao Cong, Tao Sun, Fei Wang, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling trajectory data with generic-purpose dense representations has become a prevalent paradigm for various downstream applications, such as trajectory classification, travel time estimation and similarity computation. However, existing methods typically rely on trajectories from a single spatial view, limiting their ability to capture the rich contextual information that is crucial for gaining deeper insights into movement patterns across different geospatial contexts. To this end, we propose MVTraj, a novel multi-view modeling method for trajectory representation learning. MVTraj integrates diverse contextual knowledge, from GPS to road network and points-of-interest to provide a more comprehensive understanding of trajectory data. To align the learning process across multiple views, we utilize GPS trajectories as a bridge and employ self-supervised pretext tasks to capture and distinguish movement patterns across different spatial views. Following this, we treat trajectories from different views as distinct modalities and apply a hierarchical cross-modal interaction module to fuse the representations, thereby enriching the knowledge derived from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MVTraj significantly outperforms existing baselines in tasks associated with various spatial views, validating its effectiveness and practical utility in spatio-temporal modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Perceiving and generating diverse modalities are crucial for AI models to effectively learn from and engage with real-world signals, necessitating reliable evaluations for their development. We identify two major issues in current evaluations: (1) inconsistent standards, shaped by different communities with varying protocols and maturity levels; and (2) significant query, grading, and generalization biases. To address these, we introduce MixEval-X, the first any-to-any, real-world benchmark designed to optimize and standardize evaluations across diverse input and output modalities. We propose multi-modal benchmark mixture and adaptation-rectification pipelines to reconstruct real-world task distributions, ensuring evaluations generalize effectively to real-world use cases. Extensive meta-evaluations show our approach effectively aligns benchmark samples with real-world task distributions. Meanwhile, MixEval-X's model rankings correlate strongly with that of crowd-sourced real-world evaluations (up to 0.98) while being much more efficient. We provide comprehensive leaderboards to rerank existing models and organizations and offer insights to enhance understanding of multi-modal evaluations and inform future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongming Zhang, Ke Sun, Bo Xu, Linglong Kong, Martin M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: In deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems, abnormal states pose significant risks by potentially triggering unpredictable behaviors and unsafe actions, thus impeding the deployment of RL systems in real-world scenarios. It is crucial for reliable decision-making systems to have the capability to cast an alert whenever they encounter unfamiliar observations that they are not equipped to handle. In this paper, we propose a novel Mahalanobis distance-based (MD) anomaly detection framework, called \textit{MDX}, for deep RL algorithms. MDX simultaneously addresses random, adversarial, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state outliers in both offline and online settings. It utilizes Mahalanobis distance within class-conditional distributions for each action and operates within a statistical hypothesis testing framework under the Gaussian assumption. We further extend it to robust and distribution-free versions by incorporating Robust MD and conformal inference techniques. Through extensive experiments on classical control environments, Atari games, and autonomous driving scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our MD-based detection framework. MDX offers a simple, unified, and practical anomaly detection tool for enhancing the safety and reliability of RL systems in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoyiran Li, Fangyu Liu, Nigel Collier, Anna Korhonen, Ivan Vuli\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Word translation or bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) is a key cross-lingual task, aiming to bridge the lexical gap between different languages. In this work, we propose a robust and effective two-stage contrastive learning framework for the BLI task. At Stage C1, we propose to refine standard cross-lingual linear maps between static word embeddings (WEs) via a contrastive learning objective; we also show how to integrate it into the self-learning procedure for even more refined cross-lingual maps. In Stage C2, we conduct BLI-oriented contrastive fine-tuning of mBERT, unlocking its word translation capability. We also show that static WEs induced from the `C2-tuned' mBERT complement static WEs from Stage C1. Comprehensive experiments on standard BLI datasets for diverse languages and different experimental setups demonstrate substantial gains achieved by our framework. While the BLI method from Stage C1 already yields substantial gains over all state-of-the-art BLI methods in our comparison, even stronger improvements are met with the full two-stage framework: e.g., we report gains for 112/112 BLI setups, spanning 28 language pairs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoyiran Li, Fangyu Liu, Ivan Vuli\'c, Anna Korhonen</p>
<p>Abstract: Bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) with limited bilingual supervision is a crucial yet challenging task in multilingual NLP. Current state-of-the-art BLI methods rely on the induction of cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWEs) to capture cross-lingual word similarities; such CLWEs are obtained 1) via traditional static models (e.g., VecMap), or 2) by extracting type-level CLWEs from multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs), or 3) through combining the former two options. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised post-hoc reranking method termed BLICEr (BLI with Cross-Encoder Reranking), applicable to any precalculated CLWE space, which improves their BLI capability. The key idea is to 'extract' cross-lingual lexical knowledge from mPLMs, and then combine it with the original CLWEs. This crucial step is done via 1) creating a word similarity dataset, comprising positive word pairs (i.e., true translations) and hard negative pairs induced from the original CLWE space, and then 2) fine-tuning an mPLM (e.g., mBERT or XLM-R) in a cross-encoder manner to predict the similarity scores. At inference, we 3) combine the similarity score from the original CLWE space with the score from the BLI-tuned cross-encoder. BLICEr establishes new state-of-the-art results on two standard BLI benchmarks spanning a wide spectrum of diverse languages: it substantially outperforms a series of strong baselines across the board. We also validate the robustness of BLICEr with different CLWEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsu Kim, Hyung-Il Kim, Yong Man Ro</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) aims to infer speech into text depending on lip movements alone. As it focuses on visual information to model the speech, its performance is inherently sensitive to personal lip appearances and movements, and this makes the VSR models show degraded performance when they are applied to unseen speakers. In this paper, to remedy the performance degradation of the VSR model on unseen speakers, we propose prompt tuning methods of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for speaker-adaptive VSR. Specifically, motivated by recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we finetune prompts on adaptation data of target speakers instead of modifying the pre-trained model parameters. Different from the previous prompt tuning methods mainly limited to Transformer variant architecture, we explore different types of prompts, the addition, the padding, and the concatenation form prompts that can be applied to the VSR model which is composed of CNN and Transformer in general. With the proposed prompt tuning, we show that the performance of the pre-trained VSR model on unseen speakers can be largely improved by using a small amount of adaptation data (e.g., less than 5 minutes), even if the pre-trained model is already developed with large speaker variations. Moreover, by analyzing the performance and parameters of different types of prompts, we investigate when the prompt tuning is preferred over the finetuning methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both word- and sentence-level VSR databases, LRW-ID and GRID.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyue Guo, Zheng Zhang, Bo Yang, Jianwei Zhang, Hongyu Yang, Yi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The booming air transportation industry inevitably burdens air traffic controllers' workload, causing unexpected human factor-related incidents. Current air traffic control systems fail to consider spoken instructions for traffic prediction, bringing significant challenges in detecting human errors during real-time traffic operations. Here, we present an automation paradigm integrating controlling intent into the information processing loop through the spoken instruction-aware flight trajectory prediction framework. A 3-stage progressive multi-modal learning paradigm is proposed to address the modality gap between the trajectory and spoken instructions, as well as minimize the data requirements. Experiments on a real-world dataset show the proposed framework achieves flight trajectory prediction with high predictability and timeliness, obtaining over 20% relative reduction in mean deviation error. Moreover, the generalizability of the proposed framework is also confirmed by various model architectures. The proposed framework can formulate full-automated information processing in real-world air traffic applications, supporting human error detection and enhancing aviation safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Magdalena Wysocka, Oskar Wysocki, Maxime Delmas, Vincent Mutel, Andre Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper introduces a framework for the evaluation of the encoding of factual scientific knowledge, designed to streamline the manual evaluation process typically conducted by domain experts. Inferring over and extracting information from Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on a large corpus of scientific literature can potentially define a step change in biomedical discovery, reducing the barriers for accessing and integrating existing medical evidence. This work explores the potential of LLMs for dialoguing with biomedical background knowledge, using the context of antibiotic discovery. The framework involves of three evaluation steps, each assessing different aspects sequentially: fluency, prompt alignment, semantic coherence, factual knowledge, and specificity of the generated responses. By splitting these tasks between non-experts and experts, the framework reduces the effort required from the latter. The work provides a systematic assessment on the ability of eleven state-of-the-art models LLMs, including ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Llama 2, in two prompting-based tasks: chemical compound definition generation and chemical compound-fungus relation determination. Although recent models have improved in fluency, factual accuracy is still low and models are biased towards over-represented entities. The ability of LLMs to serve as biomedical knowledge bases is questioned, and the need for additional systematic evaluation frameworks is highlighted. While LLMs are currently not fit for purpose to be used as biomedical factual knowledge bases in a zero-shot setting, there is a promising emerging property in the direction of factuality as the models become domain specialised, scale-up in size and level of human feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxiao Shen, John Dudley, Per Ola Kristensson</p>
<p>Abstract: We depend on our own memory to encode, store, and retrieve our experiences. However, memory lapses can occur. One promising avenue for achieving memory augmentation is through the use of augmented reality head-mounted displays to capture and preserve egocentric videos, a practice commonly referred to as lifelogging. However, a significant challenge arises from the sheer volume of video data generated through lifelogging, as the current technology lacks the capability to encode and store such large amounts of data efficiently. Further, retrieving specific information from extensive video archives requires substantial computational power, further complicating the task of quickly accessing desired content. To address these challenges, we propose a memory augmentation agent that involves leveraging natural language encoding for video data and storing them in a vector database. This approach harnesses the power of large vision language models to perform the language encoding process. Additionally, we propose using large language models to facilitate natural language querying. Our agent underwent extensive evaluation using the QA-Ego4D dataset and achieved state-of-the-art results with a BLEU score of 8.3, outperforming conventional machine learning models that scored between 3.4 and 5.8. Additionally, we conducted a user study in which participants interacted with the human memory augmentation agent through episodic memory and open-ended questions. The results of this study show that the agent results in significantly better recall performance on episodic memory tasks compared to human participants. The results also highlight the agent's practical applicability and user acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangxian Xie, Jiancheng Yang, Donglai Wei, Ziqiao Weng, Pascal Fua</p>
<p>Abstract: Pulmonary diseases rank prominently among the principal causes of death worldwide. Curing them will require, among other things, a better understanding of the complex 3D tree-shaped structures within the pulmonary system, such as airways, arteries, and veins. Traditional approaches using high-resolution image stacks and standard CNNs on dense voxel grids face challenges in computational efficiency, limited resolution, local context, and inadequate preservation of shape topology. Our method addresses these issues by shifting from dense voxel to sparse point representation, offering better memory efficiency and global context utilization. However, the inherent sparsity in point representation can lead to a loss of crucial connectivity in tree-shaped structures. To mitigate this, we introduce graph learning on skeletonized structures, incorporating differentiable feature fusion for improved topology and long-distance context capture. Furthermore, we employ an implicit function for efficient conversion of sparse representations into dense reconstructions end-to-end. The proposed method not only delivers state-of-the-art performance in labeling accuracy, both overall and at key locations, but also enables efficient inference and the generation of closed surface shapes. Addressing data scarcity in this field, we have also curated a comprehensive dataset to validate our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Tanner, Sina Mansour L., Ludovico Coletta, Alessandro Gozzi, Richard F. Betzel</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental work in neuroscience has focused on the representational and dynamical character of neural manifolds --subspaces in neural activity space wherein many neurons coactivate. Importantly, neural populations studied under this "neural manifold hypothesis" are continuous and not cleanly divided into separate neural populations. This perspective clashes with the "modular hypothesis" of brain organization, wherein neural elements maintain an "all-or-nothing" affiliation with modules. In line with this modular hypothesis, recent research on recurrent neural networks suggests that multi-task networks become modular across training, such that different modules specialize for task-general dynamical motifs. If the modular hypothesis is true, then it would be important to use a dimensionality reduction technique that captures modular structure. Here, we investigate the features of such a method. We leverage RNNs as a model system to study the character of modular neural populations, using a community detection method from network science known as modularity maximization to partition neurons into distinct modules. These partitions allow us to ask the following question: do these modular boundaries matter to the system? ...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Lin, Zhe Chen, Zihan Fang, Xianhao Chen, Xiong Wang, Yue Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, a large number of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have been launched and deployed successfully in space by commercial companies, such as SpaceX. Due to multimodal sensors equipped by the LEO satellites, they serve not only for communication but also for various machine learning applications, such as space modulation recognition, remote sensing image classification, etc. However, the ground station (GS) may be incapable of downloading such a large volume of raw sensing data for centralized model training due to the limited contact time with LEO satellites (e.g. 5 minutes). Therefore, federated learning (FL) has emerged as the promising solution to address this problem via on-device training. Unfortunately, to enable FL on LEO satellites, we still face three critical challenges that are i) heterogeneous computing and memory capabilities, ii) limited uplink rate, and iii) model staleness. To this end, we propose FedSN as a general FL framework to tackle the above challenges, and fully explore data diversity on LEO satellites. Specifically, we first present a novel sub-structure scheme to enable heterogeneous local model training considering different computing, memory, and communication constraints on LEO satellites. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-synchronous model aggregation strategy to dynamically schedule model aggregation for compensating model staleness. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the FedSN, we evaluate it using space modulation recognition and remote sensing image classification tasks by leveraging the data from real-world satellite networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedSN framework achieves higher accuracy, lower computing, and communication overhead than the state-of-the-art benchmarks and the effectiveness of each components in FedSN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Assaf Ben-Kish, Moran Yanuka, Morris Alper, Raja Giryes, Hadar Averbuch-Elor</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent years have seen rapid progress in image-conditioned text generation, image captioning still suffers from the fundamental issue of hallucinations, namely, the generation of spurious details that cannot be inferred from the given image. Existing methods largely use closed-vocabulary object lists to mitigate or evaluate hallucinations in image captioning, ignoring the long-tailed nature of hallucinations that occur in practice. To this end, we propose a framework for addressing hallucinations in image captioning in the open-vocabulary setting. Our framework includes a new benchmark, OpenCHAIR, that leverages generative foundation models to evaluate open-vocabulary object hallucinations for image captioning, surpassing the popular and similarly-sized CHAIR benchmark in both diversity and accuracy. Furthermore, to mitigate open-vocabulary hallucinations without using a closed object list, we propose MOCHa, an approach harnessing advancements in reinforcement learning. Our multi-objective reward function explicitly targets the trade-off between fidelity and adequacy in generations without requiring any strong supervision. MOCHa improves a large variety of image captioning models, as captured by our OpenCHAIR benchmark and other existing metrics.

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) by modelling how entities and relations interact in recent years. However, the explanation of the predicted facts has not caught the necessary attention. Proper explanations for the results of GNN-based KGC models increase model transparency and help researchers develop more reliable models. Existing practices for explaining KGC tasks rely on instance/subgraph-based approaches, while in some scenarios, paths can provide more user-friendly and interpretable explanations. Nonetheless, the methods for generating path-based explanations for KGs have not been well-explored. To address this gap, we propose Power-Link, the first path-based KGC explainer that explores GNN-based models. We design a novel simplified graph-powering technique, which enables the generation of path-based explanations with a fully parallelisable and memory-efficient training scheme. We further introduce three new metrics for quantitative evaluation of the explanations, together with a qualitative human evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Power-Link outperforms the SOTA baselines in interpretability, efficiency, and scalability.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to generate sentiment-controlled feedback in response to multimodal inputs comprising text and images addresses a critical gap in human-computer interaction. This capability allows systems to provide empathetic, accurate, and engaging responses, with useful applications in education, healthcare, marketing, and customer service. To this end, we have constructed a large-scale Controllable Multimodal Feedback Synthesis (CMFeed) dataset and propose a controllable feedback synthesis system. The system features an encoder, decoder, and controllability block for textual and visual inputs. It extracts features using a transformer and Faster R-CNN networks, combining them to generate feedback. The CMFeed dataset includes images, texts, reactions to the posts, human comments with relevance scores, and reactions to these comments. These reactions train the model to produce feedback with specified sentiments, achieving a sentiment classification accuracy of 77.23\%, which is 18.82\% higher than the accuracy without controllability. The system also incorporates a similarity module for assessing feedback relevance through rank-based metrics and an interpretability technique to analyze the contributions of textual and visual features during feedback generation.

Meanwhile, developments in neural surface representation learning incorporate non-linear positional encoding, addressing issues like spectral bias; however, this poses challenges in applying mesh extraction techniques based on CPWA functions. Focusing on trilinear interpolating methods as positional encoding, we present theoretical insights and an analytical mesh extraction, showing the transformation of hypersurfaces to flat planes within the trilinear region under the eikonal constraint. Moreover, we introduce a method for approximating intersecting points among three hypersurfaces contributing to broader applications. We empirically validate correctness and parsimony through chamfer distance and efficiency, and angular distance, while examining the correlation between the eikonal loss and the planarity of the hypersurfaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nazar Buzun, Maksim Bobrin, Dmitry V. Dylov</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a new approach for Neural Optimal Transport (NOT) training procedure, capable of accurately and efficiently estimating optimal transportation plan via specific regularization on dual Kantorovich potentials. The main bottleneck of existing NOT solvers is associated with the procedure of finding a near-exact approximation of the conjugate operator (i.e., the c-transform), which is done either by optimizing over non-convex max-min objectives or by the computationally intensive fine-tuning of the initial approximated prediction. We resolve both issues by proposing a new, theoretically justified loss in the form of expectile regularisation which enforces binding conditions on the learning process of dual potentials. Such a regularization provides the upper bound estimation over the distribution of possible conjugate potentials and makes the learning stable, completely eliminating the need for additional extensive fine-tuning. Proposed method, called Expectile-Regularised Neural Optimal Transport (ENOT), outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on the established Wasserstein-2 benchmark tasks by a large margin (up to a 3-fold improvement in quality and up to a 10-fold improvement in runtime). Moreover, we showcase performance of ENOT for varying cost functions on different tasks such as image generation, showing robustness of proposed algorithm. OTT-JAX library includes our implementation of ENOT algorithm https://ott-jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/ENOT.html</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hazhar Rahmani, Abhishek N. Kulkarni, Jie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human preferences are not always represented via complete linear orders: It is natural to employ partially-ordered preferences for expressing incomparable outcomes. In this work, we consider decision-making and probabilistic planning in stochastic systems modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs), given a partially ordered preference over a set of temporally extended goals. Specifically, each temporally extended goal is expressed using a formula in Linear Temporal Logic on Finite Traces (LTL$_f$). To plan with the partially ordered preference, we introduce order theory to map a preference over temporal goals to a preference over policies for the MDP. Accordingly, a most preferred policy under a stochastic ordering induces a stochastic nondominated probability distribution over the finite paths in the MDP. To synthesize a most preferred policy, our technical approach includes two key steps. In the first step, we develop a procedure to transform a partially ordered preference over temporal goals into a computational model, called preference automaton, which is a semi-automaton with a partial order over acceptance conditions. In the second step, we prove that finding a most preferred policy is equivalent to computing a Pareto-optimal policy in a multi-objective MDP that is constructed from the original MDP, the preference automaton, and the chosen stochastic ordering relation. Throughout the paper, we employ running examples to illustrate the proposed preference specification and solution approaches. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm using these examples, providing detailed analysis, and then discuss several potential future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seth Lazar</p>
<p>Abstract: Some have criticised Generative AI Systems for replicating the familiar pathologies of already widely-deployed AI systems. Other critics highlight how they foreshadow vastly more powerful future systems, which might threaten humanity's survival. The first group says there is nothing new here; the other looks through the present to a perhaps distant horizon. In this paper, I instead pay attention to what makes these particular systems distinctive: both their remarkable scientific achievement, and the most likely and consequential ways in which they will change society over the next five to ten years. In particular, I explore the potential societal impacts and normative questions raised by the looming prospect of 'Language Model Agents', in which multimodal large language models (LLMs) form the executive centre of complex, tool-using AI systems that can take unsupervised sequences of actions towards some goal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyu Qiu, Benjamin Tan, Hammond Pearce</p>
<p>Abstract: Training new engineers in digital design is a challenge, particularly when it comes to teaching the complex electronic design automation (EDA) tooling used in this domain. Learners will typically deploy designs in the Verilog and VHDL hardware description languages to Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) from Altera (Intel) and Xilinx (AMD) via proprietary closed-source toolchains (Quartus Prime and Vivado, respectively). These tools are complex and difficult to use -- yet, as they are the tools used in industry, they are an essential first step in this space. In this work, we examine how recent advances in artificial intelligence may be leveraged to address aspects of this challenge. Specifically, we investigate if Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated text comprehension and question-answering capabilities, can be used to generate novice-friendly explanations of compile-time synthesis error messages from Quartus Prime and Vivado. To perform this study we generate 936 error message explanations using three OpenAI LLMs over 21 different buggy code samples. These are then graded for relevance and correctness, and we find that in approximately 71% of cases the LLMs give correct & complete explanations suitable for novice learners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederic Kirstein, Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp</p>
<p>Abstract: Meeting summarization has become a critical task considering the increase in online interactions. While new techniques are introduced regularly, their evaluation uses metrics not designed to capture meeting-specific errors, undermining effective evaluation. This paper investigates what the frequently used automatic metrics capture and which errors they mask by correlating automatic metric scores with human evaluations across a broad error taxonomy. We commence with a comprehensive literature review on English meeting summarization to define key challenges like speaker dynamics and contextual turn-taking and error types such as missing information and linguistic inaccuracy, concepts previously loosely defined in the field. We examine the relationship between characteristic challenges and errors by using annotated transcripts and summaries from Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence and autoregressive models from the general summary QMSum dataset. Through experimental validation, we find that different model architectures respond variably to challenges in meeting transcripts, resulting in different pronounced links between challenges and errors. Current default-used metrics struggle to capture observable errors, showing weak to mid-correlations, while a third of the correlations show trends of error masking. Only a subset reacts accurately to specific errors, while most correlations show either unresponsiveness or failure to reflect the error's impact on summary quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayu Yang, Fumian Chen, Hui Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS). However, the application of LLMs to CRS has exposed a notable discrepancy in behavior between LLM-based CRS and human recommenders: LLMs often appear inflexible and passive, frequently rushing to complete the recommendation task without sufficient inquiry.This behavior discrepancy can lead to decreased accuracy in recommendations and lower user satisfaction. Despite its importance, existing studies in CRS lack a study about how to measure such behavior discrepancy. To fill this gap, we propose Behavior Alignment, a new evaluation metric to measure how well the recommendation strategies made by a LLM-based CRS are consistent with human recommenders'. Our experiment results show that the new metric is better aligned with human preferences and can better differentiate how systems perform than existing evaluation metrics. As Behavior Alignment requires explicit and costly human annotations on the recommendation strategies, we also propose a classification-based method to implicitly measure the Behavior Alignment based on the responses. The evaluation results confirm the robustness of the method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael H. Shaham, Taskin Padir</p>
<p>Abstract: Platooning of autonomous vehicles has the potential to increase safety and fuel efficiency on highways. The goal of platooning is to have each vehicle drive at a specified speed (set by the leader) while maintaining a safe distance from its neighbors. Many prior works have analyzed various controllers for platooning, most commonly linear feedback and distributed model predictive controllers. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for learning a stable, safe, distributed controller for a heterogeneous platoon. Our algorithm relies on recent developments in learning neural network stability certificates. We train a controller for autonomous platooning in simulation and evaluate its performance on hardware with a platoon of four F1Tenth vehicles. We then perform further analysis in simulation with a platoon of 100 vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate the practicality of the algorithm and the learned controller by comparing the performance of the neural network controller to linear feedback and distributed model predictive controllers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Improving the future of healthcare starts by better understanding the current actual practices in hospital settings. This motivates the objective of discovering typical care pathways from patient data. Revealing typical care pathways can be achieved through clustering. The difficulty in clustering care pathways, represented by sequences of timestamped events, lies in defining a semantically appropriate metric and clustering algorithms. In this article, we adapt two methods developed for time series to the clustering of timed sequences: the drop-DTW metric and the DBA approach for the construction of averaged time sequences. These methods are then applied in clustering algorithms to propose original and sound clustering algorithms for timed sequences. This approach is experimented with and evaluated on synthetic and real-world data.</p>

Using the highly expressive DL RIQ as a case study, we introduce novel sequent calculi for RIQ-ontologies and show how certain interpolants can be computed from sequent calculus proofs, which permit the extraction of explicit definitions of implicitly definable concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sequent-based approach to computing interpolants and definitions within the context of DLs, as well as the first proof that RIQ enjoys the CBP. Moreover, due to the modularity of our sequent systems, our results hold for restrictions of RIQ, and are applicable to other DLs by suitable modifications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present LayerSkip, an end-to-end solution to speed-up inference of large language models (LLMs). First, during training we apply layer dropout, with low dropout rates for earlier layers and higher dropout rates for later layers, and an early exit loss where all transformer layers share the same exit. Second, during inference, we show that this training recipe increases the accuracy of early exit at earlier layers, without adding any auxiliary layers or modules to the model. Third, we present a novel self-speculative decoding solution where we exit at early layers and verify and correct with remaining layers of the model. Our proposed self-speculative decoding approach has less memory footprint than other speculative decoding approaches and benefits from shared compute and activations of the draft and verification stages. We run experiments on different Llama model sizes on different types of training: pretraining from scratch, continual pretraining, finetuning on specific data domain, and finetuning on specific task. We implement our inference solution and show speedups of up to 2.16x on summarization for CNN/DM documents, 1.82x on coding, and 2.0x on TOPv2 semantic parsing task.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have significantly impacted various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks. One area that stands to benefit greatly is Earth observation, where these models can efficiently process large-scale, unlabeled geospatial data. In this work we extend the SwinMAE model to integrate temporal information for satellite time-series data. The architecture employs a hierarchical 3D Masked Autoencoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks to effectively capture multi-scale spatio-temporal dependencies in satellite imagery. To enhance transfer learning, we incorporate both encoder and decoder pretrained weights, along with skip connections to preserve scale-specific information. This forms an architecture similar to SwinUNet with an additional temporal component. Our approach shows significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art foundation models for all the evaluated downstream tasks: land cover segmentation, building density prediction, flood mapping, wildfire scar mapping and multi-temporal crop segmentation. Particularly, in the land cover segmentation task of the PhilEO Bench dataset, it outperforms other geospatial foundation models with a 10.4% higher accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have achieved promising performances across various applications. Nonetheless, the ongoing challenge of integrating long-tail knowledge continues to impede the seamless adoption of LLMs in specialized domains. In this work, we introduce DALK, a.k.a. Dynamic Co-Augmentation of LLMs and KG, to address this limitation and demonstrate its ability on studying Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a specialized sub-field in biomedicine and a global health priority. With a synergized framework of LLM and KG mutually enhancing each other, we first leverage LLM to construct an evolving AD-specific knowledge graph (KG) sourced from AD-related scientific literature, and then we utilize a coarse-to-fine sampling method with a novel self-aware knowledge retrieval approach to select appropriate knowledge from the KG to augment LLM inference capabilities. The experimental results, conducted on our constructed AD question answering (ADQA) benchmark, underscore the efficacy of DALK. Additionally, we perform a series of detailed analyses that can offer valuable insights and guidelines for the emerging topic of mutually enhancing KG and LLM.

<p>Abstract: Natural language inference (NLI), the task of recognizing the entailment relationship in sentence pairs, is an actively studied topic serving as a proxy for natural language understanding. Despite the relevance of the task in building conversational agents and improving text classification, machine translation and other NLP tasks, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available NLI corpus for the Romanian language. To this end, we introduce the first Romanian NLI corpus (RoNLI) comprising 58K training sentence pairs, which are obtained via distant supervision, and 6K validation and test sentence pairs, which are manually annotated with the correct labels. We conduct experiments with multiple machine learning methods based on distant learning, ranging from shallow models based on word embeddings to transformer-based neural networks, to establish a set of competitive baselines. Furthermore, we improve on the best model by employing a new curriculum learning strategy based on data cartography.

<p>Abstract: Humans and animals learn throughout life. Such continual learning is crucial for intelligence. In this chapter, we examine the pivotal role plasticity mechanisms with complex internal synaptic dynamics could play in enabling this ability in neural networks. By surveying theoretical research, we highlight two fundamental enablers for continual learning. First, synaptic plasticity mechanisms must maintain and evolve an internal state over several behaviorally relevant timescales. Second, plasticity algorithms must leverage the internal state to intelligently regulate plasticity at individual synapses to facilitate the seamless integration of new memories while avoiding detrimental interference with existing ones. Our chapter covers successful applications of these principles to deep neural networks and underscores the significance of synaptic metaplasticity in sustaining continual learning capabilities. Finally, we outline avenues for further research to understand the brain's superb continual learning abilities and harness similar mechanisms for artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiatong Li, Renjun Hu, Kunzhe Huang, Yan Zhuang, Qi Liu, Mengxiao Zhu, Xing Shi, Wei Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Expert-designed close-ended benchmarks are indispensable in assessing the knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs). Despite their widespread use, concerns have mounted regarding their reliability due to limited test scenarios and an unavoidable risk of data contamination. To rectify this, we present PertEval, a toolkit devised for in-depth probing of LLMs' knowledge capacity through \textbf{knowledge-invariant perturbations}. These perturbations employ human-like restatement techniques to generate on-the-fly test samples from static benchmarks, meticulously retaining knowledge-critical content while altering irrelevant details. Our toolkit further includes a suite of \textbf{response consistency analyses} that compare performance on raw vs. perturbed test sets to precisely assess LLMs' genuine knowledge capacity. Six representative LLMs are re-evaluated using PertEval. Results reveal significantly inflated performance of the LLMs on raw benchmarks, including an absolute 25.8% overestimation for GPT-4. Additionally, through a nuanced response pattern analysis, we discover that PertEval retains LLMs' uncertainty to specious knowledge, and reveals their potential rote memorization to correct options which leads to overestimated performance. We also find that the detailed response consistency analyses by PertEval could illuminate various weaknesses in existing LLMs' knowledge mastery and guide the development of refinement. Our findings provide insights for advancing more robust and genuinely knowledgeable LLMs. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/aigc-apps/PertEval}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kounianhua Du, Jizheng Chen, Jianghao Lin, Menghui Zhu, Bo Chen, Shuai Li, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender models play a vital role in various industrial scenarios, while often faced with the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by the fast shifting data distribution. To alleviate this problem, a common approach is to reuse knowledge from the historical data. However, preserving the vast and fast-accumulating data is hard, which causes dramatic storage overhead. Memorizing old data through a parametric knowledge base is then proposed, which compresses the vast amount of raw data into model parameters. Despite the flexibility, how to improve the memorization and generalization capabilities of the parametric knowledge base and suit the flexible information need of each instance are challenging. In this paper, we propose FINED to Feed INstance-wise information need with Essential and Disentangled parametric knowledge from past data for recommendation enhancement. Concretely, we train a knowledge extractor that extracts knowledge patterns of arbitrary order from past data and a knowledge encoder that memorizes the arbitrary order patterns, which serves as the retrieval key generator and memory network respectively in the following knowledge reusing phase. The whole process is regularized by the proposed two constraints, which improve the capabilities of the parametric knowledge base without increasing the size of it. The essential principle helps to compress the input into representative vectors that capture the task-relevant information and filter out the noisy information. The disentanglement principle reduces the redundancy of stored information and pushes the knowledge base to focus on capturing the disentangled invariant patterns. These two rules together promote rational compression of information for robust and generalized knowledge representations. Extensive experiments on two datasets justify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charlie Hou, Akshat Shrivastava, Hongyuan Zhan, Rylan Conway, Trang Le, Adithya Sagar, Giulia Fanti, Daniel Lazar</p>
<p>Abstract: On-device training is currently the most common approach for training machine learning (ML) models on private, distributed user data. Despite this, on-device training has several drawbacks: (1) most user devices are too small to train large models on-device, (2) on-device training is communication- and computation-intensive, and (3) on-device training can be difficult to debug and deploy. To address these problems, we propose Private Evolution-Text (PrE-Text), a method for generating differentially private (DP) synthetic textual data. First, we show that across multiple datasets, training small models (models that fit on user devices) with PrE-Text synthetic data outperforms small models trained on-device under practical privacy regimes ($\epsilon=1.29$, $\epsilon=7.58$). We achieve these results while using 9$\times$ fewer rounds, 6$\times$ less client computation per round, and 100$\times$ less communication per round. Second, finetuning large models on PrE-Text's DP synthetic data improves large language model (LLM) performance on private data across the same range of privacy budgets. Altogether, these results suggest that training on DP synthetic data can be a better option than training a model on-device on private distributed data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divij Handa, Pavel Dolin, Shrinidhi Kumbhar, Tran Cao Son, Chitta Baral</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning about Actions and Change (RAC) has historically played a pivotal role in solving foundational AI problems, such as the frame problem. It has driven advancements in AI fields, such as non-monotonic and commonsense reasoning. RAC remains crucial for AI systems that operate in dynamic environments, engage in interactive scenarios, or rely on commonsense reasoning. Despite substantial advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in various AI domains, their performance in RAC remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a new diagnostic benchmark, ActionReasoningBench, which encompasses 8 domains and includes questions for up to 19 action sequences. This benchmark rigorously evaluates LLMs across six key RAC dimensions: Fluent Tracking, State Tracking, Action Executability, Effects of Actions, Numerical RAC, and Composite Questions. LLMs demonstrate average accuracy rates of 73.55%, 65.63%, 58.73%, and 62.38% on the former four dimensions, which are frequently discussed in RAC literature. However, the performance on the latter two dimensions, which introduce complex and novel reasoning questions, the average performance of LLMs is lowered to 33.16% and 51.19%, respectively, reflecting a 17.9% performance decline. We also introduce new ramification constraints to capture the indirect effects of actions, providing deeper insights into RAC challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Wang, Chris Holmes</p>
<p>Abstract: Applications of large language models often involve the generation of free-form responses, in which case uncertainty quantification becomes challenging. This is due to the need to identify task-specific uncertainties (e.g., about the semantics) which appears difficult to define in general cases. This work addresses these challenges from a perspective of Bayesian decision theory, starting from the assumption that our utility is characterized by a similarity measure that compares a generated response with a hypothetical true response. We discuss how this assumption enables principled quantification of the model's subjective uncertainty and its calibration. We further derive a measure for epistemic uncertainty, based on a missing data perspective and its characterization as an excess risk. The proposed methods can be applied to black-box language models. We illustrate the methods on question answering and machine translation tasks. Our experiments provide a principled evaluation of task-specific calibration, and demonstrate that epistemic uncertainty offers a promising deferral strategy for efficient data acquisition in in-context learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhong Li, Simon Geisler, Yuhang Wang, Stephan G\"unnemann, Matthijs van Leeuwen</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictions made by graph neural networks (GNNs) usually lack interpretability due to their complex computational behavior and the abstract nature of graphs. In an attempt to tackle this, many GNN explanation methods have emerged. Their goal is to explain a model's predictions and thereby obtain trust when GNN models are deployed in decision critical applications. Most GNN explanation methods work in a post-hoc manner and provide explanations in the form of a small subset of important edges and/or nodes. In this paper we demonstrate that these explanations can unfortunately not be trusted, as common GNN explanation methods turn out to be highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations. That is, even small perturbations of the original graph structure that preserve the model's predictions may yield drastically different explanations. This calls into question the trustworthiness and practical utility of post-hoc explanation methods for GNNs. To be able to attack GNN explanation models, we devise a novel attack method dubbed \textit{GXAttack}, the first \textit{optimization-based} adversarial white-box attack method for post-hoc GNN explanations under such settings. Due to the devastating effectiveness of our attack, we call for an adversarial evaluation of future GNN explainers to demonstrate their robustness. For reproducibility, our code is available via GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Li, Qingyan Guo, Jiawei Shao, Lei Song, Jiang Bian, Jun Zhang, Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation has revolutionized large language model (LLM) outputs by providing factual supports. Nevertheless, it struggles to capture all the necessary knowledge for complex reasoning questions. Existing retrieval methods typically divide reference documents into passages, treating them in isolation. These passages, however, are often interrelated, such as passages that are contiguous or share the same keywords. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize such relatedness for enhancing the retrieval process. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval method, called GNN-Ret, which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance retrieval by exploiting the relatedness between passages. Specifically, we first construct a graph of passages by connecting passages that are structure-related or keyword-related. A graph neural network (GNN) is then leveraged to exploit the relationships between passages and improve the retrieval of supporting passages. Furthermore, we extend our method to handle multi-hop reasoning questions using a recurrent graph neural network (RGNN), named RGNN-Ret. At each step, RGNN-Ret integrates the graphs of passages from previous steps, thereby enhancing the retrieval of supporting passages. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNN-Ret achieves higher accuracy for question answering with a single query of LLMs than strong baselines that require multiple queries, and RGNN-Ret further improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 10.4% accuracy improvement on the 2WikiMQA dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Basim Azam, Naveed Akhtar</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) introduce a paradigm of neural modeling that implements learnable functions on the edges of the networks, diverging from the traditional node-centric activations in neural networks. This work assesses the applicability and efficacy of KANs in visual modeling, focusing on fundamental recognition and segmentation tasks. We mainly analyze the performance and efficiency of different network architectures built using KAN concepts along with conventional building blocks of convolutional and linear layers, enabling a comparative analysis with the conventional models. Our findings are aimed at contributing to understanding the potential of KANs in computer vision, highlighting both their strengths and areas for further research. Our evaluation point toward the fact that while KAN-based architectures perform in line with the original claims, it may often be important to employ more complex functions on the network edges to retain the performance advantage of KANs on more complex visual data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhrij Patel, Vishnu Sashank Dorbala, Amrit Singh Bedi, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown in popularity due to their natural language interface and pre trained knowledge, leading to rapidly increasing success in question-answering (QA) tasks. More recently, multi-agent systems with LLM-based agents (Multi-LLM) have been utilized increasingly more for QA. In these scenarios, the models may each answer the question and reach a consensus or each model is specialized to answer different domain questions. However, most prior work dealing with Multi-LLM QA has focused on scenarios where the models are asked in a zero-shot manner or are given information sources to extract the answer. For question answering of an unknown environment, embodied exploration of the environment is first needed to answer the question. This skill is necessary for personalizing embodied AI to environments such as households. There is a lack of insight into whether a Multi-LLM system can handle question-answering based on observations from embodied exploration. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the use of Multi-Embodied LLM Explorers (MELE) for QA in an unknown environment. Multiple LLM-based agents independently explore and then answer queries about a household environment. We analyze different aggregation methods to generate a single, final answer for each query: debating, majority voting, and training a central answer module (CAM). Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher accuracy compared against the other non-learning-based aggregation methods. We provide code and the query dataset for further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhan Yao, Jiangkun Yang, Yongqiang He, Jia Liu, Weiping Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech recognition is an essential start ring of human-computer interaction, and recently, deep learning models have achieved excellent success in this task. However, when the model training and private data provider are always separated, some security threats that make deep neural networks (DNNs) abnormal deserve to be researched. In recent years, the typical backdoor attacks have been researched in speech recognition systems. The existing backdoor methods are based on data poisoning. The attacker adds some incorporated changes to benign speech spectrograms or changes the speech components, such as pitch and timbre. As a result, the poisoned data can be detected by human hearing or automatic deep algorithms. To improve the stealthiness of data poisoning, we propose a non-neural and fast algorithm called Random Spectrogram Rhythm Transformation (RSRT) in this paper. The algorithm combines four steps to generate stealthy poisoned utterances. From the perspective of rhythm component transformation, our proposed trigger stretches or squeezes the mel spectrograms and recovers them back to signals. The operation keeps timbre and content unchanged for good stealthiness. Our experiments are conducted on two kinds of speech recognition tasks, including testing the stealthiness of poisoned samples by speaker verification and automatic speech recognition. The results show that our method has excellent effectiveness and stealthiness. The rhythm trigger needs a low poisoning rate and gets a very high attack success rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyan Liu, Sirui Ding, Sheng Zhou, Wenqi Fan, Qiaoyu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a fundamental and crucial task in drug discovery. However, prior methods are limited by the requirement for a large number of labeled molecules and their restricted ability to generalize for unseen and new tasks, both of which are essential for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we present MolecularGPT for few-shot MPP. From a perspective on instruction tuning, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) based on curated molecular instructions spanning over 1000 property prediction tasks. This enables building a versatile and specialized LLM that can be adapted to novel MPP tasks without any fine-tuning through zero- and few-shot in-context learning (ICL). MolecularGPT exhibits competitive in-context reasoning capabilities across 10 downstream evaluation datasets, setting new benchmarks for few-shot molecular prediction tasks. More importantly, with just two-shot examples, MolecularGPT can outperform standard supervised graph neural network methods on 4 out of 7 datasets. It also excels state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 15.7% increase on classification accuracy and decrease of 17.9 on regression metrics (e.g., RMSE) under zero-shot. This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs as effective few-shot molecular property predictors. The code is available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/MolecularGPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jirui Qi, Gabriele Sarti, Raquel Fern\'andez, Arianna Bisazza</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the verifiability of model answers is a fundamental challenge for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in the question answering (QA) domain. Recently, self-citation prompting was proposed to make large language models (LLMs) generate citations to supporting documents along with their answers. However, self-citing LLMs often struggle to match the required format, refer to non-existent sources, and fail to faithfully reflect LLMs' context usage throughout the generation. In this work, we present MIRAGE --Model Internals-based RAG Explanations -- a plug-and-play approach using model internals for faithful answer attribution in RAG applications. MIRAGE detects context-sensitive answer tokens and pairs them with retrieved documents contributing to their prediction via saliency methods. We evaluate our proposed approach on a multilingual extractive QA dataset, finding high agreement with human answer attribution. On open-ended QA, MIRAGE achieves citation quality and efficiency comparable to self-citation while also allowing for a finer-grained control of attribution parameters. Our qualitative evaluation highlights the faithfulness of MIRAGE's attributions and underscores the promising application of model internals for RAG answer attribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Previous research has demonstrated the potential of AI agents to act as companions that can provide constant emotional support for humans. In this paper, we emphasize the necessity of autonomous adaptation in personal AI companionship, an underexplored yet promising direction. Such adaptability is crucial as it can facilitate more tailored interactions with users and allow the agent to evolve in response to users' changing needs. However, imbuing agents with autonomous adaptability presents unique challenges, including identifying optimal adaptations to meet users' expectations and ensuring a smooth transition during the adaptation process. To address them, we devise a hierarchical framework, AutoPal, that enables controllable and authentic adjustments to the agent's persona based on user interactions. A personamatching dataset is constructed to facilitate the learning of optimal persona adaptations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoPal and highlight the importance of autonomous adaptability in AI companionship.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Xu, Fei Wang, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of Large Language models (LLMs), multimodal LLMs with additional visual modality are also exhibited with similar ICL abilities when multiple image-text pairs are provided as demonstrations. However, relatively less work has been done to investigate the principles behind how and why multimodal ICL works. We conduct a systematic and principled evaluation of multimodal ICL for models of different scales on a broad spectrum of new yet critical tasks. Through perturbations over different modality information, we show that modalities matter differently across tasks in multimodal ICL. Guided by task-specific modality impact, we recommend modality-driven demonstration strategies to boost ICL performance. We also find that models may follow inductive biases from multimodal ICL even if they are rarely seen in or contradict semantic priors from pretraining data. Our principled analysis provides a comprehensive way of understanding the role of demonstrations in multimodal in-context learning, and sheds light on effectively improving multimodal ICL on a wide range of tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqiang Zu, Shenghao Xie, Qing Zhao, Guoqi Li, Lei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale data have been widely witnessed to achieve success in various natural imaging downstream tasks. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to adapt foundation models to new domains by updating only a small portion of parameters in order to reduce computational overhead. However, the effectiveness of these PEFT methods, especially in cross-domain few-shot scenarios, e.g., medical image analysis, has not been fully explored. In this work, we facilitate the study of the performance of PEFT when adapting foundation models to medical image classification tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate the limitations of prompt introducing ways and approximation capabilities on Transformer architectures of mainstream prompt tuning methods, we propose the Embedded Prompt Tuning (EPT) method by embedding prompt tokens into the expanded channels. We also find that there are anomalies in the feature space distribution of foundation models during pre-training process, and prompt tuning can help mitigate this negative impact. To explain this phenomenon, we also introduce a novel perspective to understand prompt tuning: Prompt tuning is a distribution calibrator. And we support it by analyzing patch-wise scaling and feature separation operations contained in EPT. Our experiments show that EPT outperforms several state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods by a significant margin on few-shot medical image classification tasks, and completes the fine-tuning process within highly competitive time, indicating EPT is an effective PEFT method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaodong Sun, Xiaobai Li, Jukka Komulainen, Guoying Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method for measuring cardiac signals from facial videos, offering a convenient alternative to contact photoplethysmography (cPPG) obtained from contact sensors. Recent studies have shown that each individual possesses a unique cPPG signal morphology that can be utilized as a biometric identifier, which has inspired us to utilize the morphology of rPPG signals extracted from facial videos for person authentication. Since the facial appearance and rPPG are mixed in the facial videos, we first de-identify facial videos to remove facial appearance while preserving the rPPG information, which protects facial privacy and guarantees that only rPPG is used for authentication. The de-identified videos are fed into an rPPG model to get the rPPG signal morphology for authentication. In the first training stage, unsupervised rPPG training is performed to get coarse rPPG signals. In the second training stage, an rPPG-cPPG hybrid training is performed by incorporating external cPPG datasets to achieve rPPG biometric authentication and enhance rPPG signal morphology. Our approach needs only de-identified facial videos with subject IDs to train rPPG authentication models. The experimental results demonstrate that rPPG signal morphology hidden in facial videos can be used for biometric authentication.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Eirale, Matteo Leonetti, Marcello Chiaberge</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving social acceptance is one of the main goals of Social Robotic Navigation. Despite this topic has received increasing interest in recent years, most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent along obstacle-free trajectories, planning around estimates of future human motion to respect personal distances and optimize navigation. However, social interactions in everyday life are also dictated by norms that do not strictly depend on movement, such as when standing at the end of a queue rather than cutting it. In this paper, we propose a novel method to recognize common social scenarios and modify a traditional planner's cost function to adapt to them. This solution enables the robot to carry out different social navigation behaviors that would not arise otherwise, maintaining the robustness of traditional navigation. Our approach allows the robot to learn different social norms with a single learned model, rather than having different modules for each task. As a proof of concept, we consider the tasks of queuing and respect interaction spaces of groups of people talking to one another, but the method can be extended to other human activities that do not involve motion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Determining the chronology of ancient handwritten manuscripts is essential for reconstructing the evolution of ideas. For the Dead Sea Scrolls, this is particularly important. However, there is an almost complete lack of date-bearing manuscripts evenly distributed across the timeline and written in similar scripts available for palaeographic comparison. Here, we present Enoch, a state-of-the-art AI-based date-prediction model, trained on the basis of new radiocarbon-dated samples of the scrolls. Enoch uses established handwriting-style descriptors and applies Bayesian ridge regression. The challenge of this study is that the number of radiocarbon-dated manuscripts is small, while current machine learning requires an abundance of training data. We show that by using combined angular and allographic writing style feature vectors and applying Bayesian ridge regression, Enoch could predict the radiocarbon-based dates from style, supported by leave-one-out validation, with varied MAEs of 27.9 to 30.7 years relative to the radiocarbon dating. Enoch was then used to estimate the dates of 135 unseen manuscripts, revealing that 79 per cent of the samples were considered 'realistic' upon palaeographic post-hoc evaluation. We present a new chronology of the scrolls. The radiocarbon ranges and Enoch's style-based predictions are often older than the traditionally assumed palaeographic estimates. In the range of 300-50 BCE, Enoch's date prediction provides an improved granularity. The study is in line with current developments in multimodal machine-learning techniques, and the methods can be used for date prediction in other partially-dated manuscript collections. This research shows how Enoch's quantitative, probability-based approach can be a tool for palaeographers and historians, re-dating ancient Jewish key texts and contributing to current debates on Jewish and Christian origins.</p>

<p>Abstract: As one of the most representative DL techniques, Transformer architecture has empowered numerous advanced models, especially the large language models (LLMs) that comprise billions of parameters, becoming a cornerstone in deep learning. Despite the impressive achievements, Transformers still face inherent limitations, particularly the time-consuming inference resulting from the quadratic computation complexity of attention calculation. Recently, a novel architecture named Mamba, drawing inspiration from classical state space models (SSMs), has emerged as a promising alternative for building foundation models, delivering comparable modeling abilities to Transformers while preserving near-linear scalability concerning sequence length. This has sparked an increasing number of studies actively exploring Mamba's potential to achieve impressive performance across diverse domains. Given such rapid evolution, there is a critical need for a systematic review that consolidates existing Mamba-empowered models, offering a comprehensive understanding of this emerging model architecture. In this survey, we therefore conduct an in-depth investigation of recent Mamba-associated studies, covering three main aspects: the advancements of Mamba-based models, the techniques of adapting Mamba to diverse data, and the applications where Mamba can excel. Specifically, we first review the foundational knowledge of various representative deep learning models and the details of Mamba-1&2 as preliminaries. Then, to showcase the significance of Mamba for AI, we comprehensively review the related studies focusing on Mamba models' architecture design, data adaptability, and applications. Finally, we present a discussion of current limitations and explore various promising research directions to provide deeper insights for future investigations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Loc Vu-Quoc, Alexander Humer</p>
<p>Abstract: Several forms for constructing novel physics-informed neural-networks (PINN) for the solution of partial-differential-algebraic equations based on derivative operator splitting are proposed, using the nonlinear Kirchhoff rod as a prototype for demonstration. The open-source DeepXDE is likely the most well documented framework with many examples. Yet, we encountered some pathological problems and proposed novel methods to resolve them. Among these novel methods are the PDE forms, which evolve from the lower-level form with fewer unknown dependent variables to higher-level form with more dependent variables, in addition to those from lower-level forms. Traditionally, the highest-level form, the balance-of-momenta form, is the starting point for (hand) deriving the lowest-level form through a tedious (and error prone) process of successive substitutions. The next step in a finite element method is to discretize the lowest-level form upon forming a weak form and linearization with appropriate interpolation functions, followed by their implementation in a code and testing. The time-consuming tedium in all of these steps could be bypassed by applying the proposed novel PINN directly to the highest-level form. We developed a script based on JAX. While our JAX script did not show the pathological problems of DDE-T (DDE with TensorFlow backend), it is slower than DDE-T. That DDE-T itself being more efficient in higher-level form than in lower-level form makes working directly with higher-level form even more attractive in addition to the advantages mentioned further above. Since coming up with an appropriate learning-rate schedule for a good solution is more art than science, we systematically codified in detail our experience running optimization through a normalization/standardization of the network-training process so readers can reproduce our results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Jeanselme, Chang Ho Yoon, Fabian Falck, Brian Tom, Jessica Barrett</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying patient subgroups with different treatment responses is an important task to inform medical recommendations, guidelines, and the design of future clinical trials. Existing approaches for subgroup analysis primarily rely on Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), in which treatment assignment is randomised. RCTs' patient cohorts are often constrained by cost, rendering them not representative of the heterogeneity of patients likely to receive treatment in real-world clinical practice. When applied to observational studies, subgroup analysis approaches suffer from significant statistical biases particularly because of the non-randomisation of treatment. Our work introduces a novel, outcome-guided method for identifying treatment response subgroups in observational studies. Our approach assigns each patient to a subgroup associated with two time-to-event distributions: one under treatment and one under control regime. It hence positions itself in between individualised and average treatment effect estimation. The assumptions of our model result in a simple correction of the statistical bias from treatment non-randomisation through inverse propensity weighting. In experiments, our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art method for outcome-guided subgroup analysis in both randomised and observational treatment regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqiu Chen, Xuebin Yao, Pradeep Subedi, Cong Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that collects and processes data at or near the source of data generation. The on-device learning at edge relies on device-to-device wireless communication to facilitate real-time data sharing and collaborative decision-making among multiple devices. This significantly improves the adaptability of the edge computing system to the changing environments. However, as the scale of the edge computing system is getting larger, communication among devices is becoming the bottleneck because of the limited bandwidth of wireless communication leads to large data transfer latency. To reduce the amount of device-to-device data transmission and accelerate on-device learning, in this paper, we propose Residual-INR, a fog computing-based communication-efficient on-device learning framework by utilizing implicit neural representation (INR) to compress images/videos into neural network weights. Residual-INR enhances data transfer efficiency by collecting JPEG images from edge devices, compressing them into INR format at the fog node, and redistributing them for on-device learning. By using a smaller INR for full image encoding and a separate object INR for high-quality object region reconstruction through residual encoding, our technique can reduce the encoding redundancy while maintaining the object quality. Residual-INR is a promising solution for edge on-device learning because it reduces data transmission by up to 5.16 x across a network of 10 edge devices. It also facilitates CPU-free accelerated on-device learning, achieving up to 2.9 x speedup without sacrificing accuracy. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sharclab/Residual-INR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xubin Ren, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have become a powerful technique for learning representations from user-item interaction data in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommender systems. However, many existing methods heavily rely on unique user and item IDs, which limits their ability to perform well in practical zero-shot learning scenarios where sufficient training data may be unavailable. Inspired by the success of language models (LMs) and their strong generalization capabilities, a crucial question arises: How can we harness the potential of language models to empower recommender systems and elevate its generalization capabilities to new heights? In this study, we propose EasyRec - an effective and easy-to-use approach that seamlessly integrates text-based semantic understanding with collaborative signals. EasyRec employs a text-behavior alignment framework, which combines contrastive learning with collaborative language model tuning, to ensure a strong alignment between the text-enhanced semantic space and the collaborative behavior information. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of EasyRec compared to state-of-the-art alternative models, particularly in the challenging text-based zero-shot recommendation scenarios. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of seamlessly integrating EasyRec as a plug-and-play component into text-enhanced collaborative filtering frameworks, thereby empowering existing recommender systems to elevate their recommendation performance and adapt to the evolving user preferences in dynamic environments. For better result reproducibility of our EasyRec framework, the model implementation details, source code, and datasets are available at the link: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyRec.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we improved the analysis of the running time of SparseGPT [Frantar, Alistarh ICML 2023] from $O(d^{3})$ to $O(d^{\omega} + d^{2+a+o(1)} + d^{1+\omega(1,1,a)-a})$ for any $a \in [0, 1]$, where $\omega$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. In particular, for the current $\omega \approx 2.371$ [Alman, Duan, Williams, Xu, Xu, Zhou 2024], our running time boils down to $O(d^{2.53})$. This running time is due to the analysis of the lazy update behavior in iterative maintenance problems such as [Deng, Song, Weinstein 2022; Brand, Song, Zhou ICML 2024].</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucheng Jiang, Yijia Shao, Dekun Ma, Sina J. Semnani, Monica S. Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: While language model (LM)-powered chatbots and generative search engines excel at answering concrete queries, discovering information in the terrain of unknown unknowns remains challenging for users. To emulate the common educational scenario where children/students learn by listening to and participating in conversations of their parents/teachers, we create Collaborative STORM (Co-STORM). Unlike QA systems that require users to ask all the questions, Co-STORM lets users observe and occasionally steer the discourse among several LM agents. The agents ask questions on the user's behalf, allowing the user to discover unknown unknowns serendipitously. To facilitate user interaction, Co-STORM assists users in tracking the discourse by organizing the uncovered information into a dynamic mind map, ultimately generating a comprehensive report as takeaways. For automatic evaluation, we construct the WildSeek dataset by collecting real information-seeking records with user goals. Co-STORM outperforms baseline methods on both discourse trace and report quality. In a further human evaluation, 70% of participants prefer Co-STORM over a search engine, and 78% favor it over a RAG chatbot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naser Kazemi, Nedko Savov, Danda Paudel, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: World models are increasingly pivotal in interpreting and simulating the rules and actions of complex environments. Genie, a recent model, excels at learning from visually diverse environments but relies on costly human-collected data. We observe that their alternative method of using random agents is too limited to explore the environment. We propose to improve the model by employing reinforcement learning based agents for data generation. This approach produces diverse datasets that enhance the model's ability to adapt and perform well across various scenarios and realistic actions within the environment. In this paper, we first release the model GenieRedux - an implementation based on Genie. Additionally, we introduce GenieRedux-G, a variant that uses the agent's readily available actions to factor out action prediction uncertainty during validation. Our evaluation, including a replication of the Coinrun case study, shows that GenieRedux-G achieves superior visual fidelity and controllability using the trained agent exploration. The proposed approach is reproducable, scalable and adaptable to new types of environments. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/insait-institute/GenieRedux .</p>

<p>Abstract: Given recent advances in generative AI technology, a key question is how large language models (LLMs) can enhance acoustic modeling tasks using text decoding results from a frozen, pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. To explore new capabilities in language modeling for speech processing, we introduce the generative speech transcription error correction (GenSEC) challenge. This challenge comprises three post-ASR language modeling tasks: (i) post-ASR transcription correction, (ii) speaker tagging, and (iii) emotion recognition. These tasks aim to emulate future LLM-based agents handling voice-based interfaces while remaining accessible to a broad audience by utilizing open pretrained language models or agent-based APIs. We also discuss insights from baseline evaluations, as well as lessons learned for designing future evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raja Kumar, Raghav Singhal, Pranamya Kulkarni, Deval Mehta, Kshitij Jadhav</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep multimodal learning has shown remarkable success by leveraging contrastive learning to capture explicit one-to-one relations across modalities. However, real-world data often exhibits shared relations beyond simple pairwise associations. We propose M3CoL, a Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning approach to capture nuanced shared relations inherent in multimodal data. Our key contribution is a Mixup-based contrastive loss that learns robust representations by aligning mixed samples from one modality with their corresponding samples from other modalities thereby capturing shared relations between them. For multimodal classification tasks, we introduce a framework that integrates a fusion module with unimodal prediction modules for auxiliary supervision during training, complemented by our proposed Mixup-based contrastive loss. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (N24News, ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food-101), we demonstrate that M3CoL effectively captures shared multimodal relations and generalizes across domains. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on N24News, ROSMAP, and BRCA, while achieving comparable performance on Food-101. Our work highlights the significance of learning shared relations for robust multimodal learning, opening up promising avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaobo Ma, Chao Fang, Haikuo Shao, Zhongfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied but face challenges in efficient inference. While quantization methods reduce computational demands, ultra-low bit quantization with arbitrary precision is hindered by limited GPU Tensor Core support and inefficient memory management, leading to suboptimal acceleration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs. At its core, we introduce a novel bipolar-INT data format that facilitates parallel computing and supports symmetric quantization, effectively reducing data redundancy. Building on this, we implement an arbitrary precision matrix multiplication scheme that decomposes and recovers matrices at the bit level, enabling flexible precision while maximizing GPU Tensor Core utilization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient matrix preprocessing method that optimizes data layout for subsequent computations. Finally, we design a data recovery-oriented memory management system that strategically utilizes fast shared memory, significantly enhancing kernel execution speed and minimizing memory access latency. Experimental results demonstrate our approach's effectiveness, with up to 2.4\times speedup in matrix multiplication compared to NVIDIA's CUTLASS. When integrated into LLMs, we achieve up to 6.7\times inference acceleration. These improvements significantly enhance LLM inference efficiency, enabling broader and more responsive applications of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Liu, Jiaxiang Ren, Ruoming Jin, Zijie Zhang, Yang Zhou, Patrick Valduriez, Dejing Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: As a promising paradigm to collaboratively train models with decentralized data, Federated Learning (FL) can be exploited to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs correspond to huge size, the scale of the training data significantly increases, which leads to tremendous amounts of computation and communication costs. The training data is generally non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID), which requires adaptive data processing within each device. Although Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can significantly reduce the scale of parameters to update in the fine-tuning process, it still takes unaffordable time to transfer the low-rank parameters of all the layers in LLMs. In this paper, we propose a Fisher Information-based Efficient Curriculum Federated Learning framework (FibecFed) with two novel methods, i.e., adaptive federated curriculum learning and efficient sparse parameter update. First, we propose a fisher information-based method to adaptively sample data within each device to improve the effectiveness of the FL fine-tuning process. Second, we dynamically select the proper layers for global aggregation and sparse parameters for local update with LoRA so as to improve the efficiency of the FL fine-tuning process. Extensive experimental results based on 10 datasets demonstrate that FibecFed yields excellent performance (up to 45.35% in terms of accuracy) and superb fine-tuning speed (up to 98.61% faster) compared with 17 baseline approaches).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John X. Morris, Alexander M. Rush</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense document embeddings are central to neural retrieval. The dominant paradigm is to train and construct embeddings by running encoders directly on individual documents. In this work, we argue that these embeddings, while effective, are implicitly out-of-context for targeted use cases of retrieval, and that a contextualized document embedding should take into account both the document and neighboring documents in context - analogous to contextualized word embeddings. We propose two complementary methods for contextualized document embeddings: first, an alternative contrastive learning objective that explicitly incorporates the document neighbors into the intra-batch contextual loss; second, a new contextual architecture that explicitly encodes neighbor document information into the encoded representation. Results show that both methods achieve better performance than biencoders in several settings, with differences especially pronounced out-of-domain. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the MTEB benchmark with no hard negative mining, score distillation, dataset-specific instructions, intra-GPU example-sharing, or extremely large batch sizes. Our method can be applied to improve performance on any contrastive learning dataset and any biencoder.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03558">Not All Diffusion Model Activations Have Been Evaluated as Discriminative Features</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Benyuan Meng, Qianqian Xu, Zitai Wang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are initially designed for image generation. Recent research shows that the internal signals within their backbones, named activations, can also serve as dense features for various discriminative tasks such as semantic segmentation. Given numerous activations, selecting a small yet effective subset poses a fundamental problem. To this end, the early study of this field performs a large-scale quantitative comparison of the discriminative ability of the activations. However, we find that many potential activations have not been evaluated, such as the queries and keys used to compute attention scores. Moreover, recent advancements in diffusion architectures bring many new activations, such as those within embedded ViT modules. Both combined, activation selection remains unresolved but overlooked. To tackle this issue, this paper takes a further step with a much broader range of activations evaluated. Considering the significant increase in activations, a full-scale quantitative comparison is no longer operational. Instead, we seek to understand the properties of these activations, such that the activations that are clearly inferior can be filtered out in advance via simple qualitative evaluation. After careful analysis, we discover three properties universal among diffusion models, enabling this study to go beyond specific models. On top of this, we present effective feature selection solutions for several popular diffusion models. Finally, the experiments across multiple discriminative tasks validate the superiority of our method over the SOTA competitors.

Using only egocentric SLAM poses and images, EgoAllo guides sampling from a conditional diffusion model to estimate 3D body pose, height, and hand parameters that capture the wearer's actions in the allocentric coordinate frame of the scene. To achieve this, our key insight is in representation: we propose spatial and temporal invariance criteria for improving model performance, from which we derive a head motion conditioning parameterization that improves estimation by up to 18%. We also show how the bodies estimated by our system can improve the hands: the resulting kinematic and temporal constraints result in over 40% lower hand estimation errors compared to noisy monocular estimates.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Yu, Xian Wu, Hao Liu, Wenbo Guo, Xinyu Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose BlockFound, a customized foundation model for anomaly blockchain transaction detection. Unlike existing methods that rely on rule-based systems or directly apply off-the-shelf large language models, BlockFound introduces a series of customized designs to model the unique data structure of blockchain transactions. First, a blockchain transaction is multi-modal, containing blockchain-specific tokens, texts, and numbers. We design a modularized tokenizer to handle these multi-modal inputs, balancing the information across different modalities. Second, we design a customized mask language learning mechanism for pretraining with RoPE embedding and FlashAttention for handling longer sequences. After training the foundation model, we further design a novel detection method for anomaly detection. Extensive evaluations on Ethereum and Solana transactions demonstrate BlockFound's exceptional capability in anomaly detection while maintaining a low false positive rate. Remarkably, BlockFound is the only method that successfully detects anomalous transactions on Solana with high accuracy, whereas all other approaches achieved very low or zero detection recall scores. This work not only provides new foundation models for blockchain but also sets a new benchmark for applying LLMs in blockchain data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Zhang, Justin Wang, Francois Charton</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and accurately following instructions is critical for large language models (LLMs) to be effective across diverse tasks. In this work, we rigorously examine the key factors that enable models to generalize to unseen instructions, providing insights to guide the collection of data for instruction-tuning. Through controlled experiments, inspired by the Turing-complete Markov algorithm, we demonstrate that such generalization $\textbf{only emerges}$ when training data is diversified enough across semantic domains. Our findings also reveal that merely diversifying within limited domains fails to ensure robust generalization. In contrast, cross-domain data diversification, even under constrained data budgets, significantly enhances a model's adaptability. We further extend our analysis to real-world scenarios, including fine-tuning of $\textit{$\textbf{specialist}$}$ and $\textit{$\textbf{generalist}$}$ models. In both cases, we demonstrate that 1) better performance can be achieved by increasing the diversity of an established dataset while keeping the data size constant, and 2) when scaling up the data, diversifying the semantics of instructions is more effective than simply increasing the quantity of similar data. Our research provides important insights for dataset collation, particularly when optimizing model performance by expanding training data for both specialist and generalist scenarios. We show that careful consideration of data diversification is key: training specialist models with data extending beyond their core domain leads to significant performance improvements, while generalist models benefit from diverse data mixtures that enhance their overall instruction-following capabilities across a wide range of applications. Our results highlight the critical role of strategic diversification and offer clear guidelines for improving data quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adarsh Kumarappan, Mo Tiwari, Peiyang Song, Robert Joseph George, Chaowei Xiao, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful in mathematical reasoning tasks such as formal theorem proving when integrated with interactive proof assistants like Lean. Existing approaches involve training or fine-tuning an LLM on a specific dataset to perform well on particular domains, such as undergraduate-level mathematics. These methods struggle with generalizability to advanced mathematics. A fundamental limitation is that these approaches operate on static domains, failing to capture how mathematicians often work across multiple domains and projects simultaneously or cyclically. We present LeanAgent, a novel lifelong learning framework for theorem proving that continuously generalizes to and improves on ever-expanding mathematical knowledge without forgetting previously learned knowledge. LeanAgent introduces several key innovations, including a curriculum learning strategy that optimizes the learning trajectory in terms of mathematical difficulty, a dynamic database for efficient management of evolving mathematical knowledge, and progressive training to balance stability and plasticity. LeanAgent successfully proves 162 theorems previously unproved by humans across 23 diverse Lean repositories, many from advanced mathematics. It performs significantly better than the static LLM baseline, proving challenging theorems in domains like abstract algebra and algebraic topology while showcasing a clear progression of learning from basic concepts to advanced topics. In addition, we analyze LeanAgent's superior performance on key lifelong learning metrics. LeanAgent achieves exceptional scores in stability and backward transfer, where learning new tasks improves performance on previously learned tasks. This emphasizes LeanAgent's continuous generalizability and improvement, explaining its superior theorem-proving performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoran Zhang, Yongxiang Li, Zijian Kan, Keyuan Cheng, Lijie Hu, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The locate-then-edit paradigm has shown significant promise for knowledge editing (KE) in Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous methods perform well on single-hop fact recall tasks, they consistently struggle with multi-hop factual recall tasks involving newly edited knowledge. In this paper, leveraging tools in mechanistic interpretability, we first identify that in multi-hop tasks, LLMs tend to retrieve implicit subject knowledge from deeper MLP layers, unlike single-hop tasks, which rely on earlier layers. This distinction explains the poor performance of current methods in multi-hop queries, as they primarily focus on editing shallow layers, leaving deeper layers unchanged. To address this, we propose IFMET, a novel locate-then-edit KE approach designed to edit both shallow and deep MLP layers. IFMET employs multi-hop editing prompts and supplementary sets to locate and modify knowledge across different reasoning stages. Experimental results demonstrate that IFMET significantly improves performance on multi-hop factual recall tasks, effectively overcoming the limitations of previous locate-then-edit methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benyuan Meng, Qianqian Xu, Zitai Wang, Zhiyong Yang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models, and this capability can also be applied to discrimination. The inner activations of a pre-trained diffusion model can serve as features for discriminative tasks, namely, diffusion feature. We discover that diffusion feature has been hindered by a hidden yet universal phenomenon that we call content shift. To be specific, there are content differences between features and the input image, such as the exact shape of a certain object. We locate the cause of content shift as one inherent characteristic of diffusion models, which suggests the broad existence of this phenomenon in diffusion feature. Further empirical study also indicates that its negative impact is not negligible even when content shift is not visually perceivable. Hence, we propose to suppress content shift to enhance the overall quality of diffusion features. Specifically, content shift is related to the information drift during the process of recovering an image from the noisy input, pointing out the possibility of turning off-the-shelf generation techniques into tools for content shift suppression. We further propose a practical guideline named GATE to efficiently evaluate the potential benefit of a technique and provide an implementation of our methodology. Despite the simplicity, the proposed approach has achieved superior results on various tasks and datasets, validating its potential as a generic booster for diffusion features.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joost de Winter, Dimitra Dodou, Yke Bauke Eisma</p>
<p>Abstract: The processes underlying human cognition are often divided into System 1, which involves fast, intuitive thinking, and System 2, which involves slow, deliberate reasoning. Previously, large language models were criticized for lacking the deeper, more analytical capabilities of System 2. In September 2024, OpenAI introduced the o1 model series, designed to handle System 2-like reasoning. While OpenAI's benchmarks are promising, independent validation is still needed. In this study, we tested the o1-preview model twice on the Dutch 'Mathematics B' final exam. It scored a near-perfect 76 and 74 out of 76 points. For context, only 24 out of 16,414 students in the Netherlands achieved a perfect score. By comparison, the GPT-4o model scored 66 and 62 out of 76, well above the Dutch average of 40.63 points. Neither model had access to the exam figures. Since there was a risk of model contamination (i.e., the knowledge cutoff of o1-preview and GPT-4o was after the exam was published online), we repeated the procedure with a new Mathematics B exam that was published after the cutoff date. The results again indicated that o1-preview performed strongly (97.8th percentile), which suggests that contamination was not a factor. We also show that there is some variability in the output of o1-preview, which means that sometimes there is 'luck' (the answer is correct) or 'bad luck' (the output has diverged into something that is incorrect). We demonstrate that a self-consistency approach, where repeated prompts are given and the most common answer is selected, is a useful strategy for identifying the correct answer. It is concluded that while OpenAI's new model series holds great potential, certain risks must be considered.</p>

<p>Abstract: The detection of bias in natural language processing (NLP) is a critical challenge, particularly with the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in various domains. This paper introduces GUS-Net, an innovative approach to bias detection that focuses on three key types of biases: (G)eneralizations, (U)nfairness, and (S)tereotypes. GUS-Net leverages generative AI and automated agents to create a comprehensive synthetic dataset, enabling robust multi-label token classification. Our methodology enhances traditional bias detection methods by incorporating the contextual encodings of pre-trained models, resulting in improved accuracy and depth in identifying biased entities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that GUS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving superior performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and Hamming Loss. The findings highlight GUS-Net's effectiveness in capturing a wide range of biases across diverse contexts, making it a valuable tool for social bias detection in text.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devdhar Patel, Hava Siegelmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is rapidly reaching and surpassing human-level control capabilities. However, state-of-the-art RL algorithms often require timesteps and reaction times significantly faster than human capabilities, which is impractical in real-world settings and typically necessitates specialized hardware. Such speeds are difficult to achieve in the real world and often requires specialized hardware. We introduce Sequence Reinforcement Learning (SRL), an RL algorithm designed to produce a sequence of actions for a given input state, enabling effective control at lower decision frequencies. SRL addresses the challenges of learning action sequences by employing both a model and an actor-critic architecture operating at different temporal scales. We propose a "temporal recall" mechanism, where the critic uses the model to estimate intermediate states between primitive actions, providing a learning signal for each individual action within the sequence. Once training is complete, the actor can generate action sequences independently of the model, achieving model-free control at a slower frequency. We evaluate SRL on a suite of continuous control tasks, demonstrating that it achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms while significantly reducing actor sample complexity. To better assess performance across varying decision frequencies, we introduce the Frequency-Averaged Score (FAS) metric. Our results show that SRL significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in terms of FAS, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring variable decision frequencies. Additionally, we compare SRL with model-based online planning, showing that SRL achieves superior FAS while leveraging the same model during training that online planners use for planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peifan Jiang, Xuben Wang, Shuang Wang, Fei Deng, Kunpeng Wang, Bin Wang, Yuhan Yang, Islam Fadel</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetotelluric deep learning (DL) inversion methods based on joint data-driven and physics-driven have become a hot topic in recent years. When mapping observation data (or forward modeling data) to the resistivity model using neural networks (NNs), incorporating the error (loss) term of the inversion resistivity's forward modeling response--which introduces physical information about electromagnetic field propagation--can significantly enhance the inversion accuracy. To efficiently achieve data-physical dual-driven MT deep learning inversion for large-scale 3-D MT data, we propose using DL forward modeling networks to compute this portion of the loss. This approach introduces pseudo-physical information through the forward modeling of NN simulation, further guiding the inversion network fitting. Specifically, we first pre-train the forward modeling networks as fixed forward modeling operators, then transfer and integrate them into the inversion network training, and finally optimize the inversion network by minimizing the multinomial loss. Theoretical experimental results indicate that despite some simulation errors in DL forward modeling, the introduced pseudo-physical information still enhances inversion accuracy and significantly mitigates the overfitting problem during training. Additionally, we propose a new input mode that involves masking and adding noise to the data, simulating the field data environment of 3-D MT inversion, thereby making the method more flexible and effective for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyuan Wang, Victor Shea-Jay Huang, Renmiao Chen, Hao Wang, Chengwei Pan, Lei Sha, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various tasks, they encounter potential security risks such as jailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to bypass security measures and generate harmful outputs. Existing jailbreak strategies mainly focus on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), frequently neglecting other critical factors, including the relevance of the jailbreak response to the query and the level of stealthiness. This narrow focus on single objectives can result in ineffective attacks that either lack contextual relevance or are easily recognizable. In this work, we introduce BlackDAN, an innovative black-box attack framework with multi-objective optimization, aiming to generate high-quality prompts that effectively facilitate jailbreaking while maintaining contextual relevance and minimizing detectability. BlackDAN leverages Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs), specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, to optimize jailbreaks across multiple objectives including ASR, stealthiness, and semantic relevance. By integrating mechanisms like mutation, crossover, and Pareto-dominance, BlackDAN provides a transparent and interpretable process for generating jailbreaks. Furthermore, the framework allows customization based on user preferences, enabling the selection of prompts that balance harmfulness, relevance, and other factors. Experimental results demonstrate that BlackDAN outperforms traditional single-objective methods, yielding higher success rates and improved robustness across various LLMs and multimodal LLMs, while ensuring jailbreak responses are both relevant and less detectable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Morris Yau, Ekin Aky\"urek, Jiayuan Mao, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Stefanie Jegelka, Jacob Andreas</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous research has explored the computational expressivity of Transformer models in simulating Boolean circuits or Turing machines. However, the learnability of these simulators from observational data has remained an open question. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that linear attention may be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. As a consequence, the problem of learning any linear transformer may be converted into the problem of learning an ordinary linear predictor in an expanded feature space, and any such predictor may be converted back into a multiheaded linear transformer. Moving to generalization, we show how to efficiently identify training datasets for which every empirical risk minimizer is equivalent (up to trivial symmetries) to the linear Transformer that generated the data, thereby guaranteeing the learned model will correctly generalize across all inputs. Finally, we provide examples of computations expressible via linear attention and therefore polynomial-time learnable, including associative memories, finite automata, and a class of Universal Turing Machine (UTMs) with polynomially bounded computation histories. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on three tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata. Our findings bridge a critical gap between theoretical expressivity and learnability of Transformers, and show that flexible and general models of computation are efficiently learnable.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Autonomous Weapon Systems (AWS) into military operations presents both significant opportunities and challenges. This paper explores the multifaceted nature of trust in AWS, emphasising the necessity of establishing reliable and transparent systems to mitigate risks associated with bias, operational failures, and accountability. Despite advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the trustworthiness of these systems, especially in high-stakes military applications, remains a critical issue. Through a systematic review of existing literature, this research identifies gaps in the understanding of trust dynamics during the development and deployment phases of AWS. It advocates for a collaborative approach that includes technologists, ethicists, and military strategists to address these ongoing challenges. The findings underscore the importance of Human-Machine teaming and enhancing system intelligibility to ensure accountability and adherence to International Humanitarian Law. Ultimately, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on the ethical implications of AWS and the imperative for trustworthy AI in defense contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangru Zhu, Penglei Sun, Yaoxian Song, Yanghua Xiao, Zhixu Li, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Bei Yang, Xiaoxiao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate interpretation and visualization of human instructions are crucial for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, current models struggle to capture semantic variations from word order changes, and existing evaluations, relying on indirect metrics like text-image similarity, fail to reliably assess these challenges. This often obscures poor performance on complex or uncommon linguistic patterns by the focus on frequent word combinations. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel metric called SemVarEffect and a benchmark named SemVarBench, designed to evaluate the causality between semantic variations in inputs and outputs in T2I synthesis. Semantic variations are achieved through two types of linguistic permutations, while avoiding easily predictable literal variations. Experiments reveal that the CogView-3-Plus and Ideogram 2 performed the best, achieving a score of 0.2/1. Semantic variations in object relations are less understood than attributes, scoring 0.07/1 compared to 0.17-0.19/1. We found that cross-modal alignment in UNet or Transformers plays a crucial role in handling semantic variations, a factor previously overlooked by a focus on textual encoders. Our work establishes an effective evaluation framework that advances the T2I synthesis community's exploration of human instruction understanding. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/zhuxiangru/SemVarBench .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Zeng, Yingyu Shan, Zeming Liu, Jiashu Yao, Yuhang Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) embed extensive knowledge and utilize it to perform exceptionally well across various tasks. Nevertheless, outdated knowledge or factual errors within LLMs can lead to misleading or incorrect responses, causing significant issues in practical applications. To rectify the fatal flaw without the necessity for costly model retraining, various model editing approaches have been proposed to correct inaccurate knowledge within LLMs in a cost-efficient way. To evaluate these model editing methods, previous work introduced a series of datasets. However, most of the previous datasets only contain fabricated data in a single format, which diverges from real-world model editing scenarios, raising doubts about their usability in practice. To facilitate the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the challenge of practicality. To resolve such challenges and effectively enhance the capabilities of LLMs, we present FAME, an factual, comprehensive, and multi-task dataset, which is designed to enhance the practicality of model editing. We then propose SKEME, a model editing method that uses a novel caching mechanism to ensure synchronization with the real world. The experiments demonstrate that SKEME performs excellently across various tasks and scenarios, confirming its practicality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyan Shi, Sander Land, Acyr Locatelli, Matthieu Geist, Max Bartolo</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) and Identity Preference Optimisation (IPO), have emerged as alternatives to online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) for aligning language models to human preferences, without the need for explicit reward modelling. These methods generally aim to increase the likelihood of generating better (preferred) completions while discouraging worse (non-preferred) ones, while staying close to the original model's behaviour. In this work, we explore the relationship between completion likelihood and model performance in state-of-the-art DAAs, and identify a critical issue of likelihood over-optimisation. Contrary to expectations, we find that higher likelihood of better completions and larger margins between better and worse completion likelihoods do not necessarily lead to better performance, and may even degrade it. Our analysis reveals that while higher likelihood correlates with better memorisation of factual knowledge patterns, a slightly lower completion likelihood tends to improve output diversity, thus leading to better generalisation to unseen scenarios. Moreover, we identify two key indicators that signal when over-optimised output diversity begins to harm performance: Decreasing Entropy over Top-k Tokens and Diminishing Top-k Probability Mass. Our experimental results validate that these indicators are reliable signs of declining performance under different regularisations, helping prevent over-optimisation and improve alignment with human preferences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open domain question answering systems frequently rely on information retrieved from large collections of text (such as the Web) to answer questions. However, such collections of text often contain conflicting information, and indiscriminately depending on this information may result in untruthful and inaccurate answers. To understand the gravity of this problem, we collect a human-annotated dataset, Question Answering with Conflicting Contexts (QACC), and find that as much as 25% of unambiguous, open domain questions can lead to conflicting contexts when retrieved using Google Search. We evaluate and benchmark three powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with our dataset QACC and demonstrate their limitations in effectively addressing questions with conflicting information. To explore how humans reason through conflicting contexts, we request our annotators to provide explanations for their selections of correct answers. We demonstrate that by finetuning LLMs to explain their answers, we can introduce richer information into their training that guide them through the process of reasoning with conflicting contexts.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12841">UniAutoML: A Human-Centered Framework for Unified Discriminative and Generative AutoML with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Guo, Zan Chen, Yingrui Ji, Liyun Zhang, Daqin Luo, Zhigang Li, Yiqin Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has simplified complex ML processes such as data pre-processing, model selection, and hyper-parameter searching. However, traditional AutoML frameworks focus solely on discriminative tasks, often falling short in tackling AutoML for generative models. Additionally, these frameworks lack interpretability and user engagement during the training process, primarily due to the absence of human-centered design. It leads to a lack of transparency in final decision-making and limited user control, potentially reducing trust and adoption of AutoML methods. To address these limitations, we introduce UniAutoML, a human-centered AutoML framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to unify AutoML for both discriminative (e.g., Transformers and CNNs for classification or regression tasks) and generative tasks (e.g., fine-tuning diffusion models or LLMs). The human-centered design of UniAutoML innovatively features a conversational user interface (CUI) that facilitates natural language interactions, providing users with real-time guidance, feedback, and progress updates for better interpretability. This design enhances transparency and user control throughout the AutoML training process, allowing users to seamlessly break down or modify the model being trained. To mitigate potential risks associated with LLM generated content, UniAutoML incorporates a safety guardline that filters inputs and censors outputs. We evaluated UniAutoML's performance and usability through experiments on eight diverse datasets and user studies involving 25 participants, demonstrating that UniAutoML not only enhances performance but also improves user control and trust. Our human-centered design bridges the gap between AutoML capabilities and user understanding, making ML more accessible to a broader audience.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompt Tuning has been a popular Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning method attributed to its remarkable performance with few updated parameters on various large-scale pretrained Language Models (PLMs). Traditionally, each prompt has been considered indivisible and updated independently, leading the parameters increase proportionally as prompt length grows. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Codebook for Composite and Efficient Prompt Tuning (ACCEPT). In our method, we refer to the concept of product quantization (PQ), allowing all soft prompts to share a set of learnable codebook vectors in each subspace, with each prompt differentiated by a set of adaptive weights. We achieve the superior performance on 17 diverse natural language tasks including natural language understanding (NLU) and question answering (QA) tasks by tuning only 0.3% of parameters of the PLMs. Our approach also excels in few-shot and large model settings, highlighting its significant potential.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in enhancing LLM safety against jailbreak attacks, evaluating LLM defenses remains a challenge, with current methods often lacking explainability and generalization to complex scenarios, leading to incomplete assessments (e.g., direct judgment without reasoning, low F1 score of GPT-4 in complex cases, bias in multilingual scenarios). To address this, we present JAILJUDGE, a comprehensive benchmark featuring diverse risk scenarios, including synthetic, adversarial, in-the-wild, and multilingual prompts, along with high-quality human-annotated datasets. The JAILJUDGE dataset includes over 35k+ instruction-tune data with reasoning explainability and JAILJUDGETEST, a 4.5k+ labeled set for risk scenarios, and a 6k+ multilingual set across ten languages. To enhance evaluation with explicit reasoning, we propose the JailJudge MultiAgent framework, which enables explainable, fine-grained scoring (1 to 10). This framework supports the construction of instruction-tuning ground truth and facilitates the development of JAILJUDGE Guard, an end-to-end judge model that provides reasoning and eliminates API costs. Additionally, we introduce JailBoost, an attacker-agnostic attack enhancer, and GuardShield, a moderation defense, both leveraging JAILJUDGE Guard. Our experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of JailJudge methods (JailJudge MultiAgent, JAILJUDGE Guard) across diverse models (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-Guard) and zero-shot scenarios. JailBoost and GuardShield significantly improve jailbreak attack and defense tasks under zero-shot settings, with JailBoost enhancing performance by 29.24% and GuardShield reducing defense ASR from 40.46% to 0.15%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prior methods propose to offset the escalating costs of modern foundation models by dropping specific parts of their contexts with hand-designed rules, while attempting to preserve their original performance. We overcome this trade-off with Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs), introducing a learned network for memory management that improves both the performance and efficiency of transformers. We evolve NAMMs atop pre-trained transformers to provide different latent contexts focusing on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads. NAMMs are universally applicable to any model using self-attention as they condition exclusively on the values in the produced attention matrices. Learning NAMMs on a small set of problems, we achieve substantial performance improvements across multiple long-context benchmarks while cutting the model's input contexts up to a fraction of the original sizes. We show the generality of our conditioning enables zero-shot transfer of NAMMs trained only on language to entirely new transformer architectures even across input modalities, with their benefits carrying over to vision and reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic question generation (QG) is essential for AI and NLP, particularly in intelligent tutoring, dialogue systems, and fact verification. Generating multiple-choice questions (MCQG) for professional exams, like the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), is particularly challenging, requiring domain expertise and complex multi-hop reasoning for high-quality questions. However, current large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 struggle with professional MCQG due to outdated knowledge, hallucination issues, and prompt sensitivity, resulting in unsatisfactory quality and difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose MCQG-SRefine, an LLM self-refine-based (Critique and Correction) framework for converting medical cases into high-quality USMLE-style questions. By integrating expert-driven prompt engineering with iterative self-critique and self-correction feedback, MCQG-SRefine significantly enhances human expert satisfaction regarding both the quality and difficulty of the questions. Furthermore, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge-based automatic metric to replace the complex and costly expert evaluation process, ensuring reliable and expert-aligned assessments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) drives research to align its performance with full fine-tuning. However, significant challenges remain: (1) Simply increasing the rank size of LoRA does not effectively capture high-rank information, which leads to a performance bottleneck.(2) MoE-style LoRA methods substantially increase parameters and inference latency, contradicting the goals of efficient fine-tuning and ease of application. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of Ranks (MoR), which learns rank-specific information for different tasks based on input and efficiently integrates multi-rank information. We firstly propose a new framework that equates the integration of multiple LoRAs to expanding the rank of LoRA. Moreover, we hypothesize that low-rank LoRA already captures sufficient intrinsic information, and MoR can derive high-rank information through mathematical transformations of the low-rank components. Thus, MoR can reduces the learning difficulty of LoRA and enhances its multi-task capabilities. MoR achieves impressive results, with MoR delivering a 1.31\% performance improvement while using only 93.93\% of the parameters compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Liang, Shweta Bhardwaj, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep neural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Talking head generation intends to produce vivid and realistic talking head videos from a single portrait and speech audio clip. Although significant progress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all methods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context utilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower generation speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (Dynamic frame Avatar With Non-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once generation of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two main components: (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the latent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid videos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements. Additionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation capabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These results highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the field of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks further exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Hanbo-Cheng/DAWN-pytorch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayeol Lee, Jorge Ant\'onio, Hisham Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses privacy protection in decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) using Confidential Computing (CC) within the Atoma Network, a decentralized AI platform designed for the Web3 domain. Decentralized AI distributes AI services among multiple entities without centralized oversight, fostering transparency and robustness. However, this structure introduces significant privacy challenges, as sensitive assets such as proprietary models and personal data may be exposed to untrusted participants. Cryptography-based privacy protection techniques such as zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) suffers prohibitive computational overhead. To address the limitation, we propose leveraging Confidential Computing (CC). Confidential Computing leverages hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide isolation for processing sensitive data, ensuring that both model parameters and user data remain secure, even in decentralized, potentially untrusted environments. While TEEs face a few limitations, we believe they can bridge the privacy gap in decentralized AI. We explore how we can integrate TEEs into Atoma's decentralized framework.</p>
