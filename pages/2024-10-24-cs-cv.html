<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqing Wang, Yun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven video portrait synthesis is a crucial and useful technology in virtual human interaction and film-making applications. Recent advancements have focused on improving the image fidelity and lip-synchronization. However, generating accurate emotional expressions is an important aspect of realistic talking-head generation, which has remained underexplored in previous works. We present a novel system in this paper for synthesizing high-fidelity, audio-driven video portraits with accurate emotional expressions. Specifically, we utilize a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based audio-to-motion module to generate facial landmarks. These landmarks are concatenated with emotional embeddings to produce emotional landmarks through our motion-to-emotion module. These emotional landmarks are then used to render realistic emotional talking-head video using a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based emotion-to-video module. Additionally, we propose a pose sampling method that generates natural idle-state (non-speaking) videos in response to silent audio inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method obtains more accurate emotion generation with higher fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthis Manthe (LIRIS, CREATIS), Stefan Duffner (LIRIS), Carole Lartizien (MYRIAD)</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, federated learning has raised increasing interest in the medical image analysis field due to its ability to aggregate multi-center data with privacy-preserving properties. A large amount of federated training schemes have been published, which we categorize into global (one final model), personalized (one model per institution) or hybrid (one model per cluster of institutions) methods. However, their applicability on the recently published Federated Brain Tumor Segmentation 2022 dataset has not been explored yet. We propose an extensive benchmark of federated learning algorithms from all three classes on this task. While standard FedAvg already performs very well, we show that some methods from each category can bring a slight performance improvement and potentially limit the final model(s) bias toward the predominant data distribution of the federation. Moreover, we provide a deeper understanding of the behaviour of federated learning on this task through alternative ways of distributing the pooled dataset among institutions, namely an Independent and Identical Distributed (IID) setup, and a limited data setup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongjun Jeong, Gi-Cheon Kang, Joochan Kim, Byoung-Tak Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Collision Mitigation (VLN-CM), which takes these considerations. VLN-CM is composed of four modules and predicts the direction and distance of the next movement at each step. We utilize large foundation models for each modules. To select the direction, we use the Attention Spot Predictor (ASP), View Selector (VS), and Progress Monitor (PM). The ASP employs a Large Language Model (e.g. ChatGPT) to split navigation instructions into attention spots, which are objects or scenes at the location to move to (e.g. a yellow door). The VS selects from panorama images provided at 30-degree intervals the one that includes the attention spot, using CLIP similarity. We then choose the angle of the selected image as the direction to move in. The PM uses a rule-based approach to decide which attention spot to focus on next, among multiple spots derived from the instructions. If the similarity between the current attention spot and the visual observations decreases consecutively at each step, the PM determines that the agent has passed the current spot and moves on to the next one. For selecting the distance to move, we employed the Open Map Predictor (OMP). The OMP uses panorama depth information to predict an occupancy mask. We then selected a collision-free distance in the predicted direction based on the occupancy mask. We evaluated our method using the validation data of VLN-CE. Our approach showed better performance than several baseline methods, and the OPM was effective in mitigating collisions for the agent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sendey Vera, Luis Chuquimarca, Wilson Galdea, Bremnen V\'eliz, Carlos Salda\~na</p>
<p>Abstract: This scientific article presents the implementation of an automated control system for detecting and classifying faults in tuna metal cans using artificial vision. The system utilizes a conveyor belt and a camera for visual recognition triggered by a photoelectric sensor. A robotic arm classifies the metal cans according to their condition. Industry 4.0 integration is achieved through an IoT system using Mosquitto, Node-RED, InfluxDB, and Grafana. The YOLOv5 model is employed to detect faults in the metal can lids and the positioning of the easy-open ring. Training with GPU on Google Colab enables OCR text detection on the labels. The results indicate efficient real-time problem identification, optimization of resources, and delivery of quality products. At the same time, the vision system contributes to autonomy in quality control tasks, freeing operators to perform other functions within the company.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17331">Offline Evaluation of Set-Based Text-to-Image Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Negar Arabzadeh, Fernando Diaz, Junfeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) systems often support people during ideation, the early stages of a creative process when exposure to a broad set of relevant images can help explore the design space. Since ideation is an important subclass of TTI tasks, understanding how to quantitatively evaluate TTI systems according to how well they support ideation is crucial to promoting research and development for these users. However, existing evaluation metrics for TTI remain focused on distributional similarity metrics like Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). We take an alternative approach and, based on established methods from ranking evaluation, develop TTI evaluation metrics with explicit models of how users browse and interact with sets of spatially arranged generated images. Our proposed offline evaluation metrics for TTI not only capture how relevant generated images are with respect to the user's ideation need but also take into consideration the diversity and arrangement of the set of generated images. We analyze our proposed family of TTI metrics using human studies on image grids generated by three different TTI systems based on subsets of the widely used benchmarks such as MS-COCO captions and Localized Narratives as well as prompts used in naturalistic settings. Our results demonstrate that grounding metrics in how people use systems is an important and understudied area of benchmark design.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17357">Image-aware Evaluation of Generated Medical Reports</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gefen Dawidowicz, Elad Hirsch, Ayellet Tal</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper proposes a novel evaluation metric for automatic medical report generation from X-ray images, VLScore. It aims to overcome the limitations of existing evaluation methods, which either focus solely on textual similarities, ignoring clinical aspects, or concentrate only on a single clinical aspect, the pathology, neglecting all other factors. The key idea of our metric is to measure the similarity between radiology reports while considering the corresponding image. We demonstrate the benefit of our metric through evaluation on a dataset where radiologists marked errors in pairs of reports, showing notable alignment with radiologists' judgments. In addition, we provide a new dataset for evaluating metrics. This dataset includes well-designed perturbations that distinguish between significant modifications (e.g., removal of a diagnosis) and insignificant ones. It highlights the weaknesses in current evaluation metrics and provides a clear framework for analysis.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17393">Denoise-I2W: Mapping Images to Denoising Words for Accurate Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanmin Tang, Jing Yu, Keke Gai, Jiamin Zhuang, Gaopeng Gou, Gang Xiong, Qi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) supports diverse tasks with a broad range of visual content manipulation intentions that can be related to domain, scene, object, and attribute. A key challenge for ZS-CIR is to accurately map image representation to a pseudo-word token that captures the manipulation intention relevant image information for generalized CIR. However, existing methods between the retrieval and pre-training stages lead to significant redundancy in the pseudo-word tokens. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising image-to-word mapping approach, named Denoise-I2W, for mapping images into denoising pseudo-word tokens that, without intention-irrelevant visual information, enhance accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a pseudo triplet construction module first automatically constructs pseudo triples (\textit{i.e.,} a pseudo-reference image, a pseudo-manipulation text, and a target image) for pre-training the denoising mapping network. Then, a pseudo-composed mapping module maps the pseudo-reference image to a pseudo-word token and combines it with the pseudo-manipulation text with manipulation intention. This combination aligns with the target image, facilitating denoising intention-irrelevant visual information for mapping. Our proposed Denoise-I2W is a model-agnostic and annotation-free approach. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across three state-of-the-art ZS-CIR models on four benchmark datasets. By integrating Denoise-I2W with existing best models, we obtain consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.45\% to 4.17\% over the best methods without increasing inference costs. and achieve new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

<p>Abstract: We propose SigCLR: Sigmoid Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations. SigCLR utilizes the logistic loss that only operates on pairs and does not require a global view as in the cross-entropy loss used in SimCLR. We show that logistic loss shows competitive performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-IN compared to other established SSL objectives. Our findings verify the importance of learnable bias as in the case of SigLUP, however, it requires a fixed temperature as in the SimCLR to excel. Overall, SigCLR is a promising replacement for the SimCLR which is ubiquitous and has shown tremendous success in various domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising progress in understanding and analyzing video content. However, processing long videos remains a significant challenge constrained by LLM's context size. To address this limitation, we propose LongVU, a spatiotemporal adaptive compression mechanism thats reduces the number of video tokens while preserving visual details of long videos. Our idea is based on leveraging cross-modal query and inter-frame dependencies to adaptively reduce temporal and spatial redundancy in videos. Specifically, we leverage DINOv2 features to remove redundant frames that exhibit high similarity. Then we utilize text-guided cross-modal query for selective frame feature reduction. Further, we perform spatial token reduction across frames based on their temporal dependencies. Our adaptive compression strategy effectively processes a large number of frames with little visual information loss within given context length. Our LongVU consistently surpass existing methods across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, especially on hour-long video understanding tasks such as VideoMME and MLVU. Given a light-weight LLM, our LongVU also scales effectively into a smaller size with state-of-the-art video understanding performance.</p>

Then we introduce a reliable client VQA model that incorporates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to quantify uncertainty in predictions, enhancing the model's reliability. Furthermore, we propose a novel inter-client communication mechanism that uses maximum likelihood estimation to balance accuracy and uncertainty, fostering efficient integration of insights across clients.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17489">Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Action Recognition via Self-Ensembling and Conditional Embedding Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Indrajeet Ghosh, Garvit Chugh, Abu Zaher Md Faridee, Nirmalya Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning-based wearable human action recognition (wHAR) have improved the capture and classification of complex motions, but adoption remains limited due to the lack of expert annotations and domain discrepancies from user variations. Limited annotations hinder the model's ability to generalize to out-of-distribution samples. While data augmentation can improve generalizability, unsupervised augmentation techniques must be applied carefully to avoid introducing noise. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses domain discrepancies by aligning conditional distributions with labeled target samples, but vanilla pseudo-labeling can lead to error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose $\mu$DAR, a novel joint optimization architecture comprised of three functions: (i) consistency regularizer between augmented samples to improve model classification generalizability, (ii) temporal ensemble for robust pseudo-label generation and (iii) conditional distribution alignment to improve domain generalizability. The temporal ensemble works by aggregating predictions from past epochs to smooth out noisy pseudo-label predictions, which are then used in the conditional distribution alignment module to minimize kernel-based class-wise conditional maximum mean discrepancy ($k$CMMD) between the source and target feature space to learn a domain invariant embedding. The consistency-regularized augmentations ensure that multiple augmentations of the same sample share the same labels; this results in (a) strong generalization with limited source domain samples and (b) consistent pseudo-label generation in target samples. The novel integration of these three modules in $\mu$DAR results in a range of $\approx$ 4-12% average macro-F1 score improvement over six state-of-the-art UDA methods in four benchmark wHAR datasets</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17505">PLGS: Robust Panoptic Lifting with 3D Gaussian Splatting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Wang, Xiaobao Wei, Ming Lu, Guoliang Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous methods utilize the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for panoptic lifting, while their training and rendering speed are unsatisfactory. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent technique due to its rapid training and rendering speed. However, unlike NeRF, the conventional 3DGS may not satisfy the basic smoothness assumption as it does not rely on any parameterized structures to render (e.g., MLPs). Consequently, the conventional 3DGS is, in nature, more susceptible to noisy 2D mask supervision. In this paper, we propose a new method called PLGS that enables 3DGS to generate consistent panoptic segmentation masks from noisy 2D segmentation masks while maintaining superior efficiency compared to NeRF-based methods. Specifically, we build a panoptic-aware structured 3D Gaussian model to introduce smoothness and design effective noise reduction strategies. For the semantic field, instead of initialization with structure from motion, we construct reliable semantic anchor points to initialize the 3D Gaussians. We then use these anchor points as smooth regularization during training. Additionally, we present a self-training approach using pseudo labels generated by merging the rendered masks with the noisy masks to enhance the robustness of PLGS. For the instance field, we project the 2D instance masks into 3D space and match them with oriented bounding boxes to generate cross-view consistent instance masks for supervision. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both segmentation quality and speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kailai Sun, Zherui Shao, Yang Miang Goh, Jing Tian, Vincent J. L. Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Workplace safety has received increasing attention as millions of workers worldwide suffer from work-related accidents. Despite poor housekeeping is a significant contributor to construction accidents, there remains a significant lack of technological research focused on improving housekeeping practices in construction sites. Recognizing and locating poor housekeeping in a dynamic construction site is an important task that can be improved through computer vision approaches. Despite advances in AI and computer vision, existing methods for detecting poor housekeeping conditions face many challenges, including limited explanations, lack of locating of poor housekeeping, and lack of annotated datasets. On the other hand, change detection which aims to detect the changed environmental conditions (e.g., changing from good to poor housekeeping) and 'where' the change has occurred (e.g., location of objects causing poor housekeeping), has not been explored to the problem of housekeeping management. To address these challenges, we propose the Housekeeping Change Detection Network (HCDN), an advanced change detection neural network that integrates a feature fusion module and a large vision model, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we introduce the approach to establish a novel change detection dataset (named Housekeeping-CCD) focused on housekeeping in construction sites, along with a housekeeping segmentation dataset. Our contributions include significant performance improvements compared to existing methods, providing an effective tool for enhancing construction housekeeping and safety. To promote further development, we share our source code and trained models for global researchers: https://github.com/NUS-DBE/Housekeeping-CD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning has become a cornerstone in various areas, particularly histopathological image analysis. Image augmentation plays a crucial role in self-supervised contrastive learning, as it generates variations in image samples. However, traditional image augmentation techniques often overlook the unique characteristics of histopathological images. In this paper, we propose a new histopathology-specific image augmentation method called stain reconstruction augmentation (SRA). We integrate our SRA with MoCo v3, a leading model in self-supervised contrastive learning, along with our additional contrastive loss terms, and call the new model PathMoCo. We demonstrate that our PathMoCo always outperforms the standard MoCo v3 across various downstream tasks and achieves comparable or superior performance to other foundation models pre-trained on significantly larger histopathology datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Cheng, Shan Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world noise removal is crucial in low-level computer vision. Due to the remarkable generation capabilities of diffusion models, recent attention has shifted towards leveraging diffusion priors for image restoration tasks. However, existing diffusion priors-based methods either consider simple noise types or rely on approximate posterior estimation, limiting their effectiveness in addressing structured and signal-dependent noise commonly found in real-world images. In this paper, we build upon diffusion priors and propose adaptive likelihood estimation and MAP inference during the reverse diffusion process to tackle real-world noise. We introduce an independent, non-identically distributed likelihood combined with the noise precision (inverse variance) prior and dynamically infer the precision posterior using variational Bayes during the generation process. Meanwhile, we rectify the estimated noise variance through local Gaussian convolution. The final denoised image is obtained by propagating intermediate MAP solutions that balance the updated likelihood and diffusion prior. Additionally, we explore the local diffusion prior inherent in low-resolution diffusion models, enabling direct handling of high-resolution noisy images. Extensive experiments and analyses on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/HUST-Tan/DiffusionVI.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17534">OVT-B: A New Large-Scale Benchmark for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Object Tracking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiji Liang, Ruize Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary object perception has become an important topic in artificial intelligence, which aims to identify objects with novel classes that have not been seen during training. Under this setting, open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) in a single image has been studied in many literature. However, open-vocabulary object tracking (OVT) from a video has been studied less, and one reason is the shortage of benchmarks. In this work, we have built a new large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary multi-object tracking namely OVT-B. OVT-B contains 1,048 categories of objects and 1,973 videos with 637,608 bounding box annotations, which is much larger than the sole open-vocabulary tracking dataset, i.e., OVTAO-val dataset (200+ categories, 900+ videos). The proposed OVT-B can be used as a new benchmark to pave the way for OVT research. We also develop a simple yet effective baseline method for OVT. It integrates the motion features for object tracking, which is an important feature for MOT but is ignored in previous OVT methods. Experimental results have verified the usefulness of the proposed benchmark and the effectiveness of our method. We have released the benchmark to the public at https://github.com/Coo1Sea/OVT-B-Dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingyu Chen, Ziyuan Yang, Ming Yan, Zhongzhou Zhang, Hui Yu, Yan Liu, Yi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modality (MM) semi-supervised learning (SSL) based medical image segmentation has recently gained increasing attention for its ability to utilize MM data and reduce reliance on labeled images. However, current methods face several challenges: (1) Complex network designs hinder scalability to scenarios with more than two modalities. (2) Focusing solely on modality-invariant representation while neglecting modality-specific features, leads to incomplete MM learning. (3) Leveraging unlabeled data with generative methods can be unreliable for SSL. To address these problems, we propose Double Bank Dual Consistency (DBDC), a novel MM-SSL approach for medical image segmentation. To address challenge (1), we propose a modality all-in-one segmentation network that accommodates data from any number of modalities, removing the limitation on modality count. To address challenge (2), we design two learnable plug-in banks, Modality-Level Modulation bank (MLMB) and Modality-Level Prototype (MLPB) bank, to capture both modality-invariant and modality-specific knowledge. These banks are updated using our proposed Modality Prototype Contrastive Learning (MPCL). Additionally, we design Modality Adaptive Weighting (MAW) to dynamically adjust learning weights for each modality, ensuring balanced MM learning as different modalities learn at different rates. Finally, to address challenge (3), we introduce a Dual Consistency (DC) strategy that enforces consistency at both the image and feature levels without relying on generative methods. We evaluate our method on a 2-to-4 modality segmentation task using three open-source datasets, and extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahua Dong, Wenqi Liang, Hongliu Li, Duzhen Zhang, Meng Cao, Henghui Ding, Salman Khan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Custom diffusion models (CDMs) have attracted widespread attention due to their astonishing generative ability for personalized concepts. However, most existing CDMs unreasonably assume that personalized concepts are fixed and cannot change over time. Moreover, they heavily suffer from catastrophic forgetting and concept neglect on old personalized concepts when continually learning a series of new concepts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Concept-Incremental text-to-image Diffusion Model (CIDM), which can resolve catastrophic forgetting and concept neglect to learn new customization tasks in a concept-incremental manner. Specifically, to surmount the catastrophic forgetting of old concepts, we develop a concept consolidation loss and an elastic weight aggregation module. They can explore task-specific and task-shared knowledge during training, and aggregate all low-rank weights of old concepts based on their contributions during inference. Moreover, in order to address concept neglect, we devise a context-controllable synthesis strategy that leverages expressive region features and noise estimation to control the contexts of generated images according to user conditions. Experiments validate that our CIDM surpasses existing custom diffusion models. The source codes are available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/CIFC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyu Yang, Qingwei Wang, Feng Zheng, Peng Chen, Ale\v{s} Leonardis, Deng-Ping Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to detect objects with camouflaged properties. Although previous studies have focused on natural (animals and insects) and unnatural (artistic and synthetic) camouflage detection, plant camouflage has been neglected. However, plant camouflage plays a vital role in natural camouflage. Therefore, this paper introduces a new challenging problem of Plant Camouflage Detection (PCD). To address this problem, we introduce the PlantCamo dataset, which comprises 1,250 images with camouflaged plants representing 58 object categories in various natural scenes. To investigate the current status of plant camouflage detection, we conduct a large-scale benchmark study using 20+ cutting-edge COD models on the proposed dataset. Due to the unique characteristics of plant camouflage, including holes and irregular borders, we developed a new framework, named PCNet, dedicated to PCD. Our PCNet surpasses performance thanks to its multi-scale global feature enhancement and refinement. Finally, we discuss the potential applications and insights, hoping this work fills the gap in fine-grained COD research and facilitates further intelligent ecology research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muquan Li, Dongyang Zhang, Tao He, Xiurui Xie, Yuan-Fang Li, Ke Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) has emerged as a pivotal technique in the domain of model compression, substantially reducing the dependency on the original training data. Nonetheless, conventional DFKD methods that employ synthesized training data are prone to the limitations of inadequate diversity and discrepancies in distribution between the synthesized and original datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative approach to DFKD through diverse diffusion augmentation (DDA). Specifically, we revise the paradigm of common data synthesis in DFKD to a composite process through leveraging diffusion models subsequent to data synthesis for self-supervised augmentation, which generates a spectrum of data samples with similar distributions while retaining controlled variations. Furthermore, to mitigate excessive deviation in the embedding space, we introduce an image filtering technique grounded in cosine similarity to maintain fidelity during the knowledge distillation process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets showcase the superior performance of our method across various teacher-student network configurations, outperforming the contemporary state-of-the-art DFKD methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Song, Mengqiao He, Jinhua Feng, Bairong Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has gained increasing attention. Most current work focuses on supervised learning, which requires a large amount of labeled and diverse images, while FER suffers from the scarcity of large, diverse datasets and annotation difficulty. To address these problems, we focus on utilizing large unlabeled Face Recognition (FR) datasets to boost semi-supervised FER. Specifically, we first perform face reconstruction pre-training on large-scale facial images without annotations to learn features of facial geometry and expression regions, followed by two-stage fine-tuning on FER datasets with limited labels. In addition, to further alleviate the scarcity of labeled and diverse images, we propose a Mixup-based data augmentation strategy tailored for facial images, and the loss weights of real and virtual images are determined according to the intersection-over-union (IoU) of the faces in the two images. Experiments on RAF-DB, AffectNet, and FERPlus show that our method outperforms existing semi-supervised FER methods and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, with only 5%, 25% training sets,our method achieves 64.02% on AffectNet,and 88.23% on RAF-DB, which is comparable to fully supervised state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Liu, Yuhang Zang, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Cao, Haodong Duan, Conghui He, Yuanjun Xiong, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual preference alignment involves training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to predict human preferences between visual inputs. This is typically achieved by using labeled datasets of chosen/rejected pairs and employing optimization algorithms like direct preference optimization (DPO). Existing visual alignment methods, primarily designed for single-image scenarios, struggle to effectively handle the complexity of multi-image tasks due to the scarcity of diverse training data and the high cost of annotating chosen/rejected pairs. We present Multi-Image Augmented Direct Preference Optimization (MIA-DPO), a visual preference alignment approach that effectively handles multi-image inputs. MIA-DPO mitigates the scarcity of diverse multi-image training data by extending single-image data with unrelated images arranged in grid collages or pic-in-pic formats, significantly reducing the costs associated with multi-image data annotations. Our observation reveals that attention values of LVLMs vary considerably across different images. We use attention values to identify and filter out rejected responses the model may have mistakenly focused on. Our attention-aware selection for constructing the chosen/rejected pairs without relying on (i) human annotation, (ii) extra data, and (iii) external models or APIs. MIA-DPO is compatible with various architectures and outperforms existing methods on five multi-image benchmarks, achieving an average performance boost of 3.0% on LLaVA-v1.5 and 4.3% on the recent InternLM-XC2.5. Moreover, MIA-DPO has a minimal effect on the model's ability to understand single images.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17642">Surgical Scene Segmentation by Transformer With Asymmetric Feature Enhancement</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Yuan, Yutong Ban</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical scene segmentation is a fundamental task for robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery understanding. It often contains various anatomical structures and surgical instruments, where similar local textures and fine-grained structures make the segmentation a difficult task. Vision-specific transformer method is a promising way for surgical scene understanding. However, there are still two main challenges. Firstly, the absence of inner-patch information fusion leads to poor segmentation performance. Secondly, the specific characteristics of anatomy and instruments are not specifically modeled. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework with an Asymmetric Feature Enhancement module (TAFE), which enhances local information and then actively fuses the improved feature pyramid into the embeddings from transformer encoders by a multi-scale interaction attention strategy. The proposed method outperforms the SOTA methods in several different surgical segmentation tasks and additionally proves its ability of fine-grained structure recognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiguang Li, Jiafu Chen, Yunhe Sun, Na Lin, Ammar Hawbani, Liang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, efficient and accurate object detection capabilities have become crucial factors in ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. However, in low-visibility environments such as hazy conditions, the performance of traditional object detection algorithms often degrades significantly, failing to meet the demands of autonomous driving. To address this challenge, this paper proposes two innovative deep learning models: YOLO-Vehicle and YOLO-Vehicle-Pro. YOLO-Vehicle is an object detection model tailored specifically for autonomous driving scenarios, employing multimodal fusion techniques to combine image and textual information for object detection. YOLO-Vehicle-Pro builds upon this foundation by introducing an improved image dehazing algorithm, enhancing detection performance in low-visibility environments. In addition to model innovation, this paper also designs and implements a cloud-edge collaborative object detection system, deploying models on edge devices and offloading partial computational tasks to the cloud in complex situations. Experimental results demonstrate that on the KITTI dataset, the YOLO-Vehicle-v1s model achieved 92.1% accuracy while maintaining a detection speed of 226 FPS and an inference time of 12ms, meeting the real-time requirements of autonomous driving. When processing hazy images, the YOLO-Vehicle-Pro model achieved a high accuracy of 82.3% mAP@50 on the Foggy Cityscapes dataset while maintaining a detection speed of 43 FPS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexu Huang, Sarah Monazam Erfani, Siying Lu, Mingming Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: High-fidelity digital human representations are increasingly in demand in the digital world, particularly for interactive telepresence, AR/VR, 3D graphics, and the rapidly evolving metaverse. Even though they work well in small spaces, conventional methods for reconstructing 3D human motion frequently require the use of expensive hardware and have high processing costs. This study presents HumanAvatar, an innovative approach that efficiently reconstructs precise human avatars from monocular video sources. At the core of our methodology, we integrate the pre-trained HuMoR, a model celebrated for its proficiency in human motion estimation. This is adeptly fused with the cutting-edge neural radiance field technology, Instant-NGP, and the state-of-the-art articulated model, Fast-SNARF, to enhance the reconstruction fidelity and speed. By combining these two technologies, a system is created that can render quickly and effectively while also providing estimation of human pose parameters that are unmatched in accuracy. We have enhanced our system with an advanced posture-sensitive space reduction technique, which optimally balances rendering quality with computational efficiency. In our detailed experimental analysis using both artificial and real-world monocular videos, we establish the advanced performance of our approach. HumanAvatar consistently equals or surpasses contemporary leading-edge reconstruction techniques in quality. Furthermore, it achieves these complex reconstructions in minutes, a fraction of the time typically required by existing methods. Our models achieve a training speed that is 110X faster than that of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) NeRF-based models. Our technique performs noticeably better than SoTA dynamic human NeRF methods if given an identical runtime limit. HumanAvatar can provide effective visuals after only 30 seconds of training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surgical data science (SDS) is a field that analyzes patient data before, during, and after surgery to improve surgical outcomes and skills. However, surgical data is scarce, heterogeneous, and complex, which limits the applicability of existing machine learning methods. In this work, we introduce the novel task of future video generation in laparoscopic surgery. This task can augment and enrich the existing surgical data and enable various applications, such as simulation, analysis, and robot-aided surgery. Ultimately, it involves not only understanding the current state of the operation but also accurately predicting the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of surgical procedures. Our proposed method, VISAGE (VIdeo Synthesis using Action Graphs for Surgery), leverages the power of action scene graphs to capture the sequential nature of laparoscopic procedures and utilizes diffusion models to synthesize temporally coherent video sequences. VISAGE predicts the future frames given only a single initial frame, and the action graph triplets. By incorporating domain-specific knowledge through the action graph, VISAGE ensures the generated videos adhere to the expected visual and motion patterns observed in real laparoscopic procedures. The results of our experiments demonstrate high-fidelity video generation for laparoscopy procedures, which enables various applications in SDS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanting Fan, Chengxu Liu, Nengzhong Yin, Changlong Gao, Xueming Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have shown promising results on single-image super-resolution and other image-to-image translation tasks. Benefiting from more computational resources and longer inference times, they are able to yield more realistic images. Existing DMs-based super-resolution methods try to achieve an overall average recovery over all regions via iterative refinement, ignoring the consideration that different input image regions require different timesteps to reconstruct. In this work, we notice that previous DMs-based super-resolution methods suffer from wasting computational resources to reconstruct invisible details. To further improve the utilization of computational resources, we propose AdaDiffSR, a DMs-based SR pipeline with dynamic timesteps sampling strategy (DTSS). Specifically, by introducing the multi-metrics latent entropy module (MMLE), we can achieve dynamic perception of the latent spatial information gain during the denoising process, thereby guiding the dynamic selection of the timesteps. In addition, we adopt a progressive feature injection module (PFJ), which dynamically injects the original image features into the denoising process based on the current information gain, so as to generate images with both fidelity and realism. Experiments show that our AdaDiffSR achieves comparable performance over current state-of-the-art DMs-based SR methods while consuming less computational resources and inference time on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The medial axis, a lower-dimensional shape descriptor, plays an important role in the field of digital geometry processing. Despite its importance, robust computation of the medial axis transform from diverse inputs, especially point clouds with defects, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we tackle the challenge by proposing a new implicit method that diverges from mainstream explicit medial axis computation techniques. Our key technical insight is the difference between the signed distance field (SDF) and the medial field (MF) of a solid shape is the unsigned distance field (UDF) of the shape's medial axis. This allows for formulating medial axis computation as an implicit reconstruction problem. Utilizing a modified double covering method, we extract the medial axis as the zero level-set of the UDF. Extensive experiments show that our method has enhanced accuracy and robustness in learning compact medial axis transform from thorny meshes and point clouds compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Hao, Jianyuan Guo, Li Shen, Yong Luo, Han Hu, Yonggang Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal fusion have witnessed the remarkable success of vision-language (VL) models, which excel in various multimodal applications such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, building VL models requires substantial hardware resources, where efficiency is restricted by two key factors: the extended input sequence of the language model with vision features demands more computational operations, and a large number of additional learnable parameters increase memory complexity. These challenges significantly restrict the broader applicability of such models. To bridge this gap, we propose ADEM-VL, an efficient vision-language method that tunes VL models based on pretrained large language models (LLMs) by adopting a parameter-free cross-attention mechanism for similarity measurements in multimodal fusion. This approach only requires embedding vision features into the language space, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters and accelerating both training and inference speeds. To enhance representation learning in fusion module, we introduce an efficient multiscale feature generation scheme that requires only a single forward pass through the vision encoder. Moreover, we propose an adaptive fusion scheme that dynamically discards less relevant visual information for each text token based on its attention score. This ensures that the fusion process prioritizes the most pertinent visual features. With experiments on various tasks including visual question answering, image captioning, and instruction-following, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, our method surpasses existing methods by an average accuracy of 0.77% on ScienceQA dataset, with reduced training and inference latency, demonstrating the superiority of our framework.

<p>Abstract: Understanding trajectories in multi-agent scenarios requires addressing various tasks, including predicting future movements, imputing missing observations, inferring the status of unseen agents, and classifying different global states. Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruowei Wang, Jiaqi Li, Dan Zeng, Xueqi Ma, Zixiang Xu, Jianwei Zhang, Qijun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality meshes with complex structures and realistic surfaces is the primary goal of 3D generative models. Existing methods typically employ sequence data or deformable tetrahedral grids for mesh generation. However, sequence-based methods have difficulty producing complex structures with many faces due to memory limits. The deformable tetrahedral grid-based method MeshDiffusion fails to recover realistic surfaces due to the inherent ambiguity in deformable grids. We propose the GenUDC framework to address these challenges by leveraging the Unsigned Dual Contouring (UDC) as the mesh representation. UDC discretizes a mesh in a regular grid and divides it into the face and vertex parts, recovering both complex structures and fine details. As a result, the one-to-one mapping between UDC and mesh resolves the ambiguity problem. In addition, GenUDC adopts a two-stage, coarse-to-fine generative process for 3D mesh generation. It first generates the face part as a rough shape and then the vertex part to craft a detailed shape. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of UDC as a mesh representation and the favorable performance of GenUDC in mesh generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zhu, Jinjin Gu, Zhiyuan You, Yu Qiao, Chao Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world image restoration (IR) is inherently complex and often requires combining multiple specialized models to address diverse degradations. Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxiong Wang, Yaxiong Wang, Lianwei Wu, Lechao Cheng, Zhun Zhong, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in image-text matching have been notable, yet prevailing models predominantly cater to broad queries and struggle with accommodating fine-grained query intention. In this paper, we work towards the \textbf{E}ntity-centric \textbf{I}mage-\textbf{T}ext \textbf{M}atching (EITM), a task that the text and image involve specific entity-related information. The challenge of this task mainly lies in the larger semantic gap in entity association modeling, comparing with the general image-text matching problem.To narrow the huge semantic gap between the entity-centric text and the images, we take the fundamental CLIP as the backbone and devise a multimodal attentive contrastive learning framework to tam CLIP to adapt EITM problem, developing a model named EntityCLIP. The key of our multimodal attentive contrastive learning is to generate interpretive explanation text using Large Language Models (LLMs) as the bridge clues. In specific, we proceed by extracting explanatory text from off-the-shelf LLMs. This explanation text, coupled with the image and text, is then input into our specially crafted Multimodal Attentive Experts (MMAE) module, which effectively integrates explanation texts to narrow the gap of the entity-related text and image in a shared semantic space. Building on the enriched features derived from MMAE, we further design an effective Gated Integrative Image-text Matching (GI-ITM) strategy. The GI-ITM employs an adaptive gating mechanism to aggregate MMAE's features, subsequently applying image-text matching constraints to steer the alignment between the text and the image. Extensive experiments are conducted on three social media news benchmarks including N24News, VisualNews, and GoodNews, the results shows that our method surpasses the competition methods with a clear margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingpeng Li, Yuxin Zhang, Leyuan Fang, Yuhan Kang, Shutao Li, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection algorithms are pivotal components of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging systems, extensively employed in complex fields. However, images captured by high-mobility UAVs often suffer from motion blur cases, which significantly impedes the performance of advanced object detection algorithms. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative object detection algorithm specifically designed for blurry images, named DREB-Net (Dual-stream Restoration Embedding Blur-feature Fusion Network). First, DREB-Net addresses the particularities of blurry image object detection problem by incorporating a Blurry image Restoration Auxiliary Branch (BRAB) during the training phase. Second, it fuses the extracted shallow features via Multi-level Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (MAGFF) module, to extract richer features. Here, the MAGFF module comprises local attention modules and global attention modules, which assign different weights to the branches. Then, during the inference phase, the deep feature extraction of the BRAB can be removed to reduce computational complexity and improve detection speed. In loss function, a combined loss of MSE and SSIM is added to the BRAB to restore blurry images. Finally, DREB-Net introduces Fast Fourier Transform in the early stages of feature extraction, via a Learnable Frequency domain Amplitude Modulation Module (LFAMM), to adjust feature amplitude and enhance feature processing capability. Experimental results indicate that DREB-Net can still effectively perform object detection tasks under motion blur in captured images, showcasing excellent performance and broad application prospects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laines Schmalwasser, Jakob Gawlikowski, Joachim Denzler, Julia Niebling</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) offer insights into neural network decision-making by linking human friendly concepts to the model's internal feature extraction process. However, when a new set of CAVs is discovered, they must still be translated into a human understandable description. For image-based neural networks, this is typically done by visualizing the most relevant images of a CAV, while the determination of the concept is left to humans. In this work, we introduce an approach to aid the interpretation of newly discovered concept sets by suggesting textual descriptions for each CAV. This is done by mapping the most relevant images representing a CAV into a text-image embedding where a joint description of these relevant images can be computed. We propose utilizing the most relevant receptive fields instead of full images encoded. We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach in multiple experiments with and without given CAV labels, showing that the proposed approach provides accurate descriptions for the CAVs and reduces the challenge of concept interpretation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingshan Xu, Xuanyu Yi, Jianyao Xu, Wenbing Tao, Yew-Soon Ong, Hanwang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis with sparse inputs poses great challenges to Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). Recent works demonstrate that the frequency regularization of Positional Encoding (PE) can achieve promising results for few-shot NeRF. In this work, we reveal that there exists an inconsistency between the frequency regularization of PE and rendering loss. This prevents few-shot NeRF from synthesizing higher-quality novel views. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose Adaptive Rendering loss regularization for few-shot NeRF, dubbed AR-NeRF. Specifically, we present a two-phase rendering supervision and an adaptive rendering loss weight learning strategy to align the frequency relationship between PE and 2D-pixel supervision. In this way, AR-NeRF can learn global structures better in the early training phase and adaptively learn local details throughout the training process. Extensive experiments show that our AR-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, including object-level and complex scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruicheng Zhang, Guoheng Huang, Yejing Huo, Xiaochen Yuan, Zhizhen Zhou, Xuhang Chen, Guo Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a prominent research focus for image editing tasks, leveraging the powerful image generation capabilities of the GAN framework to produce remarkable results.However, prevailing approaches are contingent upon extensive training datasets and explicit supervision, presenting a significant challenge in manipulating the diverse attributes of new image classes with limited sample availability. To surmount this hurdle, we introduce TAGE, an innovative image generation network comprising three integral modules: the Codebook Learning Module (CLM), the Code Prediction Module (CPM) and the Prompt-driven Semantic Module (PSM). The CPM module delves into the semantic dimensions of category-agnostic attributes, encapsulating them within a discrete codebook. This module is predicated on the concept that images are assemblages of attributes, and thus, by editing these category-independent attributes, it is theoretically possible to generate images from unseen categories. Subsequently, the CPM module facilitates naturalistic image editing by predicting indices of category-independent attribute vectors within the codebook. Additionally, the PSM module generates semantic cues that are seamlessly integrated into the Transformer architecture of the CPM, enhancing the model's comprehension of the targeted attributes for editing. With these semantic cues, the model can generate images that accentuate desired attributes more prominently while maintaining the integrity of the original category, even with a limited number of samples. We have conducted extensive experiments utilizing the Animal Faces, Flowers, and VGGFaces datasets. The results of these experiments demonstrate that our proposed method not only achieves superior performance but also exhibits a high degree of stability when compared to other few-shot image generation techniques.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17856">ROCKET-1: Master Open-World Interaction with Visual-Temporal Context Prompting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaofei Cai, Zihao Wang, Kewei Lian, Zhancun Mu, Xiaojian Ma, Anji Liu, Yitao Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have excelled in multimodal tasks, but adapting them to embodied decision-making in open-world environments presents challenges. A key issue is the difficulty in smoothly connecting individual entities in low-level observations with abstract concepts required for planning. A common approach to address this problem is through the use of hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language and imagined observations. However, language often fails to effectively convey spatial information, while generating future images with sufficient accuracy remains challenging. To address these limitations, we propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from both past and present observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, with real-time object tracking provided by SAM-2. Our method unlocks the full potential of VLMs visual-language reasoning abilities, enabling them to solve complex creative tasks, especially those heavily reliant on spatial understanding. Experiments in Minecraft demonstrate that our approach allows agents to accomplish previously unattainable tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of visual-temporal context prompting in embodied decision-making.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17880">A utility-based spatial analysis of residential street-level conditions; A case study of Rotterdam</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sander van Cranenburgh, Francisco Garrido-Valenzuela</p>
<p>Abstract: Residential location choices are traditionally modelled using factors related to accessibility and socioeconomic environments, neglecting the importance of local street-level conditions. Arguably, this neglect is due to data practices. Today, however, street-level images -- which are highly effective at encoding street-level conditions -- are widely available. Additionally, recent advances in discrete choice models incorporating computer vision capabilities offer opportunities to integrate street-level conditions into residential location choice analysis. This study leverages these developments to investigate the spatial distribution of utility derived from street-level conditions in residential location choices on a city-wide scale. In our case study of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, we find that the utility derived from street-level conditions varies significantly on a highly localised scale, with conditions rapidly changing even within neighbourhoods. Our results also reveal that the high real-estate prices in the city centre cannot be attributed to attractive street-level conditions. Furthermore, whereas the city centre is characterised by relatively unattractive residential street-level conditions, neighbourhoods in the southern part of the city -- often perceived as problematic -- exhibit surprisingly appealing street-level environments. The methodological contribution of this paper is that it advances the discrete choice models incorporating computer vision capabilities by introducing a semantic regularisation layer to the model. Thereby, it adds explainability and eliminates the need for a separate pipeline to extract information from images, streamlining the analysis. As such, this paper's findings and methodological advancements pave the way for further studies to explore integrating street-level conditions in urban planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenfang Yao, Chen Liu, Kejing Yin, William K. Cheung, Jing Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating multi-modal clinical data, such as electronic health records (EHR) and chest X-ray images (CXR), is particularly beneficial for clinical prediction tasks. However, in a temporal setting, multi-modal data are often inherently asynchronous. EHR can be continuously collected but CXR is generally taken with a much longer interval due to its high cost and radiation dose. When clinical prediction is needed, the last available CXR image might have been outdated, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address this challenge, we propose DDL-CXR, a method that dynamically generates an up-to-date latent representation of the individualized CXR images. Our approach leverages latent diffusion models for patient-specific generation strategically conditioned on a previous CXR image and EHR time series, providing information regarding anatomical structures and disease progressions, respectively. In this way, the interaction across modalities could be better captured by the latent CXR generation process, ultimately improving the prediction performance. Experiments using MIMIC datasets show that the proposed model could effectively address asynchronicity in multimodal fusion and consistently outperform existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The annotation of patient organs is a crucial part of various diagnostic and treatment procedures, such as radiotherapy planning. Manual annotation is extremely time-consuming, while its automation using modern image analysis techniques has not yet reached levels sufficient for clinical adoption. This paper investigates the idea of semi-supervised medical image segmentation using human gaze as interactive input for segmentation correction. In particular, we fine-tuned the Segment Anything Model in Medical Images (MedSAM), a public solution that uses various prompt types as additional input for semi-automated segmentation correction. We used human gaze data from reading abdominal images as a prompt for fine-tuning MedSAM. The model was validated on a public WORD database, which consists of 120 CT scans of 16 abdominal organs. The results of the gaze-assisted MedSAM were shown to be superior to the results of the state-of-the-art segmentation models. In particular, the average Dice coefficient for 16 abdominal organs was 85.8%, 86.7%, 81.7%, and 90.5% for nnUNetV2, ResUNet, original MedSAM, and our gaze-assisted MedSAM model, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linus Franke, Laura Fink, Marc Stamminger</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS), particularly neural radiance fields (NeRF) and Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have demonstrated impressive results in photorealistic scene rendering. These techniques hold great potential for applications in virtual tourism and teleportation, where immersive realism is crucial. However, the high-performance demands of virtual reality (VR) systems present challenges in directly utilizing even such fast-to-render scene representations like 3DGS due to latency and computational constraints.
  In this paper, we propose foveated rendering as a promising solution to these obstacles. We analyze state-of-the-art NVS methods with respect to their rendering performance and compatibility with the human visual system. Our approach introduces a novel foveated rendering approach for Virtual Reality, that leverages the sharp, detailed output of neural point rendering for the foveal region, fused with a smooth rendering of 3DGS for the peripheral vision.
  Our evaluation confirms that perceived sharpness and detail-richness are increased by our approach compared to a standard VR-ready 3DGS configuration. Our system meets the necessary performance requirements for real-time VR interactions, ultimately enhancing the user's immersive experience.

To take full advantage of the information from the feature matching stage we incorporate learnable weights that depend on the matching confidences. In this way our solution brings together feature extraction, matching and two-view geometry estimation in a unified end-to-end trainable pipeline. We evaluate our approach on the camera pose estimation task in both outdoor and indoor scenarios. The experiments on several datasets show that the proposed method outperforms both classic and learning-based state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shyamgopal Karthik, Huseyin Coskun, Zeynep Akata, Sergey Tulyakov, Jian Ren, Anil Kag</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a powerful approach to align text-to-image (T2I) models with human feedback. Unfortunately, successful application of DPO to T2I models requires a huge amount of resources to collect and label large-scale datasets, e.g., millions of generated paired images annotated with human preferences. In addition, these human preference datasets can get outdated quickly as the rapid improvements of T2I models lead to higher quality images. In this work, we investigate a scalable approach for collecting large-scale and fully synthetic datasets for DPO training. Specifically, the preferences for paired images are generated using a pre-trained reward function, eliminating the need for involving humans in the annotation process, greatly improving the dataset collection efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that such datasets allow averaging predictions across multiple models and collecting ranked preferences as opposed to pairwise preferences. Furthermore, we introduce RankDPO to enhance DPO-based methods using the ranking feedback. Applying RankDPO on SDXL and SD3-Medium models with our synthetically generated preference dataset ``Syn-Pic'' improves both prompt-following (on benchmarks like T2I-Compbench, GenEval, and DPG-Bench) and visual quality (through user studies). This pipeline presents a practical and scalable solution to develop better preference datasets to enhance the performance of text-to-image models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an innovative in-pixel contrast enhancement circuit that performs image processing directly within the pixel circuit. The circuit can be tuned for different modes of operation. In foreground enhancement mode, it suppresses low-intensity background pixels to nearly zero, isolating the foreground for better object visibility. In contrast enhancement mode, it improves overall image contrast. The contrast enhancement function is customizable both during the design phase and in real-time, allowing the circuit to adapt to specific applications and varying lighting conditions. A model of the designed pixel circuit is developed and applied to a full pixel array, demonstrating significant improvements in image quality. Simulations performed in HSPICE show a nearly 6x increase in Michelson Contrast Ratio (CR) in the foreground enhancement mode. The simulation results indicate its potential for real-time, adaptive contrast enhancement across various imaging environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) is critical for enhancing privacy and security in deep learning models, particularly in large multimodal language models (MLLMs), by removing specific private or hazardous information. While MU has made significant progress in textual and visual modalities, multimodal unlearning (MMU) remains significantly underexplored, partially due to the absence of a suitable open-source benchmark. To address this, we introduce CLEAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate MMU methods. CLEAR contains 200 fictitious individuals and 3,700 images linked with corresponding question-answer pairs, enabling a thorough evaluation across modalities. We assess 10 MU methods, adapting them for MMU, and highlight new challenges specific to multimodal forgetting. We also demonstrate that simple $\ell_1$ regularization on LoRA weights significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting, preserving model performance on retained data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Xie, Tianhua Li, Wenqi Shao, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have received much attention for their impressive capabilities. The evaluation of MLLMs is becoming critical to analyzing attributes of MLLMs and providing valuable insights. However, current benchmarks overlook the problem of prompt sensitivity - minor prompt variations may lead to significant performance fluctuations. Thus, inappropriate prompts may obscure the models' capabilities, underestimating the models' performance. Moreover, different models have different preferences for different prompts, and thus, using the same prompt for all models will cause evaluation bias. This paper analyzes this deficiency in existing benchmarks and further introduces a new evaluation framework named TP-Eval, which introduces a prompt customization method to reduce evaluation biases and tap models' potential. TP-Eval will rewrite the original prompts to different customized prompts for different models. In particular, we propose some well-designed modules for prompt customization tailored to the scenario of MLLM evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Qin, Zhelun Shi, Jiwen Yu, Xijun Wang, Enshen Zhou, Lijun Li, Zhenfei Yin, Xihui Liu, Lu Sheng, Jing Shao, Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang, Ruimao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in predictive models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in predicting the future state of objects and scenes. However, the lack of categorization based on inherent characteristics continues to hinder the progress of predictive model development. Additionally, existing benchmarks are unable to effectively evaluate higher-capability, highly embodied predictive models from an embodied perspective. In this work, we classify the functionalities of predictive models into a hierarchy and take the first step in evaluating World Simulators by proposing a dual evaluation framework called WorldSimBench. WorldSimBench includes Explicit Perceptual Evaluation and Implicit Manipulative Evaluation, encompassing human preference assessments from the visual perspective and action-level evaluations in embodied tasks, covering three representative embodied scenarios: Open-Ended Embodied Environment, Autonomous, Driving, and Robot Manipulation. In the Explicit Perceptual Evaluation, we introduce the HF-Embodied Dataset, a video assessment dataset based on fine-grained human feedback, which we use to train a Human Preference Evaluator that aligns with human perception and explicitly assesses the visual fidelity of World Simulators. In the Implicit Manipulative Evaluation, we assess the video-action consistency of World Simulators by evaluating whether the generated situation-aware video can be accurately translated into the correct control signals in dynamic environments. Our comprehensive evaluation offers key insights that can drive further innovation in video generation models, positioning World Simulators as a pivotal advancement toward embodied artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suchisrit Gangopadhyay, Xien Chen, Michael Chu, Patrick Rim, Hyoungseob Park, Alex Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose UnCLe, a standardized benchmark for Unsupervised Continual Learning of a multimodal depth estimation task: Depth completion aims to infer a dense depth map from a pair of synchronized RGB image and sparse depth map. We benchmark depth completion models under the practical scenario of unsupervised learning over continuous streams of data. Existing methods are typically trained on a static, or stationary, dataset. However, when adapting to novel non-stationary distributions, they "catastrophically forget" previously learned information. UnCLe simulates these non-stationary distributions by adapting depth completion models to sequences of datasets containing diverse scenes captured from distinct domains using different visual and range sensors. We adopt representative methods from continual learning paradigms and translate them to enable unsupervised continual learning of depth completion. We benchmark these models for indoor and outdoor and investigate the degree of catastrophic forgetting through standard quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we introduce model inversion quality as an additional measure of forgetting. We find that unsupervised continual learning of depth completion is an open problem, and we invite researchers to leverage UnCLe as a development platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qitai Wang, Lue Fan, Yuqi Wang, Yuntao Chen, Zhaoxiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing reconstruction-based novel view synthesis methods for driving scenes focus on synthesizing camera views along the recorded trajectory of the ego vehicle. Their image rendering performance will severely degrade on viewpoints falling out of the recorded trajectory, where camera rays are untrained. We propose FreeVS, a novel fully generative approach that can synthesize camera views on free new trajectories in real driving scenes. To control the generation results to be 3D consistent with the real scenes and accurate in viewpoint pose, we propose the pseudo-image representation of view priors to control the generation process. Viewpoint transformation simulation is applied on pseudo-images to simulate camera movement in each direction. Once trained, FreeVS can be applied to any validation sequences without reconstruction process and synthesis views on novel trajectories. Moreover, we propose two new challenging benchmarks tailored to driving scenes, which are novel camera synthesis and novel trajectory synthesis, emphasizing the freedom of viewpoints. Given that no ground truth images are available on novel trajectories, we also propose to evaluate the consistency of images synthesized on novel trajectories with 3D perception models. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that FreeVS has a strong image synthesis performance on both the recorded trajectories and novel trajectories. Project Page: https://freevs24.github.io/</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18084">DynamicCity: Large-Scale LiDAR Generation from Dynamic Scenes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengwei Bian, Lingdong Kong, Haozhe Xie, Liang Pan, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR scene generation has been developing rapidly recently. However, existing methods primarily focus on generating static and single-frame scenes, overlooking the inherently dynamic nature of real-world driving environments. In this work, we introduce DynamicCity, a novel 4D LiDAR generation framework capable of generating large-scale, high-quality LiDAR scenes that capture the temporal evolution of dynamic environments. DynamicCity mainly consists of two key models. 1) A VAE model for learning HexPlane as the compact 4D representation. Instead of using naive averaging operations, DynamicCity employs a novel Projection Module to effectively compress 4D LiDAR features into six 2D feature maps for HexPlane construction, which significantly enhances HexPlane fitting quality (up to 12.56 mIoU gain). Furthermore, we utilize an Expansion & Squeeze Strategy to reconstruct 3D feature volumes in parallel, which improves both network training efficiency and reconstruction accuracy than naively querying each 3D point (up to 7.05 mIoU gain, 2.06x training speedup, and 70.84% memory reduction). 2) A DiT-based diffusion model for HexPlane generation. To make HexPlane feasible for DiT generation, a Padded Rollout Operation is proposed to reorganize all six feature planes of the HexPlane as a squared 2D feature map. In particular, various conditions could be introduced in the diffusion or sampling process, supporting versatile 4D generation applications, such as trajectory- and command-driven generation, inpainting, and layout-conditioned generation. Extensive experiments on the CarlaSC and Waymo datasets demonstrate that DynamicCity significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D LiDAR generation methods across multiple metrics. The code will be released to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilong Liu, Krzysztof Janowicz, Kitty Currier, Meilin Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Regional defaults describe the emerging phenomenon that text-to-image (T2I) foundation models used in generative AI are prone to over-proportionally depicting certain geographic regions to the exclusion of others. In this work, we introduce a scalable evaluation for uncovering such regional defaults. The evaluation consists of region hierarchy--based image generation and cross-level similarity comparisons. We carry out an experiment by prompting DALL-E 2, a state-of-the-art T2I generation model capable of generating photorealistic images, to depict a forest. We select forest as an object class that displays regional variation and can be characterized using spatial statistics. For a region in the hierarchy, our experiment reveals the regional defaults implicit in DALL-E 2, along with their scale-dependent nature and spatial relationships. In addition, we discover that the implicit defaults do not necessarily correspond to the most widely forested regions in reality. Our findings underscore a need for further investigation into the geography of T2I generation and other forms of generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Glenda Hui En Tan (Carnegie Mellon University), Goh Xin Ru Karin (London School of Economics and Political Science), Shen Bingquan (DSO National Laboratories Singapore)</p>
<p>Abstract: Colorectal cancer is the most common cancer in Singapore and the third most common cancer worldwide. Blood in a person's stool is a symptom of this disease, and it is usually detected by the faecal occult blood test (FOBT). However, the FOBT presents several limitations - the collection process for the stool samples is tedious and unpleasant, the waiting period for results is about 2 weeks and costs are involved. In this research, we propose a simple-to-use, fast and cost-free alternative - a stool recognition neural network that determines if there is blood in one's stool (which indicates a possible risk of colorectal cancer) from an image of it. As this is a new classification task, there was limited data available, hindering classifier performance. Hence, various Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (DiffAugment StyleGAN2, DCGAN, Conditional GAN) were trained to generate images of high fidelity to supplement the dataset. Subsequently, images generated by the GAN with the most realistic images (DiffAugment StyleGAN2) were concatenated to the classifier's training batch on-the-fly, improving accuracy to 94%. This model was then deployed to a mobile app - Poolice, where users can take a photo of their stool and obtain instantaneous results if there is blood in their stool, prompting those who do to seek medical advice. As "early detection saves lives", we hope our app built on our stool recognition neural network can help people detect colorectal cancer earlier, so they can seek treatment and have higher chances of survival.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryuma Nakahata, Shehtab Zaman, Mingyuan Zhang, Fake Lu, Kenneth Chiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ptychography is a computational method of microscopy that recovers high-resolution transmission images of samples from a series of diffraction patterns. While conventional phase retrieval algorithms can iteratively recover the images, they require oversampled diffraction patterns, incur significant computational costs, and struggle to recover the absolute phase of the sample's transmission function. Deep learning algorithms for ptychography are a promising approach to resolving the limitations of iterative algorithms. We present PtychoFormer, a hierarchical transformer-based model for data-driven single-shot ptychographic phase retrieval. PtychoFormer processes subsets of diffraction patterns, generating local inferences that are seamlessly stitched together to produce a high-quality reconstruction. Our model exhibits tolerance to sparsely scanned diffraction patterns and achieves up to 3600 times faster imaging speed than the extended ptychographic iterative engine (ePIE). We also propose the extended-PtychoFormer (ePF), a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of PtychoFormer with the ePIE. ePF minimizes global phase shifts and significantly enhances reconstruction quality, achieving state-of-the-art phase retrieval in ptychography.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheyuan Zhang, Fengyuan Hu, Jayjun Lee, Freda Shi, Parisa Kordjamshidi, Joyce Chai, Ziqiao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial expressions in situated communication can be ambiguous, as their meanings vary depending on the frames of reference (FoR) adopted by speakers and listeners. While spatial language understanding and reasoning by vision-language models (VLMs) have gained increasing attention, potential ambiguities in these models are still under-explored. To address this issue, we present the COnsistent Multilingual Frame Of Reference Test (COMFORT), an evaluation protocol to systematically assess the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art VLMs using COMFORT. Despite showing some alignment with English conventions in resolving ambiguities, our experiments reveal significant shortcomings of VLMs: notably, the models (1) exhibit poor robustness and consistency, (2) lack the flexibility to accommodate multiple FoRs, and (3) fail to adhere to language-specific or culture-specific conventions in cross-lingual tests, as English tends to dominate other languages. With a growing effort to align vision-language models with human cognitive intuitions, we call for more attention to the ambiguous nature and cross-cultural diversity of spatial reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arrun Sivasubramanian, Divya Sasidharan, Sowmya V, Vinayakumar Ravi</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasound fetal imaging is beneficial to support prenatal development because it is affordable and non-intrusive. Nevertheless, fetal plane classification (FPC) remains challenging and time-consuming for obstetricians since it depends on nuanced clinical aspects, which increases the difficulty in identifying relevant features of the fetal anatomy. Thus, to assist with its accurate feature extraction, a lightweight artificial intelligence architecture leveraging convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms is proposed to classify the largest benchmark ultrasound dataset. The approach fine-tunes from lightweight EfficientNet feature extraction backbones pre-trained on the ImageNet1k. to classify key fetal planes such as the brain, femur, thorax, cervix, and abdomen. Our methodology incorporates the attention mechanism to refine features and 3-layer perceptrons for classification, achieving superior performance with the highest Top-1 accuracy of 96.25%, Top-2 accuracy of 99.80% and F1-Score of 0.9576. Importantly, the model has 40x fewer trainable parameters than existing benchmark ensemble or transformer pipelines, facilitating easy deployment on edge devices to help clinical practitioners with real-time FPC. The findings are also interpreted using GradCAM to carry out clinical correlation to aid doctors with diagnostics and improve treatment plans for expectant mothers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modeling human trajectories in crowded environments is challenging due to the complex nature of pedestrian behavior and interactions. This paper proposes a geometric graph neural network (GNN) architecture that integrates domain knowledge from psychological studies to model pedestrian interactions and predict future trajectories. Unlike prior studies using complete graphs, we define interaction neighborhoods using pedestrians' field of view, motion direction, and distance-based kernel functions to construct graph representations of crowds. Evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate improved prediction accuracy through reduced average and final displacement error metrics. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating domain knowledge with data-driven approaches for effective modeling of human interactions in crowds.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present AG-SLAM, the first active SLAM system utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for online scene reconstruction. In recent years, radiance field scene representations, including 3DGS have been widely used in SLAM and exploration, but actively planning trajectories for robotic exploration is still unvisited. In particular, many exploration methods assume precise localization and thus do not mitigate the significant risk of constructing a trajectory, which is difficult for a SLAM system to operate on. This can cause camera tracking failure and lead to failures in real-world robotic applications. Our method leverages Fisher Information to balance the dual objectives of maximizing the information gain for the environment while minimizing the cost of localization errors. Experiments conducted on the Gibson and Habitat-Matterport 3D datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Wang, Guang Yin, Binghao Huang, Tarik Kelestemur, Jiuguang Wang, Yunzhu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based policies have shown remarkable capability in executing complex robotic manipulation tasks but lack explicit characterization of geometry and semantics, which often limits their ability to generalize to unseen objects and layouts. To enhance the generalization capabilities of Diffusion Policy, we introduce a novel framework that incorporates explicit spatial and semantic information via 3D semantic fields. We generate 3D descriptor fields from multi-view RGBD observations with large foundational vision models, then compare these descriptor fields against reference descriptors to obtain semantic fields. The proposed method explicitly considers geometry and semantics, enabling strong generalization capabilities in tasks requiring category-level generalization, resolving geometric ambiguities, and attention to subtle geometric details. We evaluate our method across eight tasks involving articulated objects and instances with varying shapes and textures from multiple object categories. Our method demonstrates its effectiveness by increasing Diffusion Policy's average success rate on unseen instances from 20% to 93%. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis and visualization to interpret the sources of performance gain and explain how our method can generalize to novel instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun-En Ding, Chien-Chin Hsu, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The classification of medical images is a pivotal aspect of disease diagnosis, often enhanced by deep learning techniques. However, traditional approaches typically focus on unimodal medical image data, neglecting the integration of diverse non-image patient data. This paper proposes a novel Cross-Graph Modal Contrastive Learning (CGMCL) framework for multimodal medical image classification. The model effectively integrates both image and non-image data by constructing cross-modality graphs and leveraging contrastive learning to align multimodal features in a shared latent space. An inter-modality feature scaling module further optimizes the representation learning process by reducing the gap between heterogeneous modalities. The proposed approach is evaluated on two datasets: a Parkinson's disease (PD) dataset and a public melanoma dataset. Results demonstrate that CGMCL outperforms conventional unimodal methods in accuracy, interpretability, and early disease prediction. Additionally, the method shows superior performance in multi-class melanoma classification. The CGMCL framework provides valuable insights into medical image classification while offering improved disease interpretability and predictive capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate hippocampus segmentation in brain MRI is critical for studying cognitive and memory functions and diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders. While high-field MRIs provide detailed imaging, low-field MRIs are more accessible and cost-effective, which eliminates the need for sedation in children, though they often suffer from lower image quality. In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning approach for the automatic segmentation of bilateral hippocampi in low-field MRIs. Extending recent advancements in infant brain segmentation to underserved communities through the use of low-field MRIs ensures broader access to essential diagnostic tools, thereby supporting better healthcare outcomes for all children. Inspired by our previous work, Co-BioNet, the proposed model employs a dual-view structure to enable mutual feature learning via high-frequency masking, enhancing segmentation accuracy by leveraging complementary information from different perspectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method provides reliable segmentation outcomes for hippocampal analysis in low-resource settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ran An, Ke Chen, Hongwei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep-learning methods have shown promising performance for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstruction. However, supervised methods face the problem of lacking labeled data in clinical scenarios, and the CNN-based unsupervised denoising methods would cause excessive smoothing in the reconstructed image. Recently, the normalizing flows (NFs) based methods have shown advantages in producing detail-rich images and avoiding over-smoothing, however, there are still issues: (1) Although the alternating optimization in the data and latent space can well utilize the regularization and generation capabilities of NFs, the current two-way transformation strategy of noisy images and latent variables would cause detail loss and secondary artifacts; and (2) Training NFs on high-resolution CT images is hard due to huge computation. Though using conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) to learn conditional probability can reduce the computational burden, current methods require labeled data for conditionalization, and the unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction remains a problem. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel CNFs-based unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm. It employs strict one-way transformation when performing alternating optimization in the dual spaces, thus effectively avoiding the problems of detail loss and secondary artifacts. By proposing a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy, we train CNFs on high-resolution CT images, thus achieving fast and high-quality unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments on different datasets suggest that the performance of the proposed algorithm could surpass some state-of-the-art unsupervised and even supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael John Fanous, Christopher Michael Seybold, Hanlong Chen, Nir Pillar, Aydogan Ozcan</p>
<p>Abstract: We developed a rapid scanning optical microscope, termed "BlurryScope", that leverages continuous image acquisition and deep learning to provide a cost-effective and compact solution for automated inspection and analysis of tissue sections. BlurryScope integrates specialized hardware with a neural network-based model to quickly process motion-blurred histological images and perform automated pathology classification. This device offers comparable speed to commercial digital pathology scanners, but at a significantly lower price point and smaller size/weight, making it ideal for fast triaging in small clinics, as well as for resource-limited settings. To demonstrate the proof-of-concept of BlurryScope, we implemented automated classification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) scores on immunohistochemically (IHC) stained breast tissue sections, achieving concordant results with those obtained from a high-end digital scanning microscope. We evaluated this approach by scanning HER2-stained tissue microarrays (TMAs) at a continuous speed of 5 mm/s, which introduces bidirectional motion blur artifacts. These compromised images were then used to train our network models. Using a test set of 284 unique patient cores, we achieved blind testing accuracies of 79.3% and 89.7% for 4-class (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) and 2-class (0/1+ , 2+/3+) HER2 score classification, respectively. BlurryScope automates the entire workflow, from image scanning to stitching and cropping of regions of interest, as well as HER2 score classification. We believe BlurryScope has the potential to enhance the current pathology infrastructure in resource-scarce environments, save diagnostician time and bolster cancer identification and classification across various clinical environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinpeng Liu, Junxuan Liang, Zili Lin, Haowen Hou, Yong-Lu Li, Cewu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse dynamics (ID), which aims at reproducing the driven torques from human kinematic observations, has been a critical tool for gait analysis. However, it is hindered from wider application to general motion due to its limited scalability. Conventional optimization-based ID requires expensive laboratory setups, restricting its availability. To alleviate this problem, we propose to exploit the recently progressive human motion imitation algorithms to learn human inverse dynamics in a data-driven manner. The key insight is that the human ID knowledge is implicitly possessed by motion imitators, though not directly applicable. In light of this, we devise an efficient data collection pipeline with state-of-the-art motion imitation algorithms and physics simulators, resulting in a large-scale human inverse dynamics benchmark as Imitated Dynamics (ImDy). ImDy contains over 150 hours of motion with joint torque and full-body ground reaction force data. With ImDy, we train a data-driven human inverse dynamics solver ImDyS(olver) in a fully supervised manner, which conducts ID and ground reaction force estimation simultaneously. Experiments on ImDy and real-world data demonstrate the impressive competency of ImDyS in human inverse dynamics and ground reaction force estimation. Moreover, the potential of ImDy(-S) as a fundamental motion analysis tool is exhibited with downstream applications. The project page is https://foruck.github.io/ImDy/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujia Li, Han Li, ans S. Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on causal reasoning and longitudinal analysis. For example, for a patient with Alzheimer's disease (AD), how will the brain grey matter atrophy in a year if intervened on the A-beta level in cerebrospinal fluid? The answer is fundamental to diagnosis and follow-up treatment. However, this kind of inquiry involves counterfactual medical images which can not be acquired by instrumental or correlation-based image synthesis models. Yet, such queries require counterfactual medical images, not obtainable through standard image synthesis models. Hence, a causal longitudinal image synthesis (CLIS) method, enabling the synthesis of such images, is highly valuable. However, building a CLIS model confronts three primary yet unmet challenges: mismatched dimensionality between high-dimensional images and low-dimensional tabular variables, inconsistent collection intervals of follow-up data, and inadequate causal modeling capability of existing causal graph methods for image data. In this paper, we established a tabular-visual causal graph (TVCG) for CLIS overcoming these challenges through a novel integration of generative imaging, continuous-time modeling, and structural causal models combined with a neural network. We train our CLIS based on the ADNI dataset and evaluate it on two other AD datasets, which illustrate the outstanding yet controllable quality of the synthesized images and the contributions of synthesized MRI to the characterization of AD progression, substantiating the reliability and utility in clinics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elif Ceren Gok Yildirim, Murat Onur Yildirim, Joaquin Vanschoren</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) methods usually learn from all available data. However, this is not the case in human cognition which efficiently focuses on key experiences while disregarding the redundant information. Similarly, not all data points in a dataset have equal potential; some can be more informative than others. This disparity may significantly impact the performance, as both the quality and quantity of samples directly influence the model's generalizability and efficiency. Drawing inspiration from this, we explore the potential of learning from important samples and present an empirical study for evaluating coreset selection techniques in the context of CL to stimulate research in this unexplored area. We train different continual learners on increasing amounts of selected samples and investigate the learning-forgetting dynamics by shedding light on the underlying mechanisms driving their improved stability-plasticity balance. We present several significant observations: learning from selectively chosen samples (i) enhances incremental accuracy, (ii) improves knowledge retention of previous tasks, and (iii) refines learned representations. This analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of selective learning strategies in CL scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ach. Khozaimi, Wayan Firdaus Mahmudy</p>
<p>Abstract: The Pap smear is a screening method for early cervical cancer diagnosis. The selection of the right optimizer in the convolutional neural network (CNN) model is key to the success of the CNN in image classification, including the classification of cervical cancer Pap smear images. In this study, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), RMSprop, Adam, AdaGrad, AdaDelta, Adamax, and Nadam optimizers were used to classify cervical cancer Pap smear images from the SipakMed dataset. Resnet-18, Resnet-34, and VGG-16 are the CNN architectures used in this study, and each architecture uses a transfer-learning model. Based on the test results, we conclude that the transfer learning model performs better on all CNNs and optimization techniques and that in the transfer learning model, the optimization has little influence on the training of the model. Adamax, with accuracy values of 72.8% and 66.8%, had the best accuracy for the VGG-16 and Resnet-18 architectures, respectively. Resnet-34 had 54.0%. This is 0.034% lower than Nadam. Overall, Adamax is a suitable optimizer for CNN in cervical cancer classification on Resnet-18, Resnet-34, and VGG-16 architectures. This study provides new insights into the configuration of CNN models for Pap smear image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nils Blank, Moritz Reuss, Marcel R\"uhle, \"Omer Erdin\c{c} Ya\u{g}murlu, Fabian Wenzel, Oier Mees, Rudolf Lioutikov</p>
<p>Abstract: A central challenge towards developing robots that can relate human language to their perception and actions is the scarcity of natural language annotations in diverse robot datasets. Moreover, robot policies that follow natural language instructions are typically trained on either templated language or expensive human-labeled instructions, hindering their scalability. To this end, we introduce NILS: Natural language Instruction Labeling for Scalability. NILS automatically labels uncurated, long-horizon robot data at scale in a zero-shot manner without any human intervention. NILS combines pretrained vision-language foundation models in order to detect objects in a scene, detect object-centric changes, segment tasks from large datasets of unlabelled interaction data and ultimately label behavior datasets. Evaluations on BridgeV2, Fractal, and a kitchen play dataset show that NILS can autonomously annotate diverse robot demonstrations of unlabeled and unstructured datasets while alleviating several shortcomings of crowdsourced human annotations, such as low data quality and diversity. We use NILS to label over 115k trajectories obtained from over 430 hours of robot data. We open-source our auto-labeling code and generated annotations on our website: http://robottasklabeling.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiyan Feng, Tianyu Liu, Hong Wang, Jun Zhao, Wei Li, Yanshen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection through imaging and accurate diagnosis is crucial in mitigating the high mortality rate associated with breast cancer. However, locating tumors from low-resolution and high-noise medical images is extremely challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel PGDiffSeg (Prior-Guided Diffusion Denoising Model with Parameter-Shared Attention) that applies diffusion denoising methods to breast cancer medical image segmentation, accurately recovering the affected areas from Gaussian noise. Firstly, we design a parallel pipeline for noise processing and semantic information processing and propose a parameter-shared attention module (PSA) in multi-layer that seamlessly integrates these two pipelines. This integration empowers PGDiffSeg to incorporate semantic details at multiple levels during the denoising process, producing highly accurate segmentation maps. Secondly, we introduce a guided strategy that leverages prior knowledge to simulate the decision-making process of medical professionals, thereby enhancing the model's ability to locate tumor positions precisely. Finally, we provide the first-ever discussion on the interpretability of the generative diffusion model in the context of breast cancer segmentation. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our model over the current state-of-the-art approaches, confirming its effectiveness as a flexible diffusion denoising method suitable for medical image research. Our code will be publicly available later.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Wang, Yuanchao Bai, Daxin Li, Deming Zhai, Junjun Jiang, Xianming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in learning-based methods have markedly enhanced the capabilities of image compression. However, these methods struggle with high bit-depth volumetric medical images, facing issues such as degraded performance, increased memory demand, and reduced processing speed. To address these challenges, this paper presents the Bit-Division based Lossless Volumetric Image Compression (BD-LVIC) framework, which is tailored for high bit-depth medical volume compression. The BD-LVIC framework skillfully divides the high bit-depth volume into two lower bit-depth segments: the Most Significant Bit-Volume (MSBV) and the Least Significant Bit-Volume (LSBV). The MSBV concentrates on the most significant bits of the volumetric medical image, capturing vital structural details in a compact manner. This reduction in complexity greatly improves compression efficiency using traditional codecs. Conversely, the LSBV deals with the least significant bits, which encapsulate intricate texture details. To compress this detailed information effectively, we introduce an effective learning-based compression model equipped with a Transformer-Based Feature Alignment Module, which exploits both intra-slice and inter-slice redundancies to accurately align features. Subsequently, a Parallel Autoregressive Coding Module merges these features to precisely estimate the probability distribution of the least significant bit-planes. Our extensive testing demonstrates that the BD-LVIC framework not only sets new performance benchmarks across various datasets but also maintains a competitive coding speed, highlighting its significant potential and practical utility in the realm of volumetric medical image compression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Liu, Kang You, Pan Gao, Manoranjan Paul</p>
<p>Abstract: With the great progress of 3D sensing and acquisition technology, the volume of point cloud data has grown dramatically, which urges the development of efficient point cloud compression methods. In this paper, we focus on the task of learned lossy point cloud attribute compression (PCAC). We propose an efficient attention-based method for lossy compression of point cloud attributes leveraging on an autoencoder architecture. Specifically, at the encoding side, we conduct multiple downsampling to best exploit the local attribute patterns, in which effective External Cross Attention (ECA) is devised to hierarchically aggregate features by intergrating attributes and geometry contexts. At the decoding side, the attributes of the point cloud are progressively reconstructed based on the multi-scale representation and the zero-padding upsampling tactic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to introduce attention mechanism to point-based lossy PCAC task. We verify the compression efficiency of our model on various sequences, including human body frames, sparse objects, and large-scale point cloud scenes. Experiments show that our method achieves an average improvement of 1.15 dB and 2.13 dB in BD-PSNR of Y channel and YUV channel, respectively, when comparing with the state-of-the-art point-based method Deep-PCAC.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linger Deng, Yuliang Liu, Bohan Li, Dongliang Luo, Liang Wu, Chengquan Zhang, Pengyuan Lyu, Ziyang Zhang, Gang Zhang, Errui Ding, Yingying Zhu, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) struggle with mathematical geometric reasoning due to a lack of high-quality image-text paired data. Current geometric data generation approaches, which apply preset templates to generate geometric data or use Large Language Models (LLMs) to rephrase questions and answers (Q&A), unavoidably limit data accuracy and diversity. To synthesize higher-quality data, we propose a two-stage Reverse Chain-of-Thought (R-CoT) geometry problem generation pipeline. First, we introduce GeoChain to produce high-fidelity geometric images and corresponding descriptions highlighting relations among geometric elements. We then design a Reverse A&Q method that reasons step-by-step based on the descriptions and generates questions in reverse from the reasoning results. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method brings significant and consistent improvements on multiple LMM baselines, achieving new performance records in the 2B, 7B, and 8B settings. Notably, R-CoT-8B significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art open-source mathematical models by 16.6% on MathVista and 9.2% on GeoQA, while also surpassing the closed-source model GPT-4o by an average of 13% across both datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Cagas, Chan Ko, Blake Hsiao, Shryuk Grandhi, Rishi Bhattacharya, Kevin Zhu, Michael Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of machine learning models in diverse clinical applications has led to a growing need for high-fidelity, medical image training data. Such data is often scarce due to cost constraints and privacy concerns. Alleviating this burden, medical image synthesis via generative adversarial networks (GANs) emerged as a powerful method for synthetically generating photo-realistic images based on existing sets of real medical images. However, the exact image set size required to efficiently train such a GAN is unclear. In this work, we experimentally establish benchmarks that measure the relationship between a sample dataset size and the fidelity of the generated images, given the dataset's distribution of image complexities. We analyze statistical metrics based on delentropy, an image complexity measure rooted in Shannon's entropy in information theory. For our pipeline, we conduct experiments with two state-of-the-art GANs, StyleGAN 3 and SPADE-GAN, trained on multiple medical imaging datasets with variable sample sizes. Across both GANs, general performance improved with increasing training set size but suffered with increasing complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Aloisi, Luigi Sigillo, Aurelio Uncini, Danilo Comminiello</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as a superior alternative to generative adversarial networks (GANs) for high-fidelity image generation, with wide applications in text-to-image generation, image-to-image translation, and super-resolution. However, their real-time feasibility is hindered by slow training and inference speeds. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a wavelet-based conditional Diffusion GAN scheme for Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR). Our approach utilizes the diffusion GAN paradigm to reduce the timesteps required by the reverse diffusion process and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to achieve dimensionality reduction, decreasing training and inference times significantly. The results of an experimental validation on the CelebA-HQ dataset confirm the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methodologies successfully ensuring high-fidelity output while overcoming inherent drawbacks associated with diffusion models in time-sensitive applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Zhou, Animesh Garg, Dieter Fox, Caelan Garrett, Ajay Mandlekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot learning has proven to be a general and effective technique for programming manipulators. Imitation learning is able to teach robots solely from human demonstrations but is bottlenecked by the capabilities of the demonstrations. Reinforcement learning uses exploration to discover better behaviors; however, the space of possible improvements can be too large to start from scratch. And for both techniques, the learning difficulty increases proportional to the length of the manipulation task. Accounting for this, we propose SPIRE, a system that first uses Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) to decompose tasks into smaller learning subproblems and second combines imitation and reinforcement learning to maximize their strengths. We develop novel strategies to train learning agents when deployed in the context of a planning system. We evaluate SPIRE on a suite of long-horizon and contact-rich robot manipulation problems. We find that SPIRE outperforms prior approaches that integrate imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and planning by 35% to 50% in average task performance, is 6 times more data efficient in the number of human demonstrations needed to train proficient agents, and learns to complete tasks nearly twice as efficiently.

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a unified representation for Super-Resolution (SR) and Image Compression, termed **Factorized Fields**, motivated by the shared principles between these two tasks. Both SISR and Image Compression require recovering and preserving fine image details--whether by enhancing resolution or reconstructing compressed data. Unlike previous methods that mainly focus on network architecture, our proposed approach utilizes a basis-coefficient decomposition to explicitly capture multi-scale visual features and structural components in images, addressing the core challenges of both tasks. We first derive our SR model, which includes a Coefficient Backbone and Basis Swin Transformer for generalizable Factorized Fields. Then, to further unify these two tasks, we leverage the strong information-recovery capabilities of the trained SR modules as priors in the compression pipeline, improving both compression efficiency and detail reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a merged-basis compression branch that consolidates shared structures, further optimizing the compression process. Extensive experiments show that our unified representation delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average relative improvement of 204.4% in PSNR over the baseline in Super-Resolution (SR) and 9.35% BD-rate reduction in Image Compression compared to the previous SOTA.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a framework ARBEx, a novel attentive feature extraction framework driven by Vision Transformer with reliability balancing to cope against poor class distributions, bias, and uncertainty in the facial expression learning (FEL) task. We reinforce several data pre-processing and refinement methods along with a window-based cross-attention ViT to squeeze the best of the data. We also employ learnable anchor points in the embedding space with label distributions and multi-head self-attention mechanism to optimize performance against weak predictions with reliability balancing, which is a strategy that leverages anchor points, attention scores, and confidence values to enhance the resilience of label predictions. To ensure correct label classification and improve the models' discriminative power, we introduce anchor loss, which encourages large margins between anchor points. Additionally, the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which is also trainable, plays an integral role in identifying accurate labels. This approach provides critical elements for improving the reliability of predictions and has a substantial positive effect on final prediction capabilities. Our adaptive model can be integrated with any deep neural network to forestall challenges in various recognition tasks. Our strategy outperforms current state-of-the-art methodologies, according to extensive experiments conducted in a variety of contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods primarily focus on directly learning qualified target features, making it challenging to guarantee their discrimination in the absence of target labels. This work provides a new perspective. We observe that the features learned with source data manage to keep categorically discriminative during training, thereby enabling us to implicitly learn adequate target representations by simply \textbf{pulling target features close to source features for each category}. To this end, we propose T2S-DA, which we interpret as a form of pulling Target to Source for Domain Adaptation, encouraging the model in learning similar cross-domain features. Also, considering the pixel categories are heavily imbalanced for segmentation datasets, we come up with a dynamic re-weighting strategy to help the model concentrate on those underperforming classes. Extensive experiments confirm that T2S-DA learns a more discriminative and generalizable representation, significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art. We further show that our method is quite qualified for the domain generalization task, verifying its domain-invariant property.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality, realistic images from textual descriptions. However, these approaches have faced challenges in precisely aligning the generated visual content with the textual concepts described in the prompts. In this paper, we propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine semantic re-alignment method, named RealignDiff, aimed at improving the alignment between text and images in text-to-image diffusion models. In the coarse semantic re-alignment phase, a novel caption reward, leveraging the BLIP-2 model, is proposed to evaluate the semantic discrepancy between the generated image caption and the given text prompt. Subsequently, the fine semantic re-alignment stage employs a local dense caption generation module and a re-weighting attention modulation module to refine the previously generated images from a local semantic view. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and ViLG-300 datasets demonstrate that the proposed two-stage coarse-to-fine semantic re-alignment method outperforms other baseline re-alignment techniques by a substantial margin in both visual quality and semantic similarity with the input prompt.</p>

<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art visual localization methods mostly rely on complex procedures to match local descriptors and 3D point clouds. However, these procedures can incur significant costs in terms of inference, storage, and updates over time. In this study, we propose a direct learning-based approach that utilizes a simple network named D2S to represent complex local descriptors and their scene coordinates. Our method is characterized by its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. It solely leverages a single RGB image for localization during the testing phase and only requires a lightweight model to encode a complex sparse scene. The proposed D2S employs a combination of a simple loss function and graph attention to selectively focus on robust descriptors while disregarding areas such as clouds, trees, and several dynamic objects. This selective attention enables D2S to effectively perform a binary-semantic classification for sparse descriptors. Additionally, we propose a simple outdoor dataset to evaluate the capabilities of visual localization methods in scene-specific generalization and self-updating from unlabeled observations. Our approach outperforms the previous regression-based methods in both indoor and outdoor environments. It demonstrates the ability to generalize beyond training data, including scenarios involving transitions from day to night and adapting to domain shifts.

<p>Abstract: To integrate self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition methods into autonomous robotic systems, it is crucial to consider adverse situations involving target occlusions. Such a scenario, despite its practical relevance, is rarely addressed in existing self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition methods. To empower models with the capacity to address occlusion, we propose a simple and effective method. We first pre-train using occluded skeleton sequences, then use k-means clustering (KMeans) on sequence embeddings to group semantically similar samples. Next, we propose KNN-Imputation to fill in missing skeleton data based on the closest sample neighbors. Imputing incomplete skeleton sequences to create relatively complete sequences as input provides significant benefits to existing skeleton-based self-supervised methods. Meanwhile, building on the state-of-the-art Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (PSTL), we introduce an Occluded Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (OPSTL) framework. This enhancement utilizes Adaptive Spatial Masking (ASM) for better use of high-quality, intact skeletons. The new proposed method is verified on the challenging occluded versions of the NTURGB+D 60 and NTURGB+D 120. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/cyfml/OPSTL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Lonnqvist, Zhengqing Wu, Michael H. Herzog</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans are able to segment images effortlessly without supervision using perceptual grouping. Here, we propose a counter-intuitive computational approach to solving unsupervised perceptual grouping and segmentation: that they arise because of neural noise, rather than in spite of it. We (1) mathematically demonstrate that under realistic assumptions, neural noise can be used to separate objects from each other; (2) that adding noise in a DNN enables the network to segment images even though it was never trained on any segmentation labels; and (3) that segmenting objects using noise results in segmentation performance that aligns with the perceptual grouping phenomena observed in humans, and is sample-efficient. We introduce the Good Gestalt (GG) datasets -- six datasets designed to specifically test perceptual grouping, and show that our DNN models reproduce many important phenomena in human perception, such as illusory contours, closure, continuity, proximity, and occlusion. Finally, we (4) show that our model improves performance on our GG datasets compared to other tested unsupervised models by $24.9\%$. Together, our results suggest a novel unsupervised segmentation method requiring few assumptions, a new explanation for the formation of perceptual grouping, and a novel potential benefit of neural noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyank N Gowda, Laura Sevilla-Lara</p>
<p>Abstract: Video understanding has long suffered from reliance on large labeled datasets, motivating research into zero-shot learning. Recent progress in language modeling presents opportunities to advance zero-shot video analysis, but constructing an effective semantic space relating action classes remains challenging. We address this by introducing a novel dataset, Stories, which contains rich textual descriptions for diverse action classes extracted from WikiHow articles. For each class, we extract multi-sentence narratives detailing the necessary steps, scenes, objects, and verbs that characterize the action. This contextual data enables modeling of nuanced relationships between actions, paving the way for zero-shot transfer. We also propose an approach that harnesses Stories to improve feature generation for training zero-shot classification. Without any target dataset fine-tuning, our method achieves new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks, improving top-1 accuracy by up to 6.1%. We believe Stories provides a valuable resource that can catalyze progress in zero-shot action recognition. The textual narratives forge connections between seen and unseen classes, overcoming the bottleneck of labeled data that has long impeded advancements in this exciting domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Tang, Jieren Deng, Zhihong Pan, Hao Tian, Pratik Chaudhari, Xin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating a diverse array of high-quality images, sparking interests for styled avatars, virtual try-on, and more. Previous methods use the same reference image as the target. An overlooked aspect is the leakage of the target's spatial information, style, etc. from the reference, harming the generated diversity and causing shortcuts. However, this approach continues as widely available datasets usually consist of single images not grouped by identities, and it is expensive to recollect large-scale same-identity data. Moreover, existing metrics adopt decoupled evaluation on text alignment and identity preservation, which fail at distinguishing between balanced outputs and those that over-fit to one aspect. In this paper, we propose a multi-level, same-identity dataset RetriBooru, which groups anime characters by both face and cloth identities. RetriBooru enables adopting reference images of the same character and outfits as the target, while keeping flexible gestures and actions. We benchmark previous methods on our dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of training with a reference image different from target (but same identity). We introduce a new concept composition task, where the conditioning encoder learns to retrieve different concepts from several reference images, and modify a baseline network RetriNet for the new task. Finally, we introduce a novel class of metrics named Similarity Weighted Diversity (SWD), to measure the overlooked diversity and better evaluate the alignment between similarity and diversity.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the domain of vision-language integration, generating detailed image captions poses a significant challenge due to the lack of curated and rich datasets. This study introduces PixLore, a novel method that leverages Querying Transformers through the fine-tuning of the BLIP-2 model using the LoRa method on a standard commercial GPU. The followed approach, which involves training on a carefully assembled dataset from state-of-the-art Computer Vision models combined and augmented by ChatGPT, addresses the question of whether intricate image understanding can be achieved with an ensemble of smaller-scale models, referred to as Knowledge Stitching. Comparative evaluations against major models such as GPT-4 and Google Bard demonstrate that PixLore-2.7B, despite having considerably fewer parameters, is rated higher than the existing State-of-the-Art models in over half of the assessments. Precisely, PixLore outperform Bard and BLIP-2, which score approximately 35.18% and 27.98% lower than PixLore in the task of image captioning. This research not only presents a groundbreaking approach but also highlights the importance of well-curated datasets in enhancing the performance of smaller models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichi Zhang, Jin Yang, Yuchen Liu, Yuan Cheng, Yuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has attracted much attention due to its less dependence on acquiring abundant annotations from experts compared to fully supervised methods, which is especially important for medical image segmentation which typically requires intensive pixel/voxel-wise labeling by domain experts. Although semi-supervised methods can improve the performance by utilizing unlabeled data, there are still gaps between fully supervised methods under extremely limited annotation scenarios. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient strategy to explore the usage of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for enhancing semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Concretely, the segmentation model trained with domain knowledge provides information for localization and generating input prompts to the SAM. Then the generated pseudo-labels of SAM are utilized as additional supervision to assist in the learning procedure of the semi-supervised framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemiSAM significantly improves the performance of existing semi-supervised frameworks when only one or a few labeled images are available and shows strong efficiency as a plug-and-play strategy for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zebin Yun, Achi-Or Weingarten, Eyal Ronen, Mahmood Sharif</p>
<p>Abstract: To help adversarial examples generalize from surrogate machine-learning (ML) models to targets, certain transferability-based black-box evasion attacks incorporate data augmentations (e.g., random resizing). Yet, prior work has explored limited augmentations and their composition. To fill the gap, we systematically studied how data augmentation affects transferability. Specifically, we explored 46 augmentation techniques originally proposed to help ML models generalize to unseen benign samples, and assessed how they impact transferability, when applied individually or composed. Performing exhaustive search on a small subset of augmentation techniques and genetic search on all techniques, we identified augmentation combinations that help promote transferability. Extensive experiments with the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets and 18 models showed that simple color-space augmentations (e.g., color to greyscale) attain high transferability when combined with standard augmentations. Furthermore, we discovered that composing augmentations impacts transferability mostly monotonically (i.e., more augmentations $\rightarrow$ $\ge$transferability). We also found that the best composition significantly outperformed the state of the art (e.g., 91.8% vs. $\le$82.5% average transferability to adversarially trained targets on ImageNet). Lastly, our theoretical analysis, backed by empirical evidence, intuitively explains why certain augmentations promote transferability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dvir Samuel, Barak Meiri, Haggai Maron, Yoad Tewel, Nir Darshan, Shai Avidan, Gal Chechik, Rami Ben-Ari</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion inversion is the problem of taking an image and a text prompt that describes it and finding a noise latent that would generate the exact same image. Most current deterministic inversion techniques operate by approximately solving an implicit equation and may converge slowly or yield poor reconstructed images. We formulate the problem by finding the roots of an implicit equation and devlop a method to solve it efficiently. Our solution is based on Newton-Raphson (NR), a well-known technique in numerical analysis. We show that a vanilla application of NR is computationally infeasible while naively transforming it to a computationally tractable alternative tends to converge to out-of-distribution solutions, resulting in poor reconstruction and editing. We therefore derive an efficient guided formulation that fastly converges and provides high-quality reconstructions and editing. We showcase our method on real image editing with three popular open-sourced diffusion models: Stable Diffusion, SDXL-Turbo, and Flux with different deterministic schedulers. Our solution, Guided Newton-Raphson Inversion, inverts an image within 0.4 sec (on an A100 GPU) for few-step models (SDXL-Turbo and Flux.1), opening the door for interactive image editing. We further show improved results in image interpolation and generation of rare objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joao P. C. Bertoldo, Dick Ameln, Ashwin Vaidya, Samet Ak\c{c}ay</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in visual anomaly detection research have seen AUROC and AUPRO scores on public benchmark datasets such as MVTec and VisA converge towards perfect recall, giving the impression that these benchmarks are near-solved. However, high AUROC and AUPRO scores do not always reflect qualitative performance, which limits the validity of these metrics in real-world applications. We argue that the artificial ceiling imposed by the lack of an adequate evaluation metric restrains progression of the field, and it is crucial that we revisit the evaluation metrics used to rate our algorithms. In response, we introduce Per-IMage Overlap (PIMO), a novel metric that addresses the shortcomings of AUROC and AUPRO. PIMO retains the recall-based nature of the existing metrics but introduces two distinctions: the assignment of curves (and respective area under the curve) is per-image, and its X-axis relies solely on normal images. Measuring recall per image simplifies instance score indexing and is more robust to noisy annotations. As we show, it also accelerates computation and enables the usage of statistical tests to compare models. By imposing low tolerance for false positives on normal images, PIMO provides an enhanced model validation procedure and highlights performance variations across datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that PIMO offers practical advantages and nuanced performance insights that redefine anomaly detection benchmarks -- notably challenging the perception that MVTec AD and VisA datasets have been solved by contemporary models.

<p>Abstract: We present JointMotion, a self-supervised pre-training method for joint motion prediction in self-driving vehicles. Our method jointly optimizes a scene-level objective connecting motion and environments, and an instance-level objective to refine learned representations. Scene-level representations are learned via non-contrastive similarity learning of past motion sequences and environment context. At the instance level, we use masked autoencoding to refine multimodal polyline representations. We complement this with an adaptive pre-training decoder that enables JointMotion to generalize across different environment representations, fusion mechanisms, and dataset characteristics. Notably, our method reduces the joint final displacement error of Wayformer, HPTR, and Scene Transformer models by 3\%, 8\%, and 12\%, respectively; and enables transfer learning between the Waymo Open Motion and the Argoverse 2 Motion Forecasting datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Chen, Junchen Zhu, Xu Luo, Hengtao Shen, Lianli Gao, Jingkuan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning represents a prevalent strategy employed by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to align with human instructions and adapt to new tasks. Nevertheless, MLLMs encounter the challenge of adapting to users' evolving knowledge and demands. Therefore, how to retain existing skills while acquiring new knowledge needs to be investigated. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark, namely Continual Instruction tuNing (CoIN), to assess existing MLLMs in the sequential instruction tuning paradigm. CoIN comprises 10 commonly used datasets spanning 8 task categories, ensuring a diverse range of instructions and tasks. Besides, the trained model is evaluated from two aspects: Instruction Following and General Knowledge, which assess the alignment with human intention and knowledge preserved for reasoning, respectively. Experiments on CoIN demonstrate that current powerful MLLMs still suffer catastrophic forgetting, and the failure in intention alignment assumes the main responsibility, instead of the knowledge forgetting. To this end, we introduce MoELoRA to MLLMs which is effective to retain the previous instruction alignment. Experimental results consistently illustrate the forgetting decreased from this method on CoIN.</p>

<p>Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks to imperceptible adversarial perturbations has attracted widespread attention. Inspired by the success of vision-language foundation models, previous efforts achieved zero-shot adversarial robustness by aligning adversarial visual features with text supervision. However, in practice, they are still unsatisfactory due to several issues, including heavy adaptation cost, suboptimal text supervision, and uncontrolled natural generalization capacity. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a few-shot adversarial prompt framework where adapting input sequences with limited data makes significant adversarial robustness improvement. Specifically, we achieve this by providing adversarially correlated text supervision that is end-to-end learned from adversarial examples. We also propose a novel training objective that enhances the consistency of multi-modal features while encourages differentiated uni-modal features between natural and adversarial examples. The proposed framework gives access to learn adversarial text supervision, which provides superior cross-modal adversarial alignment and matches state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness with only 1% training data.

<p>Abstract: Accurate trajectory forecasting is crucial for the performance of various systems, such as advanced driver-assistance systems and self-driving vehicles. These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renyang Liu, Kwok-Yan Lam, Wei Zhou, Sixing Wu, Jun Zhao, Dongting Hu, Mingming Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Many attack techniques have been proposed to explore the vulnerability of DNNs and further help to improve their robustness. Despite the significant progress made recently, existing black-box attack methods still suffer from unsatisfactory performance due to the vast number of queries needed to optimize desired perturbations. Besides, the other critical challenge is that adversarial examples built in a noise-adding manner are abnormal and struggle to successfully attack robust models, whose robustness is enhanced by adversarial training against small perturbations. There is no doubt that these two issues mentioned above will significantly increase the risk of exposure and result in a failure to dig deeply into the vulnerability of DNNs. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate DNNs' fragility sufficiently under query-limited settings in a non-additional way. In this paper, we propose the Spatial Transform Black-box Attack (STBA), a novel framework to craft formidable adversarial examples in the query-limited scenario. Specifically, STBA introduces a flow field to the high-frequency part of clean images to generate adversarial examples and adopts the following two processes to enhance their naturalness and significantly improve the query efficiency: a) we apply an estimated flow field to the high-frequency part of clean images to generate adversarial examples instead of introducing external noise to the benign image, and b) we leverage an efficient gradient estimation method based on a batch of samples to optimize such an ideal flow field under query-limited settings. Compared to existing score-based black-box baselines, extensive experiments indicated that STBA could effectively improve the imperceptibility of the adversarial examples and remarkably boost the attack success rate under query-limited settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of various adapters, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied from the field of natural language processing, has allowed diffusion models to personalize image generation at a low cost. However, due to the various challenges including limited datasets and shortage of regularization and computation resources, adapter training often results in unsatisfactory outcomes, leading to the corruption of the backbone model's prior knowledge. One of the well known phenomena is the loss of diversity in object generation, especially within the same class which leads to generating almost identical objects with minor variations. This poses challenges in generation capabilities. To solve this issue, we present Contrastive Adapter Training (CAT), a simple yet effective strategy to enhance adapter training through the application of CAT loss. Our approach facilitates the preservation of the base model's original knowledge when the model initiates adapters. Furthermore, we introduce the Knowledge Preservation Score (KPS) to evaluate CAT's ability to keep the former information. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare CAT's improvement. Finally, we mention the possibility of CAT in the aspects of multi-concept adapter and optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Camera calibration in broadcast sports videos presents numerous challenges for accurate sports field registration due to multiple camera angles, varying camera parameters, and frequent occlusions of the field. Traditional search-based methods depend on initial camera pose estimates, which can struggle in non-standard positions and dynamic environments. In response, we propose an optimization-based calibration pipeline that leverages a 3D soccer field model and a predefined set of keypoints to overcome these limitations. Our method also introduces a novel refinement module that improves initial calibration by using detected field lines in a non-linear optimization process. This approach outperforms existing techniques in both multi-view and single-view 3D camera calibration tasks, while maintaining competitive performance in homography estimation. Extensive experimentation on real-world soccer datasets, including SoccerNet-Calibration, WorldCup 2014, and TS-WorldCup, highlights the robustness and accuracy of our method across diverse broadcast scenarios. Our approach offers significant improvements in camera calibration precision and reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: A thorough understanding of the interaction between the target agent and surrounding agents is a prerequisite for accurate trajectory prediction. Although many methods have been explored, they all assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and calculates their correlations instead of attention scores. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. Additionally, ASPILin models the interacting agents at each past time step separately, rather than only modeling the interacting agents at the current time step. This clarifies the causal chain of the target agent's historical trajectory and helps the model better understand dynamic interactions. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byung-Kwan Lee, Chae Won Kim, Beomchan Park, Yong Man Ro</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language and vision models (LLVMs) has been driven by advances in visual instruction tuning. Recently, open-source LLVMs have curated high-quality visual instruction tuning datasets and utilized additional vision encoders or multiple computer vision models in order to narrow the performance gap with powerful closed-source LLVMs. These advancements are attributed to multifaceted information required for diverse capabilities, including fundamental image understanding, real-world knowledge about common-sense and non-object concepts (e.g., charts, diagrams, symbols, signs, and math problems), and step-by-step procedures for solving complex questions. Drawing from the multifaceted information, we present a new efficient LLVM, Mamba-based traversal of rationales (Meteor), which leverages multifaceted rationale to enhance understanding and answering capabilities. To embed lengthy rationales containing abundant information, we employ the Mamba architecture, capable of processing sequential data with linear time complexity. We introduce a new concept of traversal of rationale that facilitates efficient embedding of rationale. Subsequently, the backbone multimodal language model (MLM) is trained to generate answers with the aid of rationale. Through these steps, Meteor achieves significant improvements in vision language performances across multiple evaluation benchmarks requiring diverse capabilities, without scaling up the model size or employing additional vision encoders and computer vision models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijie Zhao, Yong Zhang, Xiaodong Cun, Shaoshu Yang, Muyao Niu, Xiaoyu Li, Wenbo Hu, Ying Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal compression of videos, utilizing networks such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE), plays a crucial role in OpenAI's SORA and numerous other video generative models. For instance, many LLM-like video models learn the distribution of discrete tokens derived from 3D VAEs within the VQVAE framework, while most diffusion-based video models capture the distribution of continuous latent extracted by 2D VAEs without quantization. The temporal compression is simply realized by uniform frame sampling which results in unsmooth motion between consecutive frames. Currently, there lacks of a commonly used continuous video (3D) VAE for latent diffusion-based video models in the research community. Moreover, since current diffusion-based approaches are often implemented using pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, directly training a video VAE without considering the compatibility with existing T2I models will result in a latent space gap between them, which will take huge computational resources for training to bridge the gap even with the T2I models as initialization. To address this issue, we propose a method for training a video VAE of latent video models, namely CV-VAE, whose latent space is compatible with that of a given image VAE, e.g., image VAE of Stable Diffusion (SD). The compatibility is achieved by the proposed novel latent space regularization, which involves formulating a regularization loss using the image VAE. Benefiting from the latent space compatibility, video models can be trained seamlessly from pre-trained T2I or video models in a truly spatio-temporally compressed latent space, rather than simply sampling video frames at equal intervals. With our CV-VAE, existing video models can generate four times more frames with minimal finetuning. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed video VAE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Young Koh, Sang Hyun Park, Joy Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent emergence of latent diffusion models such as SDXL and SD 1.5 has shown significant capability in generating highly detailed and realistic images. Despite their remarkable ability to produce images, generating accurate text within images still remains a challenging task. In this paper, we examine the validity of fine-tuning approaches in generating legible text within the image. We propose a low-cost approach by leveraging SDXL without any time-consuming training on large-scale datasets. The proposed strategy employs a fine-tuning technique that examines the effects of data refinement levels and synthetic captions. Moreover, our results demonstrate how our small scale fine-tuning approach can improve the accuracy of text generation in different scenarios without the need of additional multimodal encoders. Our experiments show that with the addition of random letters to our raw dataset, our model's performance improves in producing well-formed visual text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihan Wang, Zehai He, Wenyi Hong, Yean Cheng, Xiaohan Zhang, Ji Qi, Xiaotao Gu, Shiyu Huang, Bin Xu, Yuxiao Dong, Ming Ding, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models has markedly enhanced the understanding of short videos (typically under one minute), and several evaluation datasets have emerged accordingly. However, these advancements fall short of meeting the demands of real-world applications such as embodied intelligence for long-term decision-making, in-depth movie reviews and discussions, and live sports commentary, all of which require comprehension of long videos spanning several hours. To address this gap, we introduce LVBench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video understanding. Our dataset comprises publicly sourced videos and encompasses a diverse set of tasks aimed at long video comprehension and information extraction. LVBench is designed to challenge multimodal models to demonstrate long-term memory and extended comprehension capabilities. Our extensive evaluations reveal that current multimodal models still underperform on these demanding long video understanding tasks. Through LVBench, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of tackling the complexities of long video comprehension. Our data and code are publicly available at: https://lvbench.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Fang, Kangrui Mao, Haodong Duan, Xiangyu Zhao, Yining Li, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has spurred research into their applications in multi-modal contexts, particularly in video understanding. Traditional VideoQA benchmarks, despite providing quantitative metrics, often fail to encompass the full spectrum of video content and inadequately assess models' temporal comprehension. To address these limitations, we introduce MMBench-Video, a quantitative benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' proficiency in video understanding. MMBench-Video incorporates lengthy videos from YouTube and employs free-form questions, mirroring practical use cases. The benchmark is meticulously crafted to probe the models' temporal reasoning skills, with all questions human-annotated according to a carefully constructed ability taxonomy. We employ GPT-4 for automated assessment, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness over earlier LLM-based evaluations. Utilizing MMBench-Video, we have conducted comprehensive evaluations that include both proprietary and open-source LVLMs for images and videos. MMBench-Video stands as a valuable resource for the research community, facilitating improved evaluation of LVLMs and catalyzing progress in the field of video understanding. The evalutation code of MMBench-Video will be integrated into VLMEvalKit: https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Saiful Islam, Tariq Adnan, Jan Freyberg, Sangwu Lee, Abdelrahman Abdelkader, Meghan Pawlik, Cathe Schwartz, Karen Jaffe, Ruth B. Schneider, E Ray Dorsey, Ehsan Hoque</p>
<p>Abstract: Limited accessibility to neurological care leads to underdiagnosed Parkinson's Disease (PD), preventing early intervention. Existing AI-based PD detection methods primarily focus on unimodal analysis of motor or speech tasks, overlooking the multifaceted nature of the disease. To address this, we introduce a large-scale, multi-task video dataset consisting of 1102 sessions (each containing videos of finger tapping, facial expression, and speech tasks captured via webcam) from 845 participants (272 with PD). We propose a novel Uncertainty-calibrated Fusion Network (UFNet) that leverages this multimodal data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. UFNet employs independent task-specific networks, trained with Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification, followed by self-attended fusion of features, with attention weights dynamically adjusted based on task-specific uncertainties. To ensure patient-centered evaluation, the participants were randomly split into three sets: 60% for training, 20% for model selection, and 20% for final performance evaluation. UFNet significantly outperformed single-task models in terms of accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUROC), and sensitivity while maintaining non-inferior specificity. Withholding uncertain predictions further boosted the performance, achieving 88.0+-0.3%$ accuracy, 93.0+-0.2% AUROC, 79.3+-0.9% sensitivity, and 92.6+-0.3% specificity, at the expense of not being able to predict for 2.3+-0.3% data (+- denotes 95% confidence interval). Further analysis suggests that the trained model does not exhibit any detectable bias across sex and ethnic subgroups and is most effective for individuals aged between 50 and 80. Requiring only a webcam and microphone, our approach facilitates accessible home-based PD screening, especially in regions with limited healthcare resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Cai, Yuji Yang, Weihao Yuan, Yisheng He, Zilong Dong, Liefeng Bo, Hui Cheng, Qifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of estimating physical properties (system identification) through visual observations. To facilitate geometry-aware guidance in physical property estimation, we introduce a novel hybrid framework that leverages 3D Gaussian representation to not only capture explicit shapes but also enable the simulated continuum to render object masks as 2D shape surrogates during training.
  We propose a new dynamic 3D Gaussian framework based on motion factorization to recover the object as 3D Gaussian point sets across different time states.
  Furthermore, we develop a coarse-to-fine filling strategy to generate the density fields of the object from the Gaussian reconstruction, allowing for the extraction of object continuums along with their surfaces and the integration of Gaussian attributes into these continuums.
  In addition to the extracted object surfaces, the Gaussian-informed continuum also enables the rendering of object masks during simulations, serving as 2D-shape guidance for physical property estimation.
  Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and metrics. Additionally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through real-world demonstrations, showcasing its practical utility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Fournier-Montgieux, Michael Soumm, Adrian Popescu, Bertrand Luvison, Herv\'e Le Borgne</p>
<p>Abstract: Face recognition and verification are two computer vision tasks whose performance has progressed with the introduction of deep representations. However, ethical, legal, and technical challenges due to the sensitive character of face data and biases in real training datasets hinder their development. Generative AI addresses privacy by creating fictitious identities, but fairness problems persist. We promote fairness by introducing a demographic attributes balancing mechanism in generated training datasets. We experiment with an existing real dataset, three generated training datasets, and the balanced versions of a diffusion-based dataset. We propose a comprehensive evaluation that considers accuracy and fairness equally and includes a rigorous regression-based statistical analysis of attributes. The analysis shows that balancing reduces demographic unfairness. Also, a performance gap persists despite generation becoming more accurate with time. The proposed balancing method and comprehensive verification evaluation promote fairer and transparent face recognition and verification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vijay Sadashivaiah, Pingkun Yan, James A. Hendler</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have revolutionized medical imaging and diagnostics, yet their opaque nature poses challenges for clinical adoption and trust. Amongst approaches to improve model interpretability, concept-based explanations aim to provide concise and human-understandable explanations of any arbitrary classifier. However, such methods usually require a large amount of manually collected data with concept annotation, which is often scarce in the medical domain. In this paper, we propose Conceptual Counterfactual Explanations for Chest X-ray (CoCoX), which leverages the joint embedding space of an existing vision-language model (VLM) to explain black-box classifier outcomes without the need for annotated datasets. Specifically, we utilize textual concepts derived from chest radiography reports and a pre-trained chest radiography-based VLM to explain three common cardiothoracic pathologies. We demonstrate that the explanations generated by our method are semantically meaningful and faithful to underlying pathologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ameya Pore, Riccardo Muradore, Diego Dall'Alba</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms can learn robotic control tasks from visual observations, but they often require a large amount of data, especially when the visual scene is complex and unstructured. In this paper, we explore how the agent's knowledge of its shape can improve the sample efficiency of visual RL methods. We propose a novel method, Disentangled Environment and Agent Representations (DEAR), that uses the segmentation mask of the agent as supervision to learn disentangled representations of the environment and the agent through feature separation constraints. Unlike previous approaches, DEAR does not require reconstruction of visual observations. These representations are then used as an auxiliary loss to the RL objective, encouraging the agent to focus on the relevant features of the environment. We evaluate DEAR on two challenging benchmarks: Distracting DeepMind control suite and Franka Kitchen manipulation tasks. Our findings demonstrate that DEAR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in sample efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with reduced parameters. Our results indicate that integrating agent knowledge into visual RL methods has the potential to enhance their learning efficiency and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuelang Xu, Zhaoqi Su, Qingyao Wu, Yebin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D human head avatars is crucial for applications in VR/AR, digital human, and film production. Recent advances have leveraged morphable face models to generate animated head avatars from easily accessible data, representing varying identities and expressions within a low-dimensional parametric space. However, existing methods often struggle with modeling complex appearance details, e.g., hairstyles, and suffer from low rendering quality and efficiency. In this paper we introduce a novel approach, 3D Gaussian Parametric Head Model, which employs 3D Gaussians to accurately represent the complexities of the human head, allowing precise control over both identity and expression. The Gaussian model can handle intricate details, enabling realistic representations of varying appearances and complex expressions. Furthermore, we presents a well-designed training framework to ensure smooth convergence, providing a robust guarantee for learning the rich content. Our method achieves high-quality, photo-realistic rendering with real-time efficiency, making it a valuable contribution to the field of parametric head models. Finally, we apply the 3D Gaussian Parametric Head Model to monocular video or few-shot head avatar reconstruction tasks, which enables instant reconstruction of high-quality 3D head avatars even when input data is extremely limited, surpassing previous methods in terms of reconstruction quality and training speed.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we present TextHarmony, a unified and versatile multimodal generative model proficient in comprehending and generating visual text. Simultaneously generating images and texts typically results in performance degradation due to the inherent inconsistency between vision and language modalities. To overcome this challenge, existing approaches resort to modality-specific data for supervised fine-tuning, necessitating distinct model instances. We propose Slide-LoRA, which dynamically aggregates modality-specific and modality-agnostic LoRA experts, partially decoupling the multimodal generation space. Slide-LoRA harmonizes the generation of vision and language within a singular model instance, thereby facilitating a more unified generative process. Additionally, we develop a high-quality image caption dataset, DetailedTextCaps-100K, synthesized with a sophisticated closed-source MLLM to enhance visual text generation capabilities further. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Empowered by Slide-LoRA, TextHarmony achieves comparable performance to modality-specific fine-tuning results with only a 2% increase in parameters and shows an average improvement of 2.5% in visual text comprehension tasks and 4.0% in visual text generation tasks. Our work delineates the viability of an integrated approach to multimodal generation within the visual text domain, setting a foundation for subsequent inquiries.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincenzo De Rosa, Fabrizio Guillaro, Giovanni Poggi, Davide Cozzolino, Luisa Verdoliva</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, many forensic detectors have been proposed to detect AI-generated images and prevent their use for malicious purposes. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have long been the dominant architecture in this field and have been the subject of intense study. However, recently proposed Transformer-based detectors have been shown to match or even outperform CNN-based detectors, especially in terms of generalization. In this paper, we study the adversarial robustness of AI-generated image detectors, focusing on Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based methods that rely on Visual Transformer (ViT) backbones and comparing their performance with CNN-based methods. We study the robustness to different adversarial attacks under a variety of conditions and analyze both numerical results and frequency-domain patterns. CLIP-based detectors are found to be vulnerable to white-box attacks just like CNN-based detectors. However, attacks do not easily transfer between CNN-based and CLIP-based methods. This is also confirmed by the different distribution of the adversarial noise patterns in the frequency domain. Overall, this analysis provides new insights into the properties of forensic detectors that can help to develop more effective strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Jiawei Du, Ping Liu, Joey Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a technique aiming to condense informative features from large, natural datasets into a compact and synthetic form. While recent advancements have refined this technique, its performance is bottlenecked by the prevailing class-specific synthesis paradigm. Under this paradigm, synthetic data is optimized exclusively for a pre-assigned one-hot label, creating an implicit class barrier in feature condensation. This leads to inefficient utilization of the distillation budget and oversight of inter-class feature distributions, which ultimately limits the effectiveness and efficiency, as demonstrated in our analysis. To overcome these constraints, this paper presents the Inter-class Feature Compensator (INFER), an innovative distillation approach that transcends the class-specific data-label framework widely utilized in current dataset distillation methods. Specifically, INFER leverages a Universal Feature Compensator (UFC) to enhance feature integration across classes, enabling the generation of multiple additional synthetic instances from a single UFC input. This significantly improves the efficiency of the distillation budget. Moreover, INFER enriches inter-class interactions during the distillation, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and generalizability of the distilled data. By allowing for the linear interpolation of labels similar to those in the original dataset, INFER meticulously optimizes the synthetic data and dramatically reduces the size of soft labels in the synthetic dataset to almost zero, establishing a new benchmark for efficiency and effectiveness in dataset distillation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Hu, Jiayi Lin, Junchi Yan, Shaogang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Promptable segmentation typically requires instance-specific manual prompts to guide the segmentation of each desired object. To minimize such a need, task-generic promptable segmentation has been introduced, which employs a single task-generic prompt to segment various images of different objects in the same task. Current methods use Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to reason detailed instance-specific prompts from a task-generic prompt for improving segmentation accuracy. The effectiveness of this segmentation heavily depends on the precision of these derived prompts. However, MLLMs often suffer hallucinations during reasoning, resulting in inaccurate prompting. While existing methods focus on eliminating hallucinations to improve a model, we argue that MLLM hallucinations can reveal valuable contextual insights when leveraged correctly, as they represent pre-trained large-scale knowledge beyond individual images. In this paper, we utilize hallucinations to mine task-related information from images and verify its accuracy for enhancing precision of the generated prompts. Specifically, we introduce an iterative Prompt-Mask Cycle generation framework (ProMaC) with a prompt generator and a mask generator.The prompt generator uses a multi-scale chain of thought prompting, initially exploring hallucinations for extracting extended contextual knowledge on a test image.These hallucinations are then reduced to formulate precise instance-specific prompts, directing the mask generator to produce masks that are consistent with task semantics by mask semantic alignment. The generated masks iteratively induce the prompt generator to focus more on task-relevant image areas and reduce irrelevant hallucinations, resulting jointly in better prompts and masks. Experiments on 5 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ProMaC. Code given in https://lwpyh.github.io/ProMaC/.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-MoD, a novel framework designed to enable the efficient training of small-scale Multimodal Language Models (s-MLLM) by distilling knowledge from large-scale MLLM (l-MLLM). Our approach tackles two fundamental challenges in MLLM distillation. First, we optimize the network structure of s-MLLM by integrating a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture into the language model, striking a balance between computational efficiency and model expressiveness. Second, we propose a progressive knowledge transfer strategy to ensure comprehensive knowledge migration. This strategy begins with mimic distillation, where we minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between output distributions to enable the student model to emulate the teacher network's understanding. Following this, we introduce preference distillation via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), where the key lies in treating l-MLLM as the reference model. During this phase, the s-MLLM's ability to discriminate between superior and inferior examples is significantly enhanced beyond l-MLLM, leading to a better student that surpasses its teacher, particularly in hallucination benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-MoD outperforms existing models across various multimodal benchmarks while maintaining a minimal number of activated parameters and low computational costs. Remarkably, LLaVA-MoD, with only 2B activated parameters, surpasses Qwen-VL-Chat-7B by an average of 8.8% across benchmarks, using merely 0.3% of the training data and 23% trainable parameters. These results underscore LLaVA-MoD's ability to effectively distill comprehensive knowledge from its teacher model, paving the way for the development of more efficient MLLMs. The code will be available on: https://github.com/shufangxun/LLaVA-MoD.</p>

<p>Abstract: VILA-U is a Unified foundation model that integrates Video, Image, Language understanding and generation. Traditional visual language models (VLMs) use separate modules for understanding and generating visual content, which can lead to misalignment and increased complexity. In contrast, VILA-U employs a single autoregressive next-token prediction framework for both tasks, eliminating the need for additional components like diffusion models. This approach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art performance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of VILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns discrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances visual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar quality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset. This allows VILA-U to perform comparably to more complex models using a fully token-based autoregressive framework.</p>

Our approach synergizes features from both temporal and spatial hash encodings to achieve high rendering quality, employs parameter reuse to enhance scalability, and leverages a continual learning framework to mitigate memory overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a novel dataset comprising multi-view, exceptionally long video sequences with substantial rigid and non-rigid motion, thereby substantiating the scalability of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quoc-Bao Nguyen-Le, Tuan-Hy Le, Anh-Triet Do, Quoc-Huy Trinh</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular disease remains a predominant global health concern, responsible for a significant portion of mortality worldwide. Accurate segmentation of cardiac medical imaging data is pivotal in mitigating fatality rates associated with cardiovascular conditions. However, existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) neural networks, including both CNN-based and Transformer-based approaches, exhibit limitations in practical applicability due to their inability to effectively capture inter-slice connections alongside intra-slice information. This deficiency is particularly evident in datasets featuring intricate, long-range details along the z-axis, such as coronary arteries in axial views. Additionally, SOTA methods fail to differentiate non-cardiac components from myocardium in segmentation, leading to the "spraying" phenomenon. To address these challenges, we present RotCAtt-TransUNet++, a novel architecture tailored for robust segmentation of complex cardiac structures. Our approach emphasizes modeling global contexts by aggregating multiscale features with nested skip connections in the encoder. It integrates transformer layers to capture interactions between patches and employs a rotatory attention mechanism to capture connectivity between multiple slices (inter-slice information). Additionally, a channel-wise cross-attention gate guides the fused multi-scale channel-wise information and features from decoder stages to bridge semantic gaps. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing SOTA approaches across four cardiac datasets and one abdominal dataset. Importantly, coronary arteries and myocardium are annotated with near-perfect accuracy during inference. An ablation study shows that the rotatory attention mechanism effectively transforms embedded vectorized patches in the semantic dimensional space, enhancing segmentation accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maor Ashkenazi, Eran Treister</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have peaked interest in recent years due to their ability to encode natural signals using neural networks. While INRs allow for useful applications such as interpolating new coordinates and signal compression, their black-box nature makes it difficult to modify them post-training. In this paper we explore the idea of editable INRs, and specifically focus on the widely used cropping operation. To this end, we present Local-Global SIRENs -- a novel INR architecture that supports cropping by design. Local-Global SIRENs are based on combining local and global feature extraction for signal encoding. What makes their design unique is the ability to effortlessly remove specific portions of an encoded signal, with a proportional weight decrease. This is achieved by eliminating the corresponding weights from the network, without the need for retraining. We further show how this architecture can be used to support the straightforward extension of previously encoded signals. Beyond signal editing, we examine how the Local-Global approach can accelerate training, enhance encoding of various signals, improve downstream performance, and be applied to modern INRs such as INCODE, highlighting its potential and flexibility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwan Chung, Seungwon Lim, Jaehyun Jeon, Seungbeen Lee, Youngjae Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans possess multimodal literacy, allowing them to actively integrate information from various modalities to form reasoning. Faced with challenges like lexical ambiguity in text, we supplement this with other modalities, such as thumbnail images or textbook illustrations. Is it possible for machines to achieve a similar multimodal understanding capability? In response, we present Understanding Pun with Image Explanations (UNPIE), a novel benchmark designed to assess the impact of multimodal inputs in resolving lexical ambiguities. Puns serve as the ideal subject for this evaluation due to their intrinsic ambiguity. Our dataset includes 1,000 puns, each accompanied by an image that explains both meanings. We pose three multimodal challenges with the annotations to assess different aspects of multimodal literacy; Pun Grounding, Disambiguation, and Reconstruction. The results indicate that various Socratic Models and Visual-Language Models improve over the text-only models when given visual context, particularly as the complexity of the tasks increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Pan, Weibin Wu, Yuhang Cao, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural network based systems deployed in sensitive environments are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Unrestricted adversarial attacks typically manipulate the semantic content of an image (e.g., color or texture) to create adversarial examples that are both effective and photorealistic. Recent works have utilized the diffusion inversion process to map images into a latent space, where high-level semantics are manipulated by introducing perturbations. However, they often results in substantial semantic distortions in the denoised output and suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Semantic-Consistent Unrestricted Adversarial Attacks (SCA), which employs an inversion method to extract edit-friendly noise maps and utilizes Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to provide semantic guidance throughout the process. Under the condition of rich semantic information provided by MLLM, we perform the DDPM denoising process of each step using a series of edit-friendly noise maps, and leverage DPM Solver++ to accelerate this process, enabling efficient sampling with semantic consistency. Compared to existing methods, our framework enables the efficient generation of adversarial examples that exhibit minimal discernible semantic changes. Consequently, we for the first time introduce Semantic-Consistent Adversarial Examples (SCAE). Extensive experiments and visualizations have demonstrated the high efficiency of SCA, particularly in being on average 12 times faster than the state-of-the-art attacks. Our research can further draw attention to the security of multimedia information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taekyung Lee, Jaemoo Choi, Jaewoong Choi, Myungjoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unpaired point cloud completion explores methods for learning a completion map from unpaired incomplete and complete point cloud data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for unpaired point cloud completion using the unbalanced optimal transport map, called Unbalanced Optimal Transport Map for Unpaired Point Cloud Completion (UOT-UPC). We demonstrate that the unpaired point cloud completion can be naturally interpreted as the Optimal Transport (OT) problem and introduce the Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) approach to address the class imbalance problem, which is prevalent in unpaired point cloud completion datasets. Moreover, we analyze the appropriate cost function for unpaired completion tasks. This analysis shows that the InfoCD cost function is particularly well-suited for this task. Our model is the first attempt to leverage UOT for unpaired point cloud completion, achieving competitive or superior results on both single-category and multi-category datasets. In particular, our model is especially effective in scenarios with class imbalance, where the proportions of categories are different between the incomplete and complete point cloud datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt tuning for vision-language models such as CLIP involves optimizing the text prompts used to generate image-text pairs for specific downstream tasks. While hand-crafted or template-based prompts are generally applicable to a wider range of unseen classes, they tend to perform poorly in downstream tasks (i.e., seen classes). Learnable soft prompts, on the other hand, often perform well in downstream tasks but lack generalizability. Additionally, prior research has predominantly concentrated on the textual modality, with very few studies attempting to explore the prompt's generalization potential from the visual modality. Keeping these limitations in mind, we investigate how to prompt tuning to obtain both a competitive downstream performance and generalization. The study shows that by treating soft and hand-crafted prompts as dual views of the textual modality, and maximizing their mutual information, we can better ensemble task-specific and general semantic information. Moreover, to generate more expressive prompts, the study introduces a class-wise augmentation from the visual modality, resulting in significant robustness to a wider range of unseen classes. Extensive evaluations on several benchmarks report that the proposed approach achieves competitive results in terms of both task-specific performance and general abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hazel Doughty, Fida Mohammad Thoker, Cees G. M. Snoek</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper strives for motion-focused video-language representations. Existing methods to learn video-language representations use spatial-focused data, where identifying the objects and scene is often enough to distinguish the relevant caption. We instead propose LocoMotion to learn from motion-focused captions that describe the movement and temporal progression of local object motions. We achieve this by adding synthetic motions to videos and using the parameters of these motions to generate corresponding captions. Furthermore, we propose verb-variation paraphrasing to increase the caption variety and learn the link between primitive motions and high-level verbs. With this, we are able to learn a motion-focused video-language representation. Experiments demonstrate our approach is effective for a variety of downstream tasks, particularly when limited data is available for fine-tuning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohao Liao, Wei Zhai, Zengyu Wan, Tianzhu Zhang, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene reconstruction from casually captured videos has wide applications in real-world scenarios. With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS. Our project page is https://lbh666.github.io/ef-3dgs/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangjian Ji, Donglin Cheng, Kai Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to some complex factors (e.g., occlusion, pose variation and diverse camera perspectives), extracting stronger feature representation in person re-identification remains a challenging task. In this paper, we proposed a novel self-supervision and supervision combining transformer-based person re-identification framework, namely SSSC-TransReID. Different from the general transformer-based person re-identification models, we designed a self-supervised contrastive learning branch, which can enhance the feature representation for person re-identification without negative samples or additional pre-training. In order to train the contrastive learning branch, we also proposed a novel random rectangle mask strategy to simulate the occlusion in real scenes, so as to enhance the feature representation for occlusion. Finally, we utilized the joint-training loss function to integrate the advantages of supervised learning with ID tags and self-supervised contrastive learning without negative samples, which can reinforce the ability of our model to excavate stronger discriminative features, especially for occlusion. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets show our proposed model obtains superior Re-ID performance consistently and outperforms the state-of-the-art ReID methods by large margins on the mean average accuracy (mAP) and Rank-1 accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhang, Yidong Zhao, Qian Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Deformable image registration is inherently a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, requiring a delicate balance between image similarity and deformation regularity. These conflicting objectives often lead to poor optimization outcomes, such as being trapped in unsatisfactory local minima or experiencing slow convergence. Deep learning methods have recently gained popularity in this domain due to their efficiency in processing large datasets and achieving high accuracy. However, they often underperform during test time compared to traditional optimization techniques, which further explore iterative, instance-specific gradient-based optimization. This performance gap is more pronounced when a distribution shift between training and test data exists. To address this issue, we focus on the instance optimization (IO) paradigm, which involves additional optimization for test-time instances based on a pre-trained model. IO effectively combines the generalization capabilities of deep learning with the fine-tuning advantages of instance-specific optimization. Within this framework, we emphasize the use of gradient projection to mitigate conflicting updates in MOO. This technique projects conflicting gradients into a common space, better aligning the dual objectives and enhancing optimization stability. We validate our method using a state-of-the-art foundation model on the 3D Brain inter-subject registration task (LUMIR) from the Learn2Reg 2024 Challenge. Our results show significant improvements over standard gradient descent, leading to more accurate and reliable registration results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyu Sun, Umar Khalid, Matias Mendieta, Taojiannan Yang, Pu Wang, Minwoo Lee, Chen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling the collaborative training of models without centralized access to the raw data on local devices. In the typical FL paradigm (e.g., FedAvg), model weights are sent to and from the server each round to participating clients. Recently, the use of small pre-trained models has been shown effective in federated learning optimization and improving convergence. However, recent state-of-the-art pre-trained models are getting more capable but also have more parameters. In conventional FL, sharing the enormous model weights can quickly put a massive communication burden on the system, especially if more capable models are employed. Can we find a solution to enable those strong and readily-available pre-trained models in FL to achieve excellent performance while simultaneously reducing the communication burden? To this end, we investigate the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated learning and thus introduce a new framework: FedPEFT. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of FedPEFT across a variety of client stability, data distribution, and differential privacy settings. By only locally tuning and globally sharing a small portion of the model weights, significant reductions in the total communication overhead can be achieved while maintaining competitive or even better performance in a wide range of federated learning scenarios, providing insight into a new paradigm for practical and effective federated systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizabeth A. Olson, Jana Pavlasek, Jasmine A. Berry, Odest Chadwicke Jenkins</p>
<p>Abstract: Particle filtering is a common technique for six degrees of freedom (6D) pose estimation due to its ability to tractably represent belief over object pose. However, the particle filter is prone to particle deprivation due to the high-dimensional nature of 6D pose. When particle deprivation occurs, it can cause mode collapse of the underlying belief distribution during importance sampling. If the region surrounding the true state suffers from mode collapse, recovering its belief is challenging since the area is no longer represented in the probability mass formed by the particles. Previous methods mitigate this problem by randomizing and resetting particles in the belief distribution, but determining the frequency of reinvigoration has relied on hand-tuning abstract heuristics. In this paper, we estimate the necessary reinvigoration rate at each time step by introducing a Counter-Hypothetical likelihood function, which is used alongside the standard likelihood. Inspired by the notions of plausibility and implausibility from Evidential Reasoning, the addition of our Counter-Hypothetical likelihood function assigns a level of doubt to each particle. The competing cumulative values of confidence and doubt across the particle set are used to estimate the level of failure within the filter, in order to determine the portion of particles to be reinvigorated. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the rigid body object 6D pose tracking task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanran Chen, Yinpeng Dong, Shitong Shao, Zhongkai Hao, Xiao Yang, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative learning, recognized for its effective modeling of data distributions, offers inherent advantages in handling out-of-distribution instances, especially for enhancing robustness to adversarial attacks. Among these, diffusion classifiers, utilizing powerful diffusion models, have demonstrated superior empirical robustness. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of their robustness is still lacking, raising concerns about their vulnerability to stronger future attacks. In this study, we prove that diffusion classifiers possess $O(1)$ Lipschitzness, and establish their certified robustness, demonstrating their inherent resilience. To achieve non-constant Lipschitzness, thereby obtaining much tighter certified robustness, we generalize diffusion classifiers to classify Gaussian-corrupted data. This involves deriving the evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) for these distributions, approximating the likelihood using the ELBO, and calculating classification probabilities via Bayes' theorem. Experimental results show the superior certified robustness of these Noised Diffusion Classifiers (NDCs). Notably, we achieve over 80% and 70% certified robustness on CIFAR-10 under adversarial perturbations with \(\ell_2\) norms less than 0.25 and 0.5, respectively, using a single off-the-shelf diffusion model without any additional data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alicia Durrer, Philippe C. Cattin, Julia Wolleb</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the "BraTS 2023 Local Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge". The task of this challenge is to transform tumor tissue into healthy tissue in brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. This idea originates from the problem that MR images can be evaluated using automatic processing tools, however, many of these tools are optimized for the analysis of healthy tissue. By solving the given inpainting task, we enable the automatic analysis of images featuring lesions, and further downstream tasks. Our approach builds on denoising diffusion probabilistic models. We use a 2D model that is trained using slices in which healthy tissue was cropped out and is learned to be inpainted again. This allows us to use the ground truth healthy tissue during training. In the sampling stage, we replace the slices containing diseased tissue in the original 3D volume with the slices containing the healthy tissue inpainting. With our approach, we achieve comparable results to the competing methods. On the validation set our model achieves a mean SSIM of 0.7804, a PSNR of 20.3525 and a MSE of 0.0113. In future we plan to extend our 2D model to a 3D model, allowing to inpaint the region of interest as a whole without losing context information of neighboring slices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyu Zhang, L\'eon Bottou</p>
<p>Abstract: It is impossible today to pretend that the practice of machine learning is compatible with the idea that training and testing data follow the same distribution. Several authors have recently used ensemble techniques to show how scenarios involving multiple data distributions are best served by representations that are both richer than those obtained by regularizing for the best in-distribution performance, and richer than those obtained under the influence of the implicit sparsity bias of common stochastic gradient procedures.
  This contribution investigates the use of very high dropout rates instead of ensembles to obtain such rich representations. Although training a deep network from scratch using such dropout rates is virtually impossible, fine-tuning a large pre-trained model under such conditions is not only possible but also achieves out-of-distribution performances that exceed those of both ensembles and weight averaging methods such as model soups. This result has practical significance because the importance of the fine-tuning scenario has considerably grown in recent years. This result also provides interesting insights on the nature of rich representations and on the intrinsically linear nature of fine-tuning a large network using a comparatively small dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in producing visually compelling images, with increasing applications in medical imaging. However, they continue to grapple with hallucination challenges and the generation of anatomically inaccurate outputs. These limitations are mainly due to the reliance on textual inputs and lack of spatial control over the generated images, hindering the potential usefulness of such models in real-life settings. In this work, we present XReal, a novel controllable diffusion model for generating realistic chest X-ray images through precise anatomy and pathology location control. Our lightweight method comprises an Anatomy Controller and a Pathology Controller to introduce spatial control over anatomy and pathology in a pre-trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Model, respectively, without fine-tuning the model. XReal outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray diffusion models in quantitative metrics and radiologists' ratings, showing significant gains in anatomy and pathology realism. Our model holds promise for advancing generative models in medical imaging, offering greater precision and adaptability while inviting further exploration in this evolving field.

Through extensive experiments on DrivingStereo and KITTI benchmarks, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the obstacle detection task. We also report comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art obstacle tracking models while requiring only a fraction of their computation cost, typically ten-fold to twenty-fold less.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunming Zhang, Dengpan Ye, Caiyun Xie, Sipeng Shen, Ziyi Liu, Jiacheng Deng, Long Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The wide deployment of Face Recognition (FR) systems poses privacy risks. One countermeasure is adversarial attack, deceiving unauthorized malicious FR, but it also disrupts regular identity verification of trusted authorizers, exacerbating the potential threat of identity impersonation. To address this, we propose the first double identity protection scheme based on traceable adversarial watermarking, termed DIP-Watermark. DIP-Watermark employs a one-time watermark embedding to deceive unauthorized FR models and allows authorizers to perform identity verification by extracting the watermark. Specifically, we propose an information-guided adversarial attack against FR models. The encoder embeds an identity-specific watermark into the deep feature space of the carrier, guiding recognizable features of the image to deviate from the source identity. We further adopt a collaborative meta-optimization strategy compatible with sub-tasks, which regularizes the joint optimization direction of the encoder and decoder. This strategy enhances the representation of universal carrier features, mitigating multi-objective optimization conflicts in watermarking. Experiments confirm that DIP-Watermark achieves significant attack success rates and traceability accuracy on state-of-the-art FR models, exhibiting remarkable robustness that outperforms the existing privacy protection methods using adversarial attacks and deep watermarking, or simple combinations of the two. Our work potentially opens up new insights into proactive protection for FR privacy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual arguments, often used in advertising or social causes, rely on images to persuade viewers to do or believe something. Understanding these arguments requires selective vision: only specific visual stimuli within an image are relevant to the argument, and relevance can only be understood within the context of a broader argumentative structure. While visual arguments are readily appreciated by human audiences, we ask: are today's AI capable of similar understanding? We present VisArgs, a dataset of 1,611 images annotated with 5,112 visual premises (with regions), 5,574 commonsense premises, and reasoning trees connecting them into structured arguments. We propose three tasks for evaluating visual argument understanding: premise localization, premise identification, and conclusion deduction. Experiments show that 1) machines struggle to capture visual cues: GPT-4-O achieved 78.5% accuracy, while humans reached 98.0%. Models also performed 19.5% worse when distinguishing between irrelevant objects within the image compared to external objects. 2) Providing relevant visual premises improved model performance significantly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can we endow visuomotor robots with generalization capabilities to operate in diverse open-world scenarios? In this paper, we propose \textbf{Maniwhere}, a generalizable framework tailored for visual reinforcement learning, enabling the trained robot policies to generalize across a combination of multiple visual disturbance types. Specifically, we introduce a multi-view representation learning approach fused with Spatial Transformer Network (STN) module to capture shared semantic information and correspondences among different viewpoints. In addition, we employ a curriculum-based randomization and augmentation approach to stabilize the RL training process and strengthen the visual generalization ability. To exhibit the effectiveness of Maniwhere, we meticulously design 8 tasks encompassing articulate objects, bi-manual, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks, demonstrating Maniwhere's strong visual generalization and sim2real transfer abilities across 3 hardware platforms. Our experiments show that Maniwhere significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Videos are provided at https://gemcollector.github.io/maniwhere/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayed Mohammad Vakilzadeh Hatefi, Maximilian Dreyer, Reduan Achtibat, Thomas Wiegand, Wojciech Samek, Sebastian Lapuschkin</p>
<p>Abstract: To solve ever more complex problems, Deep Neural Networks are scaled to billions of parameters, leading to huge computational costs. An effective approach to reduce computational requirements and increase efficiency is to prune unnecessary components of these often over-parameterized networks. Previous work has shown that attribution methods from the field of eXplainable AI serve as effective means to extract and prune the least relevant network components in a few-shot fashion. We extend the current state by proposing to explicitly optimize hyperparameters of attribution methods for the task of pruning, and further include transformer-based networks in our analysis. Our approach yields higher model compression rates of large transformer- and convolutional architectures (VGG, ResNet, ViT) compared to previous works, while still attaining high performance on ImageNet classification tasks. Here, our experiments indicate that transformers have a higher degree of over-parameterization compared to convolutional neural networks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Garske, Bradley Evans, Christopher Artlett, KC Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting unexpected objects (anomalies) in real time has great potential for monitoring, managing, and protecting the environment. Hyperspectral line-scan cameras are a low-cost solution that enhance confidence in anomaly detection over RGB and multispectral imagery. However, existing line-scan algorithms are too slow when using small computers (e.g. those onboard a drone or small satellite), do not adapt to changing scenery, or lack robustness against geometric distortions. This paper introduces the Exponentially moving RX algorithm (ERX) to address these issues, and compares it with existing RX-based anomaly detection methods for hyperspectral line scanning. Three large and more complex datasets are also introduced to better assess the practical challenges when using line-scan cameras (two hyperspectral and one multispectral). ERX is evaluated using a Jetson Xavier NX compute module, achieving the best combination of speed and detection performance. This research paves the way for future studies in grouping and locating anomalous objects, adaptive and automatic threshold selection, and real-time field tests.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11402">NVLM: Open Frontier-Class Multimodal LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenliang Dai, Nayeon Lee, Boxin Wang, Zhuolin Yang, Zihan Liu, Jon Barker, Tuomas Rintamaki, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce NVLM 1.0, a family of frontier-class multimodal large language models (LLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on vision-language tasks, rivaling the leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-access models (e.g., Llama 3-V 405B and InternVL 2). Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved text-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. In terms of model design, we perform a comprehensive comparison between decoder-only multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) and cross-attention-based models (e.g., Flamingo). Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose a novel architecture that enhances both training efficiency and multimodal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a 1-D tile-tagging design for tile-based dynamic high-resolution images, which significantly boosts performance on multimodal reasoning and OCR-related tasks. Regarding training data, we meticulously curate and provide detailed information on our multimodal pretraining and supervised fine-tuning datasets. Our findings indicate that dataset quality and task diversity are more important than scale, even during the pretraining phase, across all architectures. Notably, we develop production-grade multimodality for the NVLM-1.0 models, enabling them to excel in vision-language tasks while maintaining and even improving text-only performance compared to their LLM backbones. To achieve this, we craft and integrate a high-quality text-only dataset into multimodal training, alongside a substantial amount of multimodal math and reasoning data, leading to enhanced math and coding capabilities across modalities. To advance research in the field, we release the model weights at https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVLM-D-72B and will open-source the training code for the community soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunyu Peng, Di Wen, Kailun Yang, Ao Luo, Yufan Chen, Jia Fu, M. Saquib Sarfraz, Alina Roitberg, Rainer Stiefelhagen</p>
<p>Abstract: In Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG), the model is exposed to both new variations of data appearance (domains) and open-set conditions, where both known and novel categories are present at test time. The challenges of this task arise from the dual need to generalize across diverse domains and accurately quantify category novelty, which is critical for applications in dynamic environments. Recently, meta-learning techniques have demonstrated superior results in OSDG, effectively orchestrating the meta-train and -test tasks by employing varied random categories and predefined domain partition strategies. These approaches prioritize a well-designed training schedule over traditional methods that focus primarily on data augmentation and the enhancement of discriminative feature learning. The prevailing meta-learning models in OSDG typically utilize a predefined sequential domain scheduler to structure data partitions. However, a crucial aspect that remains inadequately explored is the influence brought by strategies of domain schedulers during training. In this paper, we observe that an adaptive domain scheduler benefits more in OSDG compared with prefixed sequential and random domain schedulers. We propose the Evidential Bi-Level Hardest Domain Scheduler (EBiL-HaDS) to achieve an adaptive domain scheduler. This method strategically sequences domains by assessing their reliabilities in utilizing a follower network, trained with confidence scores learned in an evidential manner, regularized by max rebiasing discrepancy, and optimized in a bi-level manner. The results show that our method substantially improves OSDG performance and achieves more discriminative embeddings for both the seen and unseen categories.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiran Yuan, Hao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: We address an important problem in ecology called Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), whose goal is to predict whether a species exists at a certain position on Earth. In particular, we tackle a challenging version of this task, where we learn from presence-only data in a community-sourced dataset, model a large number of species simultaneously, and do not use any additional environmental information. Previous work has used neural implicit representations to construct models that achieve promising results. However, implicit representations often generate predictions of limited spatial precision. We attribute this limitation to their inherently global formulation and inability to effectively capture local feature variations. This issue is especially pronounced with presence-only data and a large number of species. To address this, we propose a hybrid embedding scheme that combines both implicit and explicit embeddings. Specifically, the explicit embedding is implemented with a multiresolution hashgrid, enabling our models to better capture local information. Experiments demonstrate that our results exceed other works by a large margin on various standard benchmarks, and that the hybrid representation is better than both purely implicit and explicit ones. Qualitative visualizations and comprehensive ablation studies reveal that our hybrid representation successfully addresses the two main challenges.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13896">From Real Artifacts to Virtual Reference: A Robust Framework for Translating Endoscopic Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyang Wu, Fangfang Xie, Jiayuan Sun, Yun Gu, Guang-Zhong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain adaptation, which bridges the distributions across different modalities, plays a crucial role in multimodal medical image analysis. In endoscopic imaging, combining pre-operative data with intra-operative imaging is important for surgical planning and navigation. However, existing domain adaptation methods are hampered by distribution shift caused by in vivo artifacts, necessitating robust techniques for aligning noisy and artifact abundant patient endoscopic videos with clean virtual images reconstructed from pre-operative tomographic data for pose estimation during intraoperative guidance. This paper presents an artifact-resilient image translation method and an associated benchmark for this purpose. The method incorporates a novel ``local-global'' translation framework and a noise-resilient feature extraction strategy. For the former, it decouples the image translation process into a local step for feature denoising, and a global step for global style transfer. For feature extraction, a new contrastive learning strategy is proposed, which can extract noise-resilient features for establishing robust correspondence across domains. Detailed validation on both public and in-house clinical datasets has been conducted, demonstrating significantly improved performance compared to the current state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuki Hagiwara, Octavia-Andreea Ciora, Maureen Monnet, Gino Lancho, Jeanette Miriam Lorenz</p>
<p>Abstract: The diagnosis of glaucoma plays a critical role in the management and treatment of this vision-threatening disease. Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that cause blindness by damaging the optic nerve at the back of the eye. Often called "silent thief of sight", it exhibits no symptoms during the early stages. Therefore, early detection is crucial to prevent vision loss. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Deep Learning (DL) techniques, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) systems have emerged as promising tools to assist clinicians in accurately diagnosing glaucoma early. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI techniques utilized in CADx systems for glaucoma diagnosis. Through a detailed analysis of current literature, we identify key gaps and challenges in these systems, emphasizing the need for improved safety, reliability, interpretability, and explainability. By identifying research gaps, we aim to advance the field of CADx systems especially for the early diagnosis of glaucoma, in order to prevent any potential loss of vision.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16239">MoRE: Multi-Modal Contrastive Pre-training with Transformers on X-Rays, ECGs, and Diagnostic Report</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Samrajya Thapa, Koushik Howlader, Subhankar Bhattacharjee, Wei le</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Multi-Modal Contrastive Pre-training Framework that synergistically combines X-rays, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and radiology/cardiology reports. Our approach leverages transformers to encode these diverse modalities into a unified representation space, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate comprehensive patient assessments. We utilize LoRA-Peft to significantly reduce trainable parameters in the LLM and incorporate recent linear attention dropping strategy in the Vision Transformer(ViT) for smoother attention. Furthermore, we provide novel multimodal attention explanations and retrieval for our model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an integrated model that combines X-ray, ECG, and Radiology/Cardiology Report with this approach. By utilizing contrastive loss, MoRE effectively aligns modality-specific features into a coherent embedding, which supports various downstream tasks such as zero-shot classification and multimodal retrieval. Employing our proposed methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the Mimic-IV, CheXpert, Edema Severity, and PtbXl downstream datasets, surpassing existing multimodal approaches. Our proposed framework shows significant improvements in capturing intricate inter-modal relationships and its robustness in medical diagnosis that establishes a framework for future research in multimodal learning in the healthcare sector.</p>
