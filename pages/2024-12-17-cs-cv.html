<p><b>Authors:</b> Ofir Nabati, Guy Tennenholtz, ChihWei Hsu, Moonkyung Ryu, Deepak Ramachandran, Yinlam Chow, Xiang Li, Craig Boutilier</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the problem of personalized, interactive text-to-image (T2I) generation, designing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent which iteratively improves a set of generated images for a user through a sequence of prompt expansions. Using human raters, we create a novel dataset of sequential preferences, which we leverage, together with large-scale open-source (non-sequential) datasets. We construct user-preference and user-choice models using an EM strategy and identify varying user preference types. We then leverage a large multimodal language model (LMM) and a value-based RL approach to suggest a personalized and diverse slate of prompt expansions to the user. Our Personalized And Sequential Text-to-image Agent (PASTA) extends T2I models with personalized multi-turn capabilities, fostering collaborative co-creation and addressing uncertainty or underspecification in a user's intent. We evaluate PASTA using human raters, showing significant improvement compared to baseline methods. We also release our sequential rater dataset and simulated user-rater interactions to support future research in personalized, multi-turn T2I generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aysan Aghazadeh, Adriana Kovashka</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the task of advertisement image generation and introduce three evaluation metrics to assess Creativity, prompt Alignment, and Persuasiveness (CAP) in generated advertisement images. Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation and their performance in generating high-quality images for explicit descriptions, evaluating these models remains challenging. Existing evaluation methods focus largely on assessing alignment with explicit, detailed descriptions, but evaluating alignment with visually implicit prompts remains an open problem. Additionally, creativity and persuasiveness are essential qualities that enhance the effectiveness of advertisement images, yet are seldom measured. To address this, we propose three novel metrics for evaluating the creativity, alignment, and persuasiveness of generated images. Our findings reveal that current T2I models struggle with creativity, persuasiveness, and alignment when the input text is implicit messages. We further introduce a simple yet effective approach to enhance T2I models' capabilities in producing images that are better aligned, more creative, and more persuasive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Li, Xinwei Chen, Tianyou Song, Hansong Zhang, Wenzhe Zhang, Qing Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: In the burgeoning field of AI-driven image generation, the quest for precision and relevance in response to textual prompts remains paramount. This paper introduces GPTDrawer, an innovative pipeline that leverages the generative prowess of GPT-based models to enhance the visual synthesis process. Our methodology employs a novel algorithm that iteratively refines input prompts using keyword extraction, semantic analysis, and image-text congruence evaluation. By integrating ChatGPT for natural language processing and Stable Diffusion for image generation, GPTDrawer produces a batch of images that undergo successive refinement cycles, guided by cosine similarity metrics until a threshold of semantic alignment is attained. The results demonstrate a marked improvement in the fidelity of images generated in accordance with user-defined prompts, showcasing the system's ability to interpret and visualize complex semantic constructs. The implications of this work extend to various applications, from creative arts to design automation, setting a new benchmark for AI-assisted creative processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Wen, Xiang Wen, Hao Jiang, Siqi Yang, Bingfeng Han, Tianlei Hu, Gang Chen, Shuang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of the ``metaverse'' and the rapid development of games, it has become more and more critical to reconstruct characters in the virtual world faithfully. The immersive experience is one of the most central themes of the ``metaverse'', while the reducibility of the avatar is the crucial point. Meanwhile, the game is the carrier of the metaverse, in which players can freely edit the facial appearance of the game character. In this paper, we propose a simple but powerful cross-domain framework that can reconstruct fine-grained 3D game characters from single-view images in an end-to-end manner. Different from the previous methods, which do not resolve the cross-domain gap, we propose an effective regressor that can greatly reduce the discrepancy between the real-world domain and the game domain. To figure out the drawbacks of no ground truth, our unsupervised framework has accomplished the knowledge transfer of the target domain. Additionally, an innovative contrastive loss is proposed to solve the instance-wise disparity, which keeps the person-specific details of the reconstructed character. In contrast, an auxiliary 3D identity-aware extractor is activated to make the results of our model more impeccable. Then a large set of physically meaningful facial parameters is generated robustly and exquisitely. Experiments demonstrate that our method yields state-of-the-art performance in 3D game character reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry Zhang, Luca Carlone</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce CUPS, a novel method for learning sequence-to-sequence 3D human shapes and poses from RGB videos with uncertainty quantification. To improve on top of prior work, we develop a method to generate and score multiple hypotheses during training, effectively integrating uncertainty quantification into the learning process. This process results in a deep uncertainty function that is trained end-to-end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned deep uncertainty model is used as the conformity score, which can be used to calibrate a conformal predictor in order to assess the quality of the output prediction. Since the data in human pose-shape learning is not fully exchangeable, we also present two practical bounds for the coverage gap in conformal prediction, developing theoretical backing for the uncertainty bound of our model. Our results indicate that by taking advantage of deep uncertainty with conformal prediction, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongning Ruan, Yulin Shao, Qianqian Yang, Liang Zhao, Zhaoyang Zhang, Dusit Niyato</p>
<p>Abstract: Point clouds have gained prominence in numerous applications due to their ability to accurately depict 3D objects and scenes. However, compressing unstructured, high-precision point cloud data effectively remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose NeRC$^{\textbf{3}}$, a novel point cloud compression framework leveraging implicit neural representations to handle both geometry and attributes. Our approach employs two coordinate-based neural networks to implicitly represent a voxelized point cloud: the first determines the occupancy status of a voxel, while the second predicts the attributes of occupied voxels. By feeding voxel coordinates into these networks, the receiver can efficiently reconstructs the original point cloud's geometry and attributes. The neural network parameters are quantized and compressed alongside auxiliary information required for reconstruction. Additionally, we extend our method to dynamic point cloud compression with techniques to reduce temporal redundancy, including a 4D spatial-temporal representation termed 4D-NeRC$^{\textbf{3}}$. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach: for static point clouds, NeRC$^{\textbf{3}}$ outperforms octree-based methods in the latest G-PCC standard. For dynamic point clouds, 4D-NeRC$^{\textbf{3}}$ demonstrates superior geometry compression compared to state-of-the-art G-PCC and V-PCC standards and achieves competitive results for joint geometry and attribute compression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Dong, Sen Jia, Hongyu Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) technology, it has become possible to exploit its video understanding capability on different classification tasks. In practice, we face the difficulty of huge requirements for GPU resource if we need to deploy MLLMs online. In this paper, we propose COEF-VQ, a novel cascaded MLLM framework for better video quality understanding on TikTok. To this end, we first propose a MLLM fusing all visual, textual and audio signals, and then develop a cascade framework with a lightweight model as pre-filtering stage and MLLM as fine-consideration stage, significantly reducing the need for GPU resource, while retaining the performance demonstrated solely by MLLM. To demonstrate the effectiveness of COEF-VQ, we deployed this new framework onto the video management platform (VMP) at TikTok, and performed a series of detailed experiments on two in-house tasks related to video quality understanding. We show that COEF-VQ leads to substantial performance gains with limit resource consumption in these two tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10436">Benchmarking Federated Learning for Semantic Datasets: Federated Scene Graph Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> SeungBum Ha, Taehwan Lee, Jiyoun Lim, Sung Whan Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has recently garnered attention as a data-decentralized training framework that enables the learning of deep models from locally distributed samples while keeping data privacy. Built upon the framework, immense efforts have been made to establish FL benchmarks, which provide rigorous evaluation settings that control data heterogeneity across clients. Prior efforts have mainly focused on handling relatively simple classification tasks, where each sample is annotated with a one-hot label, such as MNIST, CIFAR, LEAF benchmark, etc. However, little attention has been paid to demonstrating an FL benchmark that handles complicated semantics, where each sample encompasses diverse semantic information from multiple labels, such as Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) with objects, subjects, and relations between them. Because the existing benchmark is designed to distribute data in a narrow view of a single semantic, e.g., a one-hot label, managing the complicated semantic heterogeneity across clients when formalizing FL benchmarks is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a benchmark process to establish an FL benchmark with controllable semantic heterogeneity across clients: two key steps are i) data clustering with semantics and ii) data distributing via controllable semantic heterogeneity across clients. As a proof of concept, we first construct a federated PSG benchmark, demonstrating the efficacy of the existing PSG methods in an FL setting with controllable semantic heterogeneity of scene graphs. We also present the effectiveness of our benchmark by applying robust federated learning algorithms to data heterogeneity to show increased performance.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10437">SVGFusion: Scalable Text-to-SVG Generation via Vector Space Diffusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Xing, Juncheng Hu, Jing Zhang, Dong Xu, Qian Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The generation of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) assets from textual data remains a significant challenge, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality vector datasets and the limitations in scalable vector representations required for modeling intricate graphic distributions. This work introduces SVGFusion, a Text-to-SVG model capable of scaling to real-world SVG data without reliance on a text-based discrete language model or prolonged SDS optimization. The essence of SVGFusion is to learn a continuous latent space for vector graphics with a popular Text-to-Image framework. Specifically, SVGFusion consists of two modules: a Vector-Pixel Fusion Variational Autoencoder (VP-VAE) and a Vector Space Diffusion Transformer (VS-DiT). VP-VAE takes both the SVGs and corresponding rasterizations as inputs and learns a continuous latent space, whereas VS-DiT learns to generate a latent code within this space based on the text prompt. Based on VP-VAE, a novel rendering sequence modeling strategy is proposed to enable the latent space to embed the knowledge of construction logics in SVGs. This empowers the model to achieve human-like design capabilities in vector graphics, while systematically preventing occlusion in complex graphic compositions. Moreover, our SVGFusion's ability can be continuously improved by leveraging the scalability of the VS-DiT by adding more VS-DiT blocks. A large-scale SVG dataset is collected to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Extensive experimentation has confirmed the superiority of our SVGFusion over existing SVG generation methods, achieving enhanced quality and generalizability, thereby establishing a novel framework for SVG content creation. Code, model, and data will be released at: \href{https://ximinng.github.io/SVGFusionProject/}{https://ximinng.github.io/SVGFusionProject/}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Noizet (UTC, Heudiasyc), Philippe Xu (ENSTA Paris), Philippe Bonnifait (UTC, Heudiasyc)</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting road features is a key enabler for autonomous driving and localization. For instance, a reliable detection of poles which are widespread in road environments can improve localization. Modern deep learning-based perception systems need a significant amount of annotated data. Automatic annotation avoids time-consuming and costly manual annotation. Because automatic methods are prone to errors, managing annotation uncertainty is crucial to ensure a proper learning process. Fusing multiple annotation sources on the same dataset can be an efficient way to reduce the errors. This not only improves the quality of annotations, but also improves the learning of perception models. In this paper, we consider the fusion of three automatic annotation methods in images: feature projection from a high accuracy vector map combined with a lidar, image segmentation and lidar segmentation. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of multi-modal automatic annotation for pole detection through a comparative evaluation on manually annotated images. Finally, the resulting multi-modal fusion is used to fine-tune an object detection model for pole base detection using unlabeled data, showing overall improvements achieved by enhancing network specialization. The dataset is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihan Cao, Jiazhao Zhang, Zhinan Yu, Shuzhen Liu, Zheng Qin, Qin Zou, Bo Du, Kai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task of embodied AI that requires the agent to find a target object in unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging as it demands both perceptual and cognitive processes for effective perception and decision-making. While perception has gained significant progress powered by the rapidly developed visual foundation models, the progress on the cognitive side remains limited to either implicitly learning from massive navigation demonstrations or explicitly leveraging pre-defined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that humans consistently update their cognitive states while searching for objects in unseen environments, we present CogNav, which attempts to model this cognitive process with the help of large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process with a finite state machine composed of cognitive states ranging from exploration to identification. The transitions between the states are determined by a large language model based on an online built heterogeneous cognitive map containing spatial and semantic information of the scene being explored. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world environments demonstrate that our cognitive modeling significantly improves ObjectNav efficiency, with human-like navigation behaviors. In an open-vocabulary and zero-shot setting, our method advances the SOTA of the HM3D benchmark from 69.3% to 87.2%. The code and data will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Hu, V\'ictor Guti\'errez-Basulto, Ru Li, Jeff Z. Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal entity linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within multimodal contexts to corresponding entities in a multimodal knowledge base. Most existing approaches to MEL are based on representation learning or vision-and-language pre-training mechanisms for exploring the complementary effect among multiple modalities. However, these methods suffer from two limitations. On the one hand, they overlook the possibility of considering negative samples from the same modality. On the other hand, they lack mechanisms to capture bidirectional cross-modal interaction. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-level Matching network for Multimodal Entity Linking (M3EL). Specifically, M3EL is composed of three different modules: (i) a Multimodal Feature Extraction module, which extracts modality-specific representations with a multimodal encoder and introduces an intra-modal contrastive learning sub-module to obtain better discriminative embeddings based on uni-modal differences; (ii) an Intra-modal Matching Network module, which contains two levels of matching granularity: Coarse-grained Global-to-Global and Fine-grained Global-to-Local, to achieve local and global level intra-modal interaction; (iii) a Cross-modal Matching Network module, which applies bidirectional strategies, Textual-to-Visual and Visual-to-Textual matching, to implement bidirectional cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments conducted on WikiMEL, RichpediaMEL, and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of M3EL when compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the \textbf{S}emantic-a\textbf{W}ar\textbf{E} spatial-t\textbf{E}mporal \textbf{T}okenizer (SweetTokenizer), a compact yet effective discretization approach for vision data. Our goal is to boost tokenizers' compression ratio while maintaining reconstruction fidelity in the VQ-VAE paradigm. Firstly, to obtain compact latent representations, we decouple images or videos into spatial-temporal dimensions, translating visual information into learnable querying spatial and temporal tokens through a \textbf{C}ross-attention \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (CQAE). Secondly, to complement visual information during compression, we quantize these tokens via a specialized codebook derived from off-the-shelf LLM embeddings to leverage the rich semantics from language modality. Finally, to enhance training stability and convergence, we also introduce a curriculum learning strategy, which proves critical for effective discrete visual representation learning. SweetTokenizer achieves comparable video reconstruction fidelity with only \textbf{25\%} of the tokens used in previous state-of-the-art video tokenizers, and boost video generation results by \textbf{32.9\%} w.r.t gFVD. When using the same token number, we significantly improves video and image reconstruction results by \textbf{57.1\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 and \textbf{37.2\%} w.r.t rFID on ImageNet-1K. Additionally, the compressed tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10444">Boundary Exploration of Next Best View Policy in 3D Robotic Scanning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leihui Li, Xuping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Next Best View (NBV) problem is a pivotal challenge in 3D robotic scanning, with the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of object capture and reconstruction. Current methods for determining the NBV often overlook view overlaps, assume a virtual origin point for the camera's focus, and rely on voxel representations of 3D data. To address these issues and improve the practicality of scanning unknown objects, we propose an NBV policy in which the next view explores the boundary of the scanned point cloud, and the overlap is intrinsically considered. The scanning distance or camera working distance is adjustable and flexible. To this end, a model-based approach is proposed where the next sensor positions are searched iteratively based on a reference model. A score is calculated by considering the overlaps between newly scanned and existing data, as well as the final convergence. Additionally, following the boundary exploration idea, a deep learning network, Boundary Exploration NBV network (BENBV-Net), is designed and proposed, which can be used to predict the NBV directly from the scanned data without requiring the reference model. It predicts the scores for given boundaries, and the boundary with the highest score is selected as the target point of the next best view. BENBV-Net improves the speed of NBV generation while maintaining the performance of the model-based approach. Our proposed methods are evaluated and compared with existing approaches on the ShapeNet, ModelNet, and 3D Repository datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms others in terms of scanning efficiency and overlap, both of which are crucial for practical 3D scanning applications. The related code is released at \url{github.com/leihui6/BENBV}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno Bianchi, Aakash Agrawal, Stanislas Dehaene, Emmanuel Chemla, Yair Lakretz</p>
<p>Abstract: Human readers can accurately count how many letters are in a word (e.g., 7 in ``buffalo''), remove a letter from a given position (e.g., ``bufflo'') or add a new one. The human brain of readers must have therefore learned to disentangle information related to the position of a letter and its identity. Such disentanglement is necessary for the compositional, unbounded, ability of humans to create and parse new strings, with any combination of letters appearing in any positions. Do modern deep neural models also possess this crucial compositional ability? Here, we tested whether neural models that achieve state-of-the-art on disentanglement of features in visual input can also disentangle letter position and letter identity when trained on images of written words. Specifically, we trained beta variational autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE) to reconstruct images of letter strings and evaluated their disentanglement performance using CompOrth - a new benchmark that we created for studying compositional learning and zero-shot generalization in visual models for orthography. The benchmark suggests a set of tests, of increasing complexity, to evaluate the degree of disentanglement between orthographic features of written words in deep neural models. Using CompOrth, we conducted a set of experiments to analyze the generalization ability of these models, in particular, to unseen word length and to unseen combinations of letter identities and letter positions. We found that while models effectively disentangle surface features, such as horizontal and vertical `retinal' locations of words within an image, they dramatically fail to disentangle letter position and letter identity and lack any notion of word length. Together, this study demonstrates the shortcomings of state-of-the-art $\beta$-VAE models compared to humans and proposes a new challenge and a corresponding benchmark to evaluate neural models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Qian Zhang, Ziyun Li, Chuan Guo, Saeed Mahloujifar, Deeksha Dangwal, Edward Suh, Barbara De Salvo, Chiao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverting visual representations within deep neural networks (DNNs) presents a challenging and important problem in the field of security and privacy for deep learning. The main goal is to invert the features of an unidentified target image generated by a pre-trained DNN, aiming to reconstruct the original image. Feature inversion holds particular significance in understanding the privacy leakage inherent in contemporary split DNN execution techniques, as well as in various applications based on the extracted DNN features.
  In this paper, we explore the use of diffusion models, a promising technique for image synthesis, to enhance feature inversion quality. We also investigate the potential of incorporating alternative forms of prior knowledge, such as textual prompts and cross-frame temporal correlations, to further improve the quality of inverted features. Our findings reveal that diffusion models can effectively leverage hidden information from the DNN features, resulting in superior reconstruction performance compared to previous methods. This research offers valuable insights into how diffusion models can enhance privacy and security within applications that are reliant on DNN features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kailas PS, Selvakumaran R, Palani Murugan, Ramesh Kumar V, Malaya Kumar Biswal M</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements have been made in deep learning-based object detection algorithms, revolutionizing basic computer vision tasks, notably in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. This paper delves into the intricate domain of Small-Object-Detection (SOD) within satellite imagery, highlighting the unique challenges stemming from wide imaging ranges, object distribution, and their varying appearances in bird's-eye-view satellite images. Traditional object detection models face difficulties in detecting small objects due to limited contextual information and class imbalances. To address this, our research presents a meticulously curated dataset comprising 3000 images showcasing cars, ships, and airplanes in satellite imagery. Our study aims to provide valuable insights into small object detection in satellite imagery by empirically evaluating state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we tackle the challenges of satellite video-based object tracking, employing the Byte Track algorithm on the SAT-MTB dataset. Through rigorous experimentation, we aim to offer a comprehensive understanding of the efficacy of state-of-the-art models in Small-Object-Detection for satellite applications. Our findings shed light on the effectiveness of these models and pave the way for future advancements in satellite imagery analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihao Xu, Yiyang Luo, Wei Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometry mathematics problems pose significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) because they involve visual elements and spatial reasoning. Current methods primarily rely on symbolic character awareness to address these problems. Considering geometry problem solving is a relatively nascent field with limited suitable datasets and currently almost no work on solid geometry problem solving, we collect a geometry question-answer dataset by sourcing geometric data from Chinese high school education websites, referred to as GeoMath. It contains solid geometry questions and answers with accurate reasoning steps as compensation for existing plane geometry datasets. Additionally, we propose a Large Multi-modal Model (LMM) framework named Geo-LLaVA, which incorporates retrieval augmentation with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in the training stage, called meta-training, and employs in-context learning (ICL) during inference to improve performance. Our fine-tuned model with ICL attains the state-of-the-art performance of 65.25% and 42.36% on selected questions of the GeoQA dataset and GeoMath dataset respectively with proper inference steps. Notably, our model initially endows the ability to solve solid geometry problems and supports the generation of reasonable solid geometry picture descriptions and problem-solving steps. Our research sets the stage for further exploration of LLMs in multi-modal math problem-solving, particularly in geometry math problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Liu, Monde Duinkharjav, Qi Sun, Sai Qian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging real-time eye-tracking, foveated rendering optimizes hardware efficiency and enhances visual quality virtual reality (VR). This approach leverages eye-tracking techniques to determine where the user is looking, allowing the system to render high-resolution graphics only in the foveal region-the small area of the retina where visual acuity is highest, while the peripheral view is rendered at lower resolution. However, modern deep learning-based gaze-tracking solutions often exhibit a long-tail distribution of tracking errors, which can degrade user experience and reduce the benefits of foveated rendering by causing misalignment and decreased visual quality.
  This paper introduces \textit{FovealNet}, an advanced AI-driven gaze tracking framework designed to optimize system performance by strategically enhancing gaze tracking accuracy. To further reduce the implementation cost of the gaze tracking algorithm, FovealNet employs an event-based cropping method that eliminates over $64.8\%$ of irrelevant pixels from the input image. Additionally, it incorporates a simple yet effective token-pruning strategy that dynamically removes tokens on the fly without compromising tracking accuracy. Finally, to support different runtime rendering configurations, we propose a system performance-aware multi-resolution training strategy, allowing the gaze tracking DNN to adapt and optimize overall system performance more effectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that FovealNet achieves at least $1.42\times$ speed up compared to previous methods and 13\% increase in perceptual quality for foveated output.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Zhao, Dongdong Weng, Qiuxin Du, Zeyu Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Human motion generation involves creating natural sequences of human body poses, widely used in gaming, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. It aims to produce lifelike virtual characters with realistic movements, enhancing virtual agents and immersive experiences. While previous work has focused on motion generation based on signals like movement, music, text, or scene background, the complexity of human motion and its relationships with these signals often results in unsatisfactory outputs. Manifold learning offers a solution by reducing data dimensionality and capturing subspaces of effective motion. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of manifold applications in human motion generation, one of the first in this domain. We explore methods for extracting manifolds from unstructured data, their application in motion generation, and discuss their advantages and future directions. This survey aims to provide a broad perspective on the field and stimulate new approaches to ongoing challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Wu, Xiaobao Wang, Longbiao Wang, Dongxiao He, Jianwu Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) stands as a critical research frontier, seeking to comprehensively unravel human emotions by amalgamating text, audio, and visual data. Yet, discerning subtle emotional nuances within audio and video expressions poses a formidable challenge, particularly when emotional polarities across various segments appear similar. In this paper, our objective is to spotlight emotion-relevant attributes of audio and visual modalities to facilitate multimodal fusion in the context of nuanced emotional shifts in visual-audio scenarios. To this end, we introduce DEVA, a progressive fusion framework founded on textual sentiment descriptions aimed at accentuating emotional features of visual-audio content. DEVA employs an Emotional Description Generator (EDG) to transmute raw audio and visual data into textualized sentiment descriptions, thereby amplifying their emotional characteristics. These descriptions are then integrated with the source data to yield richer, enhanced features. Furthermore, DEVA incorporates the Text-guided Progressive Fusion Module (TPF), leveraging varying levels of text as a core modality guide. This module progressively fuses visual-audio minor modalities to alleviate disparities between text and visual-audio modalities. Experimental results on widely used sentiment analysis benchmark datasets, including MOSI, MOSEI, and CH-SIMS, underscore significant enhancements compared to state-of-the-art models. Moreover, fine-grained emotion experiments corroborate the robust sensitivity of DEVA to subtle emotional variations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyuan Yang, Delin Chen, Xueyang Yu, Maohao Shen, Chuang Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Long video understanding poses unique challenges due to their temporal complexity and low information density. Recent works address this task by sampling numerous frames or incorporating auxiliary tools using LLMs, both of which result in high computational costs. In this work, we introduce a curiosity-driven video agent with self-exploration capability, dubbed as VCA. Built upon VLMs, VCA autonomously navigates video segments and efficiently builds a comprehensive understanding of complex video sequences. Instead of directly sampling frames, VCA employs a tree-search structure to explore video segments and collect frames. Rather than relying on external feedback or reward, VCA leverages VLM's self-generated intrinsic reward to guide its exploration, enabling it to capture the most crucial information for reasoning. Experimental results on multiple long video benchmarks demonstrate our approach's superior effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenfeng Zhuang, Min Cen, Yanfeng Li, Fangyu Zhou, Lequan Yu, Baptiste Magnier, Liansheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant disparities between the features of natural images and those inherent to histopathological images make it challenging to directly apply and transfer pre-trained models from natural images to histopathology tasks. Moreover, the frequent lack of annotations in histopathology patch images has driven researchers to explore self-supervised learning methods like mask reconstruction for learning representations from large amounts of unlabeled data. Crucially, previous mask-based efforts in self-supervised learning have often overlooked the spatial interactions among entities, which are essential for constructing accurate representations of pathological entities. To address these challenges, constructing graphs of entities is a promising approach. In addition, the diffusion reconstruction strategy has recently shown superior performance through its random intensity noise addition technique to enhance the robust learned representation. Therefore, we introduce H-MGDM, a novel self-supervised Histopathology image representation learning method through the Dynamic Entity-Masked Graph Diffusion Model. Specifically, we propose to use complementary subgraphs as latent diffusion conditions and self-supervised targets respectively during pre-training. We note that the graph can embed entities' topological relationships and enhance representation. Dynamic conditions and targets can improve pathological fine reconstruction. Our model has conducted pretraining experiments on three large histopathological datasets. The advanced predictive performance and interpretability of H-MGDM are clearly evaluated on comprehensive downstream tasks such as classification and survival analysis on six datasets. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/centurion-crawler/H-MGDM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehao Chen, Rong Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are essential XML-based formats for versatile graphics, offering resolution independence and scalability. Unlike raster images, SVGs use geometric shapes and support interactivity, animation, and manipulation via CSS and JavaScript. Current SVG generation methods face challenges related to high computational costs and complexity. In contrast, human designers use component-based tools for efficient SVG creation. Inspired by this, SVGBuilder introduces a component-based, autoregressive model for generating high-quality colored SVGs from textual input. It significantly reduces computational overhead and improves efficiency compared to traditional methods. Our model generates SVGs up to 604 times faster than optimization-based approaches. To address the limitations of existing SVG datasets and support our research, we introduce ColorSVG-100K, the first large-scale dataset of colored SVGs, comprising 100,000 graphics. This dataset fills the gap in color information for SVG generation models and enhances diversity in model training. Evaluation against state-of-the-art models demonstrates SVGBuilder's superior performance in practical applications, highlighting its efficiency and quality in generating complex SVG graphics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaifan Zhang, Lihuo He, Xin Jiang, Wen Lu, Di Wang, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have attracted significant attention from researchers due to their non-invasive nature and high temporal sensitivity in decoding visual stimuli. However, most recent studies have focused solely on the relationship between EEG and image data pairs, neglecting the valuable ``beyond-image-modality" information embedded in EEG signals. This results in the loss of critical multimodal information in EEG. To address this limitation, we propose CognitionCapturer, a unified framework that fully leverages multimodal data to represent EEG signals. Specifically, CognitionCapturer trains Modality Expert Encoders for each modality to extract cross-modal information from the EEG modality. Then, it introduces a diffusion prior to map the EEG embedding space to the CLIP embedding space, followed by using a pretrained generative model, the proposed framework can reconstruct visual stimuli with high semantic and structural fidelity. Notably, the framework does not require any fine-tuning of the generative models and can be extended to incorporate more modalities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CognitionCapturer outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runtao Liu, Chen I Chieh, Jindong Gu, Jipeng Zhang, Renjie Pi, Qifeng Chen, Philip Torr, Ashkan Khakzar, Fabio Pizzati</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become widespread, but their limited safety guardrails expose end users to harmful content and potentially allow for model misuse. Current safety measures are typically limited to text-based filtering or concept removal strategies, able to remove just a few concepts from the model's generative capabilities. In this work, we introduce SafetyDPO, a method for safety alignment of T2I models through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We enable the application of DPO for safety purposes in T2I models by synthetically generating a dataset of harmful and safe image-text pairs, which we call CoProV2. Using a custom DPO strategy and this dataset, we train safety experts, in the form of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices, able to guide the generation process away from specific safety-related concepts. Then, we merge the experts into a single LoRA using a novel merging strategy for optimal scaling performance. This expert-based approach enables scalability, allowing us to remove 7 times more harmful concepts from T2I models compared to baselines. SafetyDPO consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on many benchmarks and establishes new practices for safety alignment in T2I networks.

<p>Abstract: We have witnessed the unprecedented success of diffusion-based video generation over the past year. Recently proposed models from the community have wielded the power to generate cinematic and high-resolution videos with smooth motions from arbitrary input prompts. However, as a supertask of image generation, video generation models require more computation and are thus hosted mostly on cloud servers, limiting broader adoption among content creators. In this work, we propose a comprehensive acceleration framework to bring the power of the large-scale video diffusion model to the hands of edge users. From the network architecture scope, we initialize from a compact image backbone and search out the design and arrangement of temporal layers to maximize hardware efficiency. In addition, we propose a dedicated adversarial fine-tuning algorithm for our efficient model and reduce the denoising steps to 4. Our model, with only 0.6B parameters, can generate a 5-second video on an iPhone 16 PM within 5 seconds. Compared to server-side models that take minutes on powerful GPUs to generate a single video, we accelerate the generation by magnitudes while delivering on-par quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of disinformation presents a growing threat to societal trust and democracy, necessitating robust and scalable Fact-Checking systems. In this work, we present Dynamic Evidence-based FAct-checking with Multimodal Experts (DEFAME), a modular, zero-shot MLLM pipeline for open-domain, text-image claim verification. DEFAME frames the problem of fact-checking as a six-stage process, dynamically deciding about the usage of external tools for the retrieval of textual and visual evidence. In addition to the claim's veracity, DEFAME returns a justification accompanied by a comprehensive, multimodal fact-checking report. While most alternatives either focus on sub-tasks of fact-checking, lack explainability or are limited to text-only inputs, DEFAME solves the problem of fact-checking end-to-end, including claims with images or those that require visual evidence. Evaluation on the popular benchmarks VERITE, AVeriTeC, and MOCHEG shows that DEFAME surpasses all previous methods, establishing it as the new state-of-the-art fact-checking system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changan Chen, Juze Zhang, Shrinidhi K. Lakshmikanth, Yusu Fang, Ruizhi Shao, Gordon Wetzstein, Li Fei-Fei, Ehsan Adeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Human communication is inherently multimodal, involving a combination of verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, facial expressions, and body gestures. Modeling these behaviors is essential for understanding human interaction and for creating virtual characters that can communicate naturally in applications like games, films, and virtual reality. However, existing motion generation models are typically limited to specific input modalities -- either speech, text, or motion data -- and cannot fully leverage the diversity of available data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that unifies verbal and non-verbal language using multimodal language models for human motion understanding and generation. This model is flexible in taking text, speech, and motion or any combination of them as input. Coupled with our novel pre-training strategy, our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on co-speech gesture generation but also requires much less data for training. Our model also unlocks an array of novel tasks such as editable gesture generation and emotion prediction from motion. We believe unifying the verbal and non-verbal language of human motion is essential for real-world applications, and language models offer a powerful approach to achieving this goal.

<p>Abstract: We present SUGAR, a zero-shot method for subject-driven video customization.

Unlike previous methods, which require test-time fine-tuning or fail to generate text-aligned videos, SUGAR achieves superior results without the need for extra cost at test-time. To enable zero-shot capability, we introduce a scalable pipeline to construct synthetic dataset which is specifically designed for subject-driven customization, leading to 2.5 millions of image-video-text triplets. Additionally, we propose several methods to enhance our model, including special attention designs, improved training strategies, and a refined sampling algorithm.

<p>Abstract: Editing complex visual content based on ambiguous instructions remains a challenging problem in vision-language modeling. While existing models can contextualize content, they often struggle to grasp the underlying intent within a reference image or scene, leading to misaligned edits. We introduce the Editing Vision-Language Model (EVLM), a system designed to interpret such instructions in conjunction with reference visuals, producing precise and context-aware editing prompts. Leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and KL-Divergence Target Optimization (KTO) alignment technique, EVLM captures subjective editing preferences without requiring binary labels. Fine-tuned on a dataset of 30,000 CoT examples, with rationale paths rated by human evaluators, EVLM demonstrates substantial improvements in alignment with human intentions. Experiments across image, video, 3D, and 4D editing tasks show that EVLM generates coherent, high-quality instructions, supporting a scalable framework for complex vision-language applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10569">Learning to Merge Tokens via Decoupled Embedding for Efficient Vision Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Hoon Lee, Seunghoon Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent token reduction methods for Vision Transformers (ViTs) incorporate token merging, which measures the similarities between token embeddings and combines the most similar pairs. However, their merging policies are directly dependent on intermediate features in ViTs, which prevents exploiting features tailored for merging and requires end-to-end training to improve token merging. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Token Embedding for Merging (DTEM) that enhances token merging through a decoupled embedding learned via a continuously relaxed token merging process. Our method introduces a lightweight embedding module decoupled from the ViT forward pass to extract dedicated features for token merging, thereby addressing the restriction from using intermediate features. The continuously relaxed token merging, applied during training, enables us to learn the decoupled embeddings in a differentiable manner. Thanks to the decoupled structure, our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing ViT backbones and trained either modularly by learning only the decoupled embeddings or end-to-end by fine-tuning. We demonstrate the applicability of DTEM on various tasks, including classification, captioning, and segmentation, with consistent improvement in token merging. Especially in the ImageNet-1k classification, DTEM achieves a 37.2% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining a top-1 accuracy of 79.85% with DeiT-small.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwen Gu, Mahir Patel, Margrit Betke</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a contrastive learning based framework, ExeChecker, for the interpretation of rehabilitation exercises. Our work builds upon state-of-the-art advances in the area of human pose estimation, graph-attention neural networks, and transformer interpretablity. The downstream task is to assist rehabilitation by providing informative feedback to users while they are performing prescribed exercises. We utilize a contrastive learning strategy during training. Given a tuple of correctly and incorrectly executed exercises, our model is able to identify and highlight those joints that are involved in an incorrect movement and thus require the user's attention. We collected an in-house dataset, ExeCheck, with paired recordings of both correct and incorrect execution of exercises. In our experiments, we tested our method on this dataset as well as the UI-PRMD dataset and found ExeCheck outperformed the baseline method using pairwise sequence alignment in identifying joints of physical relevance in rehabilitation exercises.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lojze \v{Z}ust, Matej Kristan</p>
<p>Abstract: Panoptic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision and a crucial component for perception in autonomous vehicles. Recent mask-transformer-based methods achieve impressive performance on standard benchmarks but face significant challenges with small objects, crowded scenes and scenes exhibiting a wide range of object scales. We identify several fundamental shortcomings of the current approaches: (i) the query proposal generation process is biased towards larger objects, resulting in missed smaller objects, (ii) initially well-localized queries may drift to other objects, resulting in missed detections, (iii) spatially well-separated instances may be merged into a single mask causing inconsistent and false scene interpretations. To address these issues, we rethink the individual components of the network and its supervision, and propose a novel method for panoptic segmentation PanSR. PanSR effectively mitigates instance merging, enhances small-object detection and increases performance in crowded scenes, delivering a notable +3.4 PQ improvement over state-of-the-art on the challenging LaRS benchmark, while reaching state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Ghazanfari, Siddharth Garg, Nicolas Flammarion, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Farshad Khorrami, Francesco Croce</p>
<p>Abstract: Human perception of similarity across uni- and multimodal inputs is highly complex, making it challenging to develop automated metrics that accurately mimic it. General purpose vision-language models, such as CLIP and large multi-modal models (LMMs), can be applied as zero-shot perceptual metrics, and several recent works have developed models specialized in narrow perceptual tasks. However, the extent to which existing perceptual metrics align with human perception remains unclear. To investigate this question, we introduce UniSim-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 7 multi-modal perceptual similarity tasks, with a total of 25 datasets. Our evaluation reveals that while general-purpose models perform reasonably well on average, they often lag behind specialized models on individual tasks. Conversely, metrics fine-tuned for specific tasks fail to generalize well to unseen, though related, tasks. As a first step towards a unified multi-task perceptual similarity metric, we fine-tune both encoder-based and generative vision-language models on a subset of the UniSim-Bench tasks. This approach yields the highest average performance, and in some cases, even surpasses taskspecific models. Nevertheless, these models still struggle with generalization to unseen tasks, highlighting the ongoing challenge of learning a robust, unified perceptual similarity metric capable of capturing the human notion of similarity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Blaine Hoak, Ryan Sheatsley, Patrick McDaniel</p>
<p>Abstract: Bias significantly undermines both the accuracy and trustworthiness of machine learning models. To date, one of the strongest biases observed in image classification models is texture bias-where models overly rely on texture information rather than shape information. Yet, existing approaches for measuring and mitigating texture bias have not been able to capture how textures impact model robustness in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce the Texture Association Value (TAV), a novel metric that quantifies how strongly models rely on the presence of specific textures when classifying objects. Leveraging TAV, we demonstrate that model accuracy and robustness are heavily influenced by texture. Our results show that texture bias explains the existence of natural adversarial examples, where over 90% of these samples contain textures that are misaligned with the learned texture of their true label, resulting in confident mispredictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the use of text-to-image generative models increases, so does the adoption of automatic benchmarking methods used in their evaluation. However, while metrics and datasets abound, there are few unified benchmarking libraries that provide a framework for performing evaluations across many datasets and metrics. Furthermore, the rapid introduction of increasingly robust benchmarking methods requires that evaluation libraries remain flexible to new datasets and metrics. Finally, there remains a gap in synthesizing evaluations in order to deliver actionable takeaways about model performance. To enable unified, flexible, and actionable evaluations, we introduce EvalGIM (pronounced ''EvalGym''), a library for evaluating generative image models. EvalGIM contains broad support for datasets and metrics used to measure quality, diversity, and consistency of text-to-image generative models. In addition, EvalGIM is designed with flexibility for user customization as a top priority and contains a structure that allows plug-and-play additions of new datasets and metrics. To enable actionable evaluation insights, we introduce ''Evaluation Exercises'' that highlight takeaways for specific evaluation questions. The Evaluation Exercises contain easy-to-use and reproducible implementations of two state-of-the-art evaluation methods of text-to-image generative models: consistency-diversity-realism Pareto Fronts and disaggregated measurements of performance disparities across groups. EvalGIM also contains Evaluation Exercises that introduce two new analysis methods for text-to-image generative models: robustness analyses of model rankings and balanced evaluations across different prompt styles.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian D. Santamaria, Claudia Isaza, Jhony H. Giraldo</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have been successful in various computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection and image segmentation. However, these tasks remain challenging when these models are tested on datasets with different distributions from the training dataset, a problem known as domain shift. This is especially problematic for recognizing animal species in camera-trap images where we have variability in factors like lighting, camouflage and occlusions. In this paper, we propose the Camera Trap Language-guided Contrastive Learning (CATALOG) model to address these issues. Our approach combines multiple FMs to extract visual and textual features from camera-trap data and uses a contrastive loss function to train the model. We evaluate CATALOG on two benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in camera-trap image recognition, especially when the training and testing data have different animal species or come from different geographical areas. Our approach demonstrates the potential of using FMs in combination with multi-modal fusion and contrastive learning for addressing domain shifts in camera-trap image recognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joonmo Ahna, Taehong Jang, Quan Fengnyu, Hyungil Lee, Jaehyuk Lee, Sojung Lucia Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We implemented a high-performance optical character recognition model for classical handwritten documents using data augmentation with highly variable cropping within the document region. Optical character recognition in handwritten documents, especially classical documents, has been a challenging topic in many countries and research organizations due to its difficulty. Although many researchers have conducted research on this topic, the quality of classical texts over time and the unique stylistic characteristics of various authors have made it difficult, and it is clear that the recognition of hanja handwritten documents is a meaningful and special challenge, especially since hanja, which has been developed by reflecting the vocabulary, semantic, and syntactic features of the Joseon Dynasty, is different from classical Chinese characters. To study this challenge, we used 1100 cursive documents, which are small in size, and augmented 100 documents per document by cropping a randomly sized region within each document for training, and trained them using a two-stage object detection model, High resolution neural network (HRNet), and applied the resulting model to achieve a high inference recognition rate of 90% for cursive documents. Through this study, we also confirmed that the performance of OCR is affected by the simplified characters, variants, variant characters, common characters, and alternators of Chinese characters that are difficult to see in other studies, and we propose that the results of this study can be applied to optical character recognition of modern documents in multiple languages as well as other typefaces in classical documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Wang, Yang Liu, Aihua Zheng, Pingping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to retrieve specific objects by combining complementary information from multiple modalities. Existing multi-modal object ReID methods primarily focus on the fusion of heterogeneous features. However, they often overlook the dynamic quality changes in multi-modal imaging. In addition, the shared information between different modalities can weaken modality-specific information. To address these issues, we propose a novel feature learning framework called DeMo for multi-modal object ReID, which adaptively balances decoupled features using a mixture of experts. To be specific, we first deploy a Patch-Integrated Feature Extractor (PIFE) to extract multi-granularity and multi-modal features. Then, we introduce a Hierarchical Decoupling Module (HDM) to decouple multi-modal features into non-overlapping forms, preserving the modality uniqueness and increasing the feature diversity. Finally, we propose an Attention-Triggered Mixture of Experts (ATMoE), which replaces traditional gating with dynamic attention weights derived from decoupled features. With these modules, our DeMo can generate more robust multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks fully verify the effectiveness of our methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changjin Kim, Tae Hyun Kim, Sungyong Baik</p>
<p>Abstract: Removing noise from images, a.k.a image denoising, can be a very challenging task since the type and amount of noise can greatly vary for each image due to many factors including a camera model and capturing environments. While there have been striking improvements in image denoising with the emergence of advanced deep learning architectures and real-world datasets, recent denoising networks struggle to maintain performance on images with noise that has not been seen during training. One typical approach to address the challenge would be to adapt a denoising network to new noise distribution. Instead, in this work, we shift our focus to adapting the input noise itself, rather than adapting a network. Thus, we keep a pretrained network frozen, and adapt an input noise to capture the fine-grained deviations. As such, we propose a new denoising algorithm, dubbed Learning-to-Adapt-Noise (LAN), where a learnable noise offset is directly added to a given noisy image to bring a given input noise closer towards the noise distribution a denoising network is trained to handle. Consequently, the proposed framework exhibits performance improvement on images with unseen noise, displaying the potential of the proposed research direction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaichen Xu, Qilong Wu, Yan Lu, Yinan Zheng, Wenlin Li, Xingjie Tang, Jun Wang, Xiaobo Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection of anomalous tissue regions (ATRs) within affected tissues is crucial in clinical diagnosis and pathological studies. Conventional automated ATR detection methods, primarily based on histology images alone, falter in cases where ATRs and normal tissues have subtle visual differences. The recent spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology profiles gene expressions across tissue regions, offering a molecular perspective for detecting ATRs. However, there is a dearth of ATR detection methods that effectively harness complementary information from both histology images and ST. To address this gap, we propose MEATRD, a novel ATR detection method that integrates histology image and ST data. MEATRD is trained to reconstruct image patches and gene expression profiles of normal tissue spots (inliers) from their multimodal embeddings, followed by learning a one-class classification AD model based on latent multimodal reconstruction errors. This strategy harmonizes the strengths of reconstruction-based and one-class classification approaches. At the heart of MEATRD is an innovative masked graph dual-attention transformer (MGDAT) network, which not only facilitates cross-modality and cross-node information sharing but also addresses the model over-generalization issue commonly seen in reconstruction-based AD methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that modality-specific, task-relevant information is collated and condensed in multimodal bottleneck encoding generated in MGDAT, marking the first theoretical analysis of the informational properties of multimodal bottleneck encoding. Extensive evaluations across eight real ST datasets reveal MEATRD's superior performance in ATR detection, surpassing various state-of-the-art AD methods. Remarkably, MEATRD also proves adept at discerning ATRs that only show slight visual deviations from normal tissues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuke Akamatsu, Terumi Umematsu, Hitoshi Imaoka</p>
<p>Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) measurement plays an essential role in assessing health on a daily basis. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which extracts pulse waves from camera-captured face videos, has the potential to easily measure BP for daily health monitoring. However, there are many uncertainties in BP estimation using rPPG, resulting in limited estimation performance. In this paper, we propose U-FaceBP, an uncertainty-aware Bayesian ensemble deep learning method for face video-based BP measurement. U-FaceBP models three types of uncertainty, i.e., data, model, and ensemble uncertainties, in face video-based BP estimation with a Bayesian neural network (BNN). We also design U-FaceBP as an ensemble method, with which BP is estimated from rPPG signals, PPG signals estimated from face videos, and face images using multiple BNNs. A large-scale experiment with 786 subjects demonstrates that U-FaceBP outperforms state-of-the-art BP estimation methods. We also show that the uncertainties estimated from U-FaceBP are reasonable and useful for prediction confidence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Universal Cross-Domain Retrieval (UCDR) retrieves relevant images from unseen domains and classes without semantic labels, ensuring robust generalization. Existing methods commonly employ prompt tuning with pre-trained vision-language models but are inherently limited by static prompts, reducing adaptability. We propose UCDR-Adapter, which enhances pre-trained models with adapters and dynamic prompt generation through a two-phase training strategy. First, Source Adapter Learning integrates class semantics with domain-specific visual knowledge using a Learnable Textual Semantic Template and optimizes Class and Domain Prompts via momentum updates and dual loss functions for robust alignment. Second, Target Prompt Generation creates dynamic prompts by attending to masked source prompts, enabling seamless adaptation to unseen domains and classes. Unlike prior approaches, UCDR-Adapter dynamically adapts to evolving data distributions, enhancing both flexibility and generalization. During inference, only the image branch and generated prompts are used, eliminating reliance on textual inputs for highly efficient retrieval. Extensive benchmark experiments show that UCDR-Adapter consistently outperforms ProS in most cases and other state-of-the-art methods on UCDR, U(c)CDR, and U(d)CDR settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deng Siqin, Zhou Xiaoyi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved record-breaking performance in various visual tasks. However, concerns about their robustness against backdoor attacks have grown. Backdoor attacks involve associating a specific trigger with a target label, causing the model to predict the attacker-specified label when the trigger is present, while correctly identifying clean images.We found that ViTs exhibit higher attack success rates for quasi-triggers(patterns different from but similar to the original training triggers)compared to CNNs. Moreover, some backdoor features in clean samples can suppress the original trigger, making quasi-triggers more effective.To better understand and exploit these vulnerabilities, we developed a tool called the Perturbation Sensitivity Distribution Map (PSDM). PSDM computes and sums gradients over many inputs to show how sensitive the model is to small changes in the input. In ViTs, PSDM reveals a patch-like pattern where central pixels are more sensitive than edges. We use PSDM to guide the creation of quasi-triggers.Based on these findings, we designed "WorstVIT," a simple yet effective data poisoning backdoor for ViT models. This attack requires an extremely low poisoning rate, trains for just one epoch, and modifies a single pixel to successfully attack all validation images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Lin, Yihan Hu, Chenyi Zhang, Ting Liu, Xiaochao Qu, Luoqi Liu, Yao Zhao, Yunchao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently achieved outstanding performance in image matting. However, their application to high-resolution images remains challenging due to the quadratic complexity of global self-attention. To address this issue, we propose MEMatte, a memory-efficient matting framework for processing high-resolution images. MEMatte incorporates a router before each global attention block, directing informative tokens to the global attention while routing other tokens to a Lightweight Token Refinement Module (LTRM). Specifically, the router employs a local-global strategy to predict the routing probability of each token, and the LTRM utilizes efficient modules to simulate global attention. Additionally, we introduce a Batch-constrained Adaptive Token Routing (BATR) mechanism, which allows each router to dynamically route tokens based on image content and the stages of attention block in the network. Furthermore, we construct an ultra high-resolution image matting dataset, UHR-395, comprising 35,500 training images and 1,000 test images, with an average resolution of $4872\times6017$. This dataset is created by compositing 395 different alpha mattes across 11 categories onto various backgrounds, all with high-quality manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEMatte outperforms existing methods on both high-resolution and real-world datasets, significantly reducing memory usage by approximately 88% and latency by 50% on the Composition-1K benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Wang, Xuehu Liu, Tianyu Yan, Yang Liu, Aihua Zheng, Pingping Zhang, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to retrieve specific objects by utilizing complementary image information from different modalities. Recently, large-scale pre-trained models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive performance in traditional single-modal object ReID tasks. However, they remain unexplored for multi-modal object ReID. Furthermore, current multi-modal aggregation methods have obvious limitations in dealing with long sequences from different modalities. To address above issues, we introduce a novel framework called MambaPro for multi-modal object ReID. To be specific, we first employ a Parallel Feed-Forward Adapter (PFA) for adapting CLIP to multi-modal object ReID. Then, we propose the Synergistic Residual Prompt (SRP) to guide the joint learning of multi-modal features. Finally, leveraging Mamba's superior scalability for long sequences, we introduce Mamba Aggregation (MA) to efficiently model interactions between different modalities. As a result, MambaPro could extract more robust features with lower complexity. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201, RGBNT100 and MSVR310) validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tulashi Prasasd Joshi, Amrendra Kumar Yadav, Arjun Chhetri, Suraj Agrahari, Umesh Kanta Ghimire</p>
<p>Abstract: Online shopping has revolutionized the retail industry, providing customers with convenience and accessibility. However, customers often hesitate to purchase wearable products such as watches, jewelry, glasses, shoes, and clothes due to the lack of certainty regarding fit and suitability. This leads to significant return rates, causing problems for both customers and vendors. To address this issue, a platform called the Virtual Trial Room with Computer Vision and Machine Learning is designed which enables customers to easily check whether a product will fit and suit them or not. To achieve this, an AI-generated 3D model of the human head was created from a single 2D image using the DECA model. This 3D model was then superimposed with a custom-made 3D model of glass which is based on real-world measurements and fitted over the human head. To replicate the real-world look and feel, the model was retouched with textures, lightness, and smoothness. Furthermore, a full-stack application was developed utilizing various fornt-end and back-end technologies. This application enables users to view 3D-generated results on the website, providing an immersive and interactive experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Wan, Xiangyang Luo, Zijian Cai, Yiren Song, Yunlong Zhao, Yifan Bai, Yuhang He, Yihong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GRID, a novel paradigm that reframes a broad range of visual generation tasks as the problem of arranging grids, akin to film strips. At its core, GRID transforms temporal sequences into grid layouts, enabling image generation models to process visual sequences holistically. To achieve both layout consistency and motion coherence, we develop a parallel flow-matching training strategy that combines layout matching and temporal losses, guided by a coarse-to-fine schedule that evolves from basic layouts to precise motion control. Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency, achieving up to 35 faster inference speeds while using 1/1000 of the computational resources compared to specialized models. Extensive experiments show that GRID exhibits exceptional versatility across diverse visual generation tasks, from Text-to-Video to 3D Editing, while maintaining its foundational image generation capabilities. This dual strength in both expanded applications and preserved core competencies establishes GRID as an efficient and versatile omni-solution for visual generation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10719">Just a Few Glances: Open-Set Visual Perception with Image Prompt Paradigm</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinrong Zhang, Penghui Wang, Chunxiao Liu, Wei Liu, Dian Jin, Qiong Zhang, Erli Meng, Zhengnan Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: To break through the limitations of pre-training models on fixed categories, Open-Set Object Detection (OSOD) and Open-Set Segmentation (OSS) have attracted a surge of interest from researchers. Inspired by large language models, mainstream OSOD and OSS methods generally utilize text as a prompt, achieving remarkable performance. Following SAM paradigm, some researchers use visual prompts, such as points, boxes, and masks that cover detection or segmentation targets. Despite these two prompt paradigms exhibit excellent performance, they also reveal inherent limitations. On the one hand, it is difficult to accurately describe characteristics of specialized category using textual description. On the other hand, existing visual prompt paradigms heavily rely on multi-round human interaction, which hinders them being applied to fully automated pipeline. To address the above issues, we propose a novel prompt paradigm in OSOD and OSS, that is, \textbf{Image Prompt Paradigm}. This brand new prompt paradigm enables to detect or segment specialized categories without multi-round human intervention. To achieve this goal, the proposed image prompt paradigm uses just a few image instances as prompts, and we propose a novel framework named \textbf{MI Grounding} for this new paradigm. In this framework, high-quality image prompts are automatically encoded, selected and fused, achieving the single-stage and non-interactive inference. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets, showing that MI Grounding achieves competitive performance on OSOD and OSS benchmarks compared to text prompt paradigm methods and visual prompt paradigm methods. Moreover, MI Grounding can greatly outperform existing method on our constructed specialized ADR50K dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji-jun Park, Soo-joon Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Video captioning is a critical task in the field of multimodal machine learning, aiming to generate descriptive and coherent textual narratives for video content. While large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown significant progress, they often struggle to capture the causal and temporal dynamics inherent in complex video sequences. To address this limitation, we propose an enhanced framework that integrates a Causal-Temporal Reasoning Module (CTRM) into state-of-the-art LVLMs. CTRM comprises two key components: the Causal Dynamics Encoder (CDE) and the Temporal Relational Learner (TRL), which collectively encode causal dependencies and temporal consistency from video frames. We further design a multi-stage learning strategy to optimize the model, combining pre-training on large-scale video-text datasets, fine-tuning on causally annotated data, and contrastive alignment for better embedding coherence. Experimental results on standard benchmarks such as MSVD and MSR-VTT demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both automatic metrics (CIDEr, BLEU-4, ROUGE-L) and human evaluations, achieving more fluent, coherent, and relevant captions. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in generating captions with enriched causal-temporal narratives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Wu, Chuhao Zhou, Yen Heng Wong, Lin Gu, Jianfei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced the development of Embodied Question Answering (EQA), enhancing agents' abilities in language understanding and reasoning within complex and realistic scenarios. However, EQA in real-world scenarios remains challenging, as human-posed questions often contain noise that can interfere with an agent's exploration and response, bringing challenges especially for language beginners and non-expert users. To address this, we introduce a NoisyEQA benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to recognize and correct noisy questions. This benchmark introduces four common types of noise found in real-world applications: Latent Hallucination Noise, Memory Noise, Perception Noise, and Semantic Noise generated through an automated dataset creation framework. Additionally, we also propose a 'Self-Correction' prompting mechanism and a new evaluation metric to enhance and measure both noise detection capability and answer quality. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current EQA agents often struggle to detect noise in questions, leading to responses that frequently contain erroneous information. Through our Self-Correct Prompting mechanism, we can effectively improve the accuracy of agent answers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjun Huang, Jianguo Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have traditionally faced challenges in scaling and effectively capturing complex dependencies in visual tasks. The xLSTM architecture has emerged to address these limitations, incorporating exponential gating and a parallel matrix memory structure to enhance performance and scalability. Despite these advancements, the potential of xLSTM in visual computing has not been fully realized, particularly in leveraging autoregressive techniques for improved feature extraction. In this paper, we introduce MAL (Cluster-Masked and Multi-Task Pretraining for Enhanced xLSTM Vision Performance), a novel framework that enhances xLSTM's capabilities through innovative pretraining strategies. We propose a cluster-masked masking method that significantly improves local feature capture and optimizes image scanning efficiency. Additionally, our universal encoder-decoder pretraining approach integrates multiple tasks, including image autoregression, depth estimation, and image segmentation, thereby enhancing the model's adaptability and robustness across diverse visual tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that MAL surpasses traditional supervised models and fully leverages the scaling potential of xLSTM, setting a new benchmark in visual task performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning has intensified the need for comprehensive data for use by autonomous driving algorithms. High-quality datasets are crucial for the development of effective data-driven autonomous driving solutions. Next-generation autonomous driving datasets must be multimodal, incorporating data from advanced sensors that feature extensive data coverage, detailed annotations, and diverse scene representation. To address this need, we present OmniHD-Scenes, a large-scale multimodal dataset that provides comprehensive omnidirectional high-definition data. The OmniHD-Scenes dataset combines data from 128-beam LiDAR, six cameras, and six 4D imaging radar systems to achieve full environmental perception. The dataset comprises 1501 clips, each approximately 30-s long, totaling more than 450K synchronized frames and more than 5.85 million synchronized sensor data points. We also propose a novel 4D annotation pipeline. To date, we have annotated 200 clips with more than 514K precise 3D bounding boxes. These clips also include semantic segmentation annotations for static scene elements. Additionally, we introduce a novel automated pipeline for generation of the dense occupancy ground truth, which effectively leverages information from non-key frames. Alongside the proposed dataset, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics, baseline models, and benchmarks for 3D detection and semantic occupancy prediction. These benchmarks utilize surround-view cameras and 4D imaging radar to explore cost-effective sensor solutions for autonomous driving applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our low-cost sensor configuration and its robustness under adverse conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Zhang, Yilei Wang, Lang Qian, Peng Sun, Zengwen Li, Sudong Jiang, Maolin Liu, Liang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: As a potential application of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, multi-agent collaborative perception has achieved significant success in 3D object detection. While these methods have demonstrated impressive results on standard benchmarks, the robustness of such approaches in the face of complex real-world environments requires additional verification. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of collaborative perception methods in the presence of natural corruptions typical of real-world environments. Furthermore, we propose DSRC, a robustness-enhanced collaborative perception method aiming to learn Density-insensitive and Semantic-aware collaborative Representation against Corruptions. DSRC consists of two key designs: i) a semantic-guided sparse-to-dense distillation framework, which constructs multi-view dense objects painted by ground truth bounding boxes to effectively learn density-insensitive and semantic-aware collaborative representation; ii) a feature-to-point cloud reconstruction approach to better fuse critical collaborative representation across agents. To thoroughly evaluate DSRC, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms SOTA collaborative perception methods in both clean and corrupted conditions. Code is available at https://github.com/Terry9a/DSRC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Chen, Shuai Zheng, Nianyi Wang, Menglong Jin, Yan Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating fuel sloshing within aircraft tanks during flight is crucial for aircraft safety research. Traditional methods based on Navier-Stokes equations are computationally expensive. In this paper, we treat fluid motion as point cloud transformation and propose the first neural network method specifically designed for simulating fuel sloshing in aircraft. This model is also the deep learning model that is the first to be capable of stably modeling fluid particle dynamics in such complex scenarios. Our triangle feature fusion design achieves an optimal balance among fluid dynamics modeling, momentum conservation constraints, and global stability control. Additionally, we constructed the Fueltank dataset, the first dataset for aircraft fuel surface sloshing. It comprises 320,000 frames across four typical tank types and covers a wide range of flight maneuvers, including multi-directional rotations. We conducted comprehensive experiments on both our dataset and the take-off scenario of the aircraft. Compared to existing neural network-based fluid simulation algorithms, we significantly enhanced accuracy while maintaining high computational speed. Compared to traditional SPH methods, our speed improved approximately 10 times. Furthermore, compared to traditional fluid simulation software such as Flow3D, our computation speed increased by more than 300 times.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted disaster recovery missions have been promoted recently due to their reliability and flexibility. Machine learning algorithms running onboard significantly enhance the utility of UAVs by enabling real-time data processing and efficient decision-making, despite being in a resource-constrained environment. However, the limited bandwidth and intermittent connectivity make transmitting the outputs to ground stations challenging. This paper proposes a novel semantic extractor that can be adopted into any machine learning downstream task for identifying the critical data required for decision-making. The semantic extractor can be executed onboard which results in a reduction of data that needs to be transmitted to ground stations. We test the proposed architecture together with the semantic extractor on two publicly available datasets, FloodNet and RescueNet, for two downstream tasks: visual question answering and disaster damage level classification. Our experimental results demonstrate the proposed method maintains high accuracy across different downstream tasks while significantly reducing the volume of transmitted data, highlighting the effectiveness of our semantic extractor in capturing task-specific salient information.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as key enablers for multimodal tasks, but their reliance on separate visual encoders introduces challenges in efficiency, scalability, and modality alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MUDAIF (Multimodal Unified Decoder with Adaptive Input Fusion), a decoder-only vision-language model that seamlessly integrates visual and textual inputs through a novel Vision-Token Adapter (VTA) and adaptive co-attention mechanism. By eliminating the need for a visual encoder, MUDAIF achieves enhanced efficiency, flexibility, and cross-modal understanding. Trained on a large-scale dataset of 45M image-text pairs, MUDAIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, including VQA, image captioning, and multimodal reasoning tasks. Extensive analyses and human evaluations demonstrate MUDAIF's robustness, generalization capabilities, and practical usability, establishing it as a new standard in encoder-free vision-language models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10761">Rebalanced Vision-Language Retrieval Considering Structure-Aware Distillation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yang, Wenjuan Xi, Luping Zhou, Jinhui Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language retrieval aims to search for similar instances in one modality based on queries from another modality. The primary objective is to learn cross-modal matching representations in a latent common space. Actually, the assumption underlying cross-modal matching is modal balance, where each modality contains sufficient information to represent the others. However, noise interference and modality insufficiency often lead to modal imbalance, making it a common phenomenon in practice. The impact of imbalance on retrieval performance remains an open question. In this paper, we first demonstrate that ultimate cross-modal matching is generally sub-optimal for cross-modal retrieval when imbalanced modalities exist. The structure of instances in the common space is inherently influenced when facing imbalanced modalities, posing a challenge to cross-modal similarity measurement. To address this issue, we emphasize the importance of meaningful structure-preserved matching. Accordingly, we propose a simple yet effective method to rebalance cross-modal matching by learning structure-preserved matching representations. Specifically, we design a novel multi-granularity cross-modal matching that incorporates structure-aware distillation alongside the cross-modal matching loss. While the cross-modal matching loss constraints instance-level matching, the structure-aware distillation further regularizes the geometric consistency between learned matching representations and intra-modal representations through the developed relational matching. Extensive experiments on different datasets affirm the superior cross-modal retrieval performance of our approach, simultaneously enhancing single-modal retrieval capabilities compared to the baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jurica Runtas, Tomislav Petkovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are a contemporary solution for semantic segmentation and are usually trained to operate on a predefined closed set of classes. In open-set environments, it is possible to encounter semantically unknown objects or anomalies. Road driving is an example of such an environment in which, from a safety standpoint, it is important to ensure that a DNN indicates it is operating outside of its learned semantic domain. One possible approach to anomaly segmentation is entropy maximization, which is paired with a logistic regression based post-processing step called meta classification, which is in turn used to improve the reliability of detection of anomalous pixels. We propose to substitute the logistic regression meta classifier with a more expressive lightweight fully connected neural network. We analyze advantages and drawbacks of the proposed neural network meta classifier and demonstrate its better performance over logistic regression. We also introduce the concept of informative out-of-distribution examples which we show to improve training results when using entropy maximization in practice. Finally, we discuss the loss of interpretability and show that the behavior of logistic regression and neural network is strongly correlated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saksham Singh Kushwaha, Yapeng Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation have focused on text-to-audio (T2A) and video-to-audio (V2A) tasks. However, T2A or V2A methods cannot generate holistic sounds (onscreen and off-screen). This is because T2A cannot generate sounds aligning with onscreen objects, while V2A cannot generate semantically complete (offscreen sounds missing). In this work, we address the task of holistic audio generation: given a video and a text prompt, we aim to generate both onscreen and offscreen sounds that are temporally synchronized with the video and semantically aligned with text and video. Previous approaches for joint text and video-to-audio generation often suffer from modality bias, favoring one modality over the other. To overcome this limitation, we introduce VinTAGe, a flow-based transformer model that jointly considers text and video to guide audio generation. Our framework comprises two key components: a Visual-Text Encoder and a Joint VT-SiT model. To reduce modality bias and improve generation quality, we employ pretrained uni-modal text-to-audio and video-to-audio generation models for additional guidance. Due to the lack of appropriate benchmarks, we also introduce VinTAGe-Bench, a dataset of 636 video-text-audio pairs containing both onscreen and offscreen sounds. Our comprehensive experiments on VinTAGe-Bench demonstrate that joint text and visual interaction is necessary for holistic audio generation. Furthermore, VinTAGe achieves state-of-the-art results on the VGGSound benchmark. Our source code and pre-trained models will be released.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Liu, Yaran Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Current advanced policy learning methodologies have demonstrated the ability to develop expert-level strategies when provided enough information. However, their requirements, including task-specific rewards, expert-labeled trajectories, and huge environmental interactions, can be expensive or even unavailable in many scenarios. In contrast, humans can efficiently acquire skills within a few trials and errors by imitating easily accessible internet video, in the absence of any other supervision. In this paper, we try to let machines replicate this efficient watching-and-learning process through Unsupervised Policy from Ensemble Self-supervised labeled Videos (UPESV), a novel framework to efficiently learn policies from videos without any other expert supervision. UPESV trains a video labeling model to infer the expert actions in expert videos, through several organically combined self-supervised tasks. Each task performs its own duties, and they together enable the model to make full use of both expert videos and reward-free interactions for advanced dynamics understanding and robust prediction. Simultaneously, UPESV clones a policy from the labeled expert videos, in turn collecting environmental interactions for self-supervised tasks. After a sample-efficient and unsupervised (i.e., reward-free) training process, an advanced video-imitated policy is obtained. Extensive experiments in sixteen challenging procedurally-generated environments demonstrate that the proposed UPESV achieves state-of-the-art few-shot policy learning (outperforming five current advanced baselines on 12/16 tasks) without exposure to any other supervision except videos. Detailed analysis is also provided, verifying the necessity of each self-supervised task employed in UPESV.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates a solution for enabling in-context capabilities of video diffusion transformers, with minimal tuning required for activation. Specifically, we propose a simple pipeline to leverage in-context generation: ($\textbf{i}$) concatenate videos along spacial or time dimension, ($\textbf{ii}$) jointly caption multi-scene video clips from one source, and ($\textbf{iii}$) apply task-specific fine-tuning using carefully curated small datasets. Through a series of diverse controllable tasks, we demonstrate qualitatively that existing advanced text-to-video models can effectively perform in-context generation. Notably, it allows for the creation of consistent multi-scene videos exceeding 30 seconds in duration, without additional computational overhead. Importantly, this method requires no modifications to the original models, results in high-fidelity video outputs that better align with prompt specifications and maintain role consistency. Our framework presents a valuable tool for the research community and offers critical insights for advancing product-level controllable video generation systems.

<p>Abstract: Kinship face synthesis is a challenging problem due to the scarcity and low quality of the available kinship data. Existing methods often struggle to generate descendants with both high diversity and fidelity while precisely controlling facial attributes such as age and gender. To address these issues, we propose the Style Latent Diffusion Transformer (StyleDiT), a novel framework that integrates the strengths of StyleGAN with the diffusion model to generate high-quality and diverse kinship faces. In this framework, the rich facial priors of StyleGAN enable fine-grained attribute control, while our conditional diffusion model is used to sample a StyleGAN latent aligned with the kinship relationship of conditioning images by utilizing the advantage of modeling complex kinship relationship distribution. StyleGAN then handles latent decoding for final face generation. Additionally, we introduce the Relational Trait Guidance (RTG) mechanism, enabling independent control of influencing conditions, such as each parent's facial image. RTG also enables a fine-grained adjustment between the diversity and fidelity in synthesized faces. Furthermore, we extend the application to an unexplored domain: predicting a partner's facial images using a child's image and one parent's image within the same framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our StyleDiT outperforms existing methods by striking an excellent balance between generating diverse and high-fidelity kinship faces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jen-Yuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have demonstrated exceptional capability of generating high-quality and diverse images, but their practical application is hindered by the intensive computational cost during inference. The DPM generation process requires solving a Probability-Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE), which involves discretizing the integration domain into intervals for numerical approximation. This corresponds to the sampling schedule of a diffusion ODE solver, and we notice the solution from a first-order solver can be expressed as a convex combination of model outputs at all scheduled time-steps. We derive an upper bound for the discretization error of the sampling schedule, which can be efficiently optimized with Monte-Carlo estimation. Building on these theoretical results, we purpose a two-phase alternating optimization algorithm. In Phase-1, the sampling schedule is optimized for the pre-trained DPM; in Phase-2, the DPM further tuned on the selected time-steps.

<p>Abstract: Elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) is a powerful tool for shape analysis, which is often employed in geometric morphometrics. However, the normalization of elliptic Fourier descriptors has persistently posed challenges in obtaining unique results in basic contour transformations, requiring extensive manual alignment. Additionally, contemporary contour/outline extraction methods often struggle to handle complex digital images. Here, we reformulated the procedure of EFDs calculation to improve computational efficiency and introduced a novel approach for EFD normalization, termed true EFD normalization, which remains invariant under all basic contour transformations. These improvements are crucial for processing large sets of contour curves collected from different platforms with varying transformations. Based on these improvements, we developed ElliShape, a user-friendly software. Particularly, the improved contour/outline extraction employs an interactive approach that combines automatic contour generation for efficiency with manual correction for essential modifications and refinements. We evaluated ElliShape's stability, robustness, and ease of use by comparing it with existing software using standard datasets. ElliShape consistently produced reliable reconstructed shapes and normalized EFD values across different contours and transformations, and it demonstrated superior performance in visualization and efficient processing of various digital images for contour analysis.The output annotated images and EFDs could be utilized in deep learning-based data training, thereby advancing artificial intelligence in botany and offering innovative solutions for critical challenges in biodiversity conservation, species classification, ecosystem function assessment, and related critical issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Tian, Shuo Wang, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Face de-identification (DeID) has been widely studied for common scenes, but remains under-researched for medical scenes, mostly due to the lack of large-scale patient face datasets. In this paper, we release MeMa, consisting of over 40,000 photo-realistic patient faces. MeMa is re-generated from massive real patient photos. By carefully modulating the generation and data-filtering procedures, MeMa avoids breaching real patient privacy, while ensuring rich and plausible medical manifestations. We recruit expert clinicians to annotate MeMa with both coarse- and fine-grained labels, building the first medical-scene DeID benchmark. Additionally, we propose a baseline approach for this new medical-aware DeID task, by integrating data-driven medical semantic priors into the DeID procedure. Despite its conciseness and simplicity, our approach substantially outperforms previous ones. Dataset is available at https://github.com/tianyuan168326/MeMa-Pytorch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Bi, Michael Fulham, Jinman Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic skin lesion segmentation methods based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) are regarded as the state-of-the-art for accuracy. When there are, however, insufficient training data to cover all the variations in skin lesions, where lesions from different patients may have major differences in size/shape/texture, these methods failed to segment the lesions that have image characteristics, which are less common in the training datasets. FCN-based semi-automatic segmentation methods, which fuse user-inputs with high-level semantic image features derived from FCNs offer an ideal complement to overcome limitations of automatic segmentation methods. These semi-automatic methods rely on the automated state-of-the-art FCNs coupled with user-inputs for refinements, and therefore being able to tackle challenging skin lesions. However, there are a limited number of FCN-based semi-automatic segmentation methods and all these methods focused on early-fusion, where the first few convolutional layers are used to fuse image features and user-inputs and then derive fused image features for segmentation. For early-fusion based methods, because the user-input information can be lost after the first few convolutional layers, consequently, the user-input information will have limited guidance and constraint in segmenting the challenging skin lesions with inhomogeneous textures and fuzzy boundaries. Hence, in this work, we introduce a hyper-fusion network (HFN) to fuse the extracted user-inputs and image features over multiple stages. We separately extract complementary features which then allows for an iterative use of user-inputs along all the fusion stages to refine the segmentation. We evaluated our HFN on ISIC 2017, ISIC 2016 and PH2 datasets, and our results show that the HFN is more accurate and generalizable than the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sida Huang, Hongyuan Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of pre-trained vision-language (VL) models, enhancing the alignment between visual and linguistic modalities in downstream tasks has emerged as a critical challenge. Different from existing fine-tuning methods that add extra modules to these two modalities, we investigate whether the frozen model can be fine-tuned by customized noise. Our approach is motivated by the scientific study of beneficial noise, namely Positive-incentive Noise (Pi-noise or $\pi$-noise) , which quantitatively analyzes the impact of noise. It therefore implies a new scheme to learn beneficial noise distribution that can be employed to fine-tune VL models. Focusing on few-shot classification tasks based on CLIP, we reformulate the inference process of CLIP and apply variational inference, demonstrating how to generate $\pi$-noise towards visual and linguistic modalities. Then, we propose Positive-incentive Noise Injector (PiNI), which can fine-tune CLIP via injecting noise into both visual and text encoders. Since the proposed method can learn the distribution of beneficial noise, we can obtain more diverse embeddings of vision and language to better align these two modalities for specific downstream tasks within limited computational resources. We evaluate different noise incorporation approaches and network architectures of PiNI. The evaluation across 11 datasets demonstrates its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dengyang Jiang, Haoyu Wang, Lei Zhang, Wei Wei, Guang Dai, Mengmeng Wang, Jingdong Wang, Yanning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-training backbone networks on a general annotated dataset (e.g., ImageNet) that comprises numerous manually collected images with category annotations has proven to be indispensable for enhancing the generalization capacity of downstream visual tasks. However, those manually collected images often exhibit bias, which is non-transferable across either categories or domains, thus causing the model's generalization capacity degeneration. To mitigate this problem, we present an unbiased general annotated dataset generation framework (ubGen). Instead of expensive manual collection, we aim at directly generating unbiased images with category annotations. To achieve this goal, we propose to leverage the advantage of a multimodal foundation model (e.g., CLIP), in terms of aligning images in an unbiased semantic space defined by language. Specifically, we develop a bi-level semantic alignment loss, which not only forces all generated images to be consistent with the semantic distribution of all categories belonging to the target dataset in an adversarial learning manner, but also requires each generated image to match the semantic description of its category name. In addition, we further cast an existing image quality scoring model into a quality assurance loss to preserve the quality of the generated image. By leveraging these two loss functions, we can obtain an unbiased image generation model by simply fine-tuning a pre-trained diffusion model using only all category names in the target dataset as input. Experimental results confirm that, compared with the manually labeled dataset or other synthetic datasets, the utilization of our generated unbiased datasets leads to stable generalization capacity enhancement of different backbone networks across various tasks, especially in tasks where the manually labeled samples are scarce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxu Li, Songning Lai, Rui Li, Di Fang, Kejia Fan, Jianheng Tang, Yuhan Zhao, Rongchang Zhao, Dongzhan Zhou, Yutao Yue, Huiping Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep learning has made remarkable progress in recent years, models continue to struggle with catastrophic forgetting when processing continuously incoming data. This issue is particularly critical in continual learning, where the balance between retaining prior knowledge and adapting to new information-known as the stability-plasticity dilemma-remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose SegACIL, a novel continual learning method for semantic segmentation based on a linear closed-form solution. Unlike traditional methods that require multiple epochs for training, SegACIL only requires a single epoch, significantly reducing computational costs. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that SegACIL achieves performance on par with joint learning, effectively retaining knowledge from previous data which makes it to keep both stability and plasticity at the same time. Extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC2012 dataset show that SegACIL achieves superior performance in the sequential, disjoint, and overlap settings, offering a robust solution to the challenges of class-incremental semantic segmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai-Ming Xu, Qi Chen, Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have generated significant interest in their ability to autonomously interact with and interpret Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). A major challenge in these systems is grounding-accurately identifying critical GUI components such as text or icons based on a GUI image and a corresponding text query. Traditionally, this task has relied on fine-tuning MLLMs with specialized training data to predict component locations directly. However, in this paper, we propose a novel Tuning-free Attention-driven Grounding (TAG) method that leverages the inherent attention patterns in pretrained MLLMs to accomplish this task without the need for additional fine-tuning. Our method involves identifying and aggregating attention maps from specific tokens within a carefully constructed query prompt. Applied to MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5, a state-of-the-art MLLM, our tuning-free approach achieves performance comparable to tuning-based methods, with notable success in text localization. Additionally, we demonstrate that our attention map-based grounding technique significantly outperforms direct localization predictions from MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5, highlighting the potential of using attention maps from pretrained MLLMs and paving the way for future innovations in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxian Ruan, Zhihua Xu, Zhijing Yang, Yongyi Lu, Jinghui Qin, Tianshui Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-label recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL), in which only some labels are known while others are unknown for each image, is a practical task in computer vision, since collecting large-scale and complete multi-label datasets is difficult in real application scenarios. Recently, vision language models (e.g. CLIP) have demonstrated impressive transferability to downstream tasks in data limited or label limited settings. However, current CLIP-based methods suffer from semantic confusion in MLR task due to the lack of fine-grained information in the single global visual and textual representation for all categories. In this work, we address this problem by introducing a semantic decoupling module and a category-specific prompt optimization method in CLIP-based framework. Specifically, the semantic decoupling module following the visual encoder learns category-specific feature maps by utilizing the semantic-guided spatial attention mechanism. Moreover, the category-specific prompt optimization method is introduced to learn text representations aligned with category semantics. Therefore, the prediction of each category is independent, which alleviate the semantic confusion problem. Extensive experiments on Microsoft COCO 2014 and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms current state-of-art methods with a simpler model structure. Additionally, visual analysis shows that our method effectively separates information from different categories and achieves better performance compared to CLIP-based baseline method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adesh Kadambi, Jos\'e Zariffa</p>
<p>Abstract: Wearable egocentric cameras and machine learning have the potential to provide clinicians with a more nuanced understanding of patient hand use at home after stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI). However, they require detailed contextual information (i.e., activities and object interactions) to effectively interpret metrics and meaningfully guide therapy planning. We demonstrate that an object-centric approach, focusing on what objects patients interact with rather than how they move, can effectively recognize Activities of Daily Living (ADL) in real-world rehabilitation settings. We evaluated our models on a complex dataset collected in the wild comprising 2261 minutes of egocentric video from 16 participants with impaired hand function. By leveraging pre-trained object detection and hand-object interaction models, our system achieves robust performance across different impairment levels and environments, with our best model achieving a mean weighted F1-score of 0.78 +/- 0.12 and maintaining an F1-score > 0.5 for all participants using leave-one-subject-out cross validation. Through qualitative analysis, we observe that this approach generates clinically interpretable information about functional object use while being robust to patient-specific movement variations, making it particularly suitable for rehabilitation contexts with prevalent upper limb impairment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyu Xu, Longguang Wang, Weidong Sheng, Yingqian Wang, Chao Xiao, Chao Ma, Wei An</p>
<p>Abstract: Tracking multiple tiny objects is highly challenging due to their weak appearance and limited features. Existing multi-object tracking algorithms generally focus on single-modality scenes, and overlook the complementary characteristics of tiny objects captured by multiple remote sensors. To enhance tracking performance by integrating complementary information from multiple sources, we propose a novel framework called {HGT-Track (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer based Multi-Tiny-Object Tracking)}. Specifically, we first employ a Transformer-based encoder to embed images from different modalities. Subsequently, we utilize Heterogeneous Graph Transformer to aggregate spatial and temporal information from multiple modalities to generate detection and tracking features. Additionally, we introduce a target re-detection module (ReDet) to ensure tracklet continuity by maintaining consistency across different modalities. Furthermore, this paper introduces the first benchmark VT-Tiny-MOT (Visible-Thermal Tiny Multi-Object Tracking) for RGB-T fused multiple tiny object tracking. Extensive experiments are conducted on VT-Tiny-MOT, and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance in terms of MOTA (Multiple-Object Tracking Accuracy) and ID-F1 score.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lichen Bai, Shitong Shao, Zikai Zhou, Zipeng Qi, Zhiqiang Xu, Haoyi Xiong, Zeke Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models, the most popular generative paradigm so far, can inject conditional information into the generation path to guide the latent towards desired directions. However, existing text-to-image diffusion models often fail to maintain high image quality and high prompt-image alignment for those challenging prompts. To mitigate this issue and enhance existing pretrained diffusion models, we mainly made three contributions in this paper. First, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the conditional guidance gap between the denoising and inversion processes captures prompt-related semantic information. Second, motivated by theoretical analysis, we derive Zigzag Diffusion Sampling (Z-Sampling), a novel sampling method that leverages the guidance gap to accumulate semantic information step-by-step throughout the entire generation process, leading to improved sampling results. Moreover, as a plug-and-play method, Z-Sampling can be generally applied to various diffusion models (e.g., accelerated ones and Transformer-based ones) with very limited coding and computational costs. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate that Z-Sampling can generally and significantly enhance generation quality across various benchmark datasets, diffusion models, and performance evaluation metrics. For example, Z-Sampling can even make DreamShaper achieve the HPSv2 winning rate higher than 94% over the original results. Moreover, Z-Sampling can further enhance existing diffusion models combined with other orthogonal methods, including Diffusion-DPO.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective road crack detection is crucial for road safety, infrastructure preservation, and extending road lifespan, offering significant economic benefits. However, existing methods struggle with varied target scales, complex backgrounds, and low adaptability to different environments. This paper presents the BsS-YOLO model, which optimizes multi-scale feature fusion through an enhanced Path Aggregation Network (PAN) and Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN). The incorporation of weighted feature fusion improves feature representation, boosting detection accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, a Simple and Effective Attention Mechanism (SimAM) within the backbone enhances precision via spatial and channel-wise attention. The detection layer integrates a Shuffle Attention mechanism, which rearranges and mixes features across channels, refining key representations and further improving accuracy. Experimental results show that BsS-YOLO achieves a 2.8% increase in mean average precision (mAP) for road crack detection, supporting its applicability in diverse scenarios, including urban road maintenance and highway inspections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagi Eppel</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision language models (LVLM) are the leading A.I approach for achieving a general visual understanding of the world. Models such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and LLama can use images to understand and analyze complex visual scenes. 3D objects and shapes are the basic building blocks of the world, recognizing them is a fundamental part of human perception. The goal of this work is to test whether LVLMs truly understand 3D shapes by testing the models ability to identify and match objects of the exact same 3D shapes but with different orientations and materials/textures. Test images were created using CGI with a huge number of highly diverse objects, materials, and scenes. The results of this test show that the ability of such models to match 3D shapes is significantly below humans but much higher than random guesses. Suggesting that the models have gained some abstract understanding of 3D shapes but still trail far beyond humans in this task. Mainly it seems that the models can easily identify the same object with a different orientation as well as matching identical 3D shapes of the same orientation but with different material textures. However, when both the object material and orientation are changed, all models perform poorly relative to humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangjun Zhou, Yiping Li, Chunlin Zhong, Jianuo Huang, Jialun Pei, He Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Salient Object Detection (SOD) and Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) are two interrelated yet distinct tasks. Both tasks model the human visual system's ability to perceive the presence of objects. The traditional SOD datasets and methods are designed for scenes where only salient objects are present, similarly, COD datasets and methods are designed for scenes where only camouflaged objects are present. However, scenes where both salient and camouflaged objects coexist, or where neither is present, are not considered. This simplifies the existing research on SOD and COD. In this paper, to explore a more generalized approach to SOD and COD, we introduce a benchmark called Unconstrained Salient and Camouflaged Object Detection (USCOD), which supports the simultaneous detection of salient and camouflaged objects in unconstrained scenes, regardless of their presence. Towards this, we construct a large-scale dataset, CS12K, that encompasses a variety of scenes, including four distinct types: only salient objects, only camouflaged objects, both, and neither. In our benchmark experiments, we identify a major challenge in USCOD: distinguishing between salient and camouflaged objects within the same scene. To address this challenge, we propose USCNet, a baseline model for USCOD that decouples the learning of attribute distinction from mask reconstruction. The model incorporates an APG module, which learns both sample-generic and sample-specific features to enhance the attribute differentiation between salient and camouflaged objects. Furthermore, to evaluate models' ability to distinguish between salient and camouflaged objects, we design a metric called Camouflage-Saliency Confusion Score (CSCS). The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the newly introduced USCOD task. The code and dataset will be publicly available.</p>

Unfortunately, MS imaging datasets are often limited in size, spread across multiple hospital sites, and exhibit different formats (such as cross-sectional or longitudinal) and annotation styles. This data diversity presents a significant obstacle to developing a unified model for MS lesion segmentation. To address this issue, we introduce SegHeD+, a novel segmentation model that can handle multiple datasets and tasks, accommodating heterogeneous input data and performing segmentation for all lesions, new lesions, and vanishing lesions. We integrate domain knowledge about MS lesions by incorporating longitudinal, anatomical, and volumetric constraints into the segmentation model. Additionally, we perform lesion-level data augmentation to enlarge the training set and further improve segmentation performance. SegHeD+ is evaluated on five MS datasets and demonstrates superior performance in segmenting all, new, and vanishing lesions, surpassing several state-of-the-art methods in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Ze Wang, Xiang Li, Ximeng Sun, Fangyi Chen, Jiang Liu, Jindong Wang, Bhiksha Raj, Zicheng Liu, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient image tokenization with high compression ratios remains a critical challenge for training generative models. We present SoftVQ-VAE, a continuous image tokenizer that leverages soft categorical posteriors to aggregate multiple codewords into each latent token, substantially increasing the representation capacity of the latent space. When applied to Transformer-based architectures, our approach compresses 256x256 and 512x512 images using as few as 32 or 64 1-dimensional tokens. Not only does SoftVQ-VAE show consistent and high-quality reconstruction, more importantly, it also achieves state-of-the-art and significantly faster image generation results across different denoising-based generative models. Remarkably, SoftVQ-VAE improves inference throughput by up to 18x for generating 256x256 images and 55x for 512x512 images while achieving competitive FID scores of 1.78 and 2.21 for SiT-XL. It also improves the training efficiency of the generative models by reducing the number of training iterations by 2.3x while maintaining comparable performance. With its fully-differentiable design and semantic-rich latent space, our experiment demonstrates that SoftVQ-VQE achieves efficient tokenization without compromising generation quality, paving the way for more efficient generative models. Code and model are released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Wiedmann, Luca Wiehe, David Rozenberszki</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-set 3D segmentation represents a major point of interest for multiple downstream robotics and augmented/virtual reality applications. Recent advances introduce 3D Gaussian Splatting as a computationally efficient representation of the underlying scene. They enable the rendering of novel views while achieving real-time display rates and matching the quality of computationally far more expensive methods. We present a decoupled 3D segmentation pipeline to ensure modularity and adaptability to novel 3D representations and semantic segmentation foundation models. The pipeline proposes class-agnostic masks based on a 3D reconstruction of the scene. Given the resulting class-agnostic masks, we use a class-aware 2D foundation model to add class annotations to the 3D masks. We test this pipeline with 3D Gaussian Splatting and different 2D segmentation models and achieve better performance than more tailored approaches while also significantly increasing the modularity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Munir, Md Mostafijur Rahman, Radu Marculescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have dominated computer vision in recent years. However, ViTs are computationally expensive and not well suited for mobile devices; this led to the prevalence of convolutional neural network (CNN) and ViT-based hybrid models for mobile vision applications. Recently, Vision GNN (ViG) and CNN hybrid models have also been proposed for mobile vision tasks. However, all of these methods remain slower compared to pure CNN-based models. In this work, we propose Multi-Level Dilated Convolutions to devise a purely CNN-based mobile backbone. Using Multi-Level Dilated Convolutions allows for a larger theoretical receptive field than standard convolutions. Different levels of dilation also allow for interactions between the short-range and long-range features in an image. Experiments show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mobile CNN, ViT, ViG, and hybrid architectures in terms of accuracy and/or speed on image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Our fastest model, RapidNet-Ti, achieves 76.3\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 0.9 ms inference latency on an iPhone 13 mini NPU, which is faster and more accurate than MobileNetV2x1.4 (74.7\% top-1 with 1.0 ms latency). Our work shows that pure CNN architectures can beat SOTA hybrid and ViT models in terms of accuracy and speed when designed properly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangwei Hao, Ji Du, Weiyun Liang, Jing Xu, Xiaoxuan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image restoration (IR) is a long-standing task to recover a high-quality image from its corrupted observation. Recently, transformer-based algorithms and some attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented promising results on several IR tasks. However, existing convolutional residual building modules for IR encounter limited ability to map inputs into high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, and their local receptive fields have difficulty in capturing long-range context information like Transformer. Besides, CNN-based attention modules for IR either face static abundant parameters or have limited receptive fields. To address the first issue, we propose an efficient residual star module (ERSM) that includes context-aware "star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to contextually map features into exceedingly high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, which greatly enhances representation learning. To further boost the extraction of contextual information, as for the second issue, we propose a large dynamic integration module (LDIM) which possesses an extremely large receptive field. Thus, LDIM can dynamically and efficiently integrate more contextual information that helps to further significantly improve the reconstruction performance. Integrating ERSM and LDIM into an U-shaped backbone, we propose a context-aware convolutional network (CCNet) with powerful learning ability for contextual high-dimensional mapping and abundant contextual information. Extensive experiments show that our CCNet with low model complexity achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods on several IR tasks, including image dehazing, image motion deblurring, and image desnowing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Kang, Xin Chen, Simiao Lai, Yang Liu, Yi Liu, Dong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contextual information at the video level has become increasingly crucial for visual object tracking. However, existing methods typically use only a few tokens to convey this information, which can lead to information loss and limit their ability to fully capture the context. To address this issue, we propose a new video-level visual object tracking framework called MCITrack. It leverages Mamba's hidden states to continuously record and transmit extensive contextual information throughout the video stream, resulting in more robust object tracking. The core component of MCITrack is the Contextual Information Fusion module, which consists of the mamba layer and the cross-attention layer. The mamba layer stores historical contextual information, while the cross-attention layer integrates this information into the current visual features of each backbone block. This module enhances the model's ability to capture and utilize contextual information at multiple levels through deep integration with the backbone. Experiments demonstrate that MCITrack achieves competitive performance across numerous benchmarks. For instance, it gets 76.6% AUC on LaSOT and 80.0% AO on GOT-10k, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Code and models are available at https://github.com/kangben258/MCITrack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhang, Zhuoling Li, Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic scenes contain intricate spatio-temporal information, crucial for mobile robots, UAVs, and autonomous driving systems to make informed decisions. Parsing these scenes into semantic triplets <Subject-Predicate-Object> for accurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the fluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creating realistic VR experiences is challenging due to the labor-intensive process of accurately replicating real-world details into virtual scenes, highlighting the need for automated methods that maintain spatial accuracy and provide design flexibility. In this paper, we propose AURORA, a novel method that leverages RGB-D images to automatically generate both purely virtual reality (VR) scenes and VR scenes combined with real-world elements.

The design of this integration ensures optimal performance and precision, addressing key challenges in automated indoor design generation by uniquely combining and leveraging the strengths of foundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments, both on self-captured data and public datasets, showcasing its potential to enhance virtual reality (VR) applications by providing interior designs that conform to real-world positioning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Orthognathic surgery consultation is essential to help patients understand the changes to their facial appearance after surgery. However, current visualization methods are often inefficient and inaccurate due to limited pre- and post-treatment data and the complexity of the treatment. To overcome these challenges, this study aims to develop a fully automated pipeline that generates accurate and efficient 3D previews of postsurgical facial appearances for patients with orthognathic treatment without requiring additional medical images. The study introduces novel aesthetic losses, such as mouth-convexity and asymmetry losses, to improve the accuracy of facial surgery prediction. Additionally, it proposes a specialized parametric model for 3D reconstruction of the patient, medical-related losses to guide latent code prediction network optimization, and a data augmentation scheme to address insufficient data. The study additionally employs FLAME, a parametric model, to enhance the quality of facial appearance previews by extracting facial latent codes and establishing dense correspondences between pre- and post-surgery geometries. Quantitative comparisons showed the algorithm's effectiveness, and qualitative results highlighted accurate facial contour and detail predictions. A user study confirmed that doctors and the public could not distinguish between machine learning predictions and actual postoperative results. This study aims to offer a practical, effective solution for orthognathic surgery consultations, benefiting doctors and patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Wang, Quanfeng Liu, Jiaqi Fan, Jinlong Hong, Hongqing Chu, Mengjian Tian, Bingzhao Gao, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and addressing corner cases is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, we propose RAC3, a novel framework designed to improve VLMs' ability to handle corner cases effectively. The framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to mitigate hallucination by dynamically incorporating context-specific external knowledge. A cornerstone of RAC3 is its cross-modal alignment fine-tuning, which utilizes contrastive learning to embed image-text pairs into a unified semantic space, enabling robust retrieval of similar scenarios. We evaluate RAC3 through extensive experiments using a curated dataset of corner case scenarios, demonstrating its ability to enhance semantic alignment, improve hallucination mitigation, and achieve superior performance metrics, such as Cosine Similarity and ROUGE-L scores. For example, for the LLaVA-v1.6-34B VLM, the cosine similarity between the generated text and the reference text has increased by 5.22\%. The F1-score in ROUGE-L has increased by 39.91\%, the Precision has increased by 55.80\%, and the Recall has increased by 13.74\%. This work underscores the potential of retrieval-augmented VLMs to advance the robustness and safety of autonomous driving in complex environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the key goals of artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of a multimodal system that facilitates communication with the visual world (image and video) using a natural language query. Earlier works on medical question answering primarily focused on textual and visual (image) modalities, which may be inefficient in answering questions requiring demonstration. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved due to the introduction of large-scale language-vision datasets and the development of efficient deep neural techniques that bridge the gap between language and visual understanding. Improvements have been made in numerous vision-and-language tasks, such as visual captioning visual question answering, and natural language video localization. Most of the existing work on language vision focused on creating datasets and developing solutions for open-domain applications. We believe medical videos may provide the best possible answers to many first aid, medical emergency, and medical education questions. With increasing interest in AI to support clinical decision-making and improve patient engagement, there is a need to explore such challenges and develop efficient algorithms for medical language-video understanding and generation. Toward this, we introduced new tasks to foster research toward designing systems that can understand medical videos to provide visual answers to natural language questions, and are equipped with multimodal capability to generate instruction steps from the medical video. These tasks have the potential to support the development of sophisticated downstream applications that can benefit the public and medical professionals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyang Sun, Shengwu Xiong, Yaxiong Chen, Fei Du, Weihua Chen, Fan Wang, Yi Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the challenging task of makeup transfer, which aims to apply diverse makeup styles precisely and naturally to a given facial image. Due to the absence of paired data, current methods typically synthesize sub-optimal pseudo ground truths to guide the model training, resulting in low makeup fidelity. Additionally, different makeup styles generally have varying effects on the person face, but existing methods struggle to deal with this diversity. To address these issues, we propose a novel Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer (SHMT) method via latent diffusion models. Following a "decoupling-and-reconstruction" paradigm, SHMT works in a self-supervised manner, freeing itself from the misguidance of imprecise pseudo-paired data. Furthermore, to accommodate a variety of makeup styles, hierarchical texture details are decomposed via a Laplacian pyramid and selectively introduced to the content representation. Finally, we design a novel Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module that dynamically adjusts the injection condition of the diffusion model, allowing the alignment errors caused by the domain gap between content and makeup representations to be corrected. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/Snowfallingplum/SHMT}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhanu Tokas, Rahul Nair, Hannah Kerner</p>
<p>Abstract: Most of the ML datasets we use today are biased. When we train models on these biased datasets, they often not only learn dataset biases but can also amplify them -- a phenomenon known as bias amplification. Several co-occurrence-based metrics have been proposed to measure bias amplification between a protected attribute A (e.g., gender) and a task T (e.g., cooking). However, these metrics fail to measure biases when A is balanced with T. To measure bias amplification in balanced datasets, recent work proposed a predictability-based metric called leakage amplification. However, leakage amplification cannot identify the direction in which biases are amplified. In this work, we propose a new predictability-based metric called directional predictability amplification (DPA). DPA measures directional bias amplification, even for balanced datasets. Unlike leakage amplification, DPA is easier to interpret and less sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in predictability-based metrics). Our experiments on tabular and image datasets show that DPA is an effective metric for measuring directional bias amplification. The code will be available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Nair, Gabriel Tseng, Esther Rolf, Bhanu Tokas, Hannah Kerner</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies showed that image datasets lacking geographic diversity can lead to biased performance in models trained on them. While earlier work studied general-purpose image datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and simple tasks like image recognition, we investigated geo-biases in real-world driving datasets on a more complex task: instance segmentation. We examined if instance segmentation models trained on European driving scenes (Eurocentric models) are geo-biased. Consistent with previous work, we found that Eurocentric models were geo-biased. Interestingly, we found that geo-biases came from classification errors rather than localization errors, with classification errors alone contributing 10-90% of the geo-biases in segmentation and 19-88% of the geo-biases in detection. This showed that while classification is geo-biased, localization (including detection and segmentation) is geographically robust. Our findings show that in region-specific models (e.g., Eurocentric models), geo-biases from classification errors can be significantly mitigated by using coarser classes (e.g., grouping car, bus, and truck as 4-wheeler).</p>

<p>Abstract: Human video synthesis aims to create lifelike characters in various environments, with wide applications in VR, storytelling, and content creation. While 2D diffusion-based methods have made significant progress, they struggle to generalize to complex 3D poses and varying scene backgrounds. To address these limitations, we introduce CFSynthesis, a novel framework for generating high-quality human videos with customizable attributes, including identity, motion, and scene configurations. Our method leverages a texture-SMPL-based representation to ensure consistent and stable character appearances across free viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a novel foreground-background separation strategy that effectively decomposes the scene as foreground and background, enabling seamless integration of user-defined backgrounds. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that CFSynthesis not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in complex human animations but also adapts effectively to 3D motions in free-view and user-specified scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengfei Liu, Jiapu Wang, Yongli Hu, Mingjie Li, Junfei Yi, Xiaojun Chang, Junbin Gao, Baocai Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) models typically focus on individual exams, often overlooking the integration of historical visual or textual data, which is crucial for patient follow-ups. Traditional methods usually struggle with long sequence dependencies when incorporating historical information, but large language models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, making them well-suited for analyzing longitudinal medical data. In light of this, we propose a novel Historical-Constrained Large Language Models (HC-LLM) framework for RRG, empowering LLMs with longitudinal report generation capabilities by constraining the consistency and differences between longitudinal images and their corresponding reports. Specifically, our approach extracts both time-shared and time-specific features from longitudinal chest X-rays and diagnostic reports to capture disease progression. Then, we ensure consistent representation by applying intra-modality similarity constraints and aligning various features across modalities with multimodal contrastive and structural constraints. These combined constraints effectively guide the LLMs in generating diagnostic reports that accurately reflect the progression of the disease, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Longitudinal-MIMIC dataset. Notably, our approach performs well even without historical data during testing and can be easily adapted to other multimodal large models, enhancing its versatility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables models to adapt to evolving data streams. A major challenge of CL is catastrophic forgetting, where new knowledge will overwrite previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods usually retain the past data for replay or add additional branches in the model to learn new knowledge, which has high memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight CL framework, Adapter-Enhanced Semantic Prompting (AESP), which integrates prompt tuning and adapter techniques. Specifically, we design semantic-guided prompts to enhance the generalization ability of visual features and utilize adapters to efficiently fuse the semantic information, aiming to learn more adaptive features for the continual learning task. Furthermore, to choose the right task prompt for feature adaptation, we have developed a novel matching mechanism for prompt selection. Extensive experiments on three CL datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves favorable performance across multiple metrics, showing its potential for advancing CL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Yang, Yucong Meng, Kexue Fu, Shuo Wang, Zhijian Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels typically uses Class Activation Maps (CAM) to achieve dense predictions. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has provided an alternative to generate localization maps from class-patch attention. However, due to insufficient constraints on modeling such attention, we observe that the Localization Attention Maps (LAM) often struggle with the artifact issue, i.e., patch regions with minimal semantic relevance are falsely activated by class tokens. In this work, we propose MoRe to address this issue and further explore the potential of LAM. Our findings suggest that imposing additional regularization on class-patch attention is necessary. To this end, we first view the attention as a novel directed graph and propose the Graph Category Representation module to implicitly regularize the interaction among class-patch entities. It ensures that class tokens dynamically condense the related patch information and suppress unrelated artifacts at a graph level. Second, motivated by the observation that CAM from classification weights maintains smooth localization of objects, we devise the Localization-informed Regularization module to explicitly regularize the class-patch attention. It directly mines the token relations from CAM and further supervises the consistency between class and patch tokens in a learnable manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, validating that MoRe effectively addresses the artifact issue and achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent single-stage and even multi-stage methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanmin Tang, Xiaoting Qin, Jue Zhang, Jing Yu, Gaopeng Gou, Gang Xiong, Qingwei Ling, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that closely resemble a reference image while integrating user-specified textual modifications, thereby capturing user intent more precisely. Existing training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods often employ a two-stage process: they first generate a caption for the reference image and then use Large Language Models for reasoning to obtain a target description. However, these methods suffer from missing critical visual details and limited reasoning capabilities, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, training-free one-stage method, One-Stage Reflective Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for ZS-CIR (OSrCIR), which employs Multimodal Large Language Models to retain essential visual information in a single-stage reasoning process, eliminating the information loss seen in two-stage methods. Our Reflective Chain-of-Thought framework further improves interpretative accuracy by aligning manipulation intent with contextual cues from reference images. OSrCIR achieves performance gains of 1.80% to 6.44% over existing training-free methods across multiple tasks, setting new state-of-the-art results in ZS-CIR and enhancing its utility in vision-language applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinxiu Liu, Shaoheng Lin, Yinxiao Li, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing demand for immersive AR/VR applications and spatial intelligence has heightened the need to generate high-quality scene-level and 360{\deg} panoramic video. However, most video diffusion models are constrained by limited resolution and aspect ratio, which restricts their applicability to scene-level dynamic content synthesis. In this work, we propose the DynamicScaler, addressing these challenges by enabling spatially scalable and panoramic dynamic scene synthesis that preserves coherence across panoramic scenes of arbitrary size. Specifically, we introduce a Offset Shifting Denoiser, facilitating efficient, synchronous, and coherent denoising panoramic dynamic scenes via a diffusion model with fixed resolution through a seamless rotating Window, which ensures seamless boundary transitions and consistency across the entire panoramic space, accommodating varying resolutions and aspect ratios. Additionally, we employ a Global Motion Guidance mechanism to ensure both local detail fidelity and global motion continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior content and motion quality in panoramic scene-level video generation, offering a training-free, efficient, and scalable solution for immersive dynamic scene creation with constant VRAM consumption regardless of the output video resolution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Xing, Juncheng Hu, Guotao Liang, Jing Zhang, Dong Xu, Qian Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The unprecedented advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have profoundly impacted natural language processing but have yet to fully embrace the realm of scalable vector graphics (SVG) generation. While LLMs encode partial knowledge of SVG data from web pages during training, recent findings suggest that semantically ambiguous and tokenized representations within LLMs may result in hallucinations in vector primitive predictions. Additionally, LLM training typically lacks modeling and understanding of the rendering sequence of vector paths, which can lead to occlusion between output vector primitives. In this paper, we present LLM4SVG, an initial yet substantial step toward bridging this gap by enabling LLMs to better understand and generate vector graphics. LLM4SVG facilitates a deeper understanding of SVG components through learnable semantic tokens, which precisely encode these tokens and their corresponding properties to generate semantically aligned SVG outputs. Using a series of learnable semantic tokens, a structured dataset for instruction following is developed to support comprehension and generation across two primary tasks. Our method introduces a modular architecture to existing large language models, integrating semantic tags, vector instruction encoders, fine-tuned commands, and powerful LLMs to tightly combine geometric, appearance, and language information. To overcome the scarcity of SVG-text instruction data, we developed an automated data generation pipeline that collected a massive dataset of more than 250k SVG data and 580k SVG-text instructions, which facilitated the adoption of the two-stage training strategy popular in LLM development. By exploring various training strategies, we developed LLM4SVG, which significantly moves beyond optimized rendering-based approaches and language-model-based baselines to achieve remarkable results in human evaluation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengqiong Wu, Hao Fei, Liangming Pan, William Yang Wang, Shuicheng Yan, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown unprecedented capabilities in advancing various vision-language tasks. However, MLLMs face significant challenges with hallucinations, and misleading outputs that do not align with the input data. While existing efforts are paid to combat MLLM hallucinations, several pivotal challenges are still unsolved. First, while current approaches aggressively focus on addressing errors at the perception level, another important type at the cognition level requiring factual commonsense can be overlooked. In addition, existing methods might fall short in finding a more effective way to represent visual input, which is yet a key bottleneck that triggers visual hallucinations. Moreover, MLLMs can frequently be misled by faulty textual inputs and cause hallucinations, while unfortunately, this type of issue has long been overlooked by existing studies. Inspired by human intuition in handling hallucinations, this paper introduces a novel bottom-up reasoning framework. Our framework systematically addresses potential issues in both visual and textual inputs by verifying and integrating perception-level information with cognition-level commonsense knowledge, ensuring more reliable outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in multiple hallucination benchmarks after integrating MLLMs with the proposed framework. In-depth analyses reveal the great potential of our methods in addressing perception- and cognition-level hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Salehi, Nikolaos Apostolikas, Efstratios Gavves, Cees G. M. Snoek, Yuki M. Asano</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of novelty detection, accurately identifying outliers in data without specific class information poses a significant challenge. While current methods excel in single-object scenarios, they struggle with multi-object situations due to their focus on individual objects. Our paper suggests a novel approach: redefining `normal' at the object level in training datasets. Rather than the usual image-level view, we consider the most dominant object in a dataset as the norm, offering a perspective that is more effective for real-world scenarios. Adapting to our object-level definition of `normal', we modify knowledge distillation frameworks, where a student network learns from a pre-trained teacher network. Our first contribution, DeFeND(Dense Feature Fine-tuning on Normal Data), integrates dense feature fine-tuning into the distillation process, allowing the teacher network to focus on object-level features with a self-supervised loss. The second is masked knowledge distillation, where the student network works with partially hidden inputs, honing its ability to deduce and generalize from incomplete data. This approach not only fares well in single-object novelty detection but also considerably surpasses existing methods in multi-object contexts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanglei Zhou, Ruizhi Cai, Liyuan Wang, Hubert P. H. Shum, Xiaohui Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantitatively evaluates the quality of human actions, providing automated assessments that reduce biases in human judgment. Its applications span domains such as sports analysis, skill assessment, and medical care. Recent advances in AQA have introduced innovative methodologies, but similar methods often intertwine across different domains, highlighting the fragmented nature that hinders systematic reviews. In addition, the lack of a unified benchmark and limited computational comparisons hinder consistent evaluation and fair assessment of AQA approaches. In this work, we address these gaps by systematically analyzing over 150 AQA-related papers to develop a hierarchical taxonomy, construct a unified benchmark, and provide an in-depth analysis of current trends, challenges, and future directions. Our hierarchical taxonomy categorizes AQA methods based on input modalities (video, skeleton, multi-modal) and their specific characteristics, highlighting the evolution and interrelations across various approaches. To promote standardization, we present a unified benchmark, integrating diverse datasets to evaluate the assessment precision and computational efficiency. Finally, we review emerging task-specific applications and identify under-explored challenges in AQA, providing actionable insights into future research directions. This survey aims to deepen understanding of AQA progress, facilitate method comparison, and guide future innovations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiancheng Huang, Yi Huang, Jianzhuang Liu, Donghao Zhou, Yifan Liu, Shifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-conditional image editing is a practical AIGC task that has recently emerged with great commercial and academic value. For real image editing, most diffusion model-based methods use DDIM Inversion as the first stage before editing. However, DDIM Inversion often results in reconstruction failure, leading to unsatisfactory performance for downstream editing. To address this problem, we first analyze why the reconstruction via DDIM Inversion fails. We then propose a new inversion and sampling method named Dual-Schedule Inversion. We also design a classifier to adaptively combine Dual-Schedule Inversion with different editing methods for user-friendly image editing. Our work can achieve superior reconstruction and editing performance with the following advantages: 1) It can reconstruct real images perfectly without fine-tuning, and its reversibility is guaranteed mathematically. 2) The edited object/scene conforms to the semantics of the text prompt. 3) The unedited parts of the object/scene retain the original identity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuang Yu, Jinmiao Zhao, Yunpeng Liu, Sicheng Zhao, Xiangyu Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection with single point supervision has drawn wide-spread attention. However, the latest label evolution with single point supervision (LESPS) framework suffers from instability, excessive label evolution, and difficulty in exerting embedded network performance. Therefore, we construct a Progressive Active Learning (PAL) framework. Specifically, inspired by organisms gradually adapting to their environment and continuously accumulating knowledge, we propose an innovative progressive active learning idea, which emphasizes that the network progressively and actively recognizes and learns more hard samples to achieve continuous performance enhancement. Based on this, on the one hand, we propose a model pre-start concept, which focuses on selecting a portion of easy samples and can help models have basic task-specific learning capabilities. On the other hand, we propose a refined dual-update strategy, which can promote reasonable learning of harder samples and continuous refinement of pseudo-labels. In addition, to alleviate the risk of excessive label evolution, a decay factor is reasonably introduced, which helps to achieve a dynamic balance between the expansion and contraction of target annotations. Extensive experiments show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) equipped with our PAL framework have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple public datasets. Furthermore, our PAL framework can build a efficient and stable bridge between full supervision and point supervision tasks. Our code are available at https://github.com/YuChuang1205/PAL.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11161">Why and How: Knowledge-Guided Learning for Cross-Spectral Image Patch Matching</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuang Yu, Yunpeng Liu, Jinmiao Zhao, Xiangyu Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, cross-spectral image patch matching based on feature relation learning has attracted extensive attention. However, performance bottleneck problems have gradually emerged in existing methods. To address this challenge, we make the first attempt to explore a stable and efficient bridge between descriptor learning and metric learning, and construct a knowledge-guided learning network (KGL-Net), which achieves amazing performance improvements while abandoning complex network structures. Specifically, we find that there is feature extraction consistency between metric learning based on feature difference learning and descriptor learning based on Euclidean distance. This provides the foundation for bridge building. To ensure the stability and efficiency of the constructed bridge, on the one hand, we conduct an in-depth exploration of 20 combined network architectures. On the other hand, a feature-guided loss is constructed to achieve mutual guidance of features. In addition, unlike existing methods, we consider that the feature mapping ability of the metric branch should receive more attention. Therefore, a hard negative sample mining for metric learning (HNSM-M) strategy is constructed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that hard negative sample mining for metric networks has been implemented and brings significant performance gains. Extensive experimental results show that our KGL-Net achieves SOTA performance in three different cross-spectral image patch matching scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangming Wang, Haijin Zeng, Jiaoyang Chen, Sheng Liu, Yongyong Chen, Guoqing Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world scenarios, complex data such as multispectral images and multi-frame videos inherently exhibit robust low-rank property. This property is vital for multi-dimensional inverse problems, such as tensor completion, spectral imaging reconstruction, and multispectral image denoising. Existing tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) definitions rely on hand-designed or pre-given transforms, which lack flexibility for defining tensor nuclear norm (TNN). The TNN-regularized optimization problem is solved by the singular value thresholding (SVT) operator, which leverages the t-SVD framework to obtain the low-rank tensor. However, it is quite complicated to introduce SVT into deep neural networks due to the numerical instability problem in solving the derivatives of the eigenvectors. In this paper, we introduce a novel data-driven generative low-rank t-SVD model based on the learnable orthogonal transform, which can be naturally solved under its representation. Prompted by the linear algebra theorem of the Householder transformation, our learnable orthogonal transform is achieved by constructing an endogenously orthogonal matrix adaptable to neural networks, optimizing it as arbitrary orthogonal matrices. Additionally, we propose a low-rank solver as a generalization of SVT, which utilizes an efficient representation of generative networks to obtain low-rank structures. Extensive experiments highlight its significant restoration enhancements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has achieved remarkable progress in recent years, yet evaluating these methods remains challenging for two reasons: i) Existing benchmarks lack fine-grained evaluation on different prompt categories and evaluation dimensions. ii) Previous evaluation metrics only focus on a single aspect (e.g., text-3D alignment) and fail to perform multi-dimensional quality assessment. To address these problems, we first propose a comprehensive benchmark named MATE-3D. The benchmark contains eight well-designed prompt categories that cover single and multiple object generation, resulting in 1,280 generated textured meshes. We have conducted a large-scale subjective experiment from four different evaluation dimensions and collected 107,520 annotations, followed by detailed analyses of the results. Based on MATE-3D, we propose a novel quality evaluator named HyperScore. Utilizing hypernetwork to generate specified mapping functions for each evaluation dimension, our metric can effectively perform multi-dimensional quality assessment. HyperScore presents superior performance over existing metrics on MATE-3D, making it a promising metric for assessing and improving text-to-3D generation.

<p>Abstract: Recent diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in both 3D scene generation and perception tasks. Nevertheless, existing methods typically separate these two processes, acting as a data augmenter to generate synthetic data for downstream perception tasks. In this work, we propose OccScene, a novel mutual learning paradigm that integrates fine-grained 3D perception and high-quality generation in a unified framework, achieving a cross-task win-win effect. OccScene generates new and consistent 3D realistic scenes only depending on text prompts, guided with semantic occupancy in a joint-training diffusion framework. To align the occupancy with the diffusion latent, a Mamba-based Dual Alignment module is introduced to incorporate fine-grained semantics and geometry as perception priors. Within OccScene, the perception module can be effectively improved with customized and diverse generated scenes, while the perception priors in return enhance the generation performance for mutual benefits. Extensive experiments show that OccScene achieves realistic 3D scene generation in broad indoor and outdoor scenarios, while concurrently boosting the perception models to achieve substantial performance improvements in the 3D perception task of semantic occupancy prediction.</p>

Our experimental results confirm that this approach considerably enhances processing speed over the baseline, while still achieving an acceptable accuracy level.

<p>Abstract: Despite the significant role text-to-motion (T2M) generation plays across various applications, current methods involve a large number of parameters and suffer from slow inference speeds, leading to high usage costs. To address this, we aim to design a lightweight model to reduce usage costs. First, unlike existing works that focus solely on global information modeling, we recognize the importance of local information modeling in the T2M task by reconsidering the intrinsic properties of human motion, leading us to propose a lightweight Local Information Modeling Module. Second, we introduce Mamba to the T2M task, reducing the number of parameters and GPU memory demands, and we have designed a novel Pseudo-bidirectional Scan to replicate the effects of a bidirectional scan without increasing parameter count. Moreover, we propose a novel Adaptive Textual Information Injector that more effectively integrates textual information into the motion during generation. By integrating the aforementioned designs, we propose a lightweight and fast model named Light-T2M. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, MoMask, our Light-T2M model features just 10\% of the parameters (4.48M vs 44.85M) and achieves a 16\% faster inference time (0.152s vs 0.180s), while surpassing MoMask with an FID of \textbf{0.040} (vs. 0.045) on HumanML3D dataset and 0.161 (vs. 0.228) on KIT-ML dataset.

In this paper, we propose ViPOcc, which leverages the visual priors from vision foundation models (VFMs) for fine-grained 3D occupancy prediction. Unlike previous works that solely employ volume rendering for RGB and depth image reconstruction, we introduce a metric depth estimation branch, in which an inverse depth alignment module is proposed to bridge the domain gap in depth distribution between VFM predictions and the ground truth. The recovered metric depth is then utilized in temporal photometric alignment and spatial geometric alignment to ensure accurate and consistent 3D occupancy prediction. Additionally, we also propose a semantic-guided non-overlapping Gaussian mixture sampler for efficient, instance-aware ray sampling, which addresses the redundant and imbalanced sampling issue that still exists in previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of ViPOcc in both 3D occupancy prediction and depth estimation tasks on the KITTI-360 and KITTI Raw datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijie Lou, Gang Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Pixel dependency modeling from tampered images is pivotal for image forgery localization. Current approaches predominantly rely on convolutional neural network (CNN) or Transformer-based models, which often either lack sufficient receptive fields or entail significant computational overheads. In this paper, we propose LoMa, a novel image forgery localization method that leverages the Selective State Space (S6) model for global pixel dependency modeling and inverted residual CNN for local pixel dependency modeling. Our method introduces the Mixed-SSM Block, which initially employs atrous selective scan to traverse the spatial domain and convert the tampered image into order patch sequences, and subsequently applies multidirectional S6 modeling. In addition, an auxiliary convolutional branch is introduced to enhance local feature extraction. This design facilitates the efficient extraction of global dependencies while upholding linear complexity. Upon modeling the pixel dependency with the SSM and CNN blocks, the pixel-wise forgery localization results are obtained by a simple MLP decoder. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of LoMa over CNN-based and Transformer-based state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin-Yu Liu, Xian-Ling Mao, Tian-Yi Che, Rong-Cheng Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal hashing methods have gained popularity due to their fast speed and low storage requirements. Among them, the supervised methods demonstrate better performance by utilizing labels as supervisory signals compared with unsupervised methods. Currently, for almost all supervised multi-modal hashing methods, there is a hidden assumption that training sets have no noisy labels. However, labels are often annotated incorrectly due to manual labeling in real-world scenarios, which will greatly harm the retrieval performance. To address this issue, we first discover a significant distribution consistency pattern through experiments, i.e., the 1-0 distribution of the presence or absence of each category in the label is consistent with the high-low distribution of similarity scores of the hash codes relative to category centers. Then, inspired by this pattern, we propose a novel Distribution-Consistency-Guided Multi-modal Hashing (DCGMH), which aims to filter and reconstruct noisy labels to enhance retrieval performance. Specifically, the proposed method first randomly initializes several category centers, which are used to compute the high-low distribution of similarity scores; Noisy and clean labels are then separately filtered out via the discovered distribution consistency pattern to mitigate the impact of noisy labels; Subsequently, a correction strategy, which is indirectly designed via the distribution consistency pattern, is applied to the filtered noisy labels, correcting high-confidence ones while treating low-confidence ones as unlabeled for unsupervised learning, thereby further enhancing the model's performance. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baselines in multi-modal retrieval tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shrisha Bharadwaj, Haiwen Feng, Victoria Abrevaya, Michael J. Black</p>
<p>Abstract: Manipulating the illumination within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has been traditionally addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which require explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be practical and possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on massive amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we explore the potential of exploiting video diffusion models, and in particular Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), in understanding the physical world to perform relighting tasks given a single image. Specifically, we introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate the results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset (270 objects) is able to generalize to real images, enabling single-image relighting with realistic ray tracing effects and cast shadows. These results reveal the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape. Our findings suggest that such models, with minimal training, can be used for physically-based rendering without explicit physically asset reconstruction and complex ray tracing. This further suggests the potential of such models for controllable and physically accurate image synthesis tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulin Wang, Haoji Zhang, Yang Yue, Shiji Song, Chao Deng, Junlan Feng, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the phenomenon of data redundancy in video understanding, with the aim to improve computational efficiency. Our investigation commences with an examination of spatial redundancy, which refers to the observation that the most informative region in each video frame usually corresponds to a small image patch, whose shape, size and location shift smoothly across frames. Motivated by this phenomenon, we formulate the patch localization problem as a dynamic decision task, and introduce a spatially adaptive video recognition approach, termed AdaFocus. In specific, a lightweight encoder is first employed to quickly process the full video sequence, whose features are then utilized by a policy network to identify the most task-relevant regions. Subsequently, the selected patches are inferred by a high-capacity deep network for the final prediction. The full model can be trained in end-to-end conveniently. Furthermore, AdaFocus can be extended by further considering temporal and sample-wise redundancies, i.e., allocating the majority of computation to the most task-relevant frames, and minimizing the computation spent on relatively "easier" videos. Our resulting approach, Uni-AdaFocus, establishes a comprehensive framework that seamlessly integrates spatial, temporal, and sample-wise dynamic computation, while it preserves the merits of AdaFocus in terms of efficient end-to-end training and hardware friendliness. In addition, Uni-AdaFocus is general and flexible as it is compatible with off-the-shelf efficient backbones (e.g., TSM and X3D), which can be readily deployed as our feature extractor, yielding a significantly improved computational efficiency. Empirically, extensive experiments based on seven benchmark datasets and three application scenarios substantiate that Uni-AdaFocus is considerably more efficient than the competitive baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11237">On the Generalizability of Iterative Patch Selection for Memory-Efficient High-Resolution Image Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Riffi-Aslett, Christina Fell</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifying large images with small or tiny regions of interest (ROI) is challenging due to computational and memory constraints. Weakly supervised memory-efficient patch selectors have achieved results comparable with strongly supervised methods. However, low signal-to-noise ratios and low entropy attention still cause overfitting. We explore these issues using a novel testbed on a memory-efficient cross-attention transformer with Iterative Patch Selection (IPS) as the patch selection module. Our testbed extends the megapixel MNIST benchmark to four smaller O2I (object-to-image) ratios ranging from 0.01% to 0.14% while keeping the canvas size fixed and introducing a noise generation component based on B\'ezier curves. Experimental results generalize the observations made on CNNs to IPS whereby the O2I threshold below which the classifier fails to generalize is affected by the training dataset size. We further observe that the magnitude of this interaction differs for each task of the Megapixel MNIST. For tasks "Maj" and "Top", the rate is at its highest, followed by tasks "Max" and "Multi" where in the latter, this rate is almost at 0. Moreover, results show that in a low data setting, tuning the patch size to be smaller relative to the ROI improves generalization, resulting in an improvement of + 15% for the megapixel MNIST and + 5% for the Swedish traffic signs dataset compared to the original object-to-patch ratios in IPS. Further outcomes indicate that the similarity between the thickness of the noise component and the digits in the megapixel MNIST gradually causes IPS to fail to generalize, contributing to previous suspicions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11248">Multimodal Class-aware Semantic Enhancement Network for Audio-Visual Video Parsing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Zhao, Jinxing Zhou, Dan Guo, Yang Zhao, Yanxiang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The Audio-Visual Video Parsing task aims to recognize and temporally localize all events occurring in either the audio or visual stream, or both. Capturing accurate event semantics for each audio/visual segment is vital. Prior works directly utilize the extracted holistic audio and visual features for intra- and cross-modal temporal interactions. However, each segment may contain multiple events, resulting in semantically mixed holistic features that can lead to semantic interference during intra- or cross-modal interactions: the event semantics of one segment may incorporate semantics of unrelated events from other segments. To address this issue, our method begins with a Class-Aware Feature Decoupling (CAFD) module, which explicitly decouples the semantically mixed features into distinct class-wise features, including multiple event-specific features and a dedicated background feature. The decoupled class-wise features enable our model to selectively aggregate useful semantics for each segment from clearly matched classes contained in other segments, preventing semantic interference from irrelevant classes. Specifically, we further design a Fine-Grained Semantic Enhancement module for encoding intra- and cross-modal relations. It comprises a Segment-wise Event Co-occurrence Modeling (SECM) block and a Local-Global Semantic Fusion (LGSF) block. The SECM exploits inter-class dependencies of concurrent events within the same timestamp with the aid of a new event co-occurrence loss. The LGSF further enhances the event semantics of each segment by incorporating relevant semantics from more informative global video features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and loss functions, resulting in a new state-of-the-art parsing performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Shao, Shulun Wang, Yang Zhou, Guanglu Song, Dailan He, Shuo Qin, Zhuofan Zong, Bingqi Ma, Yu Liu, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Video face swapping is becoming increasingly popular across various applications, yet existing methods primarily focus on static images and struggle with video face swapping because of temporal consistency and complex scenarios. In this paper, we present the first diffusion-based framework specifically designed for video face swapping. Our approach introduces a novel image-video hybrid training framework that leverages both abundant static image data and temporal video sequences, addressing the inherent limitations of video-only training. The framework incorporates a specially designed diffusion model coupled with a VidFaceVAE that effectively processes both types of data to better maintain temporal coherence of the generated videos. To further disentangle identity and pose features, we construct the Attribute-Identity Disentanglement Triplet (AIDT) Dataset, where each triplet has three face images, with two images sharing the same pose and two sharing the same identity. Enhanced with a comprehensive occlusion augmentation, this dataset also improves robustness against occlusions. Additionally, we integrate 3D reconstruction techniques as input conditioning to our network for handling large pose variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance in identity preservation, temporal consistency, and visual quality compared to existing methods, while requiring fewer inference steps. Our approach effectively mitigates key challenges in video face swapping, including temporal flickering, identity preservation, and robustness to occlusions and pose variations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11284">Learning Normal Flow Directly From Event Neighborhoods</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dehao Yuan, Levi Burner, Jiayi Wu, Minghui Liu, Jingxi Chen, Yiannis Aloimonos, Cornelia Ferm\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based motion field estimation is an important task. However, current optical flow methods face challenges: learning-based approaches, often frame-based and relying on CNNs, lack cross-domain transferability, while model-based methods, though more robust, are less accurate. To address the limitations of optical flow estimation, recent works have focused on normal flow, which can be more reliably measured in regions with limited texture or strong edges. However, existing normal flow estimators are predominantly model-based and suffer from high errors.
  In this paper, we propose a novel supervised point-based method for normal flow estimation that overcomes the limitations of existing event learning-based approaches. Using a local point cloud encoder, our method directly estimates per-event normal flow from raw events, offering multiple unique advantages: 1) It produces temporally and spatially sharp predictions. 2) It supports more diverse data augmentation, such as random rotation, to improve robustness across various domains. 3) It naturally supports uncertainty quantification via ensemble inference, which benefits downstream tasks. 4) It enables training and inference on undistorted data in normalized camera coordinates, improving transferability across cameras. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves better and more consistent performance than state-of-the-art methods when transferred across different datasets. Leveraging this transferability, we train our model on the union of datasets and release it for public use. Finally, we introduce an egomotion solver based on a maximum-margin problem that uses normal flow and IMU to achieve strong performance in challenging scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dafna Schwartz, Lori Quinn, Nora E. Fritz, Lisa M. Muratori, Jeffery M. Hausdorff, Ran Gilad Bachrach</p>
<p>Abstract: Wearable sensors offer a non-invasive way to collect physical activity (PA) data, with walking as a key component. Existing models often struggle to detect gait bouts in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) involving involuntary movements. We developed J-Net, a deep learning model inspired by U-Net, which uses a pre-trained self-supervised foundation model fine-tuned with Huntington`s disease (HD) in-lab data and paired with a segmentation head for gait detection. J-Net processes wrist-worn accelerometer data to detect gait during daily living. We evaluated J-Net on in-lab and daily-living data from HD, Parkinson`s disease (PD), and controls. J-Net achieved a 10-percentage point improvement in ROC-AUC for HD over existing methods, reaching 0.97 for in-lab data. In daily-living environments, J-Net estimates showed no significant differences in median daily walking time between HD and controls (p = 0.23), in contrast to other models, which indicated counterintuitive results (p < 0.005). Walking time measured by J-Net correlated with the UHDRS-TMS clinical severity score (r=-0.52; p=0.02), confirming its clinical relevance. Fine-tuning J-Net on PD data also improved gait detection over current methods. J-Net`s architecture effectively addresses the challenges of gait detection in severe chorea and offers robust performance in daily living. The dataset and J-Net model are publicly available, providing a resource for further research into NDD-related gait impairments.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we explored the potential of utilizing Facial Expression Activations (FEAs) captured via the Meta Quest Pro Virtual Reality (VR) headset for Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in VR settings. Leveraging the EmojiHeroVR Database (EmoHeVRDB), we compared several unimodal approaches and achieved up to 73.02% accuracy for the static FER task with seven emotion categories. Furthermore, we integrated FEA and image data in multimodal approaches, observing significant improvements in recognition accuracy. An intermediate fusion approach achieved the highest accuracy of 80.42%, significantly surpassing the baseline evaluation result of 69.84% reported for EmoHeVRDB's image data. Our study is the first to utilize EmoHeVRDB's unique FEA data for unimodal and multimodal static FER, establishing new benchmarks for FER in VR settings. Our findings highlight the potential of fusing complementary modalities to enhance FER accuracy in VR settings, where conventional image-based methods are severely limited by the occlusion caused by Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs).</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Human Mesh Reconstruction (HMR) from 2D RGB images faces challenges in environments with poor lighting, privacy concerns, or occlusions. These weaknesses of RGB imaging can be complemented by acoustic signals, which are widely available, easy to deploy, and capable of penetrating obstacles. However, no existing methods effectively combine acoustic signals with RGB data for robust 3D HMR. The primary challenges include the low-resolution images generated by acoustic signals and the lack of dedicated processing backbones. We introduce SonicMesh, a novel approach combining acoustic signals with RGB images to reconstruct 3D human mesh. To address the challenges of low resolution and the absence of dedicated processing backbones in images generated by acoustic signals, we modify an existing method, HRNet, for effective feature extraction. We also integrate a universal feature embedding technique to enhance the precision of cross-dimensional feature alignment, enabling SonicMesh to achieve high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SonicMesh accurately reconstructs 3D human mesh in challenging environments such as occlusions, non-line-of-sight scenarios, and poor lighting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing Video Frame interpolation (VFI) models tend to suffer from time-to-location ambiguity when trained with video of non-uniform motions, such as accelerating, decelerating, and changing directions, which often yield blurred interpolated frames. In this paper, we propose (i) a novel motion description map, Bidirectional Motion field (BiM), to effectively describe non-uniform motions; (ii) a BiM-guided Flow Net (BiMFN) with Content-Aware Upsampling Network (CAUN) for precise optical flow estimation; and (iii) Knowledge Distillation for VFI-centric Flow supervision (KDVCF) to supervise the motion estimation of VFI model with VFI-centric teacher flows. The proposed VFI is called a Bidirectional Motion field-guided VFI (BiM-VFI) model.

<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has been widely used in vision tasks. Notably, CLIP has demonstrated promising performance in few-shot learning (FSL). However, existing CLIP-based methods in training-free FSL (i.e., without the requirement of additional training) mainly learn different modalities independently, leading to two essential issues: 1) severe anomalous match in image modality; 2) varying quality of generated text prompts. To address these issues, we build a mutual guidance mechanism, that introduces an Image-Guided-Text (IGT) component to rectify varying quality of text prompts through image representations, and a Text-Guided-Image (TGI) component to mitigate the anomalous match of image modality through text representations. By integrating IGT and TGI, we adopt a perspective of Text-Image Mutual guidance Optimization, proposing TIMO. Extensive experiments show that TIMO significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) training-free method. Additionally, by exploring the extent of mutual guidance, we propose an enhanced variant, TIMO-S, which even surpasses the best training-required methods by 0.33% with approximately 100 times less time cost.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11380">Relation-Guided Adversarial Learning for Data-free Knowledge Transfer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingping Liang, Ying Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation transfers knowledge by recovering training data from a pre-trained model. Despite the recent success of seeking global data diversity, the diversity within each class and the similarity among different classes are largely overlooked, resulting in data homogeneity and limited performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel Relation-Guided Adversarial Learning method with triplet losses, which solves the homogeneity problem from two aspects. To be specific, our method aims to promote both intra-class diversity and inter-class confusion of the generated samples. To this end, we design two phases, an image synthesis phase and a student training phase. In the image synthesis phase, we construct an optimization process to push away samples with the same labels and pull close samples with different labels, leading to intra-class diversity and inter-class confusion, respectively. Then, in the student training phase, we perform an opposite optimization, which adversarially attempts to reduce the distance of samples of the same classes and enlarge the distance of samples of different classes. To mitigate the conflict of seeking high global diversity and keeping inter-class confusing, we propose a focal weighted sampling strategy by selecting the negative in the triplets unevenly within a finite range of distance. RGAL shows significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and data efficiency. Besides, RGAL can be inserted into state-of-the-art methods on various data-free knowledge transfer applications. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method on various tasks, specially data-free knowledge distillation, data-free quantization, and non-exemplar incremental learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anika Tabassum, Amirkoushyar Ziabari</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is a powerful tool for non-destructive characterization of materials and manufactured components. XCT commonly accompanied by advanced image analysis and computer vision algorithms to extract relevant information from the images. Traditional computer vision models often struggle due to noise, resolution variability, and complex internal structures, particularly in scientific imaging applications. State-of-the-art foundational models, like the Segment Anything Model (SAM)-designed for general-purpose image segmentation-have revolutionized image segmentation across various domains, yet their application in specialized fields like materials science remains under-explored. In this work, we explore the application and limitations of SAM for industrial X-ray CT inspection of additive manufacturing components. We demonstrate that while SAM shows promise, it struggles with out-of-distribution data, multiclass segmentation, and computational efficiency during fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a fine-tuning strategy utilizing parameter-efficient techniques, specifically Conv-LoRa, to adapt SAM for material-specific datasets. Additionally, we leverage generative adversarial network (GAN)-generated data to enhance the training process and improve the model's segmentation performance on complex X-ray CT data. Our experimental results highlight the importance of tailored segmentation models for accurate inspection, showing that fine-tuning SAM on domain-specific scientific imaging data significantly improves performance. However, despite improvements, the model's ability to generalize across diverse datasets remains limited, highlighting the need for further research into robust, scalable solutions for domain-specific segmentation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal reasoning is a critical challenge in video-language understanding, as it requires models to align semantic concepts consistently across time. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) excel at static tasks, they struggle to capture dynamic interactions and temporal dependencies in video sequences. In this work, we propose Temporal Semantic Alignment via Dynamic Prompting (TSADP), a novel framework that enhances temporal reasoning capabilities through dynamic task-specific prompts and temporal contrastive learning. TSADP leverages a Dynamic Prompt Generator (DPG) to encode fine-grained temporal relationships and a Temporal Contrastive Loss (TCL) to align visual and textual embeddings across time. We evaluate our method on the VidSitu dataset, augmented with enriched temporal annotations, and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in tasks such as Intra-Video Entity Association, Temporal Relationship Understanding, and Chronology Prediction. Human evaluations further confirm TSADP's ability to generate coherent and semantically accurate descriptions. Our analysis highlights the robustness, efficiency, and practical utility of TSADP, making it a step forward in the field of video-language understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkai Fan, Kun Wang, Zhiqiang Yan, Xiang Chen, Shangbing Gao, Jun Li, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenging problem of simultaneously removing haze and estimating depth from real monocular hazy videos. These tasks are inherently complementary: enhanced depth estimation improves dehazing via the atmospheric scattering model (ASM), while superior dehazing contributes to more accurate depth estimation through the brightness consistency constraint (BCC). To tackle these intertwined tasks, we propose a novel depth-centric learning framework that integrates the ASM model with the BCC constraint. Our key idea is that both ASM and BCC rely on a shared depth estimation network. This network simultaneously exploits adjacent dehazed frames to enhance depth estimation via BCC and uses the refined depth cues to more effectively remove haze through ASM. Additionally, we leverage a non-aligned clear video and its estimated depth to independently regularize the dehazing and depth estimation networks. This is achieved by designing two discriminator networks: $D_{MFIR}$ enhances high-frequency details in dehazed videos, and $D_{MDR}$ reduces the occurrence of black holes in low-texture regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both video dehazing and depth estimation tasks, especially in real-world hazy scenes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Carlos Rivera, Anthony Moore, Steven Robinson</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-aware reasoning in vision-language tasks poses significant challenges for current models, particularly in handling unseen objects, reducing hallucinations, and capturing fine-grained relationships in complex visual scenes. To address these limitations, we propose the Vision-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Prompting (VRAP) framework, a generative approach that enhances Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by integrating retrieval-augmented object tags into their prompts. VRAP introduces a novel pipeline where structured tags, including objects, attributes, and relationships, are extracted using pretrained visual encoders and scene graph parsers. These tags are enriched with external knowledge and incorporated into the LLM's input, enabling detailed and accurate reasoning. We evaluate VRAP across multiple vision-language benchmarks, including VQAv2, GQA, VizWiz, and COCO, achieving state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained reasoning and multimodal understanding. Additionally, our ablation studies highlight the importance of retrieval-augmented tags and contrastive learning, while human evaluations confirm VRAP's ability to generate accurate, detailed, and contextually relevant responses. Notably, VRAP achieves a 40% reduction in inference latency by eliminating runtime retrieval. These results demonstrate that VRAP is a robust and efficient framework for advancing object-aware multimodal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> TianZhu Liu, BangYan Hu, YanFeng Gu, Xian Li, Aleksandra Pi\v{z}urica</p>
<p>Abstract: Multispectral point cloud (MPC) captures 3D spatial-spectral information from the observed scene, which can be used for scene understanding and has a wide range of applications. However, most of the existing classification methods were extensively tested on indoor datasets, and when applied to outdoor datasets they still face problems including sparse labeled targets, differences in land-covers scales, and long-tailed distributions. To address the above issues, an enhanced classification method based on adaptive multi-scale fusion for MPCs with long-tailed distributions is proposed. In the training set generation stage, a grid-balanced sampling strategy is designed to reliably generate training samples from sparse labeled datasets. In the feature learning stage, a multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed to fuse shallow features of land-covers at different scales, addressing the issue of losing fine features due to scale variations in land-covers. In the classification stage, an adaptive hybrid loss module is devised to utilize multi-classification heads with adaptive weights to balance the learning ability of different classes, improving the classification performance of small classes due to various-scales and long-tailed distributions in land-covers. Experimental results on three MPC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Liu, Shuwei He, Yifan Hu, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Text-to-Speech (VTTS) aims to take the environmental image as the prompt to synthesize the reverberant speech for the spoken content. The challenge of this task lies in understanding the spatial environment from the image. Many attempts have been made to extract global spatial visual information from the RGB space of an spatial image. However, local and depth image information are crucial for understanding the spatial environment, which previous works have ignored. To address the issues, we propose a novel multi-modal and multi-scale spatial environment understanding scheme to achieve immersive VTTS, termed M2SE-VTTS. The multi-modal aims to take both the RGB and Depth spaces of the spatial image to learn more comprehensive spatial information, and the multi-scale seeks to model the local and global spatial knowledge simultaneously. Specifically, we first split the RGB and Depth images into patches and adopt the Gemini-generated environment captions to guide the local spatial understanding. After that, the multi-modal and multi-scale features are integrated by the local-aware global spatial understanding. In this way, M2SE-VTTS effectively models the interactions between local and global spatial contexts in the multi-modal spatial environment. Objective and subjective evaluations suggest that our model outperforms the advanced baselines in environmental speech generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin-Cheng Jhang, Tao Tu, Fu-En Wang, Ke Zhang, Min Sun, Cheng-Hao Kuo</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of indoor monocular 3D object detection is gaining significant attention, fueled by the increasing demand in VR/AR and robotic applications. However, its advancement is impeded by the limited availability and diversity of 3D training data, owing to the labor-intensive nature of 3D data collection and annotation processes. In this paper, we present V-MIND (Versatile Monocular INdoor Detector), which enhances the performance of indoor 3D detectors across a diverse set of object classes by harnessing publicly available large-scale 2D datasets. By leveraging well-established monocular depth estimation techniques and camera intrinsic predictors, we can generate 3D training data by converting large-scale 2D images into 3D point clouds and subsequently deriving pseudo 3D bounding boxes. To mitigate distance errors inherent in the converted point clouds, we introduce a novel 3D self-calibration loss for refining the pseudo 3D bounding boxes during training. Additionally, we propose a novel ambiguity loss to address the ambiguity that arises when introducing new classes from 2D datasets. Finally, through joint training with existing 3D datasets and pseudo 3D bounding boxes derived from 2D datasets, V-MIND achieves state-of-the-art object detection performance across a wide range of classes on the Omni3D indoor dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Bethell, Ravi Garg, Ian Reid</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose and 3D size of an object from an image is a fundamental task in computer vision. Most current approaches are restricted to specific instances with known models or require ground truth depth information or point cloud captures from LIDAR. We tackle the harder problem of pose estimation for category-level objects from a single RGB image. We propose a novel solution that eliminates the need for specific object models or depth information. Our method utilises score-based diffusion models to generate object pose hypotheses to model the distribution of possible poses for the object. Unlike previous methods that rely on costly trained likelihood estimators to remove outliers before pose aggregation using mean pooling, we introduce a simpler approach using Mean Shift to estimate the mode of the distribution as the final pose estimate. Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the REAL275 dataset by a significant margin.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models revolutionize image generation but pose risks of misuse, such as replicating artworks or generating deepfakes. Existing image protection methods, though effective, struggle to balance protection efficacy, invisibility, and latency, thus limiting practical use. We introduce perturbation pre-training to reduce latency and propose a mixture-of-perturbations approach that dynamically adapts to input images to minimize performance degradation. Our novel training strategy computes protection loss across multiple VAE feature spaces, while adaptive targeted protection at inference enhances robustness and invisibility. Experiments show comparable protection performance with improved invisibility and drastically reduced inference time. The code and demo are available at \url{https://webtoon.github.io/impasto}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Zhang, Zhouhang Luo, Tao Yu, Hui Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: View transformation robustness (VTR) is critical for deep-learning-based multi-view 3D object reconstruction models, which indicates the methods' stability under inputs with various view transformations. However, existing research seldom focused on view transformation robustness in multi-view 3D object reconstruction. One direct way to improve the models' VTR is to produce data with more view transformations and add them to model training. Recent progress on large vision models, particularly Stable Diffusion models, has provided great potential for generating 3D models or synthesizing novel view images with only a single image input. Directly deploying these models at inference consumes heavy computation resources and their robustness to view transformations is not guaranteed either. To fully utilize the power of Stable Diffusion models without extra inference computation burdens, we propose to generate novel views with Stable Diffusion models for better view transformation robustness. Instead of synthesizing random views, we propose a reconstruction error-guided view selection method, which considers the reconstruction errors' spatial distribution of the 3D predictions and chooses the views that could cover the reconstruction errors as much as possible. The methods are trained and tested on sets with large view transformations to validate the 3D reconstruction models' robustness to view transformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods and other view transformation robustness comparison methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delong Zhang, Qiwei Huang, Yuanliu Liu, Yang Sun, Wei-Shi Zheng, Pengfei Xiong, Wei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on is challenging since the generated image should fit the garment to model images in various poses and keep the characteristics and details of the garment simultaneously. A popular research stream warps the garment image firstly to reduce the burden of the generation stage, which relies highly on the performance of the warping module. Other methods without explicit warping often lack sufficient guidance to fit the garment to the model images. In this paper, we propose FIA-VTON, which leverages the implicit warp feature by adopting a Flow Infused Attention module on virtual try-on. The dense warp flow map is projected as indirect guidance attention to enhance the feature map warping in the generation process implicitly, which is less sensitive to the warping estimation accuracy than an explicit warp of the garment image. To further enhance implicit warp guidance, we incorporate high-level spatial attention to complement the dense warp. Experimental results on the VTON-HD and DressCode dataset significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that FIA-VTON is effective and robust for virtual try-on.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanfan Zheng, Jinlin Wu, Wuyang Li, Zhen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unannotated target domain under closed-set assumption. Universal DAOD (UniDAOD) extends DAOD to handle open-set, partial-set, and closed-set domain adaptation. In this paper, we first unveil two issues: domain-private category alignment is crucial for global-level features, and the domain probability heterogeneity of features across different levels. To address these issues, we propose a novel Dual Probabilistic Alignment (DPA) framework to model domain probability as Gaussian distribution, enabling the heterogeneity domain distribution sampling and measurement. The DPA consists of three tailored modules: the Global-level Domain Private Alignment (GDPA), the Instance-level Domain Shared Alignment (IDSA), and the Private Class Constraint (PCC). GDPA utilizes the global-level sampling to mine domain-private category samples and calculate alignment weight through a cumulative distribution function to address the global-level private category alignment. IDSA utilizes instance-level sampling to mine domain-shared category samples and calculates alignment weight through Gaussian distribution to conduct the domain-shared category domain alignment to address the feature heterogeneity. The PCC aggregates domain-private category centroids between feature and probability spaces to mitigate negative transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DPA outperforms state-of-the-art UniDAOD and DAOD methods across various datasets and scenarios, including open, partial, and closed sets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiping Zhang, Yuntao Shou, Wei Ai, Tao Meng, Keqin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the recent advances in computer vision, age estimation has significantly improved in overall accuracy. However, owing to the most common methods do not take into account the class imbalance problem in age estimation datasets, they suffer from a large bias in recognizing long-tailed groups. To achieve high-quality imbalanced learning in long-tailed groups, the dominant solution lies in that the feature extractor learns the discriminative features of different groups and the classifier is able to provide appropriate and unbiased margins for different groups by the discriminative features. Therefore, in this novel, we propose an innovative collaborative learning framework (GroupFace) that integrates a multi-hop attention graph convolutional network and a dynamic group-aware margin strategy based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, to extract the discriminative features of different groups, we design an enhanced multi-hop attention graph convolutional network. This network is capable of capturing the interactions of neighboring nodes at different distances, fusing local and global information to model facial deep aging, and exploring diverse representations of different groups. In addition, to further address the class imbalance problem, we design a dynamic group-aware margin strategy based on reinforcement learning to provide appropriate and unbiased margins for different groups. The strategy divides the sample into four age groups and considers identifying the optimum margins for various age groups by employing a Markov decision process. Under the guidance of the agent, the feature representation bias and the classification margin deviation between different groups can be reduced simultaneously, balancing inter-class separability and intra-class proximity. After joint optimization, our architecture achieves excellent performance on several age estimation benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Classifying chest radiographs is a time-consuming and challenging task, even for experienced radiologists. This provides an area for improvement due to the difficulty in precisely distinguishing between conditions such as pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and pneumonia. We propose a novel transfer learning model for multi-label lung disease classification, utilizing the CheXpert dataset with over 12,617 images of frontal radiographs being analyzed. By integrating RadGraph parsing for efficient annotation extraction, we enhance the model's ability to accurately classify multiple lung diseases from complex medical images. The proposed model achieved an F1 score of 0.69 and an AUROC of 0.86, demonstrating its potential for clinical applications. Also explored was the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse report metadata and address uncertainties in disease classification. By comparing uncertain reports with more certain cases, the NLP-enhanced model improves its ability to conclusively classify conditions. This research highlights the connection between deep learning and NLP, underscoring their potential to enhance radiological diagnostics and aid in the efficient analysis of chest radiographs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruijie Lu, Yixin Chen, Junfeng Ni, Baoxiong Jia, Yu Liu, Diwen Wan, Gang Zeng, Siyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Repurposing pre-trained diffusion models has been proven to be effective for NVS. However, these methods are mostly limited to a single object; directly applying such methods to compositional multi-object scenarios yields inferior results, especially incorrect object placement and inconsistent shape and appearance under novel views. How to enhance and systematically evaluate the cross-view consistency of such models remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose MOVIS to enhance the structural awareness of the view-conditioned diffusion model for multi-object NVS in terms of model inputs, auxiliary tasks, and training strategy. First, we inject structure-aware features, including depth and object mask, into the denoising U-Net to enhance the model's comprehension of object instances and their spatial relationships. Second, we introduce an auxiliary task requiring the model to simultaneously predict novel view object masks, further improving the model's capability in differentiating and placing objects. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the diffusion sampling process and carefully devise a structure-guided timestep sampling scheduler during training, which balances the learning of global object placement and fine-grained detail recovery. To systematically evaluate the plausibility of synthesized images, we propose to assess cross-view consistency and novel view object placement alongside existing image-level NVS metrics. Extensive experiments on challenging synthetic and realistic datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities and produces consistent novel view synthesis, highlighting its potential to guide future 3D-aware multi-object NVS tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sucheng Ren, Xiaomeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformer shows great superiority in medical image segmentation due to the ability in learning long-range dependency. For medical image segmentation from 3D data, such as computed tomography (CT), existing methods can be broadly classified into 2D-based and 3D-based methods. One key limitation in 2D-based methods is that the intra-slice information is ignored, while the limitation in 3D-based methods is the high computation cost and memory consumption, resulting in a limited feature representation for inner-slice information. During the clinical examination, radiologists primarily use the axial plane and then routinely review both axial and coronal planes to form a 3D understanding of anatomy. Motivated by this fact, our key insight is to design a hybrid model which can first learn fine-grained inner-slice information and then generate a 3D understanding of anatomy by incorporating 3D information. We present a novel \textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{Res}idual trans\textbf{Former} \textbf{(HResFormer)} for 3D medical image segmentation. Building upon standard 2D and 3D Transformer backbones, HResFormer involves two novel key designs: \textbf{(1)} a \textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{L}ocal-\textbf{G}lobal fusion \textbf{M}odule \textbf{(HLGM)} to effectively and adaptively fuse inner-slice information from 2D Transformer and intra-slice information from 3D volumes for 3D Transformer with local fine-grained and global long-range representation. \textbf{(2)} a residual learning of the hybrid model, which can effectively leverage the inner-slice and intra-slice information for better 3D understanding of anatomy. Experiments show that our HResFormer outperforms prior art on widely-used medical image segmentation benchmarks. This paper sheds light on an important but neglected way to design Transformers for 3D medical image segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models trained on multi-institutional datasets can provide an enriched understanding through diverse data distributions. However, training the models on medical images is often challenging due to hospitals' reluctance to share data for privacy reasons. Federated learning(FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving solution for training distributed datasets across data centers by aggregating model weights from multiple clients instead of sharing raw data. Previous research has explored the adaptation of FL to generative models, yet effective aggregation algorithms specifically tailored for generative models remain unexplored. We hereby propose a novel algorithm aimed at improving the performance of generative models within FL. Our approach adaptively re-weights the contribution of each client, resulting in well-trained shared parameters. In each round, the server side measures the distribution distance between fake images generated by clients instead of directly comparing the Fr\'echet Inception Distance per client, thereby enhancing efficiency of the learning. Experimental results on three public chest X-ray datasets show superior performance in medical image generation, outperforming both centralized learning and conventional FL algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan-Sheng Zeng, Yunheng Li, Daquan Zhou, Guanbin Li, Qibin Hou, Ming-Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary image segmentation has been advanced through the synergy between mask generators and vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). Previous approaches focus on generating masks while aligning mask features with text embeddings during training. In this paper, we observe that relying on generated low-quality masks can weaken the alignment of vision and language in regional representations. This motivates us to present a new fine-tuning framework, named MaskCLIP++, which uses ground-truth masks instead of generated masks to enhance the mask classification capability of CLIP. Due to the limited diversity of image segmentation datasets with mask annotations, we propose incorporating a consistency alignment constraint during fine-tuning, which alleviates categorical bias toward the fine-tuning dataset. After low-cost fine-tuning, combining with the mask generator in previous state-of-the-art mask-based open vocabulary segmentation methods, we achieve performance improvements of +1.7, +2.3, +2.1, +3.1, and +0.3 mIoU on the A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, and PAS-20 datasets, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to detect and describe all events in untrimmed videos. This paper presents a dense video captioning network called Multi-Concept Cyclic Learning (MCCL), which aims to: (1) detect multiple concepts at the frame level, using these concepts to enhance video features and provide temporal event cues; and (2) design cyclic co-learning between the generator and the localizer within the captioning network to promote semantic perception and event localization. Specifically, we perform weakly supervised concept detection for each frame, and the detected concept embeddings are integrated into the video features to provide event cues. Additionally, video-level concept contrastive learning is introduced to obtain more discriminative concept embeddings. In the captioning network, we establish a cyclic co-learning strategy where the generator guides the localizer for event localization through semantic matching, while the localizer enhances the generator's event semantic perception through location matching, making semantic perception and event localization mutually beneficial. MCCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and interpretability.</p>

OmniVLM introduces a token compression mechanism that reduces visual token sequence length from 729 to 81 tokens, significantly reducing computational overhead while preserving visual-semantic fidelity. Through a multi-stage training pipeline of pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and minimal-edit Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), OmniVLM matches the performance of larger models. On multiple benchmarks including ScienceQA, POPE, and MMMU, OmniVLM outperforms existing baselines like nanoLLAVA within a 968M-parameter footprint. Empirical results on the same laptop demonstrate 9.1x faster time-to-first-token (0.75s vs 6.82s) and 1.5x higher decoding speed (29.41 vs 19.20 tokens/s) compared to nanoLLAVA, enabling efficient deployment on edge devices. The model weights can be accessed on huggingface: \url{https://huggingface.co/NexaAIDev/OmniVLM-968M}, and the inference examples can be find in Appendix B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young-Jae Park, Doyi Kim, Minseok Seo, Hae-Gon Jeon, Yeji Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is crucial for early warnings of disasters, such as floods and landslides. Traditional forecasts rely on ground-based radar systems, which are space-constrained and have high maintenance costs. Consequently, most developing countries depend on a global numerical model with low resolution, instead of operating their own radar systems. To mitigate this gap, we propose the Neural Precipitation Model (NPM), which uses global-scale geostationary satellite imagery. NPM predicts precipitation for up to six hours, with an update every hour. We take three key channels to discriminate rain clouds as input: infrared radiation (at a wavelength of 10.5 $\mu m$), upper- (6.3 $\mu m$), and lower- (7.3 $\mu m$) level water vapor channels. Additionally, NPM introduces positional encoders to capture seasonal and temporal patterns, accounting for variations in precipitation. Our experimental results demonstrate that NPM can predict rainfall in real-time with a resolution of 2 km.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Gu, Jianwei Ma, Yan Huang, Honghao Wei, Zhanye Chen, Hui Zhang, Wei Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar plays a vital role in 3D object detection for autonomous driving due to its all-weather and all-lighting-condition capabilities for perception. However, radar point clouds suffer from pronounced sparsity and unavoidable angle estimation errors. To address these limitations, incorporating a camera may partially help mitigate the shortcomings. Nevertheless, the direct fusion of radar and camera data can lead to negative or even opposite effects due to the lack of depth information in images and low-quality image features under adverse lighting conditions. Hence, in this paper, we present the radar-camera fusion network with Hybrid Generation and Synchronization (HGSFusion), designed to better fuse radar potentials and image features for 3D object detection. Specifically, we propose the Radar Hybrid Generation Module (RHGM), which fully considers the Direction-Of-Arrival (DOA) estimation errors in radar signal processing. This module generates denser radar points through different Probability Density Functions (PDFs) with the assistance of semantic information. Meanwhile, we introduce the Dual Sync Module (DSM), comprising spatial sync and modality sync, to enhance image features with radar positional information and facilitate the fusion of distinct characteristics in different modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods in the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets by $6.53\%$ and $2.03\%$ in RoI AP and BEV AP, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyang Jin, Chao Fan, Weihua Chen, Shiqi Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The gait, as a kind of soft biometric characteristic, can reflect the distinct walking patterns of individuals at a distance, exhibiting a promising technique for unrestrained human identification. With largely excluding gait-unrelated cues hidden in RGB videos, the silhouette and skeleton, though visually compact, have acted as two of the most prevailing gait modalities for a long time. Recently, several attempts have been made to introduce more informative data forms like human parsing and optical flow images to capture gait characteristics, along with multi-branch architectures. However, due to the inconsistency within model designs and experiment settings, we argue that a comprehensive and fair comparative study among these popular gait modalities, involving the representational capacity and fusion strategy exploration, is still lacking. From the perspectives of fine vs. coarse-grained shape and whole vs. pixel-wise motion modeling, this work presents an in-depth investigation of three popular gait representations, i.e., silhouette, human parsing, and optical flow, with various fusion evaluations, and experimentally exposes their similarities and differences. Based on the obtained insights, we further develop a C$^2$Fusion strategy, consequently building our new framework MultiGait++. C$^2$Fusion preserves commonalities while highlighting differences to enrich the learning of gait features. To verify our findings and conclusions, extensive experiments on Gait3D, GREW, CCPG, and SUSTech1K are conducted. The code is available at https://github.com/ShiqiYu/OpenGait.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihan Wu, Ji Zhang, Pengpeng Zeng, Lianli Gao, Jingkuan Song, Heng Tao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT) has long been recognized as an effective and efficient paradigm for transferring large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks by learning a tiny set of context vectors. Nevertheless, in this work, we reveal that freezing the parameters of VLMs during learning the context vectors neither facilitates the transferability of pre-trained knowledge nor improves the memory and time efficiency significantly. Upon further investigation, we find that reducing both the length and width of the feature-gradient propagation flows of the full fine-tuning (FT) baseline is key to achieving effective and efficient knowledge transfer. Motivated by this, we propose Skip Tuning, a novel paradigm for adapting VLMs to downstream tasks. Unlike existing PT or adapter-based methods, Skip Tuning applies Layer-wise Skipping (LSkip) and Class-wise Skipping (CSkip) upon the FT baseline without introducing extra context vectors or adapter modules. Extensive experiments across a wide spectrum of benchmarks demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our Skip Tuning over both PT and adapter-based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Zhang, Qianxi Jia, Yang Liu, Wei Zhang, Wei Wei, Xin Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Stereo video conversion aims to transform monocular videos into immersive stereo format. Despite the advancements in novel view synthesis, it still remains two major challenges: i) difficulty of achieving high-fidelity and stable results, and ii) insufficiency of high-quality stereo video data. In this paper, we introduce SpatialMe, a novel stereo video conversion framework based on depth-warping and blend-inpainting. Specifically, we propose a mask-based hierarchy feature update (MHFU) refiner, which integrate and refine the outputs from designed multi-branch inpainting module, using feature update unit (FUU) and mask mechanism. We also propose a disparity expansion strategy to address the problem of foreground bleeding. Furthermore, we conduct a high-quality real-world stereo video dataset -- StereoV1K, to alleviate the data shortage. It contains 1000 stereo videos captured in real-world at a resolution of 1180 x 1180, covering various indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in generating stereo videos over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Le Shen, Rong Huang, Zhijie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Garment restoration, the inverse of virtual try-on task, focuses on restoring standard garment from a person image, requiring accurate capture of garment details. However, existing methods often fail to preserve the identity of the garment or rely on complex processes. To address these limitations, we propose an improved diffusion model for restoring authentic garments. Our approach employs two garment extractors to independently capture low-level features and high-level semantics from the person image. Leveraging a pretrained latent diffusion model, these features are integrated into the denoising process through garment fusion blocks, which combine self-attention and cross-attention layers to align the restored garment with the person image. Furthermore, a coarse-to-fine training strategy is introduced to enhance the fidelity and authenticity of the generated garments. Experimental results demonstrate that our model effectively preserves garment identity and generates high-quality restorations, even in challenging scenarios such as complex garments or those with occlusions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Wang, Hongzhen Li, Heng Fang, Yichen Peng, Haoran Xie, Xi Yang, Chuntao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Image rendering from line drawings is vital in design and image generation technologies reduce costs, yet professional line drawings demand preserving complex details. Text prompts struggle with accuracy, and image translation struggles with consistency and fine-grained control. We present LineArt, a framework that transfers complex appearance onto detailed design drawings, facilitating design and artistic creation. It generates high-fidelity appearance while preserving structural accuracy by simulating hierarchical visual cognition and integrating human artistic experience to guide the diffusion process. LineArt overcomes the limitations of current methods in terms of difficulty in fine-grained control and style degradation in design drawings. It requires no precise 3D modeling, physical property specs, or network training, making it more convenient for design tasks. LineArt consists of two stages: a multi-frequency lines fusion module to supplement the input design drawing with detailed structural information and a two-part painting process for Base Layer Shaping and Surface Layer Coloring. We also present a new design drawing dataset ProLines for evaluation. The experiments show that LineArt performs better in accuracy, realism, and material precision compared to SOTAs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong In Lee, Hyeongcheol Park, Jiyoung Seo, Eunbyung Park, Hyunje Park, Ha Dam Baek, Shin Sangheon, Sangmin kim, Sangpil Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D editing have highlighted the potential of text-driven methods in real-time, user-friendly AR/VR applications. However, current methods rely on 2D diffusion models without adequately considering multi-view information, resulting in multi-view inconsistency. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improves rendering quality and speed, its 3D editing process encounters difficulties with inefficient optimization, as pre-trained Gaussians retain excessive source information, hindering optimization. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{EditSplat}, a novel 3D editing framework that integrates Multi-view Fusion Guidance (MFG) and Attention-Guided Trimming (AGT). Our MFG ensures multi-view consistency by incorporating essential multi-view information into the diffusion process, leveraging classifier-free guidance from the text-to-image diffusion model and the geometric properties of 3DGS. Additionally, our AGT leverages the explicit representation of 3DGS to selectively prune and optimize 3D Gaussians, enhancing optimization efficiency and enabling precise, semantically rich local edits. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, EditSplat achieves superior multi-view consistency and editing quality over existing methods, significantly enhancing overall efficiency.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11525">Sequence Matters: Harnessing Video Models in Super-Resolution</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyun-kyu Ko, Dongheok Park, Youngin Park, Byeonghyeon Lee, Juhee Han, Eunbyung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D super-resolution aims to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D models from low-resolution (LR) multi-view images. Early studies primarily focused on single-image super-resolution (SISR) models to upsample LR images into high-resolution images. However, these methods often lack view consistency because they operate independently on each image. Although various post-processing techniques have been extensively explored to mitigate these inconsistencies, they have yet to fully resolve the issues. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of 3D super-resolution by leveraging video super-resolution (VSR) models. By utilizing VSR models, we ensure a higher degree of spatial consistency and can reference surrounding spatial information, leading to more accurate and detailed reconstructions. Our findings reveal that VSR models can perform remarkably well even on sequences that lack precise spatial alignment. Given this observation, we propose a simple yet practical approach to align LR images without involving fine-tuning or generating 'smooth' trajectory from the trained 3D models over LR images. The experimental results show that the surprisingly simple algorithms can achieve the state-of-the-art results of 3D super-resolution tasks on standard benchmark datasets, such as the NeRF-synthetic and MipNeRF-360 datasets.

<p>Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization tackles the problem of image geo-localization in GNSS-denied environments by matching street-view query images with geo-tagged aerial-view reference images. However, existing datasets and methods often assume center-aligned settings or only consider limited decentrality (i.e., the offset of the query image from the reference image center). This assumption overlooks the challenges present in real-world applications, where large decentrality can significantly enhance localization efficiency but simultaneously lead to a substantial degradation in localization accuracy. To address this limitation, we introduce CVSat, a novel dataset designed to evaluate cross-view geo-localization with a large geographic scope and diverse landscapes, emphasizing the decentrality issue. Meanwhile, we propose AuxGeo (Auxiliary Enhanced Geo-Localization), which leverages a multi-metric optimization strategy with two novel modules: the Bird's-eye view Intermediary Module (BIM) and the Position Constraint Module (PCM). BIM uses bird's-eye view images derived from street-view panoramas as an intermediary, simplifying the cross-view challenge with decentrality to a cross-view problem and a decentrality problem. PCM leverages position priors between cross-view images to establish multi-grained alignment constraints. These modules improve the performance of cross-view geo-localization with the decentrality problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AuxGeo outperforms previous methods on our proposed CVSat dataset, mitigating the issue of large decentrality, and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing public datasets such as CVUSA, CVACT, and VIGOR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junda Cheng, Zhipeng Cai, Zhaoxing Zhang, Wei Yin, Matthias Muller, Michael Paulitsch, Xin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual odometry (VO) aims to estimate camera poses from visual inputs -- a fundamental building block for many applications such as VR/AR and robotics. This work focuses on monocular RGB VO where the input is a monocular RGB video without IMU or 3D sensors. Existing approaches lack robustness under this challenging scenario and fail to generalize to unseen data (especially outdoors); they also cannot recover metric-scale poses. We propose Robust Metric Visual Odometry (RoMeO), a novel method that resolves these issues leveraging priors from pre-trained depth models. RoMeO incorporates both monocular metric depth and multi-view stereo (MVS) models to recover metric-scale, simplify correspondence search, provide better initialization and regularize optimization. Effective strategies are proposed to inject noise during training and adaptively filter noisy depth priors, which ensure the robustness of RoMeO on in-the-wild data. As shown in Fig.1, RoMeO advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a large margin across 6 diverse datasets covering both indoor and outdoor scenes. Compared to the current SOTA DPVO, RoMeO reduces the relative (align the trajectory scale with GT) and absolute trajectory errors both by >50%. The performance gain also transfers to the full SLAM pipeline (with global BA & loop closure). Code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Chen, Tingyu Wang, Rongfeng Lu, Bolun Zheng, Zhedong Zheng, Chenggang Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: UAV-view Geo-Localization (UVGL) presents substantial challenges, primarily due to appearance differences between drone-view and satellite-view. Existing methods develop partition learning strategies aimed at mining more comprehensive information by constructing diverse part-level feature representations, which rely on consistent cross-view scales. However, variations of UAV flight state leads to the scale mismatch of cross-views, resulting in serious performance degradation of partition-based methods. To overcome this issue, we propose a partition learning framework based on relative distance, which alleviates the dependence on scale consistency while mining fine-grained features. Specifically, we propose a distance guided dynamic partition learning strategy (DGDPL), consisting of a square partition strategy and a dynamic-guided adjustment strategy. The former is utilized to extract fine-grained features and global features in a simple manner. The latter calculates the relative distance ratio between drone- and satellite-view to adjust the partition size, thereby aligning the semantic information between partition pairs. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-guided refinement strategy to refine part-level features, so as to further improve the retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior geo-localization accuracy across various scale-inconsistent scenarios, and exhibits remarkable robustness against scale variations. The code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxu Wan, Hong Zhang, Ziqi He, Qishu Wang, Ding Yuan, Yifan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In 3D understanding, point transformers have yielded significant advances in broadening the receptive field. However, further enhancement of the receptive field is hindered by the constraints of grouping attention. The proxy-based model, as a hot topic in image and language feature extraction, uses global or local proxies to expand the model's receptive field. But global proxy-based methods fail to precisely determine proxy positions and are not suited for tasks like segmentation and detection in the point cloud, and exist local proxy-based methods for image face difficulties in global-local balance, proxy sampling in various point clouds, and parallel cross-attention computation for sparse association. In this paper, we present SP$^2$T, a local proxy-based dual stream point transformer, which promotes global receptive field while maintaining a balance between local and global information. To tackle robust 3D proxy sampling, we propose a spatial-wise proxy sampling with vertex-based point proxy associations, ensuring robust point-cloud sampling in many scales of point cloud. To resolve economical association computation, we introduce sparse proxy attention combined with table-based relative bias, which enables low-cost and precise interactions between proxy and point features. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets reveal that our model achieves SOTA performance in downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Chen, Yiwen Ye, Feilong Tang, Yongsheng Pan, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to enhance the ability of models trained on source domains to generalize effectively to unseen domains. Recently, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown promise in this area by reducing the sharpness of the loss landscape to obtain more generalized models. However, SAM and its variants sometimes fail to guide the model toward a flat minimum, and their training processes exhibit limitations, hindering further improvements in model generalization. In this paper, we first propose an improved model training process aimed at encouraging the model to converge to a flat minima. To achieve this, we design a curvature metric that has a minimal effect when the model is far from convergence but becomes increasingly influential in indicating the curvature of the minima as the model approaches a local minimum. Then we derive a novel algorithm from this metric, called Meta Curvature-Aware Minimization (MeCAM), to minimize the curvature around the local minima. Specifically, the optimization objective of MeCAM simultaneously minimizes the regular training loss, the surrogate gap of SAM, and the surrogate gap of meta-learning. We provide theoretical analysis on MeCAM's generalization error and convergence rate, and demonstrate its superiority over existing DG methods through extensive experiments on five benchmark DG datasets, including PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet. Code will be available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weilun Feng, Haotong Qin, Chuanguang Yang, Zhulin An, Libo Huang, Boyu Diao, Fei Wang, Renshuai Tao, Yongjun Xu, Michele Magno</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have received wide attention in generation tasks. However, the expensive computation cost prevents the application of diffusion models in resource-constrained scenarios. Quantization emerges as a practical solution that significantly saves storage and computation by reducing the bit-width of parameters. However, the existing quantization methods for diffusion models still cause severe degradation in performance, especially under extremely low bit-widths (2-4 bit). The primary decrease in performance comes from the significant discretization of activation values at low bit quantization. Too few activation candidates are unfriendly for outlier significant weight channel quantization, and the discretized features prevent stable learning over different time steps of the diffusion model. This paper presents MPQ-DM, a Mixed-Precision Quantization method for Diffusion Models. The proposed MPQ-DM mainly relies on two techniques:(1) To mitigate the quantization error caused by outlier severe weight channels, we propose an Outlier-Driven Mixed Quantization (OMQ) technique that uses $Kurtosis$ to quantify outlier salient channels and apply optimized intra-layer mixed-precision bit-width allocation to recover accuracy performance within target efficiency.(2) To robustly learn representations crossing time steps, we construct a Time-Smoothed Relation Distillation (TRD) scheme between the quantized diffusion model and its full-precision counterpart, transferring discrete and continuous latent to a unified relation space to reduce the representation inconsistency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MPQ-DM achieves significant accuracy gains under extremely low bit-widths compared with SOTA quantization methods. MPQ-DM achieves a 58\% FID decrease under W2A4 setting compared with baseline, while all other methods even collapse.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive model training pipeline for Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) designed to accommodate the distinctive characteristics and constraints of the Sign Language (SL) domain.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that the developed training pipeline easily adapts to different datasets and architectures. Additionally, the ablation study shows that each proposed component expands the potential to consider ISLR task specifics. The presented strategies improve recognition performance on a broad set of ISLR benchmarks. Moreover, we achieved a state-of-the-art result on the WLASL and Slovo benchmarks with 1.63% and 14.12% improvements compared to the previous best solution, respectively.</p>

Covering wildfire events in the contiguous U.S. from January 2017 to October 2021, the dataset includes 3552 surface reflectance images and auxiliary data such as weather, topography, land cover, and fuel information, totalling 71 GB. The lifecycle of each wildfire is documented, with labels for active fires (AF) and burned areas (BA), supported by manual quality assurance of AF and BA test labels. The dataset supports three tasks: a) active fire detection, b) daily burned area mapping, and c) wildfire progression prediction. Detection tasks use pixel-wise classification of multi-spectral, multi-temporal images, while prediction tasks integrate satellite and auxiliary data to model fire dynamics. This dataset and its benchmarks provide a foundation for advancing wildfire research using deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhao, Yifang Ban</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring wildfires has become increasingly critical due to the sharp rise in wildfire incidents in recent years. Optical satellites like Sentinel-2 and Landsat are extensively utilized for mapping burned areas. However, the effectiveness of optical sensors is compromised by clouds and smoke, which obstruct the detection of burned areas. Thus, satellites equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), such as dual-polarization Sentinel-1 and quad-polarization RADARSAT-1/-2 C-band SAR, which can penetrate clouds and smoke, are investigated for mapping burned areas. However, there is limited research on using compact polarisation (compact-pol) C-band RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) SAR data for this purpose. This study aims to investigate the capacity of compact polarisation RCM data for burned area mapping through deep learning. Compact-pol m-chi decomposition and Compact-pol Radar Vegetation Index (CpRVI) are derived from the RCM Multi-look Complex product. A deep-learning-based processing pipeline incorporating ConvNet-based and Transformer-based models is applied for burned area mapping, with three different input settings: using only log-ratio dual-polarization intensity images images, using only compact-pol decomposition plus CpRVI, and using all three data sources. The results demonstrate that compact-pol m-chi decomposition and CpRVI images significantly complement log-ratio images for burned area mapping. The best-performing Transformer-based model, UNETR, trained with log-ratio, m-chi decomposition, and CpRVI data, achieved an F1 Score of 0.718 and an IoU Score of 0.565, showing a notable improvement compared to the same model trained using only log-ratio images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Cardarelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Archaeological pottery documentation and study represents a crucial but time-consuming aspect of archaeology. While recent years have seen advances in digital documentation methods, vast amounts of legacy data remain locked in traditional publications. This paper introduces PyPotteryLens, an open-source framework that leverages deep learning to automate the digitisation and processing of archaeological pottery drawings from published sources. The system combines state-of-the-art computer vision models (YOLO for instance segmentation and EfficientNetV2 for classification) with an intuitive user interface, making advanced digital methods accessible to archaeologists regardless of technical expertise. The framework achieves over 97\% precision and recall in pottery detection and classification tasks, while reducing processing time by up to 5x to 20x compared to manual methods. Testing across diverse archaeological contexts demonstrates robust generalisation capabilities. Also, the system's modular architecture facilitates extension to other archaeological materials, while its standardised output format ensures long-term preservation and reusability of digitised data as well as solid basis for training machine learning algorithms. The software, documentation, and examples are available on GitHub (https://github.com/lrncrd/PyPottery/tree/PyPotteryLens).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Knab, Katharina Prasse, Sascha Marton, Christian Bartelt, Margret Keuper</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of neural networks increases steadily, but our understanding of their decision-making lags behind. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this issue by incorporating human-understandable concepts into the prediction process, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability. Since existing approaches often rely on large language models (LLMs) to infer concepts, their results may contain inaccurate or incomplete mappings, especially in complex visual domains. We introduce visually Grounded Concept Bottleneck Models (GCBM), which derive concepts on the image level using segmentation and detection foundation models. Our method generates inherently interpretable concepts, which can be grounded in the input image using attribution methods, allowing interpretations to be traced back to the image plane. We show that GCBM concepts are meaningful interpretability vehicles, which aid our understanding of model embedding spaces. GCBMs allow users to control the granularity, number, and naming of concepts, providing flexibility and are easily adaptable to new datasets without pre-training or additional data needed. Prediction accuracy is within 0.3-6% of the linear probe and GCBMs perform especially well for fine-grained classification interpretability on CUB, due to their dataset specificity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenlong Yuan, Jinguo Luo, Fei Shen, Zhaoxin Li, Cong Liu, Tianlu Mao, Zhaoqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Patch deformation-based methods have recently exhibited substantial effectiveness in multi-view stereo, due to the incorporation of deformable and expandable perception to reconstruct textureless areas. However, such approaches typically focus on exploring correlative reliable pixels to alleviate match ambiguity during patch deformation, but ignore the deformation instability caused by mistaken edge-skipping and visibility occlusion, leading to potential estimation deviation. To remedy the above issues, we propose DVP-MVS, which innovatively synergizes depth-edge aligned and cross-view prior for robust and visibility-aware patch deformation. Specifically, to avoid unexpected edge-skipping, we first utilize Depth Anything V2 followed by the Roberts operator to initialize coarse depth and edge maps respectively, both of which are further aligned through an erosion-dilation strategy to generate fine-grained homogeneous boundaries for guiding patch deformation. In addition, we reform view selection weights as visibility maps and restore visible areas by cross-view depth reprojection, then regard them as cross-view prior to facilitate visibility-aware patch deformation. Finally, we improve propagation and refinement with multi-view geometry consistency by introducing aggregated visible hemispherical normals based on view selection and local projection depth differences based on epipolar lines, respectively. Extensive evaluations on ETH3D and Tanks & Temples benchmarks demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance with excellent robustness and generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingqian Wu, Shuo Zhu, Chutian Wang, Boxin Shi, Edmund Y. Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) have demonstrated the potential of using 3D Gaussian primitives for high-speed, high-fidelity, and cost-efficient novel view synthesis from continuously calibrated input views. However, conventional methods require high-frame-rate dense and high-quality sharp images, which are time-consuming and inefficient to capture, especially in dynamic environments. Event cameras, with their high temporal resolution and ability to capture asynchronous brightness changes, offer a promising alternative for more reliable scene reconstruction without motion blur. In this paper, we propose SweepEvGS, a novel hardware-integrated method that leverages event cameras for robust and accurate novel view synthesis across various imaging settings from a single sweep. SweepEvGS utilizes the initial static frame with dense event streams captured during a single camera sweep to effectively reconstruct detailed scene views. We also introduce different real-world hardware imaging systems for real-world data collection and evaluation for future research. We validate the robustness and efficiency of SweepEvGS through experiments in three different imaging settings: synthetic objects, real-world macro-level, and real-world micro-level view synthesis. Our results demonstrate that SweepEvGS surpasses existing methods in visual rendering quality, rendering speed, and computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for dynamic practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Xu, Ruixiang Zhang, Wen Yang, Haoran Zhu, Fang Xu, Jian Ding, Gui-Song Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting oriented tiny objects, which are limited in appearance information yet prevalent in real-world applications, remains an intricate and under-explored problem. To address this, we systemically introduce a new dataset, benchmark, and a dynamic coarse-to-fine learning scheme in this study. Our proposed dataset, AI-TOD-R, features the smallest object sizes among all oriented object detection datasets. Based on AI-TOD-R, we present a benchmark spanning a broad range of detection paradigms, including both fully-supervised and label-efficient approaches. Through investigation, we identify a learning bias presents across various learning pipelines: confident objects become increasingly confident, while vulnerable oriented tiny objects are further marginalized, hindering their detection performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Dynamic Coarse-to-Fine Learning (DCFL) scheme to achieve unbiased learning. DCFL dynamically updates prior positions to better align with the limited areas of oriented tiny objects, and it assigns samples in a way that balances both quantity and quality across different object shapes, thus mitigating biases in prior settings and sample selection. Extensive experiments across eight challenging object detection datasets demonstrate that DCFL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, high efficiency, and remarkable versatility.

<p>Abstract: While haircut indicates distinct personality, existing avatar generation methods fail to model practical hair due to the general or entangled representation. We propose StrandHead, a novel text to 3D head avatar generation method capable of generating disentangled 3D hair with strand representation. Without using 3D data for supervision, we demonstrate that realistic hair strands can be generated from prompts by distilling 2D generative diffusion models. To this end, we propose a series of reliable priors on shape initialization, geometric primitives, and statistical haircut features, leading to a stable optimization and text-aligned performance. Extensive experiments show that StrandHead achieves the state-of-the-art reality and diversity of generated 3D head and hair. The generated 3D hair can also be easily implemented in the Unreal Engine for physical simulation and other applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Chen, Lan Yang, Yonggang Qi, Honggang Zhang, Kaiyue Pang, Ke Li, Yi-Zhe Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, enabling precise visual control remains a significant challenge. Existing works attempted to incorporate multi-facet controls (text and sketch), aiming to enhance the creative control over generated images. However, our pilot study reveals that the expressive power of humans far surpasses the capabilities of current methods. Users desire a more versatile approach that can accommodate their diverse creative intents, ranging from controlling individual subjects to manipulating the entire scene composition. We present VersaGen, a generative AI agent that enables versatile visual control in T2I synthesis. VersaGen admits four types of visual controls: i) single visual subject; ii) multiple visual subjects; iii) scene background; iv) any combination of the three above or merely no control at all. We train an adaptor upon a frozen T2I model to accommodate the visual information into the text-dominated diffusion process. We introduce three optimization strategies during the inference phase of VersaGen to improve generation results and enhance user experience. Comprehensive experiments on COCO and Sketchy validate the effectiveness and flexibility of VersaGen, as evidenced by both qualitative and quantitative results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daoyi Gao, Yawar Siddiqui, Lei Li, Angela Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Articulated 3D object generation is fundamental for creating realistic, functional, and interactable virtual assets which are not simply static. We introduce MeshArt, a hierarchical transformer-based approach to generate articulated 3D meshes with clean, compact geometry, reminiscent of human-crafted 3D models. We approach articulated mesh generation in a part-by-part fashion across two stages. First, we generate a high-level articulation-aware object structure; then, based on this structural information, we synthesize each part's mesh faces. Key to our approach is modeling both articulation structures and part meshes as sequences of quantized triangle embeddings, leading to a unified hierarchical framework with transformers for autoregressive generation. Object part structures are first generated as their bounding primitives and articulation modes; a second transformer, guided by these articulation structures, then generates each part's mesh triangles. To ensure coherency among generated parts, we introduce structure-guided conditioning that also incorporates local part mesh connectivity. MeshArt shows significant improvements over state of the art, with 57.1% improvement in structure coverage and a 209-point improvement in mesh generation FID.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Tang, Hongyu Yang, Hanchen Zhang, Jiaxin Chen, Di Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in neural implicit representations and differentiable rendering have markedly improved the ability to learn animatable 3D avatars from sparse multi-view RGB videos. However, current methods that map observation space to canonical space often face challenges in capturing pose-dependent details and generalizing to novel poses. While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities in 2D image generation, their potential for creating animatable 3D avatars from 2D inputs remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce 3D$^2$-Actor, a novel approach featuring a pose-conditioned 3D-aware human modeling pipeline that integrates iterative 2D denoising and 3D rectifying steps. The 2D denoiser, guided by pose cues, generates detailed multi-view images that provide the rich feature set necessary for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction and pose rendering. Complementing this, our Gaussian-based 3D rectifier renders images with enhanced 3D consistency through a two-stage projection strategy and a novel local coordinate representation. Additionally, we propose an innovative sampling strategy to ensure smooth temporal continuity across frames in video synthesis. Our method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional numerical solutions in handling ill-posed mappings, producing realistic and animatable 3D human avatars. Experimental results demonstrate that 3D$^2$-Actor excels in high-fidelity avatar modeling and robustly generalizes to novel poses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Svetlana Pavlitska, Enrico Eisen, J. Marius Z\"ollner</p>
<p>Abstract: Vulnerability to adversarial attacks is a well-known deficiency of deep neural networks. Larger networks are generally more robust, and ensembling is one method to increase adversarial robustness: each model's weaknesses are compensated by the strengths of others. While an ensemble uses a deterministic rule to combine model outputs, a mixture of experts (MoE) includes an additional learnable gating component that predicts weights for the outputs of the expert models, thus determining their contributions to the final prediction. MoEs have been shown to outperform ensembles on specific tasks, yet their susceptibility to adversarial attacks has not been studied yet. In this work, we evaluate the adversarial vulnerability of MoEs for semantic segmentation of urban and highway traffic scenes. We show that MoEs are, in most cases, more robust to per-instance and universal white-box adversarial attacks and can better withstand transfer attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingwen Hu, Heng Liu, Zhedong Zheng, Ping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced Image Super-Resolution (SR), but most CNN-based methods rely solely on pixel-based transformations, often leading to artifacts and blurring, particularly with severe downsampling (e.g., 8x or 16x). Recent text-guided SR methods attempt to leverage textual information for enhanced detail, but they frequently struggle with effective alignment, resulting in inconsistent semantic coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce a multi-modal semantic enhancement approach that combines textual semantics with visual features, effectively tackling semantic mismatches and detail loss in highly degraded LR images. Our proposed multi-modal collaborative framework enables the production of realistic and high-quality SR images at significant up-scaling factors. The framework integrates text and image inputs, employing a prompt predictor, Text-Image Fusion Block (TIFBlock), and Iterative Refinement Module alongside CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) features to guide a progressive enhancement process with fine-grained alignment. This alignment produces high-resolution outputs with crisp details and semantic coherence, even at large scaling factors. Through extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies, we validate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, by incorporating textual semantic guidance, our technique enables a degree of super-resolution editability while maintaining semantic coherence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxiao Fan, Kan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Noisy labels can negatively impact the performance of deep neural networks. One common solution is label refurbishment, which involves reconstructing noisy labels through predictions and distributions. However, these methods may introduce problematic semantic associations, a phenomenon that we identify as Semantic Contamination. Through an analysis of Robust LR, a representative label refurbishment method, we found that utilizing the logits of views for refurbishment does not adequately balance the semantic information of individual classes. Conversely, using the logits of models fails to maintain consistent semantic relationships across models, which explains why label refurbishment methods frequently encounter issues related to Semantic Contamination. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Collaborative Cross Learning, which utilizes semi-supervised learning on refurbished labels to extract appropriate semantic associations from embeddings across views and models. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets, effectively mitigating the impact of label noise and Semantic Contamination.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in procedural tasks, but the potential of multimodal instructions augmented by texts and videos to assist users remains under-explored. To address this gap, we propose the Visually Grounded Text-Video Prompting (VG-TVP) method which is a novel LLM-empowered Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) framework. It generates cohesive text and video procedural plans given a specified high-level objective. The main challenges are achieving textual and visual informativeness, temporal coherence, and accuracy in procedural plans. VG-TVP leverages the zero-shot reasoning capability of LLMs, the video-to-text generation ability of the video captioning models, and the text-to-video generation ability of diffusion models. VG-TVP improves the interaction between modalities by proposing a novel Fusion of Captioning (FoC) method and using Text-to-Video Bridge (T2V-B) and Video-to-Text Bridge (V2T-B). They allow LLMs to guide the generation of visually-grounded text plans and textual-grounded video plans. To address the scarcity of datasets suitable for MPP, we have curated a new dataset called Daily-Life Task Procedural Plans (Daily-PP). We conduct comprehensive experiments and benchmarks to evaluate human preferences (regarding textual and visual informativeness, temporal coherence, and plan accuracy). Our VG-TVP method outperforms unimodal baselines on the Daily-PP dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Historical documents encompass a wealth of cultural treasures but suffer from severe damages including character missing, paper damage, and ink erosion over time. However, existing document processing methods primarily focus on binarization, enhancement, etc., neglecting the repair of these damages. To this end, we present a new task, termed Historical Document Repair (HDR), which aims to predict the original appearance of damaged historical documents. To fill the gap in this field, we propose a large-scale dataset HDR28K and a diffusion-based network DiffHDR for historical document repair. Specifically, HDR28K contains 28,552 damaged-repaired image pairs with character-level annotations and multi-style degradations. Moreover, DiffHDR augments the vanilla diffusion framework with semantic and spatial information and a meticulously designed character perceptual loss for contextual and visual coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DiffHDR trained using HDR28K significantly surpasses existing approaches and exhibits remarkable performance in handling real damaged documents. Notably, DiffHDR can also be extended to document editing and text block generation, showcasing its high flexibility and generalization capacity. We believe this study could pioneer a new direction of document processing and contribute to the inheritance of invaluable cultures and civilizations.

<p>Abstract: Recently, zero-shot methods like InstantID have revolutionized identity-preserving generation. Unlike multi-image finetuning approaches such as DreamBooth, these zero-shot methods leverage powerful facial encoders to extract identity information from a single portrait photo, enabling efficient identity-preserving generation through a single inference pass. However, this convenience introduces new threats to the facial identity protection. This paper aims to safeguard portrait photos from unauthorized encoder-based customization. We introduce IDProtector, an adversarial noise encoder that applies imperceptible adversarial noise to portrait photos in a single forward pass. Our approach offers universal protection for portraits against multiple state-of-the-art encoder-based methods, including InstantID, IP-Adapter, and PhotoMaker, while ensuring robustness to common image transformations such as JPEG compression, resizing, and affine transformations. Experiments across diverse portrait datasets and generative models reveal that IDProtector generalizes effectively to unseen data and even closed-source proprietary models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhang, Weiquan Yan, Yun Zhao, Wenxiang Cheng, Gang Chen, Huihui Zhou, Yonghong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuromorphic vision sensors, such as the dynamic vision sensor (DVS) and spike camera, have gained increasing attention in recent years. The spike camera can detect fine textures by mimicking the fovea in the human visual system, and output a high-frequency spike stream. Real-time high-quality vision reconstruction from the spike stream can build a bridge to high-level vision task applications of the spike camera. To realize high-speed and high-quality vision reconstruction of the spike camera, we propose a new spike stability theorem that reveals the relationship between spike stream characteristics and stable light intensity. Based on the spike stability theorem, two parameter-free algorithms are designed for the real-time vision reconstruction of the spike camera. To demonstrate the performances of our algorithms, two datasets (a public dataset PKU-Spike-High-Speed and a newly constructed dataset SpikeCityPCL) are used to compare the reconstruction quality and speed of various reconstruction methods. Experimental results show that, compared with the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction methods, our reconstruction methods obtain the best tradeoff between the reconstruction quality and speed. Additionally, we design the FPGA implementation method of our algorithms to realize the real-time (running at 20,000 FPS) visual reconstruction. Our work provides new theorem and algorithm foundations for the real-time edge-end vision processing of the spike camera.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixuan Wang, Lin Qi, Shiyu Qin, Kai Luo, Yakun Ju, Xia Li, Junyu Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Photometric stereo (PS) endeavors to ascertain surface normals using shading clues from photometric images under various illuminations. Recent deep learning-based PS methods often overlook the complexity of object surfaces. These neural network models, which exclusively rely on photometric images for training, often produce blurred results in high-frequency regions characterized by local discontinuities, such as wrinkles and edges with significant gradient changes. To address this, we propose the Image Gradient-Aided Photometric Stereo Network (IGA-PSN), a dual-branch framework extracting features from both photometric images and their gradients. Furthermore, we incorporate an hourglass regression network along with supervision to regularize normal regression. Experiments on DiLiGenT benchmarks show that IGA-PSN outperforms previous methods in surface normal estimation, achieving a mean angular error of 6.46 while preserving textures and geometric shapes in complex regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Glattki, Nikhil Kapila, Tejas Rathi</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the standard for image classification tasks for a long time, but more recently attention-based mechanisms have gained traction. This project aims to compare traditional CNNs with attention-augmented CNNs across an image classification task. By evaluating and comparing their performance, accuracy and computational efficiency, the project will highlight benefits and trade-off of the localized feature extraction of traditional CNNs and the global context capture in attention-augmented CNNs. By doing this, we can reveal further insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses, guide the selection of models based on specific application needs and ultimately, enhance understanding of these architectures in the deep learning community.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Tzelepi, Vasileios Mezaris</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we deal with image classification tasks using the powerful CLIP vision-language model. Our goal is to advance the classification performance using the CLIP's image encoder, by proposing a novel Large Multimodal Model (LMM) based regularization method. The proposed method uses an LMM to extract semantic descriptions for the images of the dataset. Then, it uses the CLIP's text encoder, frozen, in order to obtain the corresponding text embeddings and compute the mean semantic class descriptions. Subsequently, we adapt the CLIP's image encoder by adding a classification head, and we train it along with the image encoder output, apart from the main classification objective, with an additional auxiliary objective. The additional objective forces the embeddings at the image encoder's output to become similar to their corresponding LMM-generated mean semantic class descriptions. In this way, it produces embeddings with enhanced discrimination ability, leading to improved classification performance. The effectiveness of the proposed regularization method is validated through extensive experiments on three image classification datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11668">Online Writer Retrieval with Chinese Handwritten Phrases: A Synergistic Temporal-Frequency Representation Learning Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peirong Zhang, Lianwen Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, the prevalence of online handwriting has spurred a critical need for effective retrieval systems to accurately search relevant handwriting instances from specific writers, known as online writer retrieval. Despite the growing demand, this field suffers from a scarcity of well-established methodologies and public large-scale datasets. This paper tackles these challenges with a focus on Chinese handwritten phrases. First, we propose DOLPHIN, a novel retrieval model designed to enhance handwriting representations through synergistic temporal-frequency analysis. For frequency feature learning, we propose the HFGA block, which performs gated cross-attention between the vanilla temporal handwriting sequence and its high-frequency sub-bands to amplify salient writing details. For temporal feature learning, we propose the CAIR block, tailored to promote channel interaction and reduce channel redundancy. Second, to address data deficit, we introduce OLIWER, a large-scale online writer retrieval dataset encompassing over 670,000 Chinese handwritten phrases from 1,731 individuals. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the superior performance of DOLPHIN over existing methods. In addition, we explore cross-domain writer retrieval and reveal the pivotal role of increasing feature alignment in bridging the distributional gap between different handwriting data. Our findings emphasize the significance of point sampling frequency and pressure features in improving handwriting representation quality and retrieval performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Efstathios Karypidis, Ioannis Kakogeorgiou, Spyros Gidaris, Nikos Komodakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting future dynamics is crucial for applications like autonomous driving and robotics, where understanding the environment is key. Existing pixel-level methods are computationally expensive and often focus on irrelevant details. To address these challenges, we introduce $\texttt{DINO-Foresight}$, a novel framework that operates in the semantic feature space of pretrained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Our approach trains a masked feature transformer in a self-supervised manner to predict the evolution of VFM features over time. By forecasting these features, we can apply off-the-shelf, task-specific heads for various scene understanding tasks. In this framework, VFM features are treated as a latent space, to which different heads attach to perform specific tasks for future-frame analysis. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its robustness and scalability. Additionally, we highlight how intermediate transformer representations in $\texttt{DINO-Foresight}$ improve downstream task performance, offering a promising path for the self-supervised enhancement of VFM features. We provide the implementation code at https://github.com/Sta8is/DINO-Foresight .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Fang, Ke Ye, Yaofang Liu, Gongzhe Li, Xianhong Zhao, Jialong Li, Ruxin Wang, Yuchen Zhang, Xiangyang Ji, Qilin Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Point clouds or depth images captured by current RGB-D cameras often suffer from low resolution, rendering them insufficient for applications such as 3D reconstruction and robots. Existing point cloud super-resolution (PCSR) methods are either constrained by geometric artifacts or lack attention to edge details. To address these issues, we propose an edge-guided geometric-preserving 3D point cloud super-resolution (EGP3D) method tailored for RGB-D cameras. Our approach innovatively optimizes the point cloud with an edge constraint on a projected 2D space, thereby ensuring high-quality edge preservation in the 3D PCSR task. To tackle geometric optimization challenges in super-resolution point clouds, particularly preserving edge shapes and smoothness, we introduce a multi-faceted loss function that simultaneously optimizes the Chamfer distance, Hausdorff distance, and gradient smoothness. Existing datasets used for point cloud upsampling are predominantly synthetic and inadequately represent real-world scenarios, neglecting noise and stray light effects. To address the scarcity of realistic RGB-D data for PCSR tasks, we built a dataset that captures real-world noise and stray-light effects, offering a more accurate representation of authentic environments. Validated through simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed method exhibited superior performance in preserving edge clarity and geometric details.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingchi Chen, Zhuoran Zheng, Xuerui Li, Yuying Chen, Shu Wang, Wenqi Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: With the continuous improvement of device imaging resolution, the popularity of Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images is increasing. Unfortunately, existing methods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for low-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality UHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of extremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for processing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to achieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single consumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our approach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input sequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data stream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV cache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for attention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the device. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our method maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic multi-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Sun, Rong-Cheng Tu, Jingyi Liao, Zhao Jin, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated significant potential for generating high-fidelity videos but are computationally intensive. Existing acceleration methods include distillation, which requires costly retraining, and feature caching, which is highly sensitive to network architecture. Recent token reduction methods are training-free and architecture-agnostic, offering greater flexibility and wider applicability. However, they enforce the same sequence length across different components, constraining their acceleration potential. We observe that intra-sequence redundancy in video DiTs varies across features, blocks, and denoising timesteps. Building on this observation, we propose Asymmetric Reduction and Restoration (AsymRnR), a training-free approach to accelerate video DiTs. It offers a flexible and adaptive strategy that reduces the number of tokens based on their redundancy to enhance both acceleration and generation quality. We further propose matching cache to facilitate faster processing. Integrated into state-of-the-art video DiTs, AsymRnR achieves a superior speedup without compromising the quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanzhi Wang, Yong Li, Mengyi Liu, Xiaoya Zhang, Xin Liu, Zhen Cui, Antoni B. Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Editing videos with textual guidance has garnered popularity due to its streamlined process which mandates users to solely edit the text prompt corresponding to the source video. Recent studies have explored and exploited large-scale text-to-image diffusion models for text-guided video editing, resulting in remarkable video editing capabilities. However, they may still suffer from some limitations such as mislocated objects, incorrect number of objects. Therefore, the controllability of video editing remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we aim to challenge the above limitations by proposing a Re-Attentional Controllable Video Diffusion Editing (ReAtCo) method. Specially, to align the spatial placement of the target objects with the edited text prompt in a training-free manner, we propose a Re-Attentional Diffusion (RAD) to refocus the cross-attention activation responses between the edited text prompt and the target video during the denoising stage, resulting in a spatially location-aligned and semantically high-fidelity manipulated video. In particular, to faithfully preserve the invariant region content with less border artifacts, we propose an Invariant Region-guided Joint Sampling (IRJS) strategy to mitigate the intrinsic sampling errors w.r.t the invariant regions at each denoising timestep and constrain the generated content to be harmonized with the invariant region content. Experimental results verify that ReAtCo consistently improves the controllability of video diffusion editing and achieves superior video editing performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> RunLin Yu, Yipu Gong, Wenrui Li, Aiwen Sun, Mengren Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) has attracted significant attention for its ability to identify unseen classes and perform well in video classification tasks. However, modal imbalance in (G)ZSL leads to over-reliance on the optimal modality, reducing discriminative capabilities for unseen classes. Some studies have attempted to address this issue by modifying parameter gradients, but two challenges still remain: (a) Quality discrepancies, where modalities offer differing quantities and qualities of information for the same concept. (b) Content discrepancies, where sample contributions within a modality vary significantly. To address these challenges, we propose a Discrepancy-Aware Attention Network (DAAN) for Enhanced Audio-Visual ZSL. Our approach introduces a Quality-Discrepancy Mitigation Attention (QDMA) unit to minimize redundant information in the high-quality modality and a Contrastive Sample-level Gradient Modulation (CSGM) block to adjust gradient magnitudes and balance content discrepancies. We quantify modality contributions by integrating optimization and convergence rate for more precise gradient modulation in CSGM. Experiments demonstrates DAAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of individual modules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyun Li, Zheng Zhang, Xiangyuan Lan, Dongmei Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional adversarial attacks typically produce adversarial examples under norm-constrained conditions, whereas unrestricted adversarial examples are free-form with semantically meaningful perturbations. Current unrestricted adversarial impersonation attacks exhibit limited control over adversarial face attributes and often suffer from low transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel Text Controlled Attribute Attack (TCA$^2$) to generate photorealistic adversarial impersonation faces guided by natural language. Specifically, the category-level personal softmax vector is employed to precisely guide the impersonation attacks. Additionally, we propose both data and model augmentation strategies to achieve transferable attacks on unknown target models. Finally, a generative model, \textit{i.e}, Style-GAN, is utilized to synthesize impersonated faces with desired attributes. Extensive experiments on two high-resolution face recognition datasets validate that our TCA$^2$ method can generate natural text-guided adversarial impersonation faces with high transferability. We also evaluate our method on real-world face recognition systems, \textit{i.e}, Face++ and Aliyun, further demonstrating the practical potential of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Gaussian splatting has emerged as a robust technique for representing 3D scenes, enabling real-time rasterization and high-fidelity rendering. However, Gaussians' inherent radial symmetry and smoothness constraints limit their ability to represent complex shapes, often requiring thousands of primitives to approximate detailed geometry. We introduce Deformable Radial Kernel (DRK), which extends Gaussian splatting into a more general and flexible framework. Through learnable radial bases with adjustable angles and scales, DRK efficiently models diverse shape primitives while enabling precise control over edge sharpness and boundary curvature. iven DRK's planar nature, we further develop accurate ray-primitive intersection computation for depth sorting and introduce efficient kernel culling strategies for improved rasterization efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRK outperforms existing methods in both representation efficiency and rendering quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance while dramatically reducing primitive count.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a wearable driving status recognition device and our open-source dataset, along with a new real-time method robust to changes in lighting conditions for identifying driving status from eye observations of drivers. The core of our method is generating event frames from conventional intensity frames, and the other is a newly designed Attention Driving State Network (ADSN). Compared to event cameras, conventional cameras offer complete information and lower hardware costs, enabling captured frames to encode rich spatial information. However, these textures lack temporal information, posing challenges in effectively identifying driving status. DriveGazen addresses this issue from three perspectives. First, we utilize video frames to generate realistic synthetic dynamic vision sensor (DVS) events. Second, we adopt a spiking neural network to decode pertinent temporal information. Lastly, ADSN extracts crucial spatial cues from corresponding intensity frames and conveys spatial attention to convolutional spiking layers during both training and inference through a novel guide attention module to guide the feature learning and feature enhancement of the event frame. We specifically collected the Driving Status (DriveGaze) dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we validate the superiority of the DriveGazen on the Single-eye Event-based Emotion (SEE) dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to utilize guide attention spiking neural networks and eye-based event frames generated from conventional cameras for driving status recognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Zhu, Dongwei Ren, Qilong Wang, Xiaohe Wu, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative inbetweening aims to generate intermediate frame sequences by utilizing two key frames as input. Although remarkable progress has been made in video generation models, generative inbetweening still faces challenges in maintaining temporal stability due to the ambiguous interpolation path between two key frames. This issue becomes particularly severe when there is a large motion gap between input frames. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective Frame-wise Conditions-driven Video Generation (FCVG) method that significantly enhances the temporal stability of interpolated video frames. Specifically, our FCVG provides an explicit condition for each frame, making it much easier to identify the interpolation path between two input frames and thus ensuring temporally stable production of visually plausible video frames. To achieve this, we suggest extracting matched lines from two input frames that can then be easily interpolated frame by frame, serving as frame-wise conditions seamlessly integrated into existing video generation models. In extensive evaluations covering diverse scenarios such as natural landscapes, complex human poses, camera movements and animations, existing methods often exhibit incoherent transitions across frames. In contrast, our FCVG demonstrates the capability to generate temporally stable videos using both linear and non-linear interpolation curves.

<p>Abstract: We present GS-ProCams, the first Gaussian Splatting-based framework for projector-camera systems (ProCams). GS-ProCams significantly enhances the efficiency of projection mapping (PM) that requires establishing geometric and radiometric mappings between the projector and the camera. Previous CNN-based ProCams are constrained to a specific viewpoint, limiting their applicability to novel perspectives. In contrast, NeRF-based ProCams support view-agnostic projection mapping, however, they require an additional colocated light source and demand significant computational and memory resources. To address this issue, we propose GS-ProCams that employs 2D Gaussian for scene representations, and enables efficient view-agnostic ProCams applications. In particular, we explicitly model the complex geometric and photometric mappings of ProCams using projector responses, the target surface's geometry and materials represented by Gaussians, and global illumination component. Then, we employ differentiable physically-based rendering to jointly estimate them from captured multi-view projections. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, our GS-ProCams eliminates the need for additional devices, achieving superior ProCams simulation quality. It is also 600 times faster and uses only 1/10 of the GPU memory.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world design tasks - such as picture book creation, film storyboard development using character sets, photo retouching, visual effects, and font transfer - are highly diverse and complex, requiring deep interpretation and extraction of various elements from instructions, descriptions, and reference images. The resulting images often implicitly capture key features from references or user inputs, making it challenging to develop models that can effectively address such varied tasks. While existing visual generative models can produce high-quality images based on prompts, they face significant limitations in professional design scenarios that involve varied forms and multiple inputs and outputs, even when enhanced with adapters like ControlNets and LoRAs. To address this, we introduce IDEA-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing 100 real-world design tasks, including rendering, visual effects, storyboarding, picture books, fonts, style-based, and identity-preserving generation, with 275 test cases to thoroughly evaluate a model's general-purpose generation capabilities. Notably, even the best-performing model only achieves 22.48 on IDEA-Bench, while the best general-purpose model only achieves 6.81. We provide a detailed analysis of these results, highlighting the inherent challenges and providing actionable directions for improvement. Additionally, we provide a subset of 18 representative tasks equipped with multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auto-evaluation techniques to facilitate rapid model development and comparison. We releases the benchmark data, evaluation toolkits, and an online leaderboard at https://github.com/ali-vilab/IDEA-Bench, aiming to drive the advancement of generative models toward more versatile and applicable intelligent design systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eren Onaran, Erdi Sar{\i}ta\c{s}, Haz{\i}m Kemal Ekenel</p>
<p>Abstract: Face alignment is a crucial step in preparing face images for feature extraction in facial analysis tasks. For applications such as face recognition, facial expression recognition, and facial attribute classification, alignment is widely utilized during both training and inference to standardize the positions of key landmarks in the face. It is well known that the application and method of face alignment significantly affect the performance of facial analysis models. However, the impact of alignment on face image quality has not been thoroughly investigated. Current FIQA studies often assume alignment as a prerequisite but do not explicitly evaluate how alignment affects quality metrics, especially with the advent of modern deep learning-based detectors that integrate detection and landmark localization. To address this need, our study examines the impact of face alignment on face image quality scores. We conducted experiments on the LFW, IJB-B, and SCFace datasets, employing MTCNN and RetinaFace models for face detection and alignment. To evaluate face image quality, we utilized several assessment methods, including SER-FIQ, FaceQAN, DifFIQA, and SDD-FIQA. Our analysis included examining quality score distributions for the LFW and IJB-B datasets and analyzing average quality scores at varying distances in the SCFace dataset. Our findings reveal that face image quality assessment methods are sensitive to alignment. Moreover, this sensitivity increases under challenging real-life conditions, highlighting the importance of evaluating alignment's role in quality assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rick Akkerman, Haiwen Feng, Michael J. Black, Dimitrios Tzionas, Victoria Fern\'andez Abrevaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the dynamics of interacting objects is essential for both humans and intelligent systems. However, existing approaches are limited to simplified, toy settings and lack generalizability to complex, real-world environments. Recent advances in generative models have enabled the prediction of state transitions based on interventions, but focus on generating a single future state which neglects the continuous motion and subsequent dynamics resulting from the interaction. To address this gap, we propose InterDyn, a novel framework that generates videos of interactive dynamics given an initial frame and a control signal encoding the motion of a driving object or actor. Our key insight is that large video foundation models can act as both neural renderers and implicit physics simulators by learning interactive dynamics from large-scale video data. To effectively harness this capability, we introduce an interactive control mechanism that conditions the video generation process on the motion of the driving entity. Qualitative results demonstrate that InterDyn generates plausible, temporally consistent videos of complex object interactions while generalizing to unseen objects. Quantitative evaluations show that InterDyn outperforms baselines that focus on static state transitions. This work highlights the potential of leveraging video generative models as implicit physics engines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11788">Neural Collapse Inspired Knowledge Distillation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuoxi Zhang, Zijian Song, Kun He</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods have demonstrated their ability in achieving student network performance on par with their teachers. However, the knowledge gap between the teacher and student remains significant and may hinder the effectiveness of the distillation process. In this work, we introduce the structure of Neural Collapse (NC) into the KD framework. NC typically occurs in the final phase of training, resulting in a graceful geometric structure where the last-layer features form a simplex equiangular tight frame. Such phenomenon has improved the generalization of deep network training. We hypothesize that NC can also alleviate the knowledge gap in distillation, thereby enhancing student performance. This paper begins with an empirical analysis to bridge the connection between knowledge distillation and neural collapse. Through this analysis, we establish that transferring the teacher's NC structure to the student benefits the distillation process. Therefore, instead of merely transferring instance-level logits or features, as done by existing distillation methods, we encourage students to learn the teacher's NC structure. Thereby, we propose a new distillation paradigm termed Neural Collapse-inspired Knowledge Distillation (NCKD). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NCKD is simple yet effective, improving the generalization of all distilled student models and achieving state-of-the-art accuracy performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Luo, Haiming Yao, Wenyong Yu, Zhengyong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised visual anomaly detection is crucial for enhancing industrial production quality and efficiency. Among unsupervised methods, reconstruction approaches are popular due to their simplicity and effectiveness. The key aspect of reconstruction methods lies in the restoration of anomalous regions, which current methods have not satisfactorily achieved. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel \uline{A}daptive \uline{M}ask \uline{I}npainting \uline{Net}work (AMI-Net) from the perspective of adaptive mask-inpainting. In contrast to traditional reconstruction methods that treat non-semantic image pixels as targets, our method uses a pre-trained network to extract multi-scale semantic features as reconstruction targets. Given the multiscale nature of industrial defects, we incorporate a training strategy involving random positional and quantitative masking. Moreover, we propose an innovative adaptive mask generator capable of generating adaptive masks that effectively mask anomalous regions while preserving normal regions. In this manner, the model can leverage the visible normal global contextual information to restore the masked anomalous regions, thereby effectively suppressing the reconstruction of defects. Extensive experimental results on the MVTec AD and BTAD industrial datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, AMI-Net exhibits exceptional real-time performance, striking a favorable balance between detection accuracy and speed, rendering it highly suitable for industrial applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoran Xu, Jiangang Yang, Wenhui Shi, Siyuan Ding, Luqing Luo, Jian Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection~(S-DGOD) aims to train on a single source domain for robust performance across a variety of unseen target domains by taking advantage of an object detector. Existing S-DGOD approaches often rely on data augmentation strategies, including a composition of visual transformations, to enhance the detector's generalization ability. However, the absence of real-world prior knowledge hinders data augmentation from contributing to the diversity of training data distributions. To address this issue, we propose PhysAug, a novel physical model-based non-ideal imaging condition data augmentation method, to enhance the adaptability of the S-DGOD tasks. Drawing upon the principles of atmospheric optics, we develop a universal perturbation model that serves as the foundation for our proposed PhysAug. Given that visual perturbations typically arise from the interaction of light with atmospheric particles, the image frequency spectrum is harnessed to simulate real-world variations during training. This approach fosters the detector to learn domain-invariant representations, thereby enhancing its ability to generalize across various settings. Without altering the network architecture or loss function, our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art across various S-DGOD datasets. In particular, it achieves a substantial improvement of $7.3\%$ and $7.2\%$ over the baseline on DWD and Cityscape-C, highlighting its enhanced generalizability in real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianheng Qiu, Ka Lung Law, Guanghua Pan, Jufei Wang, Xin Gao, Xuan Huang, Hu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) algorithms can markedly enhance the performance of object detectors under conditions of domain shifts, thereby reducing the necessity for extensive labeling and retraining. Current domain adaptive object detection algorithms primarily cater to two-stage detectors, which tend to offer minimal improvements when directly applied to single-stage detectors such as YOLO. Intending to benefit the YOLO detector from UDA, we build a comprehensive domain adaptive architecture using a teacher-student cooperative system for the YOLO detector. In this process, we propose uncertainty learning to cope with pseudo-labeling generated by the teacher model with extreme uncertainty and leverage dynamic data augmentation to asymptotically adapt the teacher-student system to the environment. To address the inability of single-stage object detectors to align at multiple stages, we utilize a unified visual contrastive learning paradigm that aligns instance at backbone and head respectively, which steadily improves the robustness of the detectors in cross-domain tasks. In summary, we present an unsupervised domain adaptive YOLO detector based on visual contrastive learning (CLDA-YOLO), which achieves highly competitive results across multiple domain adaptive datasets without any reduction in inference speed.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11813">Designing Semi-Structured Pruning of Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-based Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hichem Sahbi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are nowadays witnessing a major success in solving many pattern recognition tasks including skeleton-based classification. The deployment of DNNs on edge-devices, endowed with limited time and memory resources, requires designing lightweight and efficient variants of these networks. Pruning is one of the lightweight network design techniques that operate by removing unnecessary network parts, in a structured or an unstructured manner, including individual weights, neurons or even entire channels. Nonetheless, structured and unstructured pruning methods, when applied separately, may either be inefficient or ineffective. In this paper, we devise a novel semi-structured method that discards the downsides of structured and unstructured pruning while gathering their upsides to some extent. The proposed solution is based on a differentiable cascaded parametrization which combines (i) a band-stop mechanism that prunes weights depending on their magnitudes, (ii) a weight-sharing parametrization that prunes connections either individually or group-wise, and (iii) a gating mechanism which arbitrates between different group-wise and entry-wise pruning. All these cascaded parametrizations are built upon a common latent tensor which is trained end-to-end by minimizing a classification loss and a surrogate tensor rank regularizer. Extensive experiments, conducted on the challenging tasks of action and hand-gesture recognition, show the clear advantage of our proposed semi-structured pruning approach against both structured and unstructured pruning, when taken separately, as well as the related work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Zhuang, Xuan Ju, Zhaoyang Zhang, Yong Liu, Shiyi Zhang, Chun Yuan, Ying Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic black-and-white image sequence colorization while preserving character and object identity (ID) is a complex task with significant market demand, such as in cartoon or comic series colorization. Despite advancements in visual colorization using large-scale generative models like diffusion models, challenges with controllability and identity consistency persist, making current solutions unsuitable for industrial application.To address this, we propose ColorFlow, a three-stage diffusion-based framework tailored for image sequence colorization in industrial applications. Unlike existing methods that require per-ID finetuning or explicit ID embedding extraction, we propose a novel robust and generalizable Retrieval Augmented Colorization pipeline for colorizing images with relevant color references. Our pipeline also features a dual-branch design: one branch for color identity extraction and the other for colorization, leveraging the strengths of diffusion models. We utilize the self-attention mechanism in diffusion models for strong in-context learning and color identity matching. To evaluate our model, we introduce ColorFlow-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for reference-based colorization. Results show that ColorFlow outperforms existing models across multiple metrics, setting a new standard in sequential image colorization and potentially benefiting the art industry. We release our codes and models on our project page: https://zhuang2002.github.io/ColorFlow/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ba Hung Ngo, Doanh C. Bui, Nhat-Tuong Do-Tran, Tae Jong Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The enhanced representational power and broad applicability of deep learning models have attracted significant interest from the research community in recent years. However, these models often struggle to perform effectively under domain shift conditions, where the training data (the source domain) is related to but exhibits different distributions from the testing data (the target domain). To address this challenge, previous studies have attempted to reduce the domain gap between source and target data by incorporating a few labeled target samples during training - a technique known as semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA). While this strategy has demonstrated notable improvements in classification performance, the network architectures used in these approaches primarily focus on exploiting the features of individual images, leaving room for improvement in capturing rich representations. In this study, we introduce a Hierarchical Graph of Nodes designed to simultaneously present representations at both feature and category levels. At the feature level, we introduce a local graph to identify the most relevant patches within an image, facilitating adaptability to defined main object representations. At the category level, we employ a global graph to aggregate the features from samples within the same category, thereby enriching overall representations. Extensive experiments on widely used SSDA benchmark datasets, including Office-Home, DomainNet, and VisDA2017, demonstrate that both quantitative and qualitative results substantiate the effectiveness of HiGDA, establishing it as a new state-of-the-art method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikang Chen, Tao Jiang, Xiaowan Hu, Wang Zhang, Huaqiu Li, Haoqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised video denoising aims to remove noise from videos without relying on ground truth data, leveraging the video itself to recover clean frames. Existing methods often rely on simplistic feature stacking or apply optical flow without thorough analysis. This results in suboptimal utilization of both inter-frame and intra-frame information, and it also neglects the potential of optical flow alignment under self-supervised conditions, leading to biased and insufficient denoising outcomes. To this end, we first explore the practicality of optical flow in the self-supervised setting and introduce a SpatioTemporal Blind-spot Network (STBN) for global frame feature utilization. In the temporal domain, we utilize bidirectional blind-spot feature propagation through the proposed blind-spot alignment block to ensure accurate temporal alignment and effectively capture long-range dependencies. In the spatial domain, we introduce the spatial receptive field expansion module, which enhances the receptive field and improves global perception capabilities. Additionally, to reduce the sensitivity of optical flow estimation to noise, we propose an unsupervised optical flow distillation mechanism that refines fine-grained inter-frame interactions during optical flow alignment. Our method demonstrates superior performance across both synthetic and real-world video denoising datasets. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZKCCZ/STBN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruv Sharma, Chhavi Dhiman, Dinesh Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning is the generation of natural language descriptions of images which have increased immense popularity in the recent past. With this different deep-learning techniques are devised for the development of factual and stylized image captioning models. Previous models focused more on the generation of factual and stylized captions separately providing more than one caption for a single image. The descriptions generated from these suffer from out-of-vocabulary and repetition issues. To the best of our knowledge, no such work exists that provided a description that integrates different captioning methods to describe the contents of an image with factual and stylized (romantic and humorous) elements. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel Unified Attention and Multi-Head Attention-driven Caption Summarization Transformer (UnMA-CapSumT) based Captioning Framework. It utilizes both factual captions and stylized captions generated by the Modified Adaptive Attention-based factual image captioning model (MAA-FIC) and Style Factored Bi-LSTM with attention (SF-Bi-ALSTM) driven stylized image captioning model respectively. SF-Bi-ALSTM-based stylized IC model generates two prominent styles of expression- {romance, and humor}. The proposed summarizer UnMHA-ST combines both factual and stylized descriptions of an input image to generate styled rich coherent summarized captions. The proposed UnMHA-ST transformer learns and summarizes different linguistic styles efficiently by incorporating proposed word embedding fastText with Attention Word Embedding (fTA-WE) and pointer-generator network with coverage mechanism concept to solve the out-of-vocabulary issues and repetition problem. Extensive experiments are conducted on Flickr8K and a subset of FlickrStyle10K with supporting ablation studies to prove the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite their proficiency in general tasks, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with automatic Geometry Problem Solving (GPS), which demands understanding diagrams, interpreting symbols, and performing complex reasoning. This limitation arises from their pre-training on natural images and texts, along with the lack of automated verification in the problem-solving process. Besides, current geometric specialists are limited by their task-specific designs, making them less effective for broader geometric problems. To this end, we present GeoX, a multi-modal large model focusing on geometric understanding and reasoning tasks. Given the significant differences between geometric diagram-symbol and natural image-text, we introduce unimodal pre-training to develop a diagram encoder and symbol decoder, enhancing the understanding of geometric images and corpora. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-language alignment, an effective pre-training paradigm that bridges the modality gap between unimodal geometric experts. We propose a Generator-And-Sampler Transformer (GS-Former) to generate discriminative queries and eliminate uninformative representations from unevenly distributed geometric signals. Finally, GeoX benefits from visual instruction tuning, empowering it to take geometric images and questions as input and generate verifiable solutions. Experiments show that GeoX outperforms both generalists and geometric specialists on publicly recognized benchmarks, such as GeoQA, UniGeo, Geometry3K, and PGPS9k.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11866">Event-based Motion Deblurring via Multi-Temporal Granularity Fusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaopeng Lin, Hongwei Ren, Yulong Huang, Zunchang Liu, Yue Zhou, Haotian Fu, Biao Pan, Bojun Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional frame-based cameras inevitably produce blurry effects due to motion occurring during the exposure time. Event camera, a bio-inspired sensor offering continuous visual information could enhance the deblurring performance. Effectively utilizing the high-temporal-resolution event data is crucial for extracting precise motion information and enhancing deblurring performance. However, existing event-based image deblurring methods usually utilize voxel-based event representations, losing the fine-grained temporal details that are mathematically essential for fast motion deblurring. In this paper, we first introduce point cloud-based event representation into the image deblurring task and propose a Multi-Temporal Granularity Network (MTGNet). It combines the spatially dense but temporally coarse-grained voxel-based event representation and the temporally fine-grained but spatially sparse point cloud-based event. To seamlessly integrate such complementary representations, we design a Fine-grained Point Branch. An Aggregation and Mapping Module (AMM) is proposed to align the low-level point-based features with frame-based features and an Adaptive Feature Diffusion Module (AFDM) is designed to manage the resolution discrepancies between event data and image data by enriching the sparse point feature. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian J. Maquignaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate environment maps are a key component in rendering photorealistic outdoor scenes with coherent illumination. They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but existing approaches fall short in faithfully recreating key-characteristics in physically captured HDRI. As we demonstrate, environment maps produced by sky-models do not relight scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination coherence as physically captured HDR imagery. Though the visual quality of DNN-generated LDR and HDR imagery has greatly progressed in recent years, we demonstrate this progress to be tangential to sky-modelling. Due to the Extended Dynamic Range (EDR) of 14EV required for outdoor environment maps inclusive of the sun, sky-modelling extends beyond the conventional paradigm of High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI). In this work, we propose an all-weather sky-model, learning weathered-skies directly from physically captured HDR imagery. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, our model (AllSky) allows for emulation of physically captured environment maps with improved retention of the Extended Dynamic Range (EDR) of the sky.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunxiang Fu, Meng Lou, Yizhou Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality semantic segmentation relies on three key capabilities: global context modeling, local detail encoding, and multi-scale feature extraction. However, recent methods struggle to possess all these capabilities simultaneously. Hence, we aim to empower segmentation networks to simultaneously carry out efficient global context modeling, high-quality local detail encoding, and rich multi-scale feature representation for varying input resolutions. In this paper, we introduce SegMAN, a novel linear-time model comprising a hybrid feature encoder dubbed SegMAN Encoder, and a decoder based on state space models. Specifically, the SegMAN Encoder synergistically integrates sliding local attention with dynamic state space models, enabling highly efficient global context modeling while preserving fine-grained local details. Meanwhile, the MMSCopE module in our decoder enhances multi-scale context feature extraction and adaptively scales with the input resolution. We comprehensively evaluate SegMAN on three challenging datasets: ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO-Stuff. For instance, SegMAN-B achieves 52.6% mIoU on ADE20K, outperforming SegNeXt-L by 1.6% mIoU while reducing computational complexity by over 15% GFLOPs. On Cityscapes, SegMAN-B attains 83.8% mIoU, surpassing SegFormer-B3 by 2.1% mIoU with approximately half the GFLOPs. Similarly, SegMAN-B improves upon VWFormer-B3 by 1.6% mIoU with lower GFLOPs on the COCO-Stuff dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/yunxiangfu2001/SegMAN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xilin Wang, Jia Zheng, Yuanchao Hu, Hao Zhu, Qian Yu, Zihan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present CAD2Program, a new method for reconstructing 3D parametric models from 2D CAD drawings. Our proposed method is inspired by recent successes in vision-language models (VLMs), and departs from traditional methods which rely on task-specific data representations and/or algorithms. Specifically, on the input side, we simply treat the 2D CAD drawing as a raster image, regardless of its original format, and encode the image with a standard ViT model. We show that such an encoding scheme achieves competitive performance against existing methods that operate on vector-graphics inputs, while imposing substantially fewer restrictions on the 2D drawings. On the output side, our method auto-regressively predicts a general-purpose language describing 3D parametric models in text form. Compared to other sequence modeling methods for CAD which use domain-specific sequence representations with fixed-size slots, our text-based representation is more flexible, and can be easily extended to arbitrary geometric entities and semantic or functional properties. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset of cabinet models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal punchlines, which involve humor or sarcasm conveyed in image-caption pairs, are a popular way of communication on online multimedia platforms. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), it is essential to assess their ability to effectively comprehend these punchlines. However, existing benchmarks on punchline comprehension suffer from three major limitations: 1) language shortcuts that allow models to solely rely on text, 2) lack of question diversity, and 3) narrow focus on a specific domain of multimodal content (e.g., cartoon). To address these limitations, we introduce a multimodal \textbf{Punch}line comprehension \textbf{Bench}mark, named \textbf{PunchBench}, which is tailored for accurate and comprehensive evaluation of punchline comprehension. To enhance the evaluation accuracy, we generate synonymous and antonymous captions by modifying original captions, which mitigates the impact of shortcuts in the captions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, PunchBench incorporates diverse question formats and image-captions from various domains. On this basis, we conduct extensive evaluations and reveal a significant gap between state-of-the-art MLLMs and humans in punchline comprehension. To improve punchline comprehension, we propose Simple-to-Complex Chain-of-Question (SC-CoQ) strategy, enabling the models to incrementally address complicated questions by first mastering simple ones. SC-CoQ effectively enhances the performance of various MLLMs on PunchBench, surpassing in-context learning and chain-of-thought.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pingchuan Ma, Lennart Rietdorf, Dmytro Kotovenko, Vincent Tao Hu, Bj\"orn Ommer</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately describing images via text is a foundation of explainable AI. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have recently addressed this by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, expressing semantic similarities between vision and language embeddings. VLM classification can be improved with descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it is difficult to determine the contribution of actual description semantics, as the performance gain may also stem from a semantic-agnostic ensembling effect. Considering this, we ask how to distinguish the actual discriminative power of descriptions from performance boosts that potentially rely on an ensembling effect. To study this, we propose an alternative evaluation scenario that shows a characteristic behavior if the used descriptions have discriminative power. Furthermore, we propose a training-free method to select discriminative descriptions that work independently of classname ensembling effects. The training-free method works in the following way: A test image has a local CLIP label neighborhood, i.e., its top-$k$ label predictions. Then, w.r.t. to a small selection set, we extract descriptions that distinguish each class well in the local neighborhood. Using the selected descriptions, we demonstrate improved classification accuracy across seven datasets and provide in-depth analysis and insights into the explainability of description-based image classification by VLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Drones have revolutionized various domains, including agriculture. Recent advances in deep learning have propelled among other things object detection in computer vision. This study utilized YOLO, a real-time object detector, to identify and count coconut palm trees in Ghanaian farm drone footage. The farm presented has lost track of its trees due to different planting phases. While manual counting would be very tedious and error-prone, accurately determining the number of trees is crucial for efficient planning and management of agricultural processes, especially for optimizing yields and predicting production. We assessed YOLO for palm detection within a semi-automated framework, evaluated accuracy augmentations, and pondered its potential for farmers. Data was captured in September 2022 via drones. To optimize YOLO with scarce data, synthetic images were created for model training and validation. The YOLOv7 model, pretrained on the COCO dataset (excluding coconut palms), was adapted using tailored data. Trees from footage were repositioned on synthetic images, with testing on distinct authentic images. In our experiments, we adjusted hyperparameters, improving YOLO's mean average precision (mAP). We also tested various altitudes to determine the best drone height. From an initial mAP@.5 of $0.65$, we achieved 0.88, highlighting the value of synthetic images in agricultural scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA) is a vital and intricate task that entails analyzing and assessing an image's aesthetic values, and identifying its highlights and areas for improvement. Traditional methods of IAA often concentrate on a single aesthetic task and suffer from inadequate labeled datasets, thus impairing in-depth aesthetic comprehension. Despite efforts to overcome this challenge through the application of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such models remain underdeveloped for IAA purposes. To address this, we propose a comprehensive aesthetic MLLM capable of nuanced aesthetic insight. Central to our approach is an innovative multi-scale text-guided self-supervised learning technique. This technique features a multi-scale feature alignment module and capitalizes on a wealth of unlabeled data in a self-supervised manner to structurally and functionally enhance aesthetic ability. The empirical evidence indicates that accompanied with extensive instruct-tuning, our model sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across multiple tasks, including aesthetic scoring, aesthetic commenting, and personalized image aesthetic assessment. Remarkably, it also demonstrates zero-shot learning capabilities in the emerging task of aesthetic suggesting. Furthermore, for personalized image aesthetic assessment, we harness the potential of in-context learning and showcase its inherent advantages.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11953">Reliable Breast Cancer Molecular Subtype Prediction based on uncertainty-aware Bayesian Deep Learning by Mammography</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohaddeseh Chegini, Ali Mahloojifar</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with different molecular subtypes, clinical behavior, treatment responses as well as survival outcomes. The development of a reliable, accurate, available and inexpensive method to predict the molecular subtypes using medical images plays an important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. Recently, deep learning methods have shown good performance in the breast cancer classification tasks using various medical images. Despite all that success, classical deep learning cannot deliver the predictive uncertainty. The uncertainty represents the validity of the predictions.Therefore, the high predicted uncertainty might cause a negative effect in the accurate diagnosis of breast cancer molecular subtypes. To overcome this, uncertainty quantification methods are used to determine the predictive uncertainty. Accordingly, in this study, we proposed an uncertainty-aware Bayesian deep learning model using the full mammogram images. In addition, to increase the performance of the multi-class molecular subtype classification task, we proposed a novel hierarchical classification strategy, named the two-stage classification strategy. The separate AUC of the proposed model for each subtype was 0.71, 0.75 and 0.86 for HER2-enriched, luminal and triple-negative classes, respectively. The proposed model not only has a comparable performance to other studies in the field of breast cancer molecular subtypes prediction, even using full mammography images, but it is also more reliable, due to quantify the predictive uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giordano Cicchetti, Eleonora Grassucci, Luigi Sigillo, Danilo Comminiello</p>
<p>Abstract: Human perception integrates multiple modalities, such as vision, hearing, and language, into a unified understanding of the surrounding reality. While recent multimodal models have achieved significant progress by aligning pairs of modalities via contrastive learning, their solutions are unsuitable when scaling to multiple modalities. These models typically align each modality to a designated anchor without ensuring the alignment of all modalities with each other, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring a joint understanding of multiple modalities. In this paper, we structurally rethink the pairwise conventional approach to multimodal learning and we present the novel Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM), which overcomes the above-mentioned limitations. GRAM learns and then aligns $n$ modalities directly in the higher-dimensional space in which modality embeddings lie by minimizing the Gramian volume of the $k$-dimensional parallelotope spanned by the modality vectors, ensuring the geometric alignment of all modalities simultaneously. GRAM can replace cosine similarity in any downstream method, holding for 2 to $n$ modality and providing more meaningful alignment with respect to previous similarity measures. The novel GRAM-based contrastive loss function enhances the alignment of multimodal models in the higher-dimensional embedding space, leading to new state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as video-audio-text retrieval and audio-video classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Onur Tasar, Cl\'ement Chadebec, Benjamin Aubin</p>
<p>Abstract: Realistic shadow generation is a critical component for high-quality image compositing and visual effects, yet existing methods suffer from certain limitations: Physics-based approaches require a 3D scene geometry, which is often unavailable, while learning-based techniques struggle with control and visual artifacts. We introduce a novel method for fast, controllable, and background-free shadow generation for 2D object images. We create a large synthetic dataset using a 3D rendering engine to train a diffusion model for controllable shadow generation, generating shadow maps for diverse light source parameters. Through extensive ablation studies, we find that rectified flow objective achieves high-quality results with just a single sampling step enabling real-time applications. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the model generalizes well to real-world images. To facilitate further research in evaluating quality and controllability in shadow generation, we release a new public benchmark containing a diverse set of object images and shadow maps in various settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Savinay Nagendra, Kashif Rashid, Chaopeng Shen, Daniel Kifer</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot segmentation is the problem of learning to identify specific types of objects (e.g., airplanes) in images from a small set of labeled reference images. The current state of the art is driven by resource-intensive construction of models for every new domain-specific application. Such models must be trained on enormous labeled datasets of unrelated objects (e.g., cars, trains, animals) so that their ``knowledge'' can be transferred to new types of objects. In this paper, we show how to leverage existing vision foundation models (VFMs) to reduce the incremental cost of creating few-shot segmentation models for new domains. Specifically, we introduce SAMIC, a small network that learns how to prompt VFMs in order to segment new types of objects in domain-specific applications. SAMIC enables any task to be approached as a few-shot learning problem. At 2.6 million parameters, it is 94% smaller than the leading models (e.g., having ResNet 101 backbone with 45+ million parameters). Even using 1/5th of the training data provided by one-shot benchmarks, SAMIC is competitive with, or sets the state of the art, on a variety of few-shot and semantic segmentation datasets including COCO-$20^i$, Pascal-$5^i$, PerSeg, FSS-1000, and NWPU VHR-10.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zhang, Xun Gong, Zhonglin Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Face recognition has made remarkable strides, driven by the expanding scale of datasets, advancements in various backbone and discriminative losses. However, face recognition performance is heavily affected by the label noise, especially closed-set noise. While numerous studies have focused on handling label noise, addressing closed-set noise still poses challenges. This paper identifies this challenge as training isn't robust to noise at the early-stage training, and necessitating an appropriate learning strategy for samples with low confidence, which are often misclassified as closed-set noise in later training phases. To address these issues, we propose a new framework to stabilize the training at early stages and split the samples into clean, ambiguous and noisy groups which are devised with separate training strategies. Initially, we employ generated auxiliary closed-set noisy samples to enable the model to identify noisy data at the early stages of training. Subsequently, we introduce how samples are split into clean, ambiguous and noisy groups by their similarity to the positive and nearest negative centers. Then we perform label fusion for ambiguous samples by incorporating accumulated model predictions. Finally, we apply label smoothing within the closed set, adjusting the label to a point between the nearest negative class and the initially assigned label. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method on mainstream face datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaojian Wang, Feng Lin, Tong Wu, Zhenguang Liu, Zhongjie Ba, Kui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: This work asks: with abundant, unlabeled real faces, how to learn a robust and transferable facial representation that boosts various face security tasks with respect to generalization performance? We make the first attempt and propose a self-supervised pretraining framework to learn fundamental representations of real face images, FSFM, that leverages the synergy between masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID). We explore various facial masking strategies for MIM and present a simple yet powerful CRFR-P masking, which explicitly forces the model to capture meaningful intra-region consistency and challenging inter-region coherency. Furthermore, we devise the ID network that naturally couples with MIM to establish underlying local-to-global correspondence via tailored self-distillation. These three learning objectives, namely 3C, empower encoding both local features and global semantics of real faces. After pretraining, a vanilla ViT serves as a universal vision foundation model for downstream face security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forgery detection. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets demonstrate that our model transfers better than supervised pretraining, visual and facial self-supervised learning arts, and even outperforms task-specialized SOTA methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) have made text-to-image generation and customization widely accessible, with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) able to replicate an artist's style or subject using minimal data and computation. In this paper, we examine the relationship between LoRA weights and artistic styles, demonstrating that LoRA weights alone can serve as an effective descriptor of style, without the need for additional image generation or knowledge of the original training set. Our findings show that LoRA weights yield better performance in clustering of artistic styles compared to traditional pre-trained features, such as CLIP and DINO, with strong structural similarities between LoRA-based and conventional image-based embeddings observed both qualitatively and quantitatively. We identify various retrieval scenarios for the growing collection of customized models and show that our approach enables more accurate retrieval in real-world settings where knowledge of the training images is unavailable and additional generation is required. We conclude with a discussion on potential future applications, such as zero-shot LoRA fine-tuning and model attribution.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12050">Exploring Semantic Consistency and Style Diversity for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Niu, Linhuang Xie, Jianghang Lin, Shengchuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) seeks to utilize source domain data exclusively to enhance the generalization of semantic segmentation across unknown target domains. Prevailing studies predominantly concentrate on feature normalization and domain randomization, these approaches exhibit significant limitations. Feature normalization-based methods tend to confuse semantic features in the process of constraining the feature space distribution, resulting in classification misjudgment. Domain randomization-based methods frequently incorporate domain-irrelevant noise due to the uncontrollability of style transformations, resulting in segmentation ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, named SCSD for Semantic Consistency prediction and Style Diversity generalization. It comprises three pivotal components: Firstly, a Semantic Query Booster is designed to enhance the semantic awareness and discrimination capabilities of object queries in the mask decoder, enabling cross-domain semantic consistency prediction. Secondly, we develop a Text-Driven Style Transform module that utilizes domain difference text embeddings to controllably guide the style transformation of image features, thereby increasing inter-domain style diversity. Lastly, to prevent the collapse of similar domain feature spaces, we introduce a Style Synergy Optimization mechanism that fortifies the separation of inter-domain features and the aggregation of intra-domain features by synergistically weighting style contrastive loss and style aggregation loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SCSD significantly outperforms existing state-of-theart methods. Notably, SCSD trained on GTAV achieved an average of 49.11 mIoU on the four unseen domain datasets, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method by +4.08 mIoU.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangzhou Lin, Shang Gao, Yichuan Tang, Xihan Ma, Ryo Murakami, Ziming Zhang, John D. Obayemic, Winston W. Soboyejo, Haichong K. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) imaging uses multiple wavelengths to differentiate chromophores based on their unique optical absorption spectra. This technique has been widely applied in areas such as vascular mapping, tumor detection, and therapeutic monitoring. However, sPA imaging is highly susceptible to noise, leading to poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and compromised image quality. Traditional denoising techniques like frame averaging, though effective in improving SNR, can be impractical for dynamic imaging scenarios due to reduced frame rates. Advanced methods, including learning-based approaches and analytical algorithms, have demonstrated promise but often require extensive training data and parameter tuning, limiting their adaptability for real-time clinical use. In this work, we propose a sPA denoising using a tuning-free analytical and data-free enhancement (SPADE) framework for denoising sPA images. This framework integrates a data-free learning-based method with an efficient BM3D-based analytical approach while preserves spectral linearity, providing noise reduction and ensuring that functional information is maintained. The SPADE framework was validated through simulation, phantom, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments. Results demonstrated that SPADE improved SNR and preserved spectral information, outperforming conventional methods, especially in challenging imaging conditions. SPADE presents a promising solution for enhancing sPA imaging quality in clinical applications where noise reduction and spectral preservation are critical.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12075">CG-Bench: Clue-grounded Question Answering Benchmark for Long Video Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guo Chen, Yicheng Liu, Yifei Huang, Yuping He, Baoqi Pei, Jilan Xu, Yali Wang, Tong Lu, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing video understanding benchmarks for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) focus only on short videos. The limited number of benchmarks for long video understanding often rely solely on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, because of the inherent limitation of MCQ-based evaluation and the increasing reasoning ability of MLLMs, models can give the current answer purely by combining short video understanding with elimination, without genuinely understanding the video content. To address this gap, we introduce CG-Bench, a novel benchmark designed for clue-grounded question answering in long videos. CG-Bench emphasizes the model's ability to retrieve relevant clues for questions, enhancing evaluation credibility. It features 1,219 manually curated videos categorized by a granular system with 14 primary categories, 171 secondary categories, and 638 tertiary categories, making it the largest benchmark for long video analysis. The benchmark includes 12,129 QA pairs in three major question types: perception, reasoning, and hallucination. Compensating the drawbacks of pure MCQ-based evaluation, we design two novel clue-based evaluation methods: clue-grounded white box and black box evaluations, to assess whether the model generates answers based on the correct understanding of the video. We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source MLLMs on CG-Bench. Results indicate that current models significantly underperform in understanding long videos compared to short ones, and a significant gap exists between open-source and commercial models. We hope CG-Bench can advance the development of more trustworthy and capable MLLMs for long video understanding.

<p>Abstract: The emergence of large multimodal models (LMMs) has brought significant advancements to pathology. Previous research has primarily focused on separately training patch-level and whole-slide image (WSI)-level models, limiting the integration of learned knowledge across patches and WSIs, and resulting in redundant models. In this work, we introduce CPath-Omni, the first 15-billion-parameter LMM designed to unify both patch and WSI level image analysis, consolidating a variety of tasks at both levels, including classification, visual question answering, captioning, and visual referring prompting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPath-Omni achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across seven diverse tasks on 39 out of 42 datasets, outperforming or matching task-specific models trained for individual tasks. Additionally, we develop a specialized pathology CLIP-based visual processor for CPath-Omni, CPath-CLIP, which, for the first time, integrates different vision models and incorporates a large language model as a text encoder to build a more powerful CLIP model, which achieves SOTA performance on nine zero-shot and four few-shot datasets. Our findings highlight CPath-Omni's ability to unify diverse pathology tasks, demonstrating its potential to streamline and advance the field of foundation model in pathology.</p>

<p>Abstract: To date, most place recognition methods focus on single-modality retrieval. While they perform well in specific environments, cross-modal methods offer greater flexibility by allowing seamless switching between map and query sources. It also promises to reduce computation requirements by having a unified model, and achieving greater sample efficiency by sharing parameters. In this work, we develop a universal solution to place recognition, UniLoc, that works with any single query modality (natural language, image, or point cloud). UniLoc leverages recent advances in large-scale contrastive learning, and learns by matching hierarchically at two levels: instance-level matching and scene-level matching. Specifically, we propose a novel Self-Attention based Pooling (SAP) module to evaluate the importance of instance descriptors when aggregated into a place-level descriptor. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate the benefits of cross-modality for place recognition, achieving superior performance in cross-modal settings and competitive results also for uni-modal scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Capturing geometric and material information from images remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Traditional optimization-based methods often require hours of computational time to reconstruct geometry, material properties, and environmental lighting from dense multi-view inputs, while still struggling with inherent ambiguities between lighting and material. On the other hand, learning-based approaches leverage rich material priors from existing 3D object datasets but face challenges with maintaining multi-view consistency. In this paper, we introduce IDArb, a diffusion-based model designed to perform intrinsic decomposition on an arbitrary number of images under varying illuminations. Our method achieves accurate and multi-view consistent estimation on surface normals and material properties. This is made possible through a novel cross-view, cross-domain attention module and an illumination-augmented, view-adaptive training strategy. Additionally, we introduce ARB-Objaverse, a new dataset that provides large-scale multi-view intrinsic data and renderings under diverse lighting conditions, supporting robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IDArb outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, our approach facilitates a range of downstream tasks, including single-image relighting, photometric stereo, and 3D reconstruction, highlighting its broad applications in realistic 3D content creation.</p>

Using this approach, we create a new dataset to train InstructMove, a model capable of instruction-based complex manipulations that are difficult to achieve with synthetically generated datasets.

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses a challenging question: How can we efficiently create high-quality, wide-scope 3D scenes from a single arbitrary image? Existing methods face several constraints, such as requiring multi-view data, time-consuming per-scene optimization, low visual quality in backgrounds, and distorted reconstructions in unseen areas. We propose a novel pipeline to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale reconstruction model that uses latents from a video diffusion model to predict 3D Gaussian Splattings for the scenes in a feed-forward manner. The video diffusion model is designed to create videos precisely following specified camera trajectories, allowing it to generate compressed video latents that contain multi-view information while maintaining 3D consistency. We train the 3D reconstruction model to operate on the video latent space with a progressive training strategy, enabling the efficient generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes. Extensive evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods for single-view 3D scene generation, particularly with out-of-domain images. For the first time, we demonstrate that a 3D reconstruction model can be effectively built upon the latent space of a diffusion model to realize efficient 3D scene generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Taubner, Ruihang Zhang, Mathieu Tuli, David B. Lindell</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing photorealistic and dynamic portrait avatars from images is essential to many applications including advertising, visual effects, and virtual reality. Depending on the application, avatar reconstruction involves different capture setups and constraints $-$ for example, visual effects studios use camera arrays to capture hundreds of reference images, while content creators may seek to animate a single portrait image downloaded from the internet. As such, there is a large and heterogeneous ecosystem of methods for avatar reconstruction. Techniques based on multi-view stereo or neural rendering achieve the highest quality results, but require hundreds of reference images. Recent generative models produce convincing avatars from a single reference image, but visual fidelity yet lags behind multi-view techniques. Here, we present CAP4D: an approach that uses a morphable multi-view diffusion model to reconstruct photoreal 4D (dynamic 3D) portrait avatars from any number of reference images (i.e., one to 100) and animate and render them in real time. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for single-, few-, and multi-image 4D portrait avatar reconstruction, and takes steps to bridge the gap in visual fidelity between single-image and multi-view reconstruction techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Causal Diffusion as the autoregressive (AR) counterpart of Diffusion models. It is a next-token(s) forecasting framework that is friendly to both discrete and continuous modalities and compatible with existing next-token prediction models like LLaMA and GPT. While recent works attempt to combine diffusion with AR models, we show that introducing sequential factorization to a diffusion model can substantially improve its performance and enables a smooth transition between AR and diffusion generation modes. Hence, we propose CausalFusion - a decoder-only transformer that dual-factorizes data across sequential tokens and diffusion noise levels, leading to state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet generation benchmark while also enjoying the AR advantage of generating an arbitrary number of tokens for in-context reasoning. We further demonstrate CausalFusion's multimodal capabilities through a joint image generation and captioning model, and showcase CausalFusion's ability for zero-shot in-context image manipulations. We hope that this work could provide the community with a fresh perspective on training multimodal models over discrete and continuous data.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advent of portable 360{\deg} cameras, panorama has gained significant attention in applications like virtual reality (VR), virtual tours, robotics, and autonomous driving. As a result, wide-baseline panorama view synthesis has emerged as a vital task, where high resolution, fast inference, and memory efficiency are essential. Nevertheless, existing methods are typically constrained to lower resolutions (512 $\times$ 1024) due to demanding memory and computational requirements. In this paper, we present PanSplat, a generalizable, feed-forward approach that efficiently supports resolution up to 4K (2048 $\times$ 4096). Our approach features a tailored spherical 3D Gaussian pyramid with a Fibonacci lattice arrangement, enhancing image quality while reducing information redundancy. To accommodate the demands of high resolution, we propose a pipeline that integrates a hierarchical spherical cost volume and Gaussian heads with local operations, enabling two-step deferred backpropagation for memory-efficient training on a single A100 GPU. Experiments demonstrate that PanSplat achieves state-of-the-art results with superior efficiency and image quality across both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suchithra Kunhoth, Somaya Al- Maadeed, Younes Akbari, Rafif Al Saady</p>
<p>Abstract: Precision medicine has become a central focus in breast cancer management, advancing beyond conventional methods to deliver more precise and individualized therapies. Traditionally, histopathology images have been used primarily for diagnostic purposes; however, they are now recognized for their potential in molecular profiling, which provides deeper insights into cancer prognosis and treatment response. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled digital pathology to analyze histopathologic images for both targeted molecular and broader omic biomarkers, marking a pivotal step in personalized cancer care. These technologies offer the capability to extract various biomarkers such as genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic markers directly from the routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images, which can support treatment decisions without the need for costly molecular assays. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of AI-driven techniques for biomarker detection, with a focus on diverse omic biomarkers that allow novel biomarker discovery. Additionally, we analyze the major challenges faced in this field for robust algorithm development. These challenges highlight areas where further research is essential to bridge the gap between AI research and clinical application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quoc-Bao Nguyen-Le, Tuan-Hy Le, Anh-Triet Do</p>
<p>Abstract: In the burgeoning field of medical imaging, precise computation of 3D volume holds a significant importance for subsequent qualitative analysis of 3D reconstructed objects. Combining multivariate calculus, marching cube algorithm, and binary indexed tree data structure, we developed an algorithm for efficient computation of intrinsic volume of any volumetric data recovered from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR). We proposed the 30 configurations of volume values based on the polygonal mesh generation method. Our algorithm processes the data in scan-line order simultaneously with reconstruction algorithm to create a Fenwick tree, ensuring query time much faster and assisting users' edition of slicing or transforming model. We tested the algorithm's accuracy on simple 3D objects (e.g., sphere, cylinder) to complicated structures (e.g., lungs, cardiac chambers). The result deviated within $\pm 0.004 \text{cm}^3$ and there is still room for further improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Exploiting the promise of recent advances in imitation learning for mobile manipulation will require the collection of large numbers of human-guided demonstrations. This paper proposes an open-source design for an inexpensive, robust, and flexible mobile manipulator that can support arbitrary arms, enabling a wide range of real-world household mobile manipulation tasks. Crucially, our design uses powered casters to enable the mobile base to be fully holonomic, able to control all planar degrees of freedom independently and simultaneously. This feature makes the base more maneuverable and simplifies many mobile manipulation tasks, eliminating the kinematic constraints that create complex and time-consuming motions in nonholonomic bases. We equip our robot with an intuitive mobile phone teleoperation interface to enable easy data acquisition for imitation learning. In our experiments, we use this interface to collect data and show that the resulting learned policies can successfully perform a variety of common household mobile manipulation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayuri Mathur, Anav Chaudhary, Saurabh Kumar Gupta, Ojaswa Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image colorization can greatly enhance the interpretability of the underlying imaging modality and provide insights into human anatomy. The objective of medical image colorization is to transfer a diverse spectrum of colors distributed across human anatomy from Cryosection data to source MRI data while retaining the structures of the MRI. To achieve this, we propose a novel architecture for structurally consistent color transfer to the source MRI data. Our architecture fuses segmentation semantics of Cryosection images for stable contextual colorization of various organs in MRI images. For colorization, we neither require precise registration between MRI and Cryosection images, nor segmentation of MRI images. Additionally, our architecture incorporates a feature compression-and-activation mechanism to capture organ-level global information and suppress noise, enabling the distinction of organ-specific data in MRI scans for more accurate and realistic organ-specific colorization. Our experiments demonstrate that our architecture surpasses the existing methods and yields better quantitative and qualitative results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in the field of computer vision. However, their opaque decision-making processes pose significant challenges for practical applications. In this study, we provide quantitative metrics for assessing CNN filters by clustering the feature maps corresponding to individual filters in the model via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). By analyzing the clustering results, we screen out some anomaly filters associated with outlier samples. We further analyze the relationship between the anomaly filters and model overfitting, proposing three hypotheses. This method is universally applicable across diverse CNN architectures without modifications, as evidenced by its successful application to models like AlexNet and LeNet-5. We present three meticulously designed experiments demonstrating our hypotheses from the perspectives of model behavior, dataset characteristics, and filter impacts. Through this work, we offer a novel perspective for evaluating the CNN performance and gain new insights into the operational behavior of model overfitting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate predictions and representations of plant growth patterns in simulated and controlled environments are important for addressing various challenges in plant phenomics research. This review explores various works on state-of-the-art predictive pattern recognition techniques, focusing on the spatiotemporal modeling of plant traits and the integration of dynamic environmental interactions. We provide a comprehensive examination of deterministic, probabilistic, and generative modeling approaches, emphasizing their applications in high-throughput phenotyping and simulation-based plant growth forecasting. Key topics include regressions and neural network-based representation models for the task of forecasting, limitations of existing experiment-based deterministic approaches, and the need for dynamic frameworks that incorporate uncertainty and evolving environmental feedback. This review surveys advances in 2D and 3D structured data representations through functional-structural plant models and conditional generative models. We offer a perspective on opportunities for future works, emphasizing the integration of domain-specific knowledge to data-driven methods, improvements to available datasets, and the implementation of these techniques toward real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Xu, Xin Miao, Hengjie Liu, Jessica E. Scholey, Wensha Yang, Mary Feng, Michael Ohliger, Hui Lin, Yi Lao, Yang Yang, Ke Sheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstract Purpose: High-quality 4D MRI requires an impractically long scanning time for dense k-space signal acquisition covering all respiratory phases. Accelerated sparse sampling followed by reconstruction enhancement is desired but often results in degraded image quality and long reconstruction time. We hereby propose the chained iterative reconstruction network (CIRNet) for efficient sparse-sampling reconstruction while maintaining clinically deployable quality. Methods: CIRNet adopts the denoising diffusion probabilistic framework to condition the image reconstruction through a stochastic iterative denoising process. During training, a forward Markovian diffusion process is designed to gradually add Gaussian noise to the densely sampled ground truth (GT), while CIRNet is optimized to iteratively reverse the Markovian process from the forward outputs. At the inference stage, CIRNet performs the reverse process solely to recover signals from noise, conditioned upon the undersampled input. CIRNet processed the 4D data (3D+t) as temporal slices (2D+t). The proposed framework is evaluated on a data cohort consisting of 48 patients (12332 temporal slices) who underwent free-breathing liver 4D MRI. 3-, 6-, 10-, 20- and 30-times acceleration were examined with a retrospective random undersampling scheme. Compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction with a spatiotemporal constraint and a recently proposed deep network, Re-Con-GAN, are selected as baselines. Results: CIRNet consistently achieved superior performance compared to CS and Re-Con-GAN. The inference time of CIRNet, CS, and Re-Con-GAN are 11s, 120s, and 0.15s. Conclusion: A novel framework, CIRNet, is presented. CIRNet maintains useable image quality for acceleration up to 30 times, significantly reducing the burden of 4DMRI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyang Li, Kuangyu Ding, Kim-Chuan Toh, Pan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Preconditioned stochastic optimization algorithms, exemplified by Shampoo, have demonstrated superior performance over first-order optimizers, providing both theoretical advantages in convergence rates and practical improvements in large-scale neural network training. However, they incur substantial memory overhead due to the storage demands of non-diagonal preconditioning matrices. To address this, we introduce 4-bit quantization for Shampoo's preconditioners. We introduced two key methods: First, we apply Cholesky decomposition followed by quantization of the Cholesky factors, reducing memory usage by leveraging their lower triangular structure while preserving symmetry and positive definiteness to minimize information loss. To our knowledge, this is the first quantization approach applied to Cholesky factors of preconditioners. Second, we incorporate error feedback in the quantization process, efficiently storing Cholesky factors and error states in the lower and upper triangular parts of the same matrix. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that combining Cholesky quantization with error feedback enhances memory efficiency and algorithm performance in large-scale deep-learning tasks. Theoretically, we also provide convergence proofs for quantized Shampoo under both smooth and non-smooth stochastic optimization settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dupati Srikar Chandra, P. K. Srijith, Dana Rezazadegan, Chris McCarthy</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning allows the system to learn and adapt to new tasks while retaining the knowledge acquired from previous tasks. However, deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting of knowledge learned from earlier tasks while learning a new task. Moreover, retraining large models like transformers from scratch for every new task is costly. An effective approach to address continual learning is to use a large pre-trained model with task-specific adapters to adapt to the new tasks. Though this approach can mitigate catastrophic forgetting, they fail to transfer knowledge across tasks as each task is learning adapters separately. To address this, we propose a novel approach Linked Adapters that allows knowledge transfer through a weighted attention mechanism to other task-specific adapters. Linked adapters use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to model the attention weights, which overcomes the challenge of backward knowledge transfer in continual learning in addition to modeling the forward knowledge transfer. During inference, our proposed approach effectively leverages knowledge transfer through MLP-based attention weights across all the lateral task adapters. Through numerous experiments conducted on diverse image classification datasets, we effectively demonstrated the improvement in performance on the continual learning tasks using Linked Adapters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfeng Li, Jiawen Zhang, Feng Wang, Lianbo Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: One-shot methods have significantly advanced the field of neural architecture search (NAS) by adopting weight-sharing strategy to reduce search costs. However, the accuracy of performance estimation can be compromised by co-adaptation. Few-shot methods divide the entire supernet into individual sub-supernets by splitting edge by edge to alleviate this issue, yet neglect relationships among edges and result in performance degradation on huge search space. In this paper, we introduce HEP-NAS, a hierarchy-wise partition algorithm designed to further enhance accuracy. To begin with, HEP-NAS treats edges sharing the same end node as a hierarchy, permuting and splitting edges within the same hierarchy to directly search for the optimal operation combination for each intermediate node. This approach aligns more closely with the ultimate goal of NAS. Furthermore, HEP-NAS selects the most promising sub-supernet after each segmentation, progressively narrowing the search space in which the optimal architecture may exist. To improve performance evaluation of sub-supernets, HEP-NAS employs search space mutual distillation, stabilizing the training process and accelerating the convergence of each individual sub-supernet. Within a given budget, HEP-NAS enables the splitting of all edges and gradually searches for architectures with higher accuracy. Experimental results across various datasets and search spaces demonstrate the superiority of HEP-NAS compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling have significantly advanced semi-supervised learning (SSL). Prior works have effectively employed Mixup for consistency regularization in SSL. However, our findings indicate that applying Mixup for consistency regularization may degrade SSL performance by compromising the purity of artificial labels. Moreover, most pseudo-labeling based methods utilize thresholding strategy to exclude low-confidence data, aiming to mitigate confirmation bias; however, this approach limits the utility of unlabeled samples. To address these challenges, we propose RegMixMatch, a novel framework that optimizes the use of Mixup with both high- and low-confidence samples in SSL. First, we introduce semi-supervised RegMixup, which effectively addresses reduced artificial labels purity by using both mixed samples and clean samples for training. Second, we develop a class-aware Mixup technique that integrates information from the top-2 predicted classes into low-confidence samples and their artificial labels, reducing the confirmation bias associated with these samples and enhancing their effective utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that RegMixMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SSL benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangbin Li, Jinxing Zhou, Jing Zhang, Shengeng Tang, Kun Li, Dan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Answering questions related to audio-visual scenes, i.e., the AVQA task, is becoming increasingly popular. A critical challenge is accurately identifying and tracking sounding objects related to the question along the timeline. In this paper, we present a new Patch-level Sounding Object Tracking (PSOT) method. It begins with a Motion-driven Key Patch Tracking (M-KPT) module, which relies on visual motion information to identify salient visual patches with significant movements that are more likely to relate to sounding objects and questions. We measure the patch-wise motion intensity map between neighboring video frames and utilize it to construct and guide a motion-driven graph network. Meanwhile, we design a Sound-driven KPT (S-KPT) module to explicitly track sounding patches. This module also involves a graph network, with the adjacency matrix regularized by the audio-visual correspondence map. The M-KPT and S-KPT modules are performed in parallel for each temporal segment, allowing balanced tracking of salient and sounding objects. Based on the tracked patches, we further propose a Question-driven KPT (Q-KPT) module to retain patches highly relevant to the question, ensuring the model focuses on the most informative clues. The audio-visual-question features are updated during the processing of these modules, which are then aggregated for final answer prediction. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive performance even compared to recent large-scale pretraining-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucong Meng, Zhiwei Yang, Yonghong Shi, Zhijian Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The accelerated MRI reconstruction process presents a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the extensive under-sampling in k-space. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the mainstream for this task, demonstrating substantial performance improvements. However, there are still three significant issues remain unaddressed: (1) ViTs struggle to capture high-frequency components of images, limiting their ability to detect local textures and edge information, thereby impeding MRI restoration; (2) Previous methods calculate multi-head self-attention (MSA) among both related and unrelated tokens in content, introducing noise and significantly increasing computational burden; (3) The naive feed-forward network in ViTs cannot model the multi-scale information that is important for image restoration. In this paper, we propose FPS-Former, a powerful ViT-based framework, to address these issues from the perspectives of frequency modulation, spatial purification, and scale diversification. Specifically, for issue (1), we introduce a frequency modulation attention module to enhance the self-attention map by adaptively re-calibrating the frequency information in a Laplacian pyramid. For issue (2), we customize a spatial purification attention module to capture interactions among closely related tokens, thereby reducing redundant or irrelevant feature representations. For issue (3), we propose an efficient feed-forward network based on a hybrid-scale fusion strategy. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three public datasets show that our FPS-Former outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring lower computational costs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chest radiography is climacteric in identifying different pulmonary diseases, yet radiologist workload and inefficiency can lead to misdiagnoses. Automatic, accurate, and efficient segmentation of lung from X-ray images of chest is paramount for early disease detection. This study develops a deep learning framework using a Pix2pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to segment pulmonary abnormalities from CXR images. This framework's image preprocessing and augmentation techniques were properly incorporated with a U-Net-inspired generator-discriminator architecture. Initially, it loaded the CXR images and manual masks from the Montgomery and Shenzhen datasets, after which preprocessing and resizing were performed. A U-Net generator is applied to the processed CXR images that yield segmented masks; then, a Discriminator Network differentiates between the generated and real masks. Montgomery dataset served as the model's training set in the study, and the Shenzhen dataset was used to test its robustness, which was used here for the first time. An adversarial loss and an L1 distance were used to optimize the model in training. All metrics, which assess precision, recall, F1 score, and Dice coefficient, prove the effectiveness of this framework in pulmonary abnormality segmentation. It, therefore, sets the basis for future studies to be performed shortly using diverse datasets that could further confirm its clinical applicability in medical imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced significantly in speech recognition applications. Speech-based interaction with digital systems, particularly AI-driven digit recognition, has emerged as a prominent application. However, existing neural network-based methods often neglect the impact of noise, leading to reduced accuracy in noisy environments. This study tackles the challenge of recognizing the isolated spoken Persian numbers (zero to nine), particularly distinguishing phonetically similar numbers, in noisy environments. The proposed method, which is designed for speaker-independent recognition, combines residual convolutional neural network and bidirectional gated recurrent unit in a hybrid structure for Persian number recognition. This method employs word units as input instead of phoneme units. Audio data from 51 speakers of FARSDIGIT1 database are utilized after augmentation using various noises, and the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) technique is employed for feature extraction. The experimental results show the proposed method efficacy with 98.53%, 96.10%, and 95.9% recognition accuracy for training, validation, and test, respectively. In the noisy environment, the proposed method exhibits an average performance improvement of 26.88% over phoneme unit-based LSTM method for Persian numbers. In addition, the accuracy of the proposed method is 7.61% better than that of the Mel-scale Two Dimension Root Cepstrum Coefficients (MTDRCC) feature extraction technique along with MLP model in the test data for the same dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ptychography is a scanning coherent diffractive imaging technique that enables imaging nanometer-scale features in extended samples. One main challenge is that widely used iterative image reconstruction methods often require significant amount of overlap between adjacent scan locations, leading to large data volumes and prolonged acquisition times. To address this key limitation, this paper proposes a Bayesian inversion method for ptychography that performs effectively even with less overlap between neighboring scan locations. Furthermore, the proposed method can quantify the inherent uncertainty on the ptychographic object, which is created by the ill-posed nature of the ptychographic inverse problem. At a high level, the proposed method first utilizes a deep generative model to learn the prior distribution of the object and then generates samples from the posterior distribution of the object by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Our results from simulated ptychography experiments show that the proposed framework can consistently outperform a widely used iterative reconstruction algorithm in cases of reduced overlap. Moreover, the proposed framework can provide uncertainty estimates that closely correlate with the true error, which is not available in practice. The project website is available here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongchun Qin, Pengfei Fang, Hui Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to continuously introduce novel categories into a classification system without forgetting previously learned ones, thus adapting to evolving data distributions. Researchers are currently focusing on leveraging the rich semantic information of pre-trained models (PTMs) in CIL tasks. Prompt learning has been adopted in CIL for its ability to adjust data distribution to better align with pre-trained knowledge. This paper critically examines the limitations of existing methods from the perspective of prompt learning, which heavily rely on input information. To address this issue, we propose a novel PTM-based CIL method called Input-Agnostic Prompt Enhancement with Negative Feedback Regulation (PEARL). In PEARL, we implement an input-agnostic global prompt coupled with an adaptive momentum update strategy to reduce the model's dependency on data distribution, thereby effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Guided by negative feedback regulation, this adaptive momentum update addresses the parameter sensitivity inherent in fixed-weight momentum updates. Furthermore, it fosters the continuous enhancement of the prompt for new tasks by harnessing correlations between different tasks in CIL. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at: https://github.com/qinyongchun/PEARL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved mainstream success in many generative modeling tasks, from image generation to inverse problem solving. A distinct feature of these models is that they correspond to deep hierarchical latent variable models optimizing a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the data likelihood. Drawing on a basic connection between likelihood modeling and compression, we explore the potential of diffusion models for progressive coding, resulting in a sequence of bits that can be incrementally transmitted and decoded with progressively improving reconstruction quality. Unlike prior work based on Gaussian diffusion or conditional diffusion models, we propose a new form of diffusion model with uniform noise in the forward process, whose negative ELBO corresponds to the end-to-end compression cost using universal quantization. We obtain promising first results on image compression, achieving competitive rate-distortion and rate-realism results on a wide range of bit-rates with a single model, bringing neural codecs a step closer to practical deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: The imperative for early detection of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is challenged by its asymptomatic onset and dependence on suboptimal clinical diagnostic tests, contributing to its widespread global prevalence. While research into noninvasive T2DM screening tools has advanced, conventional machine learning approaches remain limited to unimodal inputs due to extensive feature engineering requirements. In contrast, deep learning models can leverage multimodal data for a more holistic understanding of patients' health conditions. However, the potential of chest X-ray (CXR) imaging, one of the most commonly performed medical procedures, remains underexplored. This study evaluates the integration of CXR images with other noninvasive data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs) and electrocardiography signals, for T2DM detection. Utilising datasets meticulously compiled from the MIMIC-IV databases, we investigated two deep fusion paradigms: an early fusion-based multimodal transformer and a modular joint fusion ResNet-LSTM architecture. The end-to-end trained ResNet-LSTM model achieved an AUROC of 0.86, surpassing the CXR-only baseline by 2.3% with just 9863 training samples. These findings demonstrate the diagnostic value of CXRs within multimodal frameworks for identifying at-risk individuals early. Additionally, the dataset preprocessing pipeline has also been released to support further research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad R. Salmanpour, Sajad Amiri, Sara Gharibi, Ahmad Shariftabrizi, Yixi Xu, William B Weeks, Arman Rahmim, Ilker Hacihaliloglu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the connection between visual semantic features in PI-RADS and associated risk factors, moving beyond abnormal imaging findings by creating a standardized dictionary of biological/radiological radiomics features (RFs). Using multiparametric prostate MRI sequences (T2-weighted imaging [T2WI], diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI], and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]), six interpretable and seven complex classifiers, combined with nine feature selection algorithms (FSAs), were applied to segmented lesions to predict UCLA scores. Combining T2WI, DWI, and ADC with FSAs such as ANOVA F-test, Correlation Coefficient, and Fisher Score, and utilizing logistic regression, identified key features: the 90th percentile from T2WI (hypo-intensity linked to cancer risk), variance from T2WI (lesion heterogeneity), shape metrics like Least Axis Length and Surface Area to Volume ratio from ADC (lesion compactness), and Run Entropy from ADC (texture consistency). This approach achieved an average accuracy of 0.78, outperforming single-sequence methods (p < 0.05). The developed dictionary provides a common language, fostering collaboration between clinical professionals and AI developers to enable trustworthy, interpretable AI for reliable clinical decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is widely used for heart modelling and digital twin computational analysis due to its ability to visualize soft tissues and capture dynamic functions. However, the anisotropic nature of CMR images, characterized by large inter-slice distances and misalignments from cardiac motion, poses significant challenges to accurate model reconstruction. These limitations result in data loss and measurement inaccuracies, hindering the capture of detailed anatomical structures. This study introduces MorphiNet, a novel network that enhances heart model reconstruction by leveraging high-resolution Computer Tomography (CT) images, unpaired with CMR images, to learn heart anatomy. MorphiNet encodes anatomical structures as gradient fields, transforming template meshes into patient-specific geometries. A multi-layer graph subdivision network refines these geometries while maintaining dense point correspondence. The proposed method achieves high anatomy fidelity, demonstrating approximately 40% higher Dice scores, half the Hausdorff distance, and around 3 mm average surface error compared to state-of-the-art methods. MorphiNet delivers superior results with greater inference efficiency. This approach represents a significant advancement in addressing the challenges of CMR-based heart model reconstruction, potentially improving digital twin computational analyses of cardiac structure and functions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men. The recent development of high frequency, micro-ultrasound imaging offers improved resolution compared to conventional ultrasound and potentially a better ability to differentiate clinically significant cancer from normal tissue. However, the features of prostate cancer remain subtle, with ambiguous borders with normal tissue and large variations in appearance, making it challenging for both machine learning and humans to localize it on micro-ultrasound images.
  We propose a novel Mask Enhanced Deeply-supervised Micro-US network, termed MedMusNet, to automatically and more accurately segment prostate cancer to be used as potential targets for biopsy procedures. MedMusNet leverages predicted masks of prostate cancer to enforce the learned features layer-wisely within the network, reducing the influence of noise and improving overall consistency across frames.
  MedMusNet successfully detected 76% of clinically significant cancer with a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.365, significantly outperforming the baseline Swin-M2F in specificity and accuracy (Wilcoxon test, Bonferroni correction, p-value<0.05). While the lesion-level and patient-level analyses showed improved performance compared to human experts and different baseline, the improvements did not reach statistical significance, likely on account of the small cohort.
  We have presented a novel approach to automatically detect and segment clinically significant prostate cancer on B-mode micro-ultrasound images. Our MedMusNet model outperformed other models, surpassing even human experts. These preliminary results suggest the potential for aiding urologists in prostate cancer diagnosis via biopsy and treatment decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Fang, Yongchun Qin, Hui Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) addresses the challenges of evolving data distributions and the difficulty of data acquisition in real-world scenarios. To counteract the catastrophic forgetting typically encountered in FSCIL, knowledge distillation is employed as a way to maintain the knowledge from learned data distribution. Recognizing the limitations of generating discriminative feature representations in a few-shot context, our approach incorporates structural information between samples into knowledge distillation. This structural information serves as a remedy for the low quality of features. Diverging from traditional structured distillation methods that compute sample similarity, we introduce the Displacement Knowledge Distillation (DKD) method. DKD utilizes displacement rather than similarity between samples, incorporating both distance and angular information to significantly enhance the information density retained through knowledge distillation. Observing performance disparities in feature distribution between base and novel classes, we propose the Dual Distillation Network (DDNet). This network applies traditional knowledge distillation to base classes and DKD to novel classes, challenging the conventional integration of novel classes with base classes. Additionally, we implement an instance-aware sample selector during inference to dynamically adjust dual branch weights, thereby leveraging the complementary strengths of each approach. Extensive testing on three benchmarks demonstrates that DDNet achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, through rigorous experimentation and comparison, we establish the robustness and general applicability of our proposed DKD method.</p>

By recasting both diffusion and flow matching under the same generative Markov framework, we provide theoretical insights into why flow matching models can be more robust empirically and how novel model classes can be constructed by mixing deterministic and stochastic components.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wengang Guo, Wei Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral clustering is a popular clustering method. It first maps data into the spectral embedding space and then uses Kmeans to find clusters. However, the two decoupled steps prohibit joint optimization for the optimal solution. In addition, it needs to construct the similarity graph for samples, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the data are high-dimensional. To address these two challenges, we introduce \textbf{D}eep \textbf{S}pectral \textbf{C}lustering (\textbf{DSC}), which consists of two main modules: the spectral embedding module and the greedy Kmeans module. The former module learns to efficiently embed raw samples into the spectral embedding space using deep neural networks and power iteration. The latter module improves the cluster structures of Kmeans on the learned spectral embeddings by a greedy optimization strategy, which iteratively reveals the direction of the worst cluster structures and optimizes embeddings in this direction. To jointly optimize spectral embeddings and clustering, we seamlessly integrate the two modules and optimize them in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that DSC achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Gutierrez, Irene Hou, Jihye Lee, Kenneth Angelikas, Owen Man, Sophia Mettille, James Prather, Paul Denny, Stephen MacNeil</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI systems have raised concerns about academic integrity among educators. Beyond excelling at solving programming problems and text-based multiple-choice questions, recent research has also found that large multimodal models (LMMs) can solve Parsons problems based only on an image. However, such problems are still inherently text-based and rely on the capabilities of the models to convert the images of code blocks to their corresponding text. In this paper, we further investigate the capabilities of LMMs to solve graph and tree data structure problems based only on images. To achieve this, we computationally construct and evaluate a novel benchmark dataset comprising 9,072 samples of diverse graph and tree data structure tasks to assess the performance of the GPT-4o, GPT-4v, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision, and Claude 3 model families. GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Flash performed best on trees and graphs respectively. GPT-4o achieved 87.6% accuracy on tree samples, while Gemini 1.5 Flash, achieved 56.2% accuracy on graph samples. Our findings highlight the influence of structural and visual variations on model performance. This research not only introduces an LMM benchmark to facilitate replication and further exploration but also underscores the potential of LMMs in solving complex computing problems, with important implications for pedagogy and assessment practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bing Xiong, Yue Peng, RanRan Zhang, Fuqiang Chen, JiaYe He, Wenjian Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Virtual staining leverages computer-aided techniques to transfer the style of histochemically stained tissue samples to other staining types. In virtual staining of pathological images, maintaining strict structural consistency is crucial, as these images emphasize structural integrity more than natural images. Even slight structural alterations can lead to deviations in diagnostic semantic information. Furthermore, the unpaired characteristic of virtual staining data may compromise the preservation of pathological diagnostic content. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-path inversion virtual staining method using prompt learning, which optimizes visual prompts to control content and style, while preserving complete pathological diagnostic content. Our proposed inversion technique comprises two key components: (1) Dual Path Prompted Strategy, we utilize a feature adapter function to generate reference images for inversion, providing style templates for input image inversion, called Style Target Path. We utilize the inversion of the input image as the Structural Target path, employing visual prompt images to maintain structural consistency in this path while preserving style information from the style Target path. During the deterministic sampling process, we achieve complete content-style disentanglement through a plug-and-play embedding visual prompt approach. (2) StainPrompt Optimization, where we only optimize the null visual prompt as ``operator'' for dual path inversion, rather than fine-tune pre-trained model. We optimize null visual prompt for structual and style trajectory around pivotal noise on each timestep, ensuring accurate dual-path inversion reconstruction. Extensive evaluations on publicly available multi-domain unpaired staining datasets demonstrate high structural consistency and accurate style transfer results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chicago Y. Park, Yuyang Hu, Michael T. McCann, Cristina Garcia-Cardona, Brendt Wohlberg, Ulugbek S. Kamilov</p>
<p>Abstract: Plug-and-play (PnP) methods are extensively used for solving imaging inverse problems by integrating physical measurement models with pre-trained deep denoisers as priors. Score-based diffusion models (SBMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for image generation by training deep denoisers to represent the score of the image prior. While both PnP and SBMs use deep denoisers, the score-based nature of PnP is unexplored in the literature due to its distinct origins rooted in proximal optimization. This letter introduces a novel view of PnP as a score-based method, a perspective that enables the re-use of powerful SBMs within classical PnP algorithms without retraining. We present a set of mathematical relationships for adapting popular SBMs as priors within PnP. We show that this approach enables a direct comparison between PnP and SBM-based reconstruction methods using the same neural network as the prior.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of adversarial attacks on the explainability of deep learning models, which are commonly criticized for their black-box nature despite their capacity for autonomous feature extraction. This black-box nature can affect the perceived trustworthiness of these models. To address this, explainability techniques such as GradCAM, SmoothGrad, and LIME have been developed to clarify model decision-making processes. Our research focuses on the robustness of these explanations when models are subjected to adversarial attacks, specifically those involving subtle image perturbations that are imperceptible to humans but can significantly mislead models. For this, we utilize attack methods like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) and observe their effects on model accuracy and explanations. The results reveal a substantial decline in model accuracy, with accuracies dropping from 89.94% to 58.73% and 45.50% under FGSM and BIM attacks, respectively. Despite these declines in accuracy, the explanation of the models measured by metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) shows negligible changes, suggesting that these metrics may not be sensitive enough to detect the presence of adversarial perturbations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Wang, Zhiyuan Zhu, Heyang Liu, Yusheng Liao, Hongcheng Liu, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at multimodal perception and understanding, yet their tendency to generate hallucinated or inaccurate responses undermines their trustworthiness. Existing methods have largely overlooked the importance of refusal responses as a means of enhancing MLLMs reliability. To bridge this gap, we present the Information Boundary-aware Learning Framework (InBoL), a novel approach that empowers MLLMs to refuse to answer user queries when encountering insufficient information. To the best of our knowledge, InBoL is the first framework that systematically defines the conditions under which refusal is appropriate for MLLMs using the concept of information boundaries proposed in our paper. This framework introduces a comprehensive data generation pipeline and tailored training strategies to improve the model's ability to deliver appropriate refusal responses. To evaluate the trustworthiness of MLLMs, we further propose a user-centric alignment goal along with corresponding metrics. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in refusal accuracy without noticeably compromising the model's helpfulness, establishing InBoL as a pivotal advancement in building more trustworthy MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khang Nguyen, Tuan Dang, Manfred Huber</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) scenes with semantic understanding is vital in many robotic applications. Robots need to identify which objects, along with their positions and shapes, to manipulate them precisely with given tasks. Mobile robots, especially, usually use lightweight networks to segment objects on RGB images and then localize them via depth maps; however, they often encounter out-of-distribution scenarios where masks over-cover the objects. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation quality in 3D scene reconstruction by refining segmentation errors using non-parametric statistical methods. To enhance mask precision, we map the predicted masks into a depth frame to estimate their distribution via kernel densities. The outliers in depth perception are then rejected without the need for additional parameters in an adaptive manner to out-of-distribution scenarios, followed by 3D reconstruction using projective signed distance functions (SDFs). We validate our method on a synthetic dataset, which shows improvements in both quantitative and qualitative results for panoptic mapping. Through real-world testing, the results furthermore show our method's capability to be deployed on a real-robot system.

<p>Abstract: Estimating physical properties for visual data is a crucial task in computer vision, graphics, and robotics, underpinning applications such as augmented reality, physical simulation, and robotic grasping. However, this area remains under-explored due to the inherent ambiguities in physical property estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianProperty, a training-free framework that assigns physical properties of materials to 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we integrate the segmentation capability of SAM with the recognition capability of GPT-4V(ision) to formulate a global-local physical property reasoning module for 2D images. Then we project the physical properties from multi-view 2D images to 3D Gaussians using a voting strategy. We demonstrate that 3D Gaussians with physical property annotations enable applications in physics-based dynamic simulation and robotic grasping. For physics-based dynamic simulation, we leverage the Material Point Method (MPM) for realistic dynamic simulation. For robot grasping, we develop a grasping force prediction strategy that estimates a safe force range required for object grasping based on the estimated physical properties. Extensive experiments on material segmentation, physics-based dynamic simulation, and robotic grasping validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, highlighting its crucial role in understanding physical properties from visual data.

<p>Abstract: Spanning multiple scales-from macroscopic anatomy down to intricate microscopic architecture-the human brain exemplifies a complex system that demands integrated approaches to fully understand its complexity. Yet, mapping nonlinear relationships between these scales remains challenging due to technical limitations and the high cost of multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisition. Here, we introduce Macro2Micro, a deep learning framework that predicts brain microstructure from macrostructure using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Grounded in the scale-free, self-similar nature of brain organization-where microscale information can be inferred from macroscale patterns-Macro2Micro explicitly encodes multiscale brain representations into distinct processing branches. To further enhance image fidelity and suppress artifacts, we propose a simple yet effective auxiliary discriminator and learning objective. Our results show that Macro2Micro faithfully translates T1-weighted MRIs into corresponding Fractional Anisotropy (FA) images, achieving a 6.8% improvement in the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) compared to previous methods, while preserving the individual neurobiological characteristics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-step dexterous manipulation is a fundamental skill in household scenarios, yet remains an underexplored area in robotics. This paper proposes a modular approach, where each step of the manipulation process is addressed with dedicated policies based on effective modality input, rather than relying on a single end-to-end model. To demonstrate this, a dexterous robotic hand performs a manipulation task involving picking up and rotating a box. Guided by insights from neuroscience, the task is decomposed into three sub-skills, 1)reaching, 2)grasping and lifting, and 3)in-hand rotation, based on the dominant sensory modalities employed in the human brain. Each sub-skill is addressed using distinct methods from a practical perspective: a classical controller, a Vision-Language-Action model, and a reinforcement learning policy with force feedback, respectively. We tested the pipeline on a real robot to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. The key contribution of this study lies in presenting a neuroscience-inspired, modality-driven methodology for multi-step dexterous manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Asali, Prashant Doshi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel method for collaborative robots (cobots) to learn manipulation tasks and perform them in a human-like manner. Our method falls under the learn-from-observation (LfO) paradigm, where robots learn to perform tasks by observing human actions, which facilitates quicker integration into industrial settings compared to programming from scratch. We introduce Visual IRL that uses the RGB-D keypoints in each frame of the observed human task performance directly as state features, which are input to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The inversely learned reward function, which maps keypoints to reward values, is transferred from the human to the cobot using a novel neuro-symbolic dynamics model, which maps human kinematics to the cobot arm. This model allows similar end-effector positioning while minimizing joint adjustments, aiming to preserve the natural dynamics of human motion in robotic manipulation. In contrast with previous techniques that focus on end-effector placement only, our method maps multiple joint angles of the human arm to the corresponding cobot joints. Moreover, it uses an inverse kinematics model to then minimally adjust the joint angles, for accurate end-effector positioning. We evaluate the performance of this approach on two different realistic manipulation tasks. The first task is produce processing, which involves picking, inspecting, and placing onions based on whether they are blemished. The second task is liquid pouring, where the robot picks up bottles, pours the contents into designated containers, and disposes of the empty bottles. Our results demonstrate advances in human-like robotic manipulation, leading to more human-robot compatibility in manufacturing applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based volumetric video has revolutionized visual media by delivering photorealistic Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) experiences that provide audiences with unprecedented immersion and interactivity. However, the substantial data volumes pose significant challenges for storage and transmission. Existing solutions typically optimize NeRF representation and compression independently or focus on a single fixed rate-distortion (RD) tradeoff. In this paper, we propose VRVVC, a novel end-to-end joint optimization variable-rate framework for volumetric video compression that achieves variable bitrates using a single model while maintaining superior RD performance. Specifically, VRVVC introduces a compact tri-plane implicit residual representation for inter-frame modeling of long-duration dynamic scenes, effectively reducing temporal redundancy. We further propose a variable-rate residual representation compression scheme that leverages a learnable quantization and a tiny MLP-based entropy model. This approach enables variable bitrates through the utilization of predefined Lagrange multipliers to manage the quantization error of all latent representations. Finally, we present an end-to-end progressive training strategy combined with a multi-rate-distortion loss function to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRVVC achieves a wide range of variable bitrates within a single model and surpasses the RD performance of existing methods across various datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijia Zhou, Euijoon Ahn, Hao Wang, Ann Quinton, Narelle Kennedy, Pradeeba Sridar, Ralph Nanan, Jinman Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The measurement of fetal thalamus diameter (FTD) and fetal head circumference (FHC) are crucial in identifying abnormal fetal thalamus development as it may lead to certain neuropsychiatric disorders in later life. However, manual measurements from 2D-US images are laborious, prone to high inter-observer variability, and complicated by the high signal-to-noise ratio nature of the images. Deep learning-based landmark detection approaches have shown promise in measuring biometrics from US images, but the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithm, BiometryNet, is inadequate for FTD and FHC measurement due to its inability to account for the fuzzy edges of these structures and the complex shape of the FTD structure. To address these inadequacies, we propose a novel Swoosh Activation Function (SAF) designed to enhance the regularization of heatmaps produced by landmark detection algorithms. Our SAF serves as a regularization term to enforce an optimum mean squared error (MSE) level between predicted heatmaps, reducing the dispersiveness of hotspots in predicted heatmaps. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAF significantly improves the measurement performances of FTD and FHC with higher intraclass correlation coefficient scores in FTD and lower mean difference scores in FHC measurement than those of the current SOTA algorithm BiometryNet. Moreover, our proposed SAF is highly generalizable and architecture-agnostic. The SAF's coefficients can be configured for different tasks, making it highly customizable. Our study demonstrates that the SAF activation function is a novel method that can improve measurement accuracy in fetal biometry landmark detection. This improvement has the potential to contribute to better fetal monitoring and improved neonatal outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuqin Zhou, Guo Lu, Jiangchuan Li, Xiangyu Chen, Zhengxue Cheng, Li Song, Wenjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural image compression often faces a challenging trade-off among rate, distortion and perception. While most existing methods typically focus on either achieving high pixel-level fidelity or optimizing for perceptual metrics, we propose a novel approach that simultaneously addresses both aspects for a fixed neural image codec. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play module at the decoder side that leverages a latent diffusion process to transform the decoded features, enhancing either low distortion or high perceptual quality without altering the original image compression codec. Our approach facilitates fusion of original and transformed features without additional training, enabling users to flexibly adjust the balance between distortion and perception during inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the pretrained codecs with a wide, adjustable distortion-perception range while maintaining their original compression capabilities. For instance, we can achieve more than 150% improvement in LPIPS-BDRate without sacrificing more than 1 dB in PSNR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Li, Siwang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Image rescaling (IR) seeks to determine the optimal low-resolution (LR) representation of a high-resolution (HR) image to reconstruct a high-quality super-resolution (SR) image. Typically, HR images with resolutions exceeding 2K possess rich information that is unevenly distributed across the image. Traditional image rescaling methods often fall short because they focus solely on the overall scaling rate, ignoring the varying amounts of information in different parts of the image. To address this limitation, we propose a Block-Based Multi-Scale Image Rescaling Framework (BBMR), tailored for IR tasks involving HR images of 2K resolution and higher. BBMR consists of two main components: the Downscaling Module and the Upscaling Module. In the Downscaling Module, the HR image is segmented into sub-blocks of equal size, with each sub-block receiving a dynamically allocated scaling rate while maintaining a constant overall scaling rate. For the Upscaling Module, we introduce the Joint Super-Resolution method (JointSR), which performs SR on these sub-blocks with varying scaling rates and effectively eliminates blocking artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate that BBMR significantly enhances the SR image quality on the of 2K and 4K test dataset compared to initial network image rescaling methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonje Choi, Woo Kyung Kim, SeungHyun Kim, Honguk Woo</p>
<p>Abstract: For embodied reinforcement learning (RL) agents interacting with the environment, it is desirable to have rapid policy adaptation to unseen visual observations, but achieving zero-shot adaptation capability is considered as a challenging problem in the RL context. To address the problem, we present a novel contrastive prompt ensemble (ConPE) framework which utilizes a pretrained vision-language model and a set of visual prompts, thus enabling efficient policy learning and adaptation upon a wide range of environmental and physical changes encountered by embodied agents. Specifically, we devise a guided-attention-based ensemble approach with multiple visual prompts on the vision-language model to construct robust state representations. Each prompt is contrastively learned in terms of an individual domain factor that significantly affects the agent's egocentric perception and observation. For a given task, the attention-based ensemble and policy are jointly learned so that the resulting state representations not only generalize to various domains but are also optimized for learning the task. Through experiments, we show that ConPE outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms for several embodied agent tasks including navigation in AI2THOR, manipulation in egocentric-Metaworld, and autonomous driving in CARLA, while also improving the sample efficiency of policy learning and adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelbaki Souid, Mohamed Hamroun, Soufiene Ben Othman, Hedi Sakli, Naceur Abdelkarim</p>
<p>Abstract: Pulmonary pathologies are a significant global health concern, often leading to fatal outcomes if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Chest radiography serves as a primary diagnostic tool, but the availability of experienced radiologists remains limited. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, particularly in computer vision, offer promising solutions to address this challenge.
  This research evaluates a deep learning model designed to detect lung cancer, specifically pulmonary nodules, along with eight other lung pathologies, using chest radiographs. The study leverages diverse datasets comprising over 135,120 frontal chest radiographs to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A two-stage classification system, utilizing ensemble methods and transfer learning, is employed to first triage images into Normal or Abnormal categories and then identify specific pathologies, including lung nodules.
  The deep learning model achieves notable results in nodule classification, with a top-performing accuracy of 77%, a sensitivity of 0.713, a specificity of 0.776 during external validation, and an AUC score of 0.888. Despite these successes, some misclassifications were observed, primarily false negatives.
  In conclusion, the model demonstrates robust potential for generalization across diverse patient populations, attributed to the geographic diversity of the training dataset. Future work could focus on integrating ETL data distribution strategies and expanding the dataset with additional nodule-type samples to further enhance diagnostic accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid adaptation of data driven AI models, such as deep learning inference, training, Vision Transformers (ViTs), and other HPC applications, drives a strong need for runtime precision configurable different non linear activation functions (AF) hardware support. Existing solutions support diverse precision or runtime AF reconfigurability but fail to address both simultaneously. This work proposes a flexible and SIMD multiprecision processing element (FlexPE), which supports diverse runtime configurable AFs, including sigmoid, tanh, ReLU and softmax, and MAC operation. The proposed design achieves an improved throughput of up to 16X FxP4, 8X FxP8, 4X FxP16 and 1X FxP32 in pipeline mode with 100% time multiplexed hardware. This work proposes an area efficient multiprecision iterative mode in the SIMD systolic arrays for edge AI use cases. The design delivers superior performance with up to 62X and 371X reductions in DMA reads for input feature maps and weight filters in VGG16, with an energy efficiency of 8.42 GOPS / W within the accuracy loss of 2%. The proposed architecture supports emerging 4-bit computations for DL inference while enhancing throughput in FxP8/16 modes for transformers and other HPC applications. The proposed approach enables future energy-efficient AI accelerators in edge and cloud environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqun Li, Qi Zhang, Xiaofeng Huang, Zhao Wang, Siwei Ma, Wei Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: High-efficient image compression is a critical requirement. In several scenarios where multiple modalities of data are captured by different sensors, the auxiliary information from other modalities are not fully leveraged by existing image-only codecs, leading to suboptimal compression efficiency. In this paper, we increase image compression performance with the assistance of point cloud, which is widely adopted in the area of autonomous driving. We first unify the data representation for both modalities to facilitate data processing. Then, we propose the point cloud-assisted neural image codec (PCA-NIC) to enhance the preservation of image texture and structure by utilizing the high-dimensional point cloud information. We further introduce a multi-modal feature fusion transform module (MMFFT) to capture more representative image features, remove redundant information between channels and modalities that are not relevant to the image content. Our work is the first to improve image compression performance using point cloud and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Aubard, Ana Madureira, Lu\'is Teixeira, Jos\'e Pinto</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing interest in underwater exploration and monitoring, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have become essential. The recent interest in onboard Deep Learning (DL) has advanced real-time environmental interaction capabilities relying on efficient and accurate vision-based DL models. However, the predominant use of sonar in underwater environments, characterized by limited training data and inherent noise, poses challenges to model robustness. This autonomy improvement raises safety concerns for deploying such models during underwater operations, potentially leading to hazardous situations. This paper aims to provide the first comprehensive overview of sonar-based DL under the scope of robustness. It studies sonar-based DL perception task models, such as classification, object detection, segmentation, and SLAM. Furthermore, the paper systematizes sonar-based state-of-the-art datasets, simulators, and robustness methods such as neural network verification, out-of-distribution, and adversarial attacks. This paper highlights the lack of robustness in sonar-based DL research and suggests future research pathways, notably establishing a baseline sonar-based dataset and bridging the simulation-to-reality gap.</p>

This integrated approach addresses the BraTS 2023 cluster challenges by offering precise segmentation and realistic inpainting, tailored for diverse tumor types and sub-regions. The results demonstrate outstanding performance, evidenced by quantitative evaluations such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HD95) for segmentation, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Mean-Square Error (MSE) for inpainting. Qualitative assessments further validate the high-quality, clinically relevant outputs. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of combining advanced machine learning techniques for comprehensive brain tumor analysis, promising significant advancements in clinical decision-making and patient care within the realm of medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matou\v{s} Elphick, Samra Turajlic, Guang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised foundation models for digital pathology encode small patches from H\&E whole slide images into latent representations used for downstream tasks. However, the invariance of these representations to patch rotation remains unexplored. This study investigates the rotational invariance of latent representations across twelve foundation models by quantifying the alignment between non-rotated and rotated patches using mutual $k$-nearest neighbours and cosine distance. Models that incorporated rotation augmentation during self-supervised training exhibited significantly greater invariance to rotations. We hypothesise that the absence of rotational inductive bias in the transformer architecture necessitates rotation augmentation during training to achieve learned invariance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Garnung Men\'endez</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) have long been recognized as powerful tools for image processing and analysis, providing a framework to model and exploit structural and geometric properties inherent in visual data. Over the years, numerous PDE-based models have been developed and refined, inspired by natural analogies between physical phenomena and image spaces. These methods have proven highly effective in a wide range of applications, including denoising, deblurring, sharpening, inpainting, feature extraction, and others. This work provides a theoretical and computational exploration of both fundamental and innovative PDE models applied to image processing, accompanied by extensive numerical experimentation and objective and subjective analysis. Building upon well-established techniques, we introduce novel physical-based PDE models specifically designed for various image processing tasks. These models incorporate mathematical principles and approaches that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously applied in this domain, showcasing their potential to address challenges beyond the capabilities of traditional and existing PDE methods. By formulating and solving these mathematical models, we demonstrate their effectiveness in advancing image processing tasks while retaining a rigorous connection to their theoretical underpinnings. This work seeks to bridge foundational concepts and cutting-edge innovations, contributing to the evolution of PDE methodologies in digital image processing and related interdisciplinary fields.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning-based robotic control methods are often task-specific and fail to generalize across diverse environments or unseen objects and instructions. Visual Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong scene understanding and planning capabilities but lack the ability to generate actionable policies tailored to specific robotic embodiments. To address this, Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged, yet they face challenges in long-horizon spatial reasoning and grounded task planning. In this work, we propose the Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning, Emma-X. Emma-X leverages our constructed hierarchical embodiment dataset based on BridgeV2, containing 60,000 robot manipulation trajectories auto-annotated with grounded task reasoning and spatial guidance. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy based on gripper states and motion trajectories, which can help mitigate hallucination in grounding subtask reasoning generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Emma-X achieves superior performance over competitive baselines, particularly in real-world robotic tasks requiring spatial reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuhao Wang, Yihua Sun, Zihan Li, Xuan Yang, Fang Chen, Hongen Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Drafting radiology reports is a complex task requiring flexibility, where radiologists tail content to available information and particular clinical demands. However, most current radiology report generation (RRG) models are constrained to a fixed task paradigm, such as predicting the full ``finding'' section from a single image, inherently involving a mismatch between inputs and outputs. The trained models lack the flexibility for diverse inputs and could generate harmful, input-agnostic hallucinations. To bridge the gap between current RRG models and the clinical demands in practice, we first develop a data generation pipeline to create a new MIMIC-RG4 dataset, which considers four common radiology report drafting scenarios and has perfectly corresponded input and output. Secondly, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) based RRG framework, namely LLM-RG4, which utilizes LLM's flexible instruction-following capabilities and extensive general knowledge. We further develop an adaptive token fusion module that offers flexibility to handle diverse scenarios with different input combinations, while minimizing the additional computational burden associated with increased input volumes. Besides, we propose a token-level loss weighting strategy to direct the model's attention towards positive and uncertain descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-RG4 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both clinical efficiency and natural language generation on the MIMIC-RG4 and MIMIC-CXR datasets. We quantitatively demonstrate that our model has minimal input-agnostic hallucinations, whereas current open-source models commonly suffer from this problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in GPU-based parallel simulation have enabled practitioners to collect large amounts of data and train complex control policies using deep reinforcement learning (RL), on commodity GPUs. However, such successes for RL in robotics have been limited to tasks sufficiently simulated by fast rigid-body dynamics. Simulation techniques for soft bodies are comparatively several orders of magnitude slower, thereby limiting the use of RL due to sample complexity requirements. To address this challenge, this paper presents both a novel RL algorithm and a simulation platform to enable scaling RL on tasks involving rigid bodies and deformables. We introduce Soft Analytic Policy Optimization (SAPO), a maximum entropy first-order model-based actor-critic RL algorithm, which uses first-order analytic gradients from differentiable simulation to train a stochastic actor to maximize expected return and entropy. Alongside our approach, we develop Rewarped, a parallel differentiable multiphysics simulation platform that supports simulating various materials beyond rigid bodies. We re-implement challenging manipulation and locomotion tasks in Rewarped, and show that SAPO outperforms baselines over a range of tasks that involve interaction between rigid bodies, articulations, and deformables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaying Lin, Yuen-Hei Yeung, Shuquan Ye, Rynson W. H. Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Glass surfaces are becoming increasingly ubiquitous as modern buildings tend to use a lot of glass panels. This, however, poses substantial challenges to the operations of autonomous systems such as robots, self-driving cars, and drones, as these glass panels can become transparent obstacles to navigation. Existing works attempt to exploit various cues, including glass boundary context or reflections, as priors. However, they are all based on input RGB images. We observe that the transmission of 3D depth sensor light through glass surfaces often produces blank regions in the depth maps, which can offer additional insights to complement the RGB image features for glass surface detection. In this work, we first propose a large-scale RGB-D glass surface detection dataset, \textit{RGB-D GSD}, for rigorous experiments and future research. It contains 3,009 images, paired with precise annotations, offering a wide range of real-world RGB-D glass surface categories. We then propose a novel glass surface detection framework combining RGB and depth information, with two novel modules: a cross-modal context mining (CCM) module to adaptively learn individual and mutual context features from RGB and depth information, and a depth-missing aware attention (DAA) module to explicitly exploit spatial locations where missing depths occur to help detect the presence of glass surfaces. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyuan Liu, Runjia Lin, Guanyao Wu, Risheng Liu, Zhongxuan Luo, Xin Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion targets to provide an informative image by combining complementary information from different sensors. Existing learning-based fusion approaches attempt to construct various loss functions to preserve complementary features, while neglecting to discover the inter-relationship between the two modalities, leading to redundant or even invalid information on the fusion results. Moreover, most methods focus on strengthening the network with an increase in depth while neglecting the importance of feature transmission, causing vital information degeneration. To alleviate these issues, we propose a coupled contrastive learning network, dubbed CoCoNet, to realize infrared and visible image fusion in an end-to-end manner. Concretely, to simultaneously retain typical features from both modalities and to avoid artifacts emerging on the fused result, we develop a coupled contrastive constraint in our loss function. In a fused image, its foreground target / background detail part is pulled close to the infrared / visible source and pushed far away from the visible / infrared source in the representation space. We further exploit image characteristics to provide data-sensitive weights, allowing our loss function to build a more reliable relationship with source images. A multi-level attention module is established to learn rich hierarchical feature representation and to comprehensively transfer features in the fusion process. We also apply the proposed CoCoNet on medical image fusion of different types, e.g., magnetic resonance image, positron emission tomography image, and single photon emission computed tomography image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under both subjective and objective evaluation, especially in preserving prominent targets and recovering vital textural details.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of producing trustworthy and accurate compact models for edge devices. While Knowledge Distillation (KD) has improved model compression in terms of achieving high accuracy performance, calibration of these compact models has been overlooked. We introduce BD-KD (Balanced Divergence Knowledge Distillation), a framework for logit-based online KD. BD-KD enhances both accuracy and model calibration simultaneously, eliminating the need for post-hoc recalibration techniques, which add computational overhead to the overall training pipeline and degrade performance. Our method encourages student-centered training by adjusting the conventional online distillation loss on both the student and teacher losses, employing sample-wise weighting of forward and reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence. This strategy balances student network confidence and boosts performance. Experiments across CIFAR10, CIFAR100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet datasets, and various architectures demonstrate improved calibration and accuracy compared to recent online KD methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models, which employ stochastic differential equations to sample images through integrals, have emerged as a dominant class of generative models. However, the rationality of the diffusion process itself receives limited attention, leaving the question of whether the problem is well-posed and well-conditioned. In this paper, we explore a perplexing tendency of diffusion models: they often display the infinite Lipschitz property of the network with respect to time variable near the zero point. We provide theoretical proofs to illustrate the presence of infinite Lipschitz constants and empirical results to confirm it. The Lipschitz singularities pose a threat to the stability and accuracy during both the training and inference processes of diffusion models. Therefore, the mitigation of Lipschitz singularities holds great potential for enhancing the performance of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, dubbed E-TSDM, which alleviates the Lipschitz singularities of the diffusion model near the zero point of timesteps. Remarkably, our technique yields a substantial improvement in performance. Moreover, as a byproduct of our method, we achieve a dramatic reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance of acceleration methods relying on network Lipschitz, including DDIM and DPM-Solver, by over 33%. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets validate our theory and method. Our work may advance the understanding of the general diffusion process, and also provide insights for the design of diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farina Riaz, Shahab Abdulla, Hajime Suzuki, Srinjoy Ganguly, Ravinesh C. Deo, Susan Hopkins</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past few years, there has been significant interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) among researchers, as it has the potential to transform the field of machine learning. Several models that exploit the properties of quantum mechanics have been developed for practical applications. In this study, we investigated the application of our previously proposed quantum pre-processing filter (QPF) to binary image classification. We evaluated the QPF on four datasets: MNIST (handwritten digits), EMNIST (handwritten digits and alphabets), CIFAR-10 (photographic images) and GTSRB (real-life traffic sign images). Similar to our previous multi-class classification results, the application of QPF improved the binary image classification accuracy using neural network against MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 from 98.9% to 99.2%, 97.8% to 98.3%, and 71.2% to 76.1%, respectively, but degraded it against GTSRB from 93.5% to 92.0%. We then applied QPF in cases using a smaller number of training and testing samples, i.e. 80 and 20 samples per class, respectively. In order to derive statistically stable results, we conducted the experiment with 100 trials choosing randomly different training and testing samples and averaging the results. The result showed that the application of QPF did not improve the image classification accuracy against MNIST and EMNIST but improved it against CIFAR-10 and GTSRB from 65.8% to 67.2% and 90.5% to 91.8%, respectively. Further research will be conducted as part of future work to investigate the potential of QPF to assess the scalability of the proposed approach to larger and complex datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The accurate reconstruction of dynamic scenes with neural radiance fields is significantly dependent on the estimation of camera poses. Widely used structure-from-motion pipelines encounter difficulties in accurately tracking the camera trajectory when faced with separate dynamics of the scene content and the camera movement. To address this challenge, we propose Dynamic Motion-Aware Fast and Robust Camera Localization for Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (DynaMoN). DynaMoN utilizes semantic segmentation and generic motion masks to handle dynamic content for initial camera pose estimation and statics-focused ray sampling for fast and accurate novel-view synthesis. Our novel iterative learning scheme switches between training the NeRF and updating the pose parameters for an improved reconstruction and trajectory estimation quality. The proposed pipeline shows significant acceleration of the training process. We extensively evaluate our approach on two real-world dynamic datasets, the TUM RGB-D dataset and the BONN RGB-D Dynamic dataset. DynaMoN improves over the state-of-the-art both in terms of reconstruction quality and trajectory accuracy. We plan to make our code public to enhance research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheyuan Zhang, Lanhong Yao, Bin Wang, Debesh Jha, Gorkem Durak, Elif Keles, Alpay Medetalibeyoglu, Ulas Bagci</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale, big-variant, high-quality data are crucial for developing robust and successful deep-learning models for medical applications since they potentially enable better generalization performance and avoid overfitting. However, the scarcity of high-quality labeled data always presents significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this challenge by developing controllable diffusion models for medical image synthesis, called DiffBoost. We leverage recent diffusion probabilistic models to generate realistic and diverse synthetic medical image data that preserve the essential characteristics of the original medical images by incorporating edge information of objects to guide the synthesis process. In our approach, we ensure that the synthesized samples adhere to medically relevant constraints and preserve the underlying structure of imaging data. Due to the random sampling process by the diffusion model, we can generate an arbitrary number of synthetic images with diverse appearances. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct an extensive set of medical image segmentation experiments on multiple datasets, including Ultrasound breast (+13.87%), CT spleen (+0.38%), and MRI prostate (+7.78%), achieving significant improvements over the baseline segmentation methods. The promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of our \textcolor{black}{DiffBoost} for medical image segmentation tasks and show the feasibility of introducing a first-ever text-guided diffusion model for general medical image segmentation tasks. With carefully designed ablation experiments, we investigate the influence of various data augmentations, hyper-parameter settings, patch size for generating random merging mask settings, and combined influence with different network architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuqian Ren, Wenjia Wang, Dingding Cai, Tuuli Tuominen, Juho Kannala, Esa Rahtu</p>
<p>Abstract: Metaverse technologies demand accurate, real-time, and immersive modeling on consumer-grade hardware for both non-human perception (e.g., drone/robot/autonomous car navigation) and immersive technologies like AR/VR, requiring both structural accuracy and photorealism. However, there exists a knowledge gap in how to apply geometric reconstruction and photorealism modeling (novel view synthesis) in a unified framework. To address this gap and promote the development of robust and immersive modeling and rendering with consumer-grade devices, we propose a real-world Multi-Sensor Hybrid Room Dataset (MuSHRoom). Our dataset presents exciting challenges and requires state-of-the-art methods to be cost-effective, robust to noisy data and devices, and can jointly learn 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis instead of treating them as separate tasks, making them ideal for real-world applications. We benchmark several famous pipelines on our dataset for joint 3D mesh reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our dataset and benchmark show great potential in promoting the improvements for fusing 3D reconstruction and high-quality rendering in a robust and computationally efficient end-to-end fashion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Zhao, Zeyu Ding, Yong Zhou, Hancheng Zhu, Wenliang Du, Rui Yao, Abdulmotaleb El Saddik</p>
<p>Abstract: Oriented object detection presents a challenging task due to the presence of object instances with multiple orientations, varying scales, and dense distributions. Recently, end-to-end detectors have made significant strides by employing attention mechanisms and refining a fixed number of queries through consecutive decoder layers. However, existing end-to-end oriented object detectors still face two primary challenges: 1) misalignment between positional queries and keys, leading to inconsistency between classification and localization; and 2) the presence of a large number of similar queries, which complicates one-to-one label assignments and optimization. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end oriented detector called the Rotated Query Transformer, which integrates two key technologies: Rotated RoI Attention (RRoI Attention) and Selective Distinct Queries (SDQ). First, RRoI Attention aligns positional queries and keys from oriented regions of interest through cross-attention. Second, SDQ collects queries from intermediate decoder layers and filters out similar ones to generate distinct queries, thereby facilitating the optimization of one-to-one label assignments. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on four remote sensing datasets and one scene text dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. To further validate its generalization capability, we also extend our approach to horizontal object detection The code is available at \url{https://github.com/wokaikaixinxin/RQFormer}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Jiang, Boshu Lei, Kostas Daniilidis</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses the challenging problem of active view selection and uncertainty quantification within the domain of Radiance Fields. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have greatly advanced image rendering and reconstruction, but the cost of acquiring images poses the need to select the most informative viewpoints efficiently. Existing approaches depend on modifying the model architecture or hypothetical perturbation field to indirectly approximate the model uncertainty. However, selecting views from indirect approximation does not guarantee optimal information gain for the model. By leveraging Fisher Information, we directly quantify observed information on the parameters of Radiance Fields and select candidate views by maximizing the Expected Information Gain(EIG). Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple tasks, including view selection, active mapping, and uncertainty quantification, demonstrating its potential to advance the field of Radiance Fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijie Wang, Wenqi Ren, Guofeng Mei, Bin Ren, Xiaoshui Huang, Fabio Poiesi, Nicu Sebe, Bruno Lepri</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D point cloud registration methods rely on labeled 3D datasets for training, which limits their practical applications in real-world scenarios and often hinders generalization to unseen scenes. Leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of foundation models offers a promising solution to these challenges. In this paper, we introduce ZeroReg, a zero-shot registration approach that utilizes 2D foundation models to predict 3D correspondences. Specifically, ZeroReg adopts an object-to-point matching strategy, starting with object localization and semantic feature extraction from multi-view images using foundation models. In the object matching stage, semantic features help identify correspondences between objects across views. However, relying solely on semantic features can lead to ambiguity, especially in scenes with multiple instances of the same category. To address this, we construct scene graphs to capture spatial relationships among objects and apply a graph matching algorithm to these graphs to accurately identify matched objects. Finally, computing fine-grained point-level correspondences within matched object regions using algorithms like SuperGlue and LoFTR achieves robust point cloud registration. Evaluations on benchmarks such as 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and ScanNet demonstrate ZeroReg's competitive performance, highlighting its potential to advance point-cloud registration by integrating semantic features from foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungju Cho, Hongsin Lee, Changick Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches against adversarial attacks. However, adversarial training has primarily been studied in scenarios where data for all classes is provided, with limited research conducted in the context of incremental learning where knowledge is introduced sequentially. In this study, we investigate Adversarially Robust Class Incremental Learning (ARCIL), which deals with adversarial robustness in incremental learning. We first explore a series of baselines that integrate incremental learning with existing adversarial training methods, finding that they lead to conflicts between acquiring new knowledge and retaining past knowledge. Furthermore, we discover that training new knowledge causes the disappearance of a key characteristic in robust models: a flat loss landscape in input space. To address such issues, we propose a novel and robust baseline for ARCIL, named \textbf{FL}atness-preserving \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{I}ncremental learning for \textbf{R}obustness (\textbf{FLAIR}). Experimental results demonstrate that FLAIR significantly outperforms other baselines. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to comprehensively investigate the baselines, challenges, and solutions for ARCIL, which we believe represents a significant advance toward achieving real-world robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Kong, Xurui Song, Shuo Huai, Baixin Xu, Jun Luo, Ying He</p>
<p>Abstract: While 3D head reconstruction is widely used for modeling, existing neural reconstruction approaches rely on high-resolution multi-view images, posing notable privacy issues. Individuals are particularly sensitive to facial features, and facial image leakage can lead to many malicious activities, such as unauthorized tracking and deepfake. In contrast, geometric data is less susceptible to misuse due to its complex processing requirements, and absence of facial texture features. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage 3D facial reconstruction method aimed at avoiding exposure to sensitive facial information while preserving detailed geometric accuracy. Our approach first uses non-sensitive rear-head images for initial geometry and then refines this geometry using processed privacy-removed gradient images. Extensive experiments show that the resulting geometry is comparable to methods using full images, while the process is resistant to DeepFake applications and facial recognition (FR) systems, thereby proving its effectiveness in privacy protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaniv Zimmer, Oren Glickman</p>
<p>Abstract: The selection of hyperspectral bands plays a pivotal role in remote sensing and image analysis, with the aim of identifying the most informative spectral bands while minimizing computational overhead. This paper introduces a pioneering approach for hyperspectral band selection that offers an embedded solution, making it well-suited for resource-constrained or real-time applications. Our proposed method, embedded hyperspectral band selection (EHBS), excels in selecting the best bands without needing prior processing, seamlessly integrating with the downstream task model. This is achieved through stochastic band gates along with an approximation of the $l0$ norm on the number of selected bands as the regularization term and the integration of a dynamic optimizer, DoG, which removes the need for the required tuning of the learning rate.
  We conduct experiments on two distinct semantic-segmentation hyperspectral benchmark datasets, demonstrating their superiority in terms of accuracy and ease of use compared to many common and state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our contributions extend beyond hyperspectral band selection. Our approach's adaptability to other tasks, especially those involving grouped features, opens promising avenues for broader applications within the realm of deep learning, such as feature selection for feature groups.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of autonomous driving systems hinges on the ability to achieve low-latency and high-accuracy perception. To address this critical need, this paper introduces Dynamic Routing Network (DyRoNet), a low-rank enhanced dynamic routing framework designed for streaming perception in autonomous driving systems. DyRoNet integrates a suite of pre-trained branch networks, each meticulously fine-tuned to function under distinct environmental conditions. At its core, the framework offers a speed router module, developed to assess and route input data to the most suitable branch for processing. This approach not only addresses the inherent limitations of conventional models in adapting to diverse driving conditions but also ensures the balance between performance and efficiency. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the adaptability of DyRoNet to diverse branch selection strategies, resulting in significant performance enhancements across different scenarios. This work establishes a new benchmark for streaming perception and provides valuable engineering insights for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anindya Mondal, Sauradip Nag, Xiatian Zhu, Anjan Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: Object counting is pivotal for understanding the composition of scenes. Previously, this task was dominated by class-specific methods, which have gradually evolved into more adaptable class-agnostic strategies. However, these strategies come with their own set of limitations, such as the need for manual exemplar input and multiple passes for multiple categories, resulting in significant inefficiencies. This paper introduces a more practical approach enabling simultaneous counting of multiple object categories using an open-vocabulary framework. Our solution, OmniCount, stands out by using semantic and geometric insights (priors) from pre-trained models to count multiple categories of objects as specified by users, all without additional training. OmniCount distinguishes itself by generating precise object masks and leveraging varied interactive prompts via the Segment Anything Model for efficient counting. To evaluate OmniCount, we created the OmniCount-191 benchmark, a first-of-its-kind dataset with multi-label object counts, including points, bounding boxes, and VQA annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation in OmniCount-191, alongside other leading benchmarks, demonstrates OmniCount's exceptional performance, significantly outpacing existing solutions.

<p>Abstract: This paper extensively investigates the effectiveness of synthetic training data to improve the capabilities of vision-and-language models for grounding textual descriptions to image regions. We explore various strategies to best generate image-text pairs and image-text-box triplets using a series of pretrained models under different settings and varying degrees of reliance on real data.

Our findings show that SynGround can improve the localization capabilities of off-the-shelf vision-and-language models and offers the potential for arbitrarily large scale data generation. Particularly, data generated with SynGround improves the pointing game accuracy of a pretrained ALBEF and BLIP models by 4.81% and 17.11% absolute percentage points, respectively, across the RefCOCO+ and the Flickr30k benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel end-to-end algorithm (PoCo) for the indoor RGB-D place recognition task, aimed at identifying the most likely match for a given query frame within a reference database. The task presents inherent challenges attributed to the constrained field of view and limited range of perception sensors. We propose a new network architecture, which generalizes the recent Context of Clusters (CoCs) to extract global descriptors directly from the noisy point clouds through end-to-end learning. Moreover, we develop the architecture by integrating both color and geometric modalities into the point features to enhance the global descriptor representation. We conducted evaluations on public datasets ScanNet-PR and ARKit with 807 and 5047 scenarios, respectively. PoCo achieves SOTA performance: on ScanNet-PR, we achieve R@1 of 64.63%, a 5.7% improvement from the best-published result CGis (61.12%); on Arkit, we achieve R@1 of 45.12%, a 13.3% improvement from the best-published result CGis (39.82%). In addition, PoCo shows higher efficiency than CGis in inference time (1.75X-faster), and we demonstrate the effectiveness of PoCo in recognizing places within a real-world laboratory environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Guo, Shanmin Pang, Xiaojun Jia, Yang Liu, Qing Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks, particularly \textbf{targeted} transfer-based attacks, can be used to assess the adversarial robustness of large visual-language models (VLMs), allowing for a more thorough examination of potential security flaws before deployment. However, previous transfer-based adversarial attacks incur high costs due to high iteration counts and complex method structure. Furthermore, due to the unnaturalness of adversarial semantics, the generated adversarial examples have low transferability. These issues limit the utility of existing methods for assessing robustness. To address these issues, we propose AdvDiffVLM, which uses diffusion models to generate natural, unrestricted and targeted adversarial examples via score matching. Specifically, AdvDiffVLM uses Adaptive Ensemble Gradient Estimation to modify the score during the diffusion model's reverse generation process, ensuring that the produced adversarial examples have natural adversarial targeted semantics, which improves their transferability. Simultaneously, to improve the quality of adversarial examples, we use the GradCAM-guided Mask method to disperse adversarial semantics throughout the image rather than concentrating them in a single area. Finally, AdvDiffVLM embeds more target semantics into adversarial examples after multiple iterations. Experimental results show that our method generates adversarial examples 5x to 10x faster than state-of-the-art transfer-based adversarial attacks while maintaining higher quality adversarial examples. Furthermore, compared to previous transfer-based adversarial attacks, the adversarial examples generated by our method have better transferability. Notably, AdvDiffVLM can successfully attack a variety of commercial VLMs in a black-box environment, including GPT-4V.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given an original image, image editing aims to generate an image that align with the provided instruction. The challenges are to accept multimodal inputs as instructions and a scarcity of high-quality training data, including crucial triplets of source/target image pairs and multimodal (text and image) instructions. In this paper, we focus on image style editing and present StyleBooth, a method that proposes a comprehensive framework for image editing and a feasible strategy for building a high-quality style editing dataset. We integrate encoded textual instruction and image exemplar as a unified condition for diffusion model, enabling the editing of original image following multimodal instructions. Furthermore, by iterative style-destyle tuning and editing and usability filtering, the StyleBooth dataset provides content-consistent stylized/plain image pairs in various categories of styles. To show the flexibility of StyleBooth, we conduct experiments on diverse tasks, such as text-based style editing, exemplar-based style editing and compositional style editing. The results demonstrate that the quality and variety of training data significantly enhance the ability to preserve content and improve the overall quality of generated images in editing tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Gong, Qi Zhang, Guangyin Bao, Lei Zhu, Ke Liu, Liang Hu, Duoqian Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding natural visual scenes from brain activity has flourished, with extensive research in single-subject tasks and, however, less in cross-subject tasks. Reconstructing high-quality images in cross-subject tasks is a challenging problem due to profound individual differences between subjects and the scarcity of data annotation. In this work, we proposed MindTuner for cross-subject visual decoding, which achieves high-quality and rich semantic reconstructions using only 1 hour of fMRI training data benefiting from the phenomena of visual fingerprint in the human visual system and a novel fMRI-to-text alignment paradigm. Firstly, we pre-train a multi-subject model among 7 subjects and fine-tune it with scarce data on new subjects, where LoRAs with Skip-LoRAs are utilized to learn the visual fingerprint. Then, we take the image modality as the intermediate pivot modality to achieve fMRI-to-text alignment, which achieves impressive fMRI-to-text retrieval performance and corrects fMRI-to-image reconstruction with fine-tuned semantics. The results of both qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that MindTuner surpasses state-of-the-art cross-subject visual decoding models on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), whether using training data of 1 hour or 40 hours.</p>

<p>Abstract: Painterly image harmonization aims at seamlessly blending disparate visual elements within a single image. However, previous approaches often struggle due to limitations in training data or reliance on additional prompts, leading to inharmonious and content-disrupted output. To surmount these hurdles, we design a Training-and-prompt-Free General Painterly Harmonization method (TF-GPH). TF-GPH incorporates a novel ``Similarity Disentangle Mask'', which disentangles the foreground content and background image by redirecting their attention to corresponding reference images, enhancing the attention mechanism for multi-image inputs. Additionally, we propose a ``Similarity Reweighting'' mechanism to balance harmonization between stylization and content preservation. This mechanism minimizes content disruption by prioritizing the content-similar features within the given background style reference. Finally, we address the deficiencies in existing benchmarks by proposing novel range-based evaluation metrics and a new benchmark to better reflect real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in all benchmarks. More detailed in https://github.com/BlueDyee/TF-GPH.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyin Bao, Qi Zhang, Zixuan Gong, Jialei Zhou, Wei Fan, Kun Yi, Usman Naseem, Liang Hu, Duoqian Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding visual information from human brain activity has seen remarkable advancements in recent research. However, the diversity in cortical parcellation and fMRI patterns across individuals has prompted the development of deep learning models tailored to each subject. The personalization limits the broader applicability of brain visual decoding in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Wills Aligner, a novel approach designed to achieve multi-subject collaborative brain visual decoding. Wills Aligner begins by aligning the fMRI data from different subjects at the anatomical level. It then employs delicate mixture-of-brain-expert adapters and a meta-learning strategy to account for individual fMRI pattern differences. Additionally, Wills Aligner leverages the semantic relation of visual stimuli to guide the learning of inter-subject commonality, enabling visual decoding for each subject to draw insights from other subjects' data. We rigorously evaluate our Wills Aligner across various visual decoding tasks, including classification, cross-modal retrieval, and image reconstruction. The experimental results demonstrate that Wills Aligner achieves promising performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiongjun Guan, Zhiyu Pan, Jianjiang Feng, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, portable electronic devices are becoming more and more popular. For lightweight considerations, their fingerprint recognition modules usually use limited-size sensors. However, partial fingerprints have few matchable features, especially when there are differences in finger pressing posture or image quality, which makes partial fingerprint verification challenging. Most existing methods regard fingerprint position rectification and identity verification as independent tasks, ignoring the coupling relationship between them -- relative pose estimation typically relies on paired features as anchors, and authentication accuracy tends to improve with more precise pose alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for joint identity verification and pose alignment of partial fingerprint pairs, aiming to leverage their inherent correlation to improve each other. To achieve this, we present a multi-task CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)-Transformer hybrid network, and design a pre-training task to enhance the feature extraction capability. Experiments on multiple public datasets (NIST SD14, FVC2002 DB1A & DB3A, FVC2004 DB1A & DB2A, FVC2006 DB1A) and an in-house dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both partial fingerprint verification and relative pose estimation, while being more efficient than previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangmin Woo, Jaehyuk Jang, Donguk Kim, Yubin Choi, Changick Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have revolutionized how machines understand and generate textual responses based on visual inputs, yet they often produce "hallucinatory" outputs that misinterpret visual information, posing challenges in reliability and trustworthiness. We propose RITUAL, a simple decoding method that reduces hallucinations by leveraging randomly transformed images as complementary inputs during decoding, adjusting the output probability distribution without additional training or external models. Our key insight is that random transformations expose the model to diverse visual perspectives, enabling it to correct misinterpretations that lead to hallucinations. Specifically, when a model hallucinates based on the original image, the transformed images -- altered in aspects such as orientation, scale, or color -- provide alternative viewpoints that help recalibrate the model's predictions. By integrating the probability distributions from both the original and transformed images, RITUAL effectively reduces hallucinations. To further improve reliability and address potential instability from arbitrary transformations, we introduce RITUAL+, an extension that selects image transformations based on self-feedback from the LVLM. Instead of applying transformations randomly, RITUAL+ uses the LVLM to evaluate and choose transformations that are most beneficial for reducing hallucinations in a given context. This self-adaptive approach mitigates the potential negative impact of certain transformations on specific tasks, ensuring more consistent performance across different scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that RITUAL and RITUAL+ significantly reduce hallucinations across several object hallucination benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ron Keuth, Lasse Hansen, Maren Balks, Ronja J\"ager, Anne-Nele Schr\"oder, Ludger T\"ushaus, Mattias Heinrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Semantic segmentation and landmark detection are fundamental tasks of medical image processing, facilitating further analysis of anatomical objects. Although deep learning-based pixel-wise classification has set a new-state-of-the-art for segmentation, it falls short in landmark detection, a strength of shape-based approaches. Methods: In this work, we propose a dense image-to-shape representation that enables the joint learning of landmarks and semantic segmentation by employing a fully convolutional architecture. Our method intuitively allows the extraction of arbitrary landmarks due to its representation of anatomical correspondences. We benchmark our method against the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation (nnUNet), a shape-based approach employing geometric deep learning and a convolutional neural network-based method for landmark detection. Results: We evaluate our method on two medical dataset: one common benchmark featuring the lungs, heart, and clavicle from thorax X-rays, and another with 17 different bones in the paediatric wrist. While our method is on pair with the landmark detection baseline in the thorax setting (error in mm of $2.6\pm0.9$ vs $2.7\pm0.9$), it substantially surpassed it in the more complex wrist setting ($1.1\pm0.6$ vs $1.9\pm0.5$). Conclusion: We demonstrate that dense geometric shape representation is beneficial for challenging landmark detection tasks and outperforms previous state-of-the-art using heatmap regression. While it does not require explicit training on the landmarks themselves, allowing for the addition of new landmarks without necessitating retraining.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Guo, Junhao Zhao, Chaoqun Du, Yulin Wang, Chunjiang Ge, Zanlin Ni, Shiji Song, Humphrey Shi, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to improve the performance of source-domain pre-trained models on previously unseen, shifted target domains. Traditional TTA methods primarily adapt model weights based on target data streams, making model performance sensitive to the amount and order of target data. The recently proposed diffusion-driven TTA methods mitigate this by adapting model inputs instead of weights, where an unconditional diffusion model, trained on the source domain, transforms target-domain data into a synthetic domain that is expected to approximate the source domain. However, in this paper, we reveal that although the synthetic data in diffusion-driven TTA seems indistinguishable from the source data, it is unaligned with, or even markedly different from the latter for deep networks. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{S}ynthetic-\textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}lignment (SDA) framework. Our key insight is to fine-tune the source model with synthetic data to ensure better alignment. Specifically, we first employ a conditional diffusion model to generate labeled samples, creating a synthetic dataset. Subsequently, we use the aforementioned unconditional diffusion model to add noise to and denoise each sample before fine-tuning. This Mix of Diffusion (MoD) process mitigates the potential domain misalignment between the conditional and unconditional models. Extensive experiments across classifiers, segmenters, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs, \eg, LLaVA) demonstrate that SDA achieves superior domain alignment and consistently outperforms existing diffusion-driven TTA methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Liu, Mengzhen Liu, Zhenyu Wang, Pengju An, Xiaoqi Li, Kaichen Zhou, Senqiao Yang, Renrui Zhang, Yandong Guo, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental objective in robot manipulation is to enable models to comprehend visual scenes and execute actions. Although existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robots can handle a range of basic tasks, they still face challenges in two areas: (1) insufficient reasoning ability to tackle complex tasks, and (2) high computational costs for VLA model fine-tuning and inference. The recently proposed state space model (SSM) known as Mamba demonstrates promising capabilities in non-trivial sequence modeling with linear inference complexity. Inspired by this, we introduce RoboMamba, an end-to-end robotic VLA model that leverages Mamba to deliver both robotic reasoning and action capabilities, while maintaining efficient fine-tuning and inference. Specifically, we first integrate the vision encoder with Mamba, aligning visual tokens with language embedding through co-training, empowering our model with visual common sense and robotic-related reasoning. To further equip RoboMamba with SE(3) pose prediction abilities, we explore an efficient fine-tuning strategy with a simple policy head. We find that once RoboMamba possesses sufficient reasoning capability, it can acquire manipulation skills with minimal fine-tuning parameters (0.1\% of the model) and time. In experiments, RoboMamba demonstrates outstanding reasoning capabilities on general and robotic evaluation benchmarks. Meanwhile, our model showcases impressive pose prediction results in both simulation and real-world experiments, achieving inference speeds 3 times faster than existing VLA models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Scott Geng, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Vivek Ramanujan, Matthew Wallingford, Chun-Liang Li, Pang Wei Koh, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative text-to-image models enable us to synthesize unlimited amounts of images in a controllable manner, spurring many recent efforts to train vision models with synthetic data. However, every synthetic image ultimately originates from the upstream data used to train the generator. Does the intermediate generator provide additional information over directly training on relevant parts of the upstream data? Grounding this question in the setting of image classification, we compare finetuning on task-relevant, targeted synthetic data generated by Stable Diffusion -- a generative model trained on the LAION-2B dataset -- against finetuning on targeted real images retrieved directly from LAION-2B. We show that while synthetic data can benefit some downstream tasks, it is universally matched or outperformed by real data from the simple retrieval baseline. Our analysis suggests that this underperformance is partially due to generator artifacts and inaccurate task-relevant visual details in the synthetic images. Overall, we argue that targeted retrieval is a critical baseline to consider when training with synthetic data -- a baseline that current methods do not yet surpass.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Wang, Chen Li, Huiying Xu, Xinzhong Zhu, Hongbo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Driven by the rapid development of deep learning technology, the YOLO series has set a new benchmark for real-time object detectors. Additionally, transformer-based structures have emerged as the most powerful solution in the field, greatly extending the model's receptive field and achieving significant performance improvements. However, this improvement comes at a cost as the quadratic complexity of the self-attentive mechanism increases the computational burden of the model. To address this problem, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline approach called Mamba YOLO. Our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose that the ODMamba backbone introduce a \textbf{S}tate \textbf{S}pace \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{SSM}) with linear complexity to address the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Unlike the other Transformer-base and SSM-base method, ODMamba is simple to train without pretraining. 2) For real-time requirement, we designed the macro structure of ODMamba, determined the optimal stage ratio and scaling size. 3) We design the RG Block that employs a multi-branch structure to model the channel dimensions, which addresses the possible limitations of SSM in sequence modeling, such as insufficient receptive fields and weak image localization. This design captures localized image dependencies more accurately and significantly. Extensive experiments on the publicly available COCO benchmark dataset show that Mamba YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous methods. Specifically, a tiny version of Mamba YOLO achieves a \textbf{7.5}\% improvement in mAP on a single 4090 GPU with an inference time of \textbf{1.5} ms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanyu Yi, Zike Wu, Qiuhong Shen, Qingshan Xu, Pan Zhou, Joo-Hwee Lim, Shuicheng Yan, Xinchao Wang, Hanwang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent 3D large reconstruction models (LRMs) can generate high-quality 3D content in sub-seconds by integrating multi-view diffusion models with scalable multi-view reconstructors. Current works further leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting as 3D representation for improved visual quality and rendering efficiency. However, we observe that existing Gaussian reconstruction models often suffer from multi-view inconsistency and blurred textures. We attribute this to the compromise of multi-view information propagation in favor of adopting powerful yet computationally intensive architectures (e.g., Transformers). To address this issue, we introduce MVGamba, a general and lightweight Gaussian reconstruction model featuring a multi-view Gaussian reconstructor based on the RNN-like State Space Model (SSM). Our Gaussian reconstructor propagates causal context containing multi-view information for cross-view self-refinement while generating a long sequence of Gaussians for fine-detail modeling with linear complexity. With off-the-shelf multi-view diffusion models integrated, MVGamba unifies 3D generation tasks from a single image, sparse images, or text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVGamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in all 3D content generation scenarios with approximately only $0.1\times$ of the model size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Xue, Xianghui Xie, Riccardo Marin, Gerard Pons-Moll</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating realistic avatars from a single RGB image is an attractive yet challenging problem. Due to its ill-posed nature, recent works leverage powerful prior from 2D diffusion models pretrained on large datasets. Although 2D diffusion models demonstrate strong generalization capability, they cannot provide multi-view shape priors with guaranteed 3D consistency. We propose Human 3Diffusion: Realistic Avatar Creation via Explicit 3D Consistent Diffusion. Our key insight is that 2D multi-view diffusion and 3D reconstruction models provide complementary information for each other, and by coupling them in a tight manner, we can fully leverage the potential of both models. We introduce a novel image-conditioned generative 3D Gaussian Splats reconstruction model that leverages the priors from 2D multi-view diffusion models, and provides an explicit 3D representation, which further guides the 2D reverse sampling process to have better 3D consistency. Experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and enables the creation of realistic avatars from a single RGB image, achieving high-fidelity in both geometry and appearance. Extensive ablations also validate the efficacy of our design, (1) multi-view 2D priors conditioning in generative 3D reconstruction and (2) consistency refinement of sampling trajectory via the explicit 3D representation.

<p>Abstract: Prototypical networks aim to build intrinsically explainable models based on the linear summation of concepts. Concepts are coherent entities that we, as humans, can recognize and associate with a certain object or entity. However, important challenges remain in the fair evaluation of explanation quality provided by these models. This work first proposes an extensive set of quantitative and qualitative metrics which allow to identify drawbacks in current prototypical networks. It then introduces a novel architecture which provides compact explanations, outperforming current prototypical models in terms of explanation quality. Overall, the proposed architecture demonstrates how frozen pre-trained ViT backbones can be effectively turned into prototypical models for both general and domain-specific tasks, in our case biomedical image classifiers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Hou, Guoqiang Wei, Yan Zeng, Zhibo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a training-free and robust solution to offer camera movement control for off-the-shelf video diffusion models. Unlike previous work, our method does not require any supervised finetuning on camera-annotated datasets or self-supervised training via data augmentation. Instead, it can be plugged and played with most pretrained video diffusion models and generate camera controllable videos with a single image or text prompt as input. The inspiration of our work comes from the layout prior that intermediate latents hold towards generated results, thus rearranging noisy pixels in them will make output content reallocated as well. As camera move could also be seen as a kind of pixel rearrangement caused by perspective change, videos could be reorganized following specific camera motion if their noisy latents change accordingly. Established on this, we propose our method CamTrol, which enables robust camera control for video diffusion models. It is achieved by a two-stage process. First, we model image layout rearrangement through explicit camera movement in 3D point cloud space. Second, we generate videos with camera motion using layout prior of noisy latents formed by a series of rearranged images. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the robustness our method holds in controlling camera motion of generated videos. Furthermore, we show that our method can produce impressive results in generating 3D rotation videos with dynamic content. Project page at https://lifedecoder.github.io/CamTrol/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianan Jiang, Hao Tang, Zhilin Jiang, Weiren Yu, Di Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (FG-SBIR) aims to minimize the distance between sketches and corresponding images in the embedding space. However, scalability is hindered by the growing complexity of solutions, mainly due to the abstract nature of fine-grained sketches. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to narrow the gap between the two domains. It mainly facilitates unified mutual information sharing both intra- and inter-samples, rather than treating them as a single feature alignment problem between modalities. Specifically, our approach includes: (i) Employing dual weight-sharing networks to optimize alignment within the sketch and image domain, which also effectively mitigates model learning saturation issues. (ii) Introducing an objective optimization function based on contrastive loss to enhance the model's ability to align features in both intra- and inter-samples. (iii) Presenting a self-supervised Multi-Scale Token Recycling (MSTR) Module featured by recycling discarded patch tokens in multi-scale features, further enhancing representation capability and retrieval performance. Our framework achieves excellent results on CNN- and ViT-based backbones. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. We also introduce Cloths-V1, the first professional fashion sketch-image dataset, utilized to validate our method and will be beneficial for other applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the integration of diverse patient data sources into multimodal language models for automated chest X-ray (CXR) report generation. Traditionally, CXR report generation relies solely on CXR images and limited radiology data, overlooking valuable information from patient health records, particularly from emergency departments. Utilising the MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-IV-ED datasets, we incorporate detailed patient information such as vital signs, medicines, and clinical history to enhance diagnostic accuracy. We introduce a novel approach to transform these heterogeneous data sources into embeddings that prompt a multimodal language model; this significantly enhances the diagnostic accuracy of generated radiology reports. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the benefits of using a broader set of patient data, underscoring the potential for enhanced diagnostic capabilities and better patient outcomes through the integration of multimodal data in CXR report generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Liang, Jiawei Liang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Aishan Liu, Mingli Zhu, Xiaochun Cao, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning enhances large vision-language models (LVLMs) but increases their vulnerability to backdoor attacks due to their open design. Unlike prior studies in static settings, this paper explores backdoor attacks in LVLM instruction tuning across mismatched training and testing domains. We introduce a new evaluation dimension, backdoor domain generalization, to assess attack robustness under visual and text domain shifts. Our findings reveal two insights: (1) backdoor generalizability improves when distinctive trigger patterns are independent of specific data domains or model architectures, and (2) the competitive interaction between trigger patterns and clean semantic regions, where guiding the model to predict triggers enhances attack generalizability. Based on these insights, we propose a multimodal attribution backdoor attack (MABA) that injects domain-agnostic triggers into critical areas using attributional interpretation. Experiments with OpenFlamingo, Blip-2, and Otter show that MABA significantly boosts the attack success rate of generalization by 36.4%, achieving a 97% success rate at a 0.2% poisoning rate. This study reveals limitations in current evaluations and highlights how enhanced backdoor generalizability poses a security threat to LVLMs, even without test data access.</p>

Processing long sequences of visual tokens is computationally expensive and memory-intensive, making long video question-answering a challenging task. The key is to compress visual tokens effectively, reducing memory footprint and decoding latency, while preserving the essential information for accurate question-answering. We adopt a hierarchical memory mechanism named STAR Memory, proposed in Flash-VStream, that is capable of processing long videos with limited GPU memory (VRAM). We further utilize the video and audio data of MovieChat-1K training set to fine-tune the pretrained weight released by Flash-VStream, achieving 1st place in the challenge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchuan Tian, Jianhong Han, Hanting Chen, Yuanyuan Xi, Ning Ding, Jie Hu, Chao Xu, Yunhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the unaffordable size and intensive computation costs of low-level vision models, All-in-One models that are designed to address a handful of low-level vision tasks simultaneously have been popular. However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer (IPT) that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. While most research propose feature adaptation methods, we reveal their failure in addressing highly distinct tasks, and suggest weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we search for task-sensitive weights and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn both general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. As an additional feature, we enable Instruct-IPT to receive human prompts. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well.

Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) such as LLaVA mostly employ heterogeneous architectures that connect pre-trained visual encoders with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate visual recognition and complex reasoning. Although achieving remarkable performance with relatively lightweight training, we identify four primary scalability limitations: (1) The visual capacity is constrained by pre-trained visual encoders, which are typically an order of magnitude smaller than LLMs. (2) The heterogeneous architecture complicates the use of established hardware and software infrastructure. (3) Study of scaling laws on such architecture must consider three separate components - visual encoder, connector, and LLMs, which complicates the analysis. (4) The use of existing visual encoders typically requires following a pre-defined specification of image inputs pre-processing, for example, by reshaping inputs to fixed-resolution square images, which presents difficulties in processing and training on high-resolution images or those with unusual aspect ratio. A unified single Transformer architecture, like SOLO, effectively addresses these scalability concerns in LVLMs; however, its limited adoption in the modern context likely stems from the absence of reliable training recipes that balance both modalities and ensure stable training for billion-scale models. In this paper, we introduce the first open-source training recipe for developing SOLO, an open-source 7B LVLM using moderate academic resources. The training recipe involves initializing from LLMs, sequential pre-training on ImageNet and web-scale data, and instruction fine-tuning on our curated high-quality datasets. On extensive evaluation, SOLO demonstrates performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5-7B, particularly excelling in visual mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengkun Jiao, Xinlan Wu, Bin Zhu, Jingjing Chen, Chong-Wah Ngo, Yugang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have significantly advanced a variety of vision-language tasks. The scalability and availability of high-quality training data play a pivotal role in the success of LMMs. In the realm of food, while comprehensive food datasets such as Recipe1M offer an abundance of ingredient and recipe information, they often fall short of providing ample data for nutritional analysis. The Recipe1M+ dataset, despite offering a subset for nutritional evaluation, is limited in the scale and accuracy of nutrition information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-Food, a unified food dataset that comprises over 100,000 images with various food labels, including categories, ingredients, recipes, and ingredient-level nutritional information. Uni-Food is designed to provide a more holistic approach to food data analysis, thereby enhancing the performance and capabilities of LMMs in this domain. To mitigate the conflicts arising from multi-task supervision during fine-tuning of LMMs, we introduce a novel Linear Rectification Mixture of Diverse Experts (RoDE) approach. RoDE utilizes a diverse array of experts to address tasks of varying complexity, thereby facilitating the coordination of trainable parameters, i.e., it allocates more parameters for more complex tasks and, conversely, fewer parameters for simpler tasks. RoDE implements linear rectification union to refine the router's functionality, thereby enhancing the efficiency of sparse task allocation. These design choices endow RoDE with features that ensure GPU memory efficiency and ease of optimization. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing the inherent challenges of food-related multitasking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qifan Zhang, Yunhui Guo, Yu Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) focuses on using a teacher model to improve a student model. Traditionally, KD is studied in an offline fashion, where a training dataset is available before learning. In this work, we introduce the problem of Continual Distillation Learning (CDL) that considers KD in the Continual Learning (CL) setup. A teacher model and a student model need to learn a sequence of tasks, and the knowledge of the teacher model will be distilled to the student to improve the student model in an online fashion. The CDL problem is valuable to study since for prompt-based continual learning methods, using a larger vision transformer (ViT) leads to better performance in continual learning. Distilling the knowledge from a large ViT to a small ViT can improve inference efficiency for promptbased CL models. To this end, we conducted experiments to study the CDL problem with three prompt-based CL models, i.e., L2P, DualPrompt and CODA-Prompt, where we utilized logit distillation, feature distillation and prompt distillation for knowledge distillation from a teacher model to a student model. Our findings of this study can serve as baselines for future CDL work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Despina Konstantinidou, Christos Koutlis, Symeon Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI technologies produce increasingly realistic imagery, which, despite its potential for creative applications, can also be misused to produce misleading and harmful content. This renders Synthetic Image Detection (SID) methods essential for identifying AI-generated content online. State-of-the-art SID methods typically resize or center-crop input images due to architectural or computational constraints, which hampers the detection of artifacts that appear in high-resolution images. To address this limitation, we propose TextureCrop, an image pre-processing component that can be plugged in any pre-trained SID model to improve its performance. By focusing on high-frequency image parts where generative artifacts are prevalent, TextureCrop enhances SID performance with manageable memory requirements. Experimental results demonstrate a consistent improvement in AUC across various detectors by 6.1% compared to center cropping and by 15% compared to resizing, across high-resolution images from the Forensynths, Synthbuster and TWIGMA datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Perm, a learned parametric representation of human 3D hair designed to facilitate various hair-related applications. Unlike previous work that jointly models the global hair structure and local curl patterns, we propose to disentangle them using a PCA-based strand representation in the frequency domain, thereby allowing more precise editing and output control. Specifically, we leverage our strand representation to fit and decompose hair geometry textures into low- to high-frequency hair structures, termed guide textures and residual textures, respectively. These decomposed textures are later parameterized with different generative models, emulating common stages in the hair grooming process. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the architecture design of Perm, and finally deploy the trained model as a generic prior to solve task-agnostic problems, further showcasing its flexibility and superiority in tasks such as single-view hair reconstruction, hairstyle editing, and hair-conditioned image generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aashish Rai, Srinath Sridhar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce EgoSonics, a method to generate semantically meaningful and synchronized audio tracks conditioned on silent egocentric videos. Generating audio for silent egocentric videos could open new applications in virtual reality, assistive technologies, or for augmenting existing datasets. Existing work has been limited to domains like speech, music, or impact sounds and cannot capture the broad range of audio frequencies found in egocentric videos. EgoSonics addresses these limitations by building on the strengths of latent diffusion models for conditioned audio synthesis. We first encode and process paired audio-video data to make them suitable for generation. The encoded data is then used to train a model that can generate an audio track that captures the semantics of the input video. Our proposed SyncroNet builds on top of ControlNet to provide control signals that enables generation of temporally synchronized audio. Extensive evaluations and a comprehensive user study show that our model outperforms existing work in audio quality, and in our proposed synchronization evaluation method. Furthermore, we demonstrate downstream applications of our model in improving video summarization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ekta U. Samani, Ashis G. Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual object recognition in unseen and cluttered indoor environments is a challenging problem for mobile robots. This study presents a 3D shape and color-based descriptor, TOPS2, for point clouds generated from RGB-D images and an accompanying recognition framework, THOR2. The TOPS2 descriptor embodies object unity, a human cognition mechanism, by retaining the slicing-based topological representation of 3D shape from the TOPS descriptor while capturing object color information through slicing-based color embeddings computed using a network of coarse color regions. These color regions, analogous to the MacAdam ellipses identified in human color perception, are obtained using the Mapper algorithm, a topological soft-clustering technique. THOR2, trained using synthetic data, demonstrates markedly improved recognition accuracy compared to THOR, its 3D shape-based predecessor, on two benchmark real-world datasets: the OCID dataset capturing cluttered scenes from different viewpoints and the UW-IS Occluded dataset reflecting different environmental conditions and degrees of object occlusion recorded using commodity hardware. THOR2 also outperforms baseline deep learning networks, and a widely-used Vision Transformer (ViT) adapted for RGB-D inputs trained using synthetic and limited real-world data on both the datasets. Therefore, THOR2 is a promising step toward achieving robust recognition in low-cost robots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunlong Huang, Junshuo Liu, Ke Xian, Robert Caiming Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have significantly advanced the field of 3D human pose estimation (HPE). However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Huang, Ziyu Xu, Hai Wu, Jinlong Wang, Qiming Xia, Yan Xia, Jonathan Li, Kyle Gao, Chenglu Wen, Cheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-based vision systems are integral for 3D object detection, which is crucial for autonomous navigation. However, they suffer from performance degradation in adverse weather conditions due to the quality deterioration of LiDAR point clouds. Fusing LiDAR with the weather-robust 4D radar sensor is expected to solve this problem. However, the fusion of LiDAR and 4D radar is challenging because they differ significantly in terms of data quality and the degree of degradation in adverse weather. To address these issues, we introduce L4DR, a weather-robust 3D object detection method that effectively achieves LiDAR and 4D Radar fusion. Our L4DR includes Multi-Modal Encoding (MME) and Foreground-Aware Denoising (FAD) technique to reconcile sensor gaps, which is the first exploration of the complementarity of early fusion between LiDAR and 4D radar. Additionally, we design an Inter-Modal and Intra-Modal ({IM}2 ) parallel feature extraction backbone coupled with a Multi-Scale Gated Fusion (MSGF) module to counteract the varying degrees of sensor degradation under adverse weather conditions. Experimental evaluation on a VoD dataset with simulated fog proves that L4DR is more adaptable to changing weather conditions. It delivers a significant performance increase under different fog levels, improving the 3D mAP by up to 20.0% over the traditional LiDAR-only approach. Moreover, the results on the K-Radar dataset validate the consistent performance improvement of L4DR in real-world adverse weather conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yamin Sepehri, Pedram Pad, Pascal Frossard, L. Andrea Dunbar</p>
<p>Abstract: The training phase of deep neural networks requires substantial resources and as such is often performed on cloud servers. However, this raises privacy concerns when the training dataset contains sensitive content, e.g., facial or medical images. In this work, we propose a method to perform the training phase of a deep learning model on both an edge device and a cloud server that prevents sensitive content being transmitted to the cloud while retaining the desired information. The proposed privacy-preserving method uses adversarial early exits to suppress the sensitive content at the edge and transmits the task-relevant information to the cloud. This approach incorporates noise addition during the training phase to provide a differential privacy guarantee. We extensively test our method on different facial and medical datasets with diverse attributes using various deep learning architectures, showcasing its outstanding performance. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of privacy preservation through successful defenses against different white-box, deep and GAN-based reconstruction attacks. This approach is designed for resource-constrained edge devices, ensuring minimal memory usage and computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Chen, Yiwen Ye, Yongsheng Pan, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Although recent years have witnessed significant advancements in medical image segmentation, the pervasive issue of domain shift among medical images from diverse centres hinders the effective deployment of pre-trained models. Many Test-time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to address this issue by fine-tuning pre-trained models with test data during inference. These methods, however, often suffer from less-satisfactory optimization due to suboptimal optimization direction (dictated by the gradient) and fixed step-size (predicated on the learning rate). In this paper, we propose the Gradient alignment-based Test-time adaptation (GraTa) method to improve both the gradient direction and learning rate in the optimization procedure. Unlike conventional TTA methods, which primarily optimize the pseudo gradient derived from a self-supervised objective, our method incorporates an auxiliary gradient with the pseudo one to facilitate gradient alignment. Such gradient alignment enables the model to excavate the similarities between different gradients and correct the gradient direction to approximate the empirical gradient related to the current segmentation task. Additionally, we design a dynamic learning rate based on the cosine similarity between the pseudo and auxiliary gradients, thereby empowering the adaptive fine-tuning of pre-trained models on diverse test data. Extensive experiments establish the effectiveness of the proposed gradient alignment and dynamic learning rate and substantiate the superiority of our GraTa method over other state-of-the-art TTA methods on a benchmark medical image segmentation task.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-guided 3D avatar generation have made substantial progress by distilling knowledge from diffusion models. Despite the plausible generated appearance, existing methods cannot achieve fine-grained disentanglement or high-fidelity modeling between inner body and outfit. In this paper, we propose Barbie, a novel framework for generating 3D avatars that can be dressed in diverse and high-quality Barbie-like garments and accessories. Instead of relying on a holistic model, Barbie achieves fine-grained disentanglement on avatars by semantic-aligned separated models for human body and outfits. These disentangled 3D representations are then optimized by different expert models to guarantee the domain-specific fidelity. To balance geometry diversity and reasonableness, we propose a series of losses for template-preserving and human-prior evolving. The final avatar is enhanced by unified texture refinement for superior texture consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Barbie outperforms existing methods in both dressed human and outfit generation, supporting flexible apparel combination and animation.

<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved excellent performance over a wide range of tasks. However, the effectiveness of CLIP heavily relies on a substantial corpus of pre-training data, resulting in notable consumption of computational resources. Although knowledge distillation has been widely applied in single modality models, how to efficiently expand knowledge distillation to vision-language foundation models with extensive data remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-CID, a novel distillation mechanism that effectively transfers knowledge from a large vision-language foundation model to a smaller model. We initially propose a simple but efficient image semantic balance method to reduce transfer learning bias and improve distillation efficiency. This method filters out 43.7% of image-text pairs from the LAION400M while maintaining superior performance. After that, we leverage cluster-instance discrimination to facilitate knowledge transfer from the teacher model to the student model, thereby empowering the student model to acquire a holistic semantic comprehension of the pre-training data. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIP-CID achieves state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks including linear probe and zero-shot classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in text-to-image generation, most existing methods struggle to create images with multiple objects and complex spatial relationships in the 3D world. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a generic AI system, namely MUSES, for 3D-controllable image generation from user queries. Specifically, our MUSES addresses this challenging task by developing a progressive workflow with three key components, including (1) Layout Manager for 2D-to-3D layout lifting, (2) Model Engineer for 3D object acquisition and calibration, (3) Image Artist for 3D-to-2D image rendering. By mimicking the collaboration of human professionals, this multi-modal agent pipeline facilitates the effective and automatic creation of images with 3D-controllable objects, through an explainable integration of top-down planning and bottom-up generation. Additionally, we find that existing benchmarks lack detailed descriptions of complex 3D spatial relationships of multiple objects. To fill this gap, we further construct a new benchmark of T2I-3DisBench (3D image scene), which describes diverse 3D image scenes with 50 detailed prompts. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of MUSES on both T2I-CompBench and T2I-3DisBench, outperforming recent strong competitors such as DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3. These results demonstrate a significant step of MUSES forward in bridging natural language, 2D image generation, and 3D world.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minhyeok Lee, Suhwan Cho, Chajin Shin, Jungho Lee, Sunghun Yang, Sangyoun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Propagation-based video inpainting using optical flow at the pixel or feature level has recently garnered significant attention. However, it has limitations such as the inaccuracy of optical flow prediction and the propagation of noise over time. These issues result in non-uniform noise and time consistency problems throughout the video, which are particularly pronounced when the removed area is large and involves substantial movement. To address these issues, we propose a novel First Frame Filling Video Diffusion Inpainting model (FFF-VDI). We design FFF-VDI inspired by the capabilities of pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models that can transform the first frame image into a highly natural video. To apply this to the video inpainting task, we propagate the noise latent information of future frames to fill the masked areas of the first frame's noise latent code. Next, we fine-tune the pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model to generate the inpainted video. The proposed model addresses the limitations of existing methods that rely on optical flow quality, producing much more natural and temporally consistent videos. This proposed approach is the first to effectively integrate image-to-video diffusion models into video inpainting tasks. Through various comparative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model can robustly handle diverse inpainting types with high quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Object Affordance Grounding aims to predict the functional regions on a 3D object and has laid the foundation for a wide range of applications in robotics. Recent advances tackle this problem via learning a mapping between 3D regions and a single human-object interaction image. However, the geometric structure of the 3D object and the object in the human-object interaction image are not always consistent, leading to poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose to learn generalizable invariant affordance knowledge from multiple human-object interaction images within the same affordance category. Specifically, we introduce the \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}mage Guided Invariant-\textbf{F}eature-Aware 3D \textbf{A}ffordance \textbf{G}rounding (\textbf{MIFAG}) framework. It grounds 3D object affordance regions by identifying common interaction patterns across multiple human-object interaction images. First, the Invariant Affordance Knowledge Extraction Module (\textbf{IAM}) utilizes an iterative updating strategy to gradually extract aligned affordance knowledge from multiple images and integrate it into an affordance dictionary. Then, the Affordance Dictionary Adaptive Fusion Module (\textbf{ADM}) learns comprehensive point cloud representations that consider all affordance candidates in multiple images. Besides, the Multi-Image and Point Affordance (\textbf{MIPA}) benchmark is constructed and our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various experimental comparisons.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sensen Gao, Xiaojun Jia, Yihao Huang, Ranjie Duan, Jindong Gu, Yang Bai, Yang Liu, Qing Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image(T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in image generation and editing, yet these models still have many potential issues, particularly in generating inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work(NSFW) content. Strengthening attacks and uncovering such vulnerabilities can advance the development of reliable and practical T2I models. Most of the previous works treat T2I models as white-box systems, using gradient optimization to generate adversarial prompts. However, accessing the model's gradient is often impossible in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing defense methods, those using gradient masking, are designed to prevent attackers from obtaining accurate gradient information. While several black-box jailbreak attacks have been explored, they achieve the limited performance of jailbreaking T2I models due to difficulties associated with optimization in discrete spaces. To address this, we propose HTS-Attack, a heuristic token search attack method. HTS-Attack begins with an initialization that removes sensitive tokens, followed by a heuristic search where high-performing candidates are recombined and mutated. This process generates a new pool of candidates, and the optimal adversarial prompt is updated based on their effectiveness. By incorporating both optimal and suboptimal candidates, HTS-Attack avoids local optima and improves robustness in bypassing defenses. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in attacking the latest prompt checkers, post-hoc image checkers, securely trained T2I models, and online commercial models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Munish Monga, Sachin Kumar Giroh, Ankit Jha, Mainak Singha, Biplab Banerjee, Jocelyn Chanussot</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Target Domain Adaptation (MTDA) entails learning domain-invariant information from a single source domain and applying it to multiple unlabeled target domains. Yet, existing MTDA methods predominantly focus on addressing domain shifts within visual features, often overlooking semantic features and struggling to handle unknown classes, resulting in what is known as Open-Set (OS) MTDA. While large-scale vision-language foundation models like CLIP show promise, their potential for MTDA remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces COSMo, a novel method that learns domain-agnostic prompts through source domain-guided prompt learning to tackle the MTDA problem in the prompt space. By leveraging a domain-specific bias network and separate prompts for known and unknown classes, COSMo effectively adapts across domain and class shifts. To the best of our knowledge, COSMo is the first method to address Open-Set Multi-Target DA (OSMTDA), offering a more realistic representation of real-world scenarios and addressing the challenges of both open-set and multi-target DA. COSMo demonstrates an average improvement of $5.1\%$ across three challenging datasets: Mini-DomainNet, Office-31, and Office-Home, compared to other related DA methods adapted to operate within the OSMTDA setting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghao Qian, Mahdi Rezaei, Saeed Anwar, Wenjing Li, Tanveer Hussain, Mohsen Azarmi, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adverse conditions like snow, rain, nighttime, and fog, pose challenges for autonomous driving perception systems. Existing methods have limited effectiveness in improving essential computer vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, and often focus on only one specific condition, such as removing rain or translating nighttime images into daytime ones. To address these limitations, we propose a method to improve the visual quality and clarity degraded by such adverse conditions. Our method, AllWeather-Net, utilizes a novel hierarchical architecture to enhance images across all adverse conditions. This architecture incorporates information at three semantic levels: scene, object, and texture, by discriminating patches at each level. Furthermore, we introduce a Scaled Illumination-aware Attention Mechanism (SIAM) that guides the learning towards road elements critical for autonomous driving perception. SIAM exhibits robustness, remaining unaffected by changes in weather conditions or environmental scenes. AllWeather-Net effectively transforms images into normal weather and daytime scenes, demonstrating superior image enhancement results and subsequently enhancing the performance of semantic segmentation, with up to a 5.3% improvement in mIoU in the trained domain. We also show our model's generalization ability by applying it to unseen domains without re-training, achieving up to 3.9% mIoU improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo De Monte, Davide Dalle Pezze, Marina Ceccon, Francesco Pasti, Francesco Paissan, Elisabetta Farella, Gian Antonio Susto, Nicola Bellotto</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to learn new data while remembering previously acquired knowledge. In contrast to CL for image classification, CL for Object Detection faces additional challenges such as the missing annotations problem. In this scenario, images from previous tasks may contain instances of unknown classes that could reappear as labeled in future tasks, leading to task interference in replay-based approaches. Consequently, most approaches in the literature have focused on distillation-based techniques, which are effective when there is a significant class overlap between tasks. In our work, we propose an alternative to distillation-based approaches with a novel approach called Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Object Detection (RCLPOD). RCLPOD enhances the replay memory by improving the quality of the stored samples through a technique that promotes class balance while also improving the quality of the ground truth associated with these samples through a technique called label propagation. RCLPOD outperforms existing techniques on well-established benchmarks such as VOC and COC. Moreover, our approach is developed to work with modern architectures like YOLOv8, making it suitable for dynamic, real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, where continuous learning and resource efficiency are essential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weixiang Zhang, Shuzhao Xie, Shijia Ge, Wei Yao, Chen Tang, Zhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has achieved remarkable success in creating immersive media representations through its exceptional reconstruction capabilities. However, the computational demands of dense forward passes and volume rendering during training continue to challenge its real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Expansive Supervision to reduce time and memory costs during NeRF training from the perspective of partial ray selection for supervision. Specifically, we observe that training errors exhibit a long-tail distribution correlated with image content. Based on this observation, our method selectively renders a small but crucial subset of pixels and expands their values to estimate errors across the entire area for each iteration. Compared to conventional supervision, our approach effectively bypasses redundant rendering processes, resulting in substantial reductions in both time and memory consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating Expansive Supervision within existing state-of-the-art acceleration frameworks achieves 52% memory savings and 16% time savings while maintaining comparable visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yechan Kim, SooYeon Kim, Moongu Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation has shown significant advancements in computer vision to improve model performance over the years, particularly in scenarios with limited and insufficient data. Currently, most studies focus on adjusting the image or its features to expand the size, quality, and variety of samples during training in various tasks including object detection. However, we argue that it is necessary to investigate bounding box transformations as a data augmentation technique rather than image-level transformations, especially in aerial imagery due to potentially inconsistent bounding box annotations. Hence, this letter presents a thorough investigation of bounding box transformation in terms of scaling, rotation, and translation for remote sensing object detection. We call this augmentation strategy NBBOX (Noise Injection into Bounding Box). We conduct extensive experiments on DOTA and DIOR-R, both well-known datasets that include a variety of rotated generic objects in aerial images. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves remote sensing object detection without whistles and bells and it is more time-efficient than other state-of-the-art augmentation strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Malakouti, Aysan Aghazadeh, Ashmit Khandelwal, Adriana Kovashka</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong zero-shot generalization across various tasks, especially when integrated with large language models (LLMs). However, their ability to comprehend rhetorical and persuasive visual media, such as advertisements, remains understudied. Ads often employ atypical imagery, using surprising object juxtapositions to convey shared properties. For example, Fig. 1 (e) shows a beer with a feather-like texture. This requires advanced reasoning to deduce that this atypical representation signifies the beer's lightness. We introduce three novel tasks, Multi-label Atypicality Classification, Atypicality Statement Retrieval, and Aypical Object Recognition, to benchmark VLMs' understanding of atypicality in persuasive images. We evaluate how well VLMs use atypicality to infer an ad's message and test their reasoning abilities by employing semantically challenging negatives. Finally, we pioneer atypicality-aware verbalization by extracting comprehensive image descriptions sensitive to atypical elements. Our findings reveal that: (1) VLMs lack advanced reasoning capabilities compared to LLMs; (2) simple, effective strategies can extract atypicality-aware information, leading to comprehensive image verbalization; (3) atypicality aids persuasive advertisement understanding. Code and data will be made available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngsun Lim, Hojun Choi, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive success of text-to-image (TTI) generation models, existing studies overlook the issue of whether these models accurately convey factual information. In this paper, we focus on the problem of image hallucination, where images created by generation models fail to faithfully depict factual content. To address this, we introduce I-HallA (Image Hallucination evaluation with Question Answering), a novel automated evaluation metric that measures the factuality of generated images through visual question answering (VQA). We also introduce I-HallA v1.0, a curated benchmark dataset for this purpose. As part of this process, we develop a pipeline that generates high-quality question-answer pairs using multiple GPT-4 Omni-based agents, with human judgments to ensure accuracy. Our evaluation protocols measure image hallucination by testing if images from existing text-to-image models can correctly respond to these questions. The I-HallA v1.0 dataset comprises 1.2K diverse image-text pairs across nine categories with 1,000 rigorously curated questions covering various compositional challenges. We evaluate five text-to-image models using I-HallA and reveal that these state-of-the-art models often fail to accurately convey factual information. Moreover, we validate the reliability of our metric by demonstrating a strong Spearman correlation (rho=0.95) with human judgments. We believe our benchmark dataset and metric can serve as a foundation for developing factually accurate text-to-image generation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Gong, Haodong Wang, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation of large-scale outdoor point clouds is of significant importance in environment perception and scene understanding. However, this task continues to present a significant research challenge, due to the inherent complexity of outdoor objects and their diverse distributions in real-world environments. In this study, we propose the Multilateral Cascading Network (MCNet) designed to address this challenge. The model comprises two key components: a Multilateral Cascading Attention Enhancement (MCAE) module, which facilitates the learning of complex local features through multilateral cascading operations; and a Point Cross Stage Partial (P-CSP) module, which fuses global and local features, thereby optimizing the integration of valuable feature information across multiple scales. Our proposed method demonstrates superior performance relative to state-of-the-art approaches across two widely recognized benchmark datasets: Toronto3D and SensatUrban. Especially on the city-scale SensatUrban dataset, our results surpassed the current best result by 2.1\% in overall mIoU and yielded an improvement of 15.9\% on average for small-sample object categories comprising less than 2\% of the total samples, in comparison to the baseline method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Xiao, Zhenzhen Hu, Jia Li, Richang Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) has seen substantial advancements in recent years, fueled by the utilization of pre-trained models and large language models (LLMs). Despite these advancements, achieving accurate matching in TVR remains challenging due to inherent disparities between video and textual modalities and irregularities in data representation. In this paper, we propose Text-Video-ProxyNet (TV-ProxyNet), a novel framework designed to decompose the conventional 1-to-N relationship of TVR into N distinct 1-to-1 relationships. By replacing a single text query with a series of text proxies, TV-ProxyNet not only broadens the query scope but also achieves a more precise expansion. Each text proxy is crafted through a refined iterative process, controlled by mechanisms we term as the director and dash, which regulate the proxy's direction and distance relative to the original text query. This setup not only facilitates more precise semantic alignment but also effectively manages the disparities and noise inherent in multimodal data. Our experiments on three representative video-text retrieval benchmarks, MSRVTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet Captions, demonstrate the effectiveness of TV-ProxyNet. The results show an improvement of 2.0% to 3.3% in R@1 over the baseline. TV-ProxyNet achieved state-of-the-art performance on MSRVTT and ActivityNet Captions, and a 2.0% improvement on DiDeMo compared to existing methods, validating our approach's ability to enhance semantic mapping and reduce error propensity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weilun Feng, Chuanguang Yang, Zhulin An, Libo Huang, Boyu Diao, Fei Wang, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although the diffusion model has achieved remarkable performance in the field of image generation, its high inference delay hinders its wide application in edge devices with scarce computing resources. Therefore, many training-free sampling methods have been proposed to reduce the number of sampling steps required for diffusion models. However, they perform poorly under a very small number of sampling steps. Thanks to the emergence of knowledge distillation technology, the existing training scheme methods have achieved excellent results at very low step numbers. However, the current methods mainly focus on designing novel diffusion model sampling methods with knowledge distillation. How to transfer better diffusion knowledge from teacher models is a more valuable problem but rarely studied. Therefore, we propose Relational Diffusion Distillation (RDD), a novel distillation method tailored specifically for distilling diffusion models. Unlike existing methods that simply align teacher and student models at pixel level or feature distributions, our method introduces cross-sample relationship interaction during the distillation process and alleviates the memory constraints induced by multiple sample interactions. Our RDD significantly enhances the effectiveness of the progressive distillation framework within the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on several datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) demonstrate that our proposed RDD leads to 1.47 FID decrease under 1 sampling step compared to state-of-the-art diffusion distillation methods and achieving 256x speed-up compared to DDIM strategy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chong-Yang Xiang, Jun-Yan He, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Xiao Wu, Xian-Sheng Hua</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving a balance between accuracy and efficiency is a critical challenge in facial landmark detection (FLD). This paper introduces Parallel Optimal Position Search (POPoS), a high-precision encoding-decoding framework designed to address the limitations of traditional FLD methods. POPoS employs three key contributions: (1) Pseudo-range multilateration is utilized to correct heatmap errors, improving landmark localization accuracy. By integrating multiple anchor points, it reduces the impact of individual heatmap inaccuracies, leading to robust overall positioning. (2) To enhance the pseudo-range accuracy of selected anchor points, a new loss function, named multilateration anchor loss, is proposed. This loss function enhances the accuracy of the distance map, mitigates the risk of local optima, and ensures optimal solutions. (3) A single-step parallel computation algorithm is introduced, boosting computational efficiency and reducing processing time. Extensive evaluations across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that POPoS consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in low-resolution heatmaps scenarios with minimal computational overhead. These advantages make POPoS a highly efficient and accurate tool for FLD, with broad applicability in real-world scenarios.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10084">PointNet with KAN versus PointNet with MLP for 3D Classification and Segmentation of Point Sets</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Kashefi</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently gained attention as an alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) in deep learning frameworks. KANs have been integrated into various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, with their performance evaluated. However, their effectiveness within point-cloud-based neural networks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we incorporate KANs into PointNet for the first time to evaluate their performance on 3D point cloud classification and segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce PointNet-KAN, built upon two key components. First, it employs KANs instead of traditional MLPs. Second, it retains the core principle of PointNet by using shared KAN layers and applying symmetric functions for global feature extraction, ensuring permutation invariance with respect to the input features. In traditional MLPs, the goal is to train the weights and biases with fixed activation functions; however, in KANs, the goal is to train the activation functions themselves. We use Jacobi polynomials to construct the KAN layers. We extensively and systematically evaluate PointNet-KAN across various polynomial degrees and special types such as the Lagrange, Chebyshev, and Gegenbauer polynomials. Our results show that PointNet-KAN achieves competitive performance compared to PointNet with MLPs on benchmark datasets for 3D object classification and segmentation, despite employing a shallower and simpler network architecture. We hope this work serves as a foundation and provides guidance for integrating KANs, as an alternative to MLPs, into more advanced point cloud processing architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxiang Gou, Luping Ji, Pei Liu, Mao Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has very significant applications in clinical pathology, e.g., tumor identification and cancer diagnosis. Currently, most research attention is focused on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) using static datasets. One of the most obvious weaknesses of these methods is that they cannot efficiently preserve and utilize previously learned knowledge. With any new data arriving, classification models are required to be re-trained on both previous and current new data. To overcome this shortcoming and break through traditional vision modality, this paper proposes the first Vision-Language-based framework with Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning (QPMIL-VL) specially designed for incremental WSI classification. This framework mainly consists of two information processing branches: one is for generating bag-level features by prototype-guided aggregation of instance features, while the other is for enhancing class features through a combination of class ensemble, tunable vector and class similarity loss. The experiments on four public WSI datasets demonstrate that our QPMIL-VL framework is effective for incremental WSI classification and often significantly outperforms other compared methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dabbrata Das, Argho Deb Das, Farhan Sadaf</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating depth from a single 2D image is a challenging task due to the lack of stereo or multi-view data, which are typically required for depth perception. This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based approach using an enhanced encoder-decoder architecture, where the Inception-ResNet-v2 model serves as the encoder. This is the first instance of utilizing Inception-ResNet-v2 as an encoder for monocular depth estimation, demonstrating improved performance over previous models. Our model effectively captures complex objects and fine-grained details, which are generally difficult to predict. Additionally, it incorporates multi-scale feature extraction to enhance depth prediction accuracy across various object sizes and distances. We propose a composite loss function comprising depth loss, gradient edge loss, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss, with fine-tuned weights to optimize the weighted sum, ensuring a balance across different aspects of depth estimation. Experimental results on the NYU Depth V2 dataset show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an Absolute Relative Error (ARE) of 0.064, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.228, and accuracy ($\delta$ < 1.25) of 89.3%. These metrics demonstrate that our model can accurately predict depth even in challenging scenarios, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications in robotics, 3D reconstruction, and augmented reality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Chen, Yiwen Ye, Yongsheng Pan, Jingfeng Zhang, Yanning Zhang, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Distribution shifts widely exist in medical images acquired from different medical centres, hindering the deployment of semantic segmentation models trained on one centre (source domain) to another (target domain). While unsupervised domain adaptation has shown significant promise in mitigating these shifts, it poses privacy risks due to sharing data between centres. To facilitate adaptation while preserving data privacy, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) and test-time adaptation (TTA) have emerged as effective paradigms, relying solely on target domain data. However, SFDA requires a pre-collected target domain dataset before deployment. TTA insufficiently exploit the potential value of test data, as it processes the test data only once. Considering that most medical centres operate during the day and remain inactive at night in clinical practice, we propose a novel adaptation framework called Day-Night Adaptation (DyNA) with above insights, which performs adaptation through day-night cycles without requiring access to source data. During the day, a low-frequency prompt is trained to adapt the frozen model to each test sample. We construct a memory bank for prompt initialization and develop a warm-up mechanism to enhance prompt training. During the night, we reuse test data collected from the day and introduce a global student model to bridge the knowledge between teacher and student models, facilitating model fine-tuning while ensuring training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DyNA outperforms existing TTA and SFDA methods on two benchmark medical image segmentation tasks. Code will be available after the paper is published.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding and predicting human actions has been a long-standing challenge and is a crucial measure of perception in robotics AI. While significant progress has been made in anticipating the future actions of individual agents, prior work has largely overlooked a key aspect of real-world human activity -- interactions. To address this gap in human-like forecasting within multi-agent environments, we present the Hierarchical Memory-Aware Transformer (HiMemFormer), a transformer-based model for online multi-agent action anticipation. HiMemFormer integrates and distributes global memory that captures joint historical information across all agents through a transformer framework, with a hierarchical local memory decoder that interprets agent-specific features based on these global representations using a coarse-to-fine strategy. In contrast to previous approaches, HiMemFormer uniquely hierarchically applies the global context with agent-specific preferences to avoid noisy or redundant information in multi-agent action anticipation. Extensive experiments on various multi-agent scenarios demonstrate the significant performance of HiMemFormer, compared with other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual object tracking aims to locate a targeted object in a video sequence based on an initial bounding box. Recently, Vision-Language~(VL) trackers have proposed to utilize additional natural language descriptions to enhance versatility in various applications. However, VL trackers are still inferior to State-of-The-Art (SoTA) visual trackers in terms of tracking performance. We found that this inferiority primarily results from their heavy reliance on manual textual annotations, which include the frequent provision of ambiguous language descriptions. In this paper, we propose ChatTracker to leverage the wealth of world knowledge in the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate high-quality language descriptions and enhance tracking performance. To this end, we propose a novel reflection-based prompt optimization module to iteratively refine the ambiguous and inaccurate descriptions of the target with tracking feedback. To further utilize semantic information produced by MLLM, a simple yet effective VL tracking framework is proposed and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of both VL and visual trackers. Experimental results show that our proposed ChatTracker achieves a performance comparable to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Jin, Luyang Luo, Huangjing Lin, Jun Hou, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained classification of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential in precision oncology, enabling precise cancer diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies. The core of this task involves distinguishing subtle morphological variations within the same broad category of gigapixel-resolution images, which presents a significant challenge. While the multi-instance learning (MIL) paradigm alleviates the computational burden of WSIs, existing MIL methods often overlook hierarchical label correlations, treating fine-grained classification as a flat multi-class classification task. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel hierarchical multi-instance learning (HMIL) framework. By facilitating on the hierarchical alignment of inherent relationships between different hierarchy of labels at instance and bag level, our approach provides a more structured and informative learning process. Specifically, HMIL incorporates a class-wise attention mechanism that aligns hierarchical information at both the instance and bag levels. Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability for fine-grained classification and a curriculum-based dynamic weighting module to adaptively balance the hierarchical feature during training. Extensive experiments on our large-scale cytology cervical cancer (CCC) dataset and two public histology datasets, BRACS and PANDA, demonstrate the state-of-the-art class-wise and overall performance of our HMIL framework.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been successfully applied to train histopathology foundation models (FMs) for patch embedding generation. However, generating patient or slide level embeddings remains challenging. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from patch level learning to entire slides by aligning different augmentations of the slide or by utilizing multimodal data. By integrating tile embeddings from multiple FMs, we propose a new single modality SSL method in feature space that generates useful slide representations. Our contrastive pretraining strategy, called COBRA, employs multiple FMs and an architecture based on Mamba-2. COBRA exceeds performance of state-of-the-art slide encoders on four different public Clinical Protemic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cohorts on average by at least +4.5% AUC, despite only being pretrained on 3048 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, COBRA is readily compatible at inference time with previously unseen feature extractors. Code available at https://github.com/KatherLab/COBRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yumeng Liu, Xiaoxiao Long, Zemin Yang, Yuan Liu, Marc Habermann, Christian Theobalt, Yuexin Ma, Wenping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Our work aims to reconstruct hand-object interactions from a single-view image, which is a fundamental but ill-posed task. Unlike methods that reconstruct from videos, multi-view images, or predefined 3D templates, single-view reconstruction faces significant challenges due to inherent ambiguities and occlusions. These challenges are further amplified by the diverse nature of hand poses and the vast variety of object shapes and sizes. Our key insight is that current foundational models for segmentation, inpainting, and 3D reconstruction robustly generalize to in-the-wild images, which could provide strong visual and geometric priors for reconstructing hand-object interactions. Specifically, given a single image, we first design a novel pipeline to estimate the underlying hand pose and object shape using off-the-shelf large models. Furthermore, with the initial reconstruction, we employ a prior-guided optimization scheme, which optimizes hand pose to comply with 3D physical constraints and the 2D input image content. We perform experiments across several datasets and show that our method consistently outperforms baselines and faithfully reconstructs a diverse set of hand-object interactions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaojiang Liu, Jiajun Zou, Zhendan Liu, Meixia Dong, Zhiping Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread application of human body 3D reconstruction technology across various fields, the demands for data transmission and processing efficiency continue to rise, particularly in scenarios where network bandwidth is limited and low latency is required. This paper introduces an Adversarial Feature Learning-based Semantic Communication method (AFLSC) for human body 3D reconstruction, which focuses on extracting and transmitting semantic information crucial for the 3D reconstruction task, thereby significantly optimizing data flow and alleviating bandwidth pressure. At the sender's end, we propose a multitask learning-based feature extraction method to capture the spatial layout, keypoints, posture, and depth information from 2D human images, and design a semantic encoding technique based on adversarial feature learning to encode these feature information into semantic data. We also develop a dynamic compression technique to efficiently transmit this semantic data, greatly enhancing transmission efficiency and reducing latency. At the receiver's end, we design an efficient multi-level semantic feature decoding method to convert semantic data back into key image features. Finally, an improved ViT-diffusion model is employed for 3D reconstruction, producing human body 3D mesh models. Experimental results validate the advantages of our method in terms of data transmission efficiency and reconstruction quality, demonstrating its excellent potential for application in bandwidth-limited environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of talking head generation, yet still face challenges in expressiveness, controllability, and stability in long-time generation. In this research, we propose an EmotiveTalk framework to address these issues. Firstly, to realize better control over the generation of lip movement and facial expression, a Vision-guided Audio Information Decoupling (V-AID) approach is designed to generate audio-based decoupled representations aligned with lip movements and expression. Specifically, to achieve alignment between audio and facial expression representation spaces, we present a Diffusion-based Co-speech Temporal Expansion (Di-CTE) module within V-AID to generate expression-related representations under multi-source emotion condition constraints. Then we propose a well-designed Emotional Talking Head Diffusion (ETHD) backbone to efficiently generate highly expressive talking head videos, which contains an Expression Decoupling Injection (EDI) module to automatically decouple the expressions from reference portraits while integrating the target expression information, achieving more expressive generation performance. Experimental results show that EmotiveTalk can generate expressive talking head videos, ensuring the promised controllability of emotions and stability during long-time generation, yielding state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuweiyi Chen, Markus Marks, Zezhou Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Mid-level vision capabilities - such as generic object localization and 3D geometric understanding - are not only fundamental to human vision but are also crucial for many real-world applications of computer vision. These abilities emerge with minimal supervision during the early stages of human visual development. Despite their significance, current self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches are primarily designed and evaluated for high-level recognition tasks, leaving their mid-level vision capabilities largely unexamined.
  In this study, we introduce a suite of benchmark protocols to systematically assess mid-level vision capabilities and present a comprehensive, controlled evaluation of 22 prominent SSL models across 8 mid-level vision tasks. Our experiments reveal a weak correlation between mid-level and high-level task performance. We also identify several SSL methods with highly imbalanced performance across mid-level and high-level capabilities, as well as some that excel in both. Additionally, we investigate key factors contributing to mid-level vision performance, such as pretraining objectives and network architectures. Our study provides a holistic and timely view of what SSL models have learned, complementing existing research that primarily focuses on high-level vision tasks. We hope our findings guide future SSL research to benchmark models not only on high-level vision tasks but on mid-level as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuncong Yang, Han Yang, Jiachen Zhou, Peihao Chen, Hongxin Zhang, Yilun Du, Chuang Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing compact and informative 3D scene representations is essential for effective embodied exploration and reasoning, especially in complex environments over extended periods. Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Zhang, Junxian Li, Jingdi Lei, Xunzhi Wang, Yujie Liu, Zonglin Yang, Jiatong Li, Weida Wang, Suorong Yang, Jianbo Wu, Peng Ye, Wanli Ouyang, Dongzhan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueru Jia, Jiaming Liu, Sixiang Chen, Chenyang Gu, Zhilue Wang, Longzan Luo, Lily Lee, Pengwei Wang, Zhongyuan Wang, Renrui Zhang, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D geometric information is essential for manipulation tasks, as robots need to perceive the 3D environment, reason about spatial relationships, and interact with intricate spatial configurations. Recent research has increasingly focused on the explicit extraction of 3D features, while still facing challenges such as the lack of large-scale robotic 3D data and the potential loss of spatial geometry. To address these limitations, we propose the Lift3D framework, which progressively enhances 2D foundation models with implicit and explicit 3D robotic representations to construct a robust 3D manipulation policy. Specifically, we first design a task-aware masked autoencoder that masks task-relevant affordance patches and reconstructs depth information, enhancing the 2D foundation model's implicit 3D robotic representation. After self-supervised fine-tuning, we introduce a 2D model-lifting strategy that establishes a positional mapping between the input 3D points and the positional embeddings of the 2D model. Based on the mapping, Lift3D utilizes the 2D foundation model to directly encode point cloud data, leveraging large-scale pretrained knowledge to construct explicit 3D robotic representations while minimizing spatial information loss. In experiments, Lift3D consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across several simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuqian Ren, Matias Turkulainen, Jiepeng Wang, Otto Seiskari, Iaroslav Melekhov, Juho Kannala, Esa Rahtu</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometric priors are often used to enhance 3D reconstruction. With many smartphones featuring low-resolution depth sensors and the prevalence of off-the-shelf monocular geometry estimators, incorporating geometric priors as regularization signals has become common in 3D vision tasks. However, the accuracy of depth estimates from mobile devices is typically poor for highly detailed geometry, and monocular estimators often suffer from poor multi-view consistency and precision. In this work, we propose an approach for joint surface depth and normal refinement of Gaussian Splatting methods for accurate 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes. We develop supervision strategies that adaptively filters low-quality depth and normal estimates by comparing the consistency of the priors during optimization. We mitigate regularization in regions where prior estimates have high uncertainty or ambiguities. Our filtering strategy and optimization design demonstrate significant improvements in both mesh estimation and novel-view synthesis for both 3D and 2D Gaussian Splatting-based methods on challenging indoor room datasets. Furthermore, we explore the use of alternative meshing strategies for finer geometry extraction. We develop a scale-aware meshing strategy inspired by TSDF and octree-based isosurface extraction, which recovers finer details from Gaussian models compared to other commonly used open-source meshing tools.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liqiang Zhang, Ye Tian, Dongyan Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of smart cities, the demand for continuous pedestrian navigation in large-scale urban environments has significantly increased. While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Fein-Ashley, Benjamin Fein-Ashley</p>
<p>Abstract: Image inpainting is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to restore missing or corrupted regions in images realistically. While recent deep learning approaches have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art, challenges remain in maintaining structural continuity and generating coherent textures, particularly in large missing areas. Diffusion models have shown promise in generating high-fidelity images but often lack the structural guidance necessary for realistic inpainting. We propose a novel inpainting method that combines diffusion models with anisotropic Gaussian splatting to capture both local structures and global context effectively. By modeling missing regions using anisotropic Gaussian functions that adapt to local image gradients, our approach provides structural guidance to the diffusion-based inpainting network. The Gaussian splat maps are integrated into the diffusion process, enhancing the model's ability to generate high-fidelity and structurally coherent inpainting results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, producing visually plausible results with enhanced structural integrity and texture realism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Gonzalo Rodriguez Salgado, Maying Shen, Philipp Harzig, Peter Mayer, Jose M. Alvarez</p>
<p>Abstract: Robustness to out-of-distribution data is crucial for deploying modern neural networks. Recently, Vision Transformers, such as SegFormer for semantic segmentation, have shown impressive robustness to visual corruptions like blur or noise affecting the acquisition device. In this paper, we propose Channel Wise Feature Augmentation (CWFA), a simple yet efficient feature augmentation technique to improve the robustness of Vision Transformers for semantic segmentation. CWFA applies a globally estimated perturbation per encoder with minimal compute overhead during training. Extensive evaluations on Cityscapes and ADE20K, with three state-of-the-art Vision Transformer architectures : SegFormer, Swin Transformer, and Twins demonstrate that CWFA-enhanced models significantly improve robustness without affecting clean data performance. For instance, on Cityscapes, a CWFA-augmented SegFormer-B1 model yields up to 27.7% mIoU robustness gain on impulse noise compared to the non-augmented SegFormer-B1. Furthermore, CWFA-augmented SegFormer-B5 achieves a new state-of-the-art 84.3% retention rate, a 0.7% improvement over the recently published FAN+STL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Colman, Minh Vu, Manish Bhattarai, Martin Ma, Hari Viswanathan, Daniel O'Malley, Javier E. Santos</p>
<p>Abstract: For decades, corporations and governments have relied on scanned documents to record vast amounts of information. However, extracting this information is a slow and tedious process due to the sheer volume and complexity of these records. The rise of Vision Language Models (VLMs) presents a way to efficiently and accurately extract the information out of these documents. The current automated workflow often requires a two-step approach involving the extraction of information using optical character recognition software and subsequent usage of large language models for processing this information. Unfortunately, these methods encounter significant challenges when dealing with noisy scanned documents, often requiring computationally expensive language models to handle high information density effectively. In this study, we propose PatchFinder, an algorithm that builds upon VLMs to improve information extraction. First, we devise a confidence-based score, called Patch Confidence, based on the Maximum Softmax Probability of the VLMs' output to measure the model's confidence in its predictions. Using this metric, PatchFinder determines a suitable patch size, partitions the input document into overlapping patches, and generates confidence-based predictions for the target information. Our experimental results show that PatchFinder, leveraging Phi-3v, a 4.2-billion-parameter VLM, achieves an accuracy of 94% on our dataset of 190 noisy scanned documents, outperforming ChatGPT-4o by 18.5 percentage points.</p>

Additionally, we propose a novel tokenization scheme that concisely encodes these complex sewing patterns so that LLMs can learn to predict them efficiently. AIpparel achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-modal tasks, including text-to-garment and image-to-garment prediction, and enables novel multimodal garment generation applications such as interactive garment editing.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-guided image editing enable users to perform image edits through simple text inputs, leveraging the extensive priors of multi-step diffusion-based text-to-image models. However, these methods often fall short of the speed demands required for real-world and on-device applications due to the costly multi-step inversion and sampling process involved. In response to this, we introduce SwiftEdit, a simple yet highly efficient editing tool that achieve instant text-guided image editing (in 0.23s). The advancement of SwiftEdit lies in its two novel contributions: a one-step inversion framework that enables one-step image reconstruction via inversion and a mask-guided editing technique with our proposed attention rescaling mechanism to perform localized image editing. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SwiftEdit. In particular, SwiftEdit enables instant text-guided image editing, which is extremely faster than previous multi-step methods (at least 50 times faster) while maintain a competitive performance in editing results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Wang, Meng Cao, Haokun Lin, Mingfei Han, Liang Ma, Jin Jiang, Yuhao Cheng, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various visual question answering and reasoning tasks leveraging instruction fine-tuning specific datasets. They can also learn from preference data annotated by human to enhance their reasoning ability and mitigate hallucinations. Most of preference data is generated from the model itself. However, existing methods require high-quality critical labels, which are costly and rely on human or proprietary models like GPT-4V. In this work, we propose Enhancing Alignment in MLLMs via Critical Observation (EACO), which aligns MLLMs by self-generated preference data using only 5k images economically. Our approach begins with collecting and refining a Scoring Evaluation Instruction-tuning dataset to train a critical evaluation model, termed the Critic. This Critic observes model responses across multiple dimensions, selecting preferred and non-preferred outputs for refined Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) tuning. To further enhance model performance, we employ an additional supervised fine-tuning stage after preference tuning. EACO reduces the overall hallucinations by 65.6% on HallusionBench and improves the reasoning ability by 21.8% on MME-Cognition. EACO achieves an 8.5% improvement over LLaVA-v1.6-Mistral-7B across multiple benchmarks. Remarkably, EACO also shows the potential critical ability in open-source MLLMs, demonstrating that EACO is a viable path to boost the competence of MLLMs.</p>

Notably, our model is the first open-source MLLMs to surpass 70% on the MMMU benchmark, achieving a 3.7-point improvement through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and showcasing strong potential for test-time scaling. We hope this model contributes to the open-source community by setting new standards for developing and applying multimodal AI systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Ganz, Jonas Ammeling, Emely Rosbach, Ludwig Lausser, Christof A. Bertram, Katharina Breininger, Marc Aubreville</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), i.e., models trained on a vast amount of typically unlabeled data, have become popular and available recently for the domain of histopathology. The key idea is to extract semantically rich vectors from any input patch, allowing for the use of simple subsequent classification networks potentially reducing the required amounts of labeled data, and increasing domain robustness. In this work, we investigate to which degree this also holds for mitotic figure classification. Utilizing two popular public mitotic figure datasets, we compared linear probing of five publicly available FMs against models trained on ImageNet and a simple ResNet50 end-to-end-trained baseline. We found that the end-to-end-trained baseline outperformed all FM-based classifiers, regardless of the amount of data provided. Additionally, we did not observe the FM-based classifiers to be more robust against domain shifts, rendering both of the above assumptions incorrect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqian Zhou, Zhen Huang, Heqin Zhu, Qingsong Yao, S. Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Anatomical landmark detection (ALD) from a medical image is crucial for a wide array of clinical applications. While existing methods achieve quite some success in ALD, they often struggle to balance global context with computational efficiency, particularly with high-resolution images, thereby leading to the rise of a natural question: where is the performance limit of ALD? In this paper, we aim to forge performant ALD by proposing a {\bf HY}brid {\bf ATT}ention {\bf Net}work (HYATT-Net) with the following designs: (i) A novel hybrid architecture that integrates CNNs and Transformers. Its core is the BiFormer module, utilizing Bi-Level Routing Attention for efficient attention to relevant image regions. This, combined with Attention Residual Module(ARM), enables precise local feature refinement guided by the global context. (ii) A Feature Fusion Correction Module that aggregates multi-scale features and thus mitigates a resolution loss. Deep supervision with a mean-square error loss on multi-resolution heatmaps optimizes the model. Experiments on five diverse datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. The HYATT-Net provides a promising solution for accurate and efficient ALD in complex medical images. Our codes and data are already released at: \url{https://github.com/ECNUACRush/HYATT-Net}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baorui Ma, Huachen Gao, Haoge Deng, Zhengxiong Luo, Tiejun Huang, Lulu Tang, Xinlong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent 3D generation models typically rely on limited-scale 3D `gold-labels' or 2D diffusion priors for 3D content creation. However, their performance is upper-bounded by constrained 3D priors due to the lack of scalable learning paradigms. In this work, we present See3D, a visual-conditional multi-view diffusion model trained on large-scale Internet videos for open-world 3D creation. The model aims to Get 3D knowledge by solely Seeing the visual contents from the vast and rapidly growing video data -- You See it, You Got it. To achieve this, we first scale up the training data using a proposed data curation pipeline that automatically filters out multi-view inconsistencies and insufficient observations from source videos. This results in a high-quality, richly diverse, large-scale dataset of multi-view images, termed WebVi3D, containing 320M frames from 16M video clips. Nevertheless, learning generic 3D priors from videos without explicit 3D geometry or camera pose annotations is nontrivial, and annotating poses for web-scale videos is prohibitively expensive. To eliminate the need for pose conditions, we introduce an innovative visual-condition - a purely 2D-inductive visual signal generated by adding time-dependent noise to the masked video data. Finally, we introduce a novel visual-conditional 3D generation framework by integrating See3D into a warping-based pipeline for high-fidelity 3D generation. Our numerical and visual comparisons on single and sparse reconstruction benchmarks show that See3D, trained on cost-effective and scalable video data, achieves notable zero-shot and open-world generation capabilities, markedly outperforming models trained on costly and constrained 3D datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongze Mi, Jinyuan Li, Xuying Zhang, Haoran Cheng, Jiahao Wang, Di Sun, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal entity linking (MEL), a task aimed at linking mentions within multimodal contexts to their corresponding entities in a knowledge base (KB), has attracted much attention due to its wide applications in recent years. However, existing MEL methods often rely heavily on mention words as retrieval cues, which limits their ability to effectively utilize information from both images and text. This reliance poses significant challenges in scenarios where mention words are absent, as current MEL approaches struggle to leverage image-text pairs for accurate entity linking. To solve these issues, we introduce a Visual Prompts guided Multimodal Entity Linking (VP-MEL) task. Given a text-image pair, VP-MEL aims to link a marked region (i.e., visual prompt) in an image to its corresponding entities in the knowledge base. To facilitate this task, we present a new dataset, VPWiki, specifically designed for VP-MEL. Furthermore, we propose a framework named FBMEL, which enhances visual feature extraction using visual prompts and leverages the pretrained Detective-VLM model to capture latent information. Experimental results on the VPWiki dataset demonstrate that FBMEL outperforms baseline methods across multiple benchmarks for the VP-MEL task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caiyun Xie, Dengpan Ye, Yunming Zhang, Long Tang, Yunna Lv, Jiacheng Deng, Jiawei Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The security of AI-generated content (AIGC) detection is crucial for ensuring multimedia content credibility. To enhance detector security, research on adversarial attacks has become essential. However, most existing adversarial attacks focus only on GAN-generated facial images detection, struggle to be effective on multi-class natural images and diffusion-based detectors, and exhibit poor invisibility. To fill this gap, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the vulnerability of AIGC detectors and discover the feature that detectors vary in vulnerability to different post-processing. Then, considering that the detector is agnostic in real-world scenarios and given this discovery, we propose a Realistic-like Robust Black-box Adversarial attack (R$^2$BA) with post-processing fusion optimization. Unlike typical perturbations, R$^2$BA uses real-world post-processing, i.e., Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, Gaussian noise and light spot to generate adversarial examples. Specifically, we use a stochastic particle swarm algorithm with inertia decay to optimize post-processing fusion intensity and explore the detector's decision boundary. Guided by the detector's fake probability, R$^2$BA enhances/weakens the detector-vulnerable/detector-robust post-processing intensity to strike a balance between adversariality and invisibility. Extensive experiments on popular/commercial AIGC detectors and datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BA exhibits impressive anti-detection performance, excellent invisibility, and strong robustness in GAN-based and diffusion-based cases. Compared to state-of-the-art white-box and black-box attacks, R$^2$BA shows significant improvements of 15\%--72\% and 21\%--47\% in anti-detection performance under the original and robust scenario respectively, offering valuable insights for the security of AIGC detection in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image Translation (IT) holds immense potential across diverse domains, enabling the translation of textual content within images into various languages. However, existing datasets often suffer from limitations in scale, diversity, and quality, hindering the development and evaluation of IT models. To address this issue, we introduce MIT-10M, a large-scale parallel corpus of multilingual image translation with over 10M image-text pairs derived from real-world data, which has undergone extensive data cleaning and multilingual translation validation. It contains 840K images in three sizes, 28 categories, tasks with three levels of difficulty and 14 languages image-text pairs, which is a considerable improvement on existing datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate and train models on MIT-10M. The experimental results clearly indicate that our dataset has higher adaptability when it comes to evaluating the performance of the models in tackling challenging and complex image translation tasks in the real world. Moreover, the performance of the model fine-tuned with MIT-10M has tripled compared to the baseline model, further confirming its superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Ouyang, Ying Chen, Kaiyue Zhu, Gady Agam</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained text to image synthesis involves generating images from texts that belong to different categories. In contrast to general text to image synthesis, in fine-grained synthesis there is high similarity between images of different subclasses, and there may be linguistic discrepancy among texts describing the same image. Recent Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), such as the Recurrent Affine Transformation (RAT) GAN model, are able to synthesize clear and realistic images from texts. However, GAN models ignore fine-grained level information. In this paper we propose an approach that incorporates an auxiliary classifier in the discriminator and a contrastive learning method to improve the accuracy of fine-grained details in images synthesized by RAT GAN. The auxiliary classifier helps the discriminator classify the class of images, and helps the generator synthesize more accurate fine-grained images. The contrastive learning method minimizes the similarity between images from different subclasses and maximizes the similarity between images from the same subclass. We evaluate on several state-of-the-art methods on the commonly used CUB-200-2011 bird dataset and Oxford-102 flower dataset, and demonstrated superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Ning, Qing Xie, Jinyu Xu, Wenbo Jiang, Jiachen Li, Yanchun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D backdoor attacks have posed a substantial threat to 3D Deep Neural Networks (3D DNNs) designed for 3D point clouds, which are extensively deployed in various security-critical applications. Although the existing 3D backdoor attacks achieved high attack performance, they remain vulnerable to preprocessing-based defenses (e.g., outlier removal and rotation augmentation) and are prone to detection by human inspection. In pursuit of a more challenging-to-defend and stealthy 3D backdoor attack, this paper introduces the Stealthy and Robust Backdoor Attack (SRBA), which ensures robustness and stealthiness through intentional design considerations. The key insight of our attack involves applying a uniform shift to the additional point features of point clouds (e.g., reflection intensity) widely utilized as part of inputs for 3D DNNs as the trigger. Without altering the geometric information of the point clouds, our attack ensures visual consistency between poisoned and benign samples, and demonstrate robustness against preprocessing-based defenses. In addition, to automate our attack, we employ Bayesian Optimization (BO) to identify the suitable trigger. Extensive experiments suggest that SRBA achieves an attack success rate (ASR) exceeding 94% in all cases, and significantly outperforms previous SOTA methods when multiple preprocessing operations are applied during training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-light and blurring issues are prevalent when capturing photos at night, often due to the use of long exposure to address dim environments. Addressing these joint problems can be challenging and error-prone if an end-to-end model is trained without incorporating an appropriate physical model. In this paper, we introduce JUDE, a Deep Joint Unrolling for Deblurring and Low-Light Image Enhancement, inspired by the image physical model. Based on Retinex theory and the blurring model, the low-light blurry input is iteratively deblurred and decomposed, producing sharp low-light reflectance and illuminance through an unrolling mechanism. Additionally, we incorporate various modules to estimate the initial blur kernel, enhance brightness, and eliminate noise in the final image. Comprehensive experiments on LOL-Blur and Real-LOL-Blur demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Gao, Weikai Huang, Jieyu Zhang, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: DALL-E and Sora have gained attention by producing implausible images, such as "astronauts riding a horse in space." Despite the proliferation of text-to-vision models that have inundated the internet with synthetic visuals, from images to 3D assets, current benchmarks predominantly evaluate these models on real-world scenes paired with captions. We introduce Generate Any Scene, a framework that systematically enumerates scene graphs representing a vast array of visual scenes, spanning realistic to imaginative compositions. Generate Any Scene leverages 'scene graph programming', a method for dynamically constructing scene graphs of varying complexity from a structured taxonomy of visual elements. This taxonomy includes numerous objects, attributes, and relations, enabling the synthesis of an almost infinite variety of scene graphs. Using these structured representations, Generate Any Scene translates each scene graph into a caption, enabling scalable evaluation of text-to-vision models through standard metrics. We conduct extensive evaluations across multiple text-to-image, text-to-video, and text-to-3D models, presenting key findings on model performance. We find that DiT-backbone text-to-image models align more closely with input captions than UNet-backbone models. Text-to-video models struggle with balancing dynamics and consistency, while both text-to-video and text-to-3D models show notable gaps in human preference alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Generate Any Scene by conducting three practical applications leveraging captions generated by Generate Any Scene: 1) a self-improving framework where models iteratively enhance their performance using generated data, 2) a distillation process to transfer specific strengths from proprietary models to open-source counterparts, and 3) improvements in content moderation by identifying and generating challenging synthetic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhong, Weize Quan, Dong-ming Yan, Jie Jiang, Yingmei Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct the complete 3D shape from incomplete point clouds, and it is crucial for tasks such as 3D object detection and segmentation. Despite the continuous advances in point cloud analysis techniques, feature extraction methods are still confronted with apparent limitations. The sparse sampling of point clouds, used as inputs in most methods, often results in a certain loss of global structure information. Meanwhile, traditional local feature extraction methods usually struggle to capture the intricate geometric details. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce PointCFormer, a transformer framework optimized for robust global retention and precise local detail capture in point cloud completion. This framework embraces several key advantages. First, we propose a relation-based local feature extraction method to perceive local delicate geometry characteristics. This approach establishes a fine-grained relationship metric between the target point and its k-nearest neighbors, quantifying each neighboring point's contribution to the target point's local features. Secondly, we introduce a progressive feature extractor that integrates our local feature perception method with self-attention. Starting with a denser sampling of points as input, it iteratively queries long-distance global dependencies and local neighborhood relationships. This extractor maintains enhanced global structure and refined local details, without generating substantial computational overhead. Additionally, we develop a correction module after generating point proxies in the latent space to reintroduce denser information from the input points, enhancing the representation capability of the point proxies. PointCFormer demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several widely used benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zyyyyy0926/PointCFormer_Plus_Pytorch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Niu, Jie Hu, Jianghang Lin, Guannan Jiang, Shengchuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation aims to segment and classify everything in diverse scenes across an unbounded vocabulary. Existing methods typically employ two-stage or single-stage framework. The two-stage framework involves cropping the image multiple times using masks generated by a mask generator, followed by feature extraction, while the single-stage framework relies on a heavyweight mask decoder to make up for the lack of spatial position information through self-attention and cross-attention in multiple stacked Transformer blocks. Both methods incur substantial computational overhead, thereby hindering the efficiency of model inference. To fill the gap in efficiency, we propose EOV-Seg, a novel single-stage, shared, efficient, and spatialaware framework designed for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Specifically, EOV-Seg innovates in two aspects. First, a Vocabulary-Aware Selection (VAS) module is proposed to improve the semantic comprehension of visual aggregated features and alleviate the feature interaction burden on the mask decoder. Second, we introduce a Two-way Dynamic Embedding Experts (TDEE), which efficiently utilizes the spatial awareness capabilities of ViT-based CLIP backbone. To the best of our knowledge, EOV-Seg is the first open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation framework towards efficiency, which runs faster and achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, with COCO training only, EOV-Seg achieves 24.5 PQ, 32.1 mIoU, and 11.6 FPS on the ADE20K dataset and the inference time of EOV-Seg is 4-19 times faster than state-of-theart methods. Especially, equipped with ResNet50 backbone, EOV-Seg runs 23.8 FPS with only 71M parameters on a single RTX 3090 GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/nhw649/EOV-Seg.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the growing adoption and capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) comes the need for benchmarks that capture authentic user-VLM interactions. In response, we create VisionArena, a dataset of 230K real-world conversations between users and VLMs. Collected from Chatbot Arena - an open-source platform where users interact with VLMs and submit preference votes - VisionArena spans 73K unique users, 45 VLMs, and 138 languages. Our dataset contains three subsets: VisionArena-Chat, 200k single and multi-turn conversations between a user and a VLM; VisionArena-Battle, 30K conversations comparing two anonymous VLMs with user preference votes; and VisionArena-Bench, an automatic benchmark of 500 diverse user prompts that efficiently approximate the live Chatbot Arena model rankings. Additionally, we highlight the types of question asked by users, the influence of response style on preference, and areas where models often fail. We find open-ended tasks like captioning and humor are highly style-dependent, and current VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning and planning tasks. Lastly, we show finetuning the same base model on VisionArena-Chat outperforms Llava-Instruct-158K, with a 17-point gain on MMMU and a 46-point gain on the WildVision benchmark.

<p>Abstract: The demand for producing short-form videos for sharing on social media platforms has experienced significant growth in recent times. Despite notable advancements in the fields of video summarization and highlight detection, which can create partially usable short films from raw videos, these approaches are often domain-specific and require an in-depth understanding of real-world video content. To tackle this predicament, we propose Repurpose-10K, an extensive dataset comprising over 10,000 videos with more than 120,000 annotated clips aimed at resolving the video long-to-short task. Recognizing the inherent constraints posed by untrained human annotators, which can result in inaccurate annotations for repurposed videos, we propose a two-stage solution to obtain annotations from real-world user-generated content. Furthermore, we offer a baseline model to address this challenging task by integrating audio, visual, and caption aspects through a cross-modal fusion and alignment framework. We aspire for our work to ignite groundbreaking research in the lesser-explored realms of video repurposing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Zhang, Peng Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid increase of space assets represented by small satellites in low Earth orbit can enable ubiquitous digital services for everyone. However, due to the dynamic space environment, numerous space objects, complex atmospheric conditions, and unexpected events can easily introduce adverse conditions affecting space safety, operations, and sustainability of the outer space environment. This challenge calls for responsive, effective satellite object detection (SOD) solutions that allow a small satellite to assess and respond to collision risks, with the consideration of constrained resources on a small satellite platform. This paper discusses the SOD tasks and onboard deep learning (DL) approach to the tasks. Two new DL models are proposed, called GELAN-ViT and GELAN-RepViT, which incorporate vision transformer (ViT) into the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) architecture and address limitations by separating the convolutional neural network and ViT paths. These models outperform the state-of-the-art YOLOv9-t in terms of mean average precision (mAP) and computational costs. On the SOD dataset, our proposed models can achieve around 95% mAP50 with giga-floating point operations (GFLOPs) reduced by over 5.0. On the VOC 2012 dataset, they can achieve $\geq$ 60.7% mAP50 with GFLOPs reduced by over 5.2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiwei Li, Jiahuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, prompt tuning methods for pre-trained models have demonstrated promising performance in Class Incremental Learning (CIL). These methods typically involve learning task-specific prompts and predicting the task ID to select the appropriate prompts for inference. However, inaccurate task ID predictions can cause severe inconsistencies between the prompts used during training and inference, leading to knowledge forgetting and performance degradation. Additionally, existing prompt tuning methods rely solely on the pre-trained model to predict task IDs, without fully leveraging the knowledge embedded in the learned prompt parameters, resulting in inferior prediction performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel Cyclic Prompt Aggregation (CAPrompt) method that eliminates the dependency on task ID prediction by cyclically aggregating the knowledge from different prompts. Specifically, rather than predicting task IDs, we introduce an innovative prompt aggregation strategy during both training and inference to overcome prompt inconsistency by utilizing a weighted sum of different prompts. Thorough theoretical analysis demonstrates that under concave conditions, the aggregated prompt achieves lower error compared to selecting a single task-specific prompt. Consequently, we incorporate a concave constraint and a linear constraint to guide prompt learning, ensuring compliance with the concave condition requirement. Furthermore, to fully exploit the prompts and achieve more accurate prompt weights, we develop a cyclic weight prediction strategy. This strategy begins with equal weights for each task and automatically adjusts them to more appropriate values in a cyclical manner. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our proposed CAPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2%-3%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianhe Jiao, Chenlei Lv, Junli Zhao, Ran Yi, Yu-Hui Wen, Zhenkuan Pan, Zhongke Wu, Yong-jin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: For large-scale point cloud processing, resampling takes the important role of controlling the point number and density while keeping the geometric consistency. % in related tasks. However, current methods cannot balance such different requirements. Particularly with large-scale point clouds, classical methods often struggle with decreased efficiency and accuracy. To address such issues, we propose a weighted Poisson-disk (WPD) resampling method to improve the usability and efficiency for the processing. We first design an initial Poisson resampling with a voxel-based estimation strategy. It is able to estimate a more accurate radius of the Poisson-disk while maintaining high efficiency. Then, we design a weighted tangent smoothing step to further optimize the Voronoi diagram for each point. At the same time, sharp features are detected and kept in the optimized results with isotropic property. Finally, we achieve a resampling copy from the original point cloud with the specified point number, uniform density, and high-quality geometric consistency. Experiments show that our method significantly improves the performance of large-scale point cloud resampling for different applications, and provides a highly practical solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanjiang Weng, Hongsong Wang, Junbo Wang, Lei He, Guosen Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has achieved great success in skeleton-based representation learning recently. However, the prevailing methods are predominantly negative-based, necessitating additional momentum encoder and memory bank to get negative samples, which increases the difficulty of model training. Furthermore, these methods primarily concentrate on learning a global representation for recognition and retrieval tasks, while overlooking the rich and detailed local representations that are crucial for dense prediction tasks. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a Unified Skeleton-based Dense Representation Learning framework based on feature decorrelation, called USDRL, which employs feature decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains in a multi-grained manner to reduce redundancy among dimensions of the representations to maximize information extraction from features. Additionally, we design a Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE) to capture fine-grained action representations effectively, thereby enhancing the performance of dense prediction tasks. Comprehensive experiments, conducted on the benchmarks NTU-60, NTU-120, PKU-MMD I, and PKU-MMD II, across diverse downstream tasks including action recognition, action retrieval, and action detection, conclusively demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunlun Xu, Chenghao Jiang, Peixi Xiong, Yuxin Peng, Jiahuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) is an important but challenging task that suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to significant domain gaps between training steps. Existing LReID approaches typically rely on data replay and knowledge distillation to mitigate this issue. However, data replay methods compromise data privacy by storing historical exemplars, while knowledge distillation methods suffer from limited performance due to the cumulative forgetting of undistilled knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel paradigm that models and rehearses the distribution of the old domains to enhance knowledge consolidation during the new data learning, possessing a strong anti-forgetting capacity without storing any exemplars. Specifically, we introduce an exemplar-free LReID method called Distribution Rehearsing via Adaptive Style Kernel Learning (DASK). DASK includes a Distribution Rehearser Learning (DRL) mechanism that learns to transform arbitrary distribution data into the current data style at each learning step. To enhance the style transfer capacity of DRL, an Adaptive Kernel Prediction Network (AKPNet) is explored to achieve an instance-specific distribution adjustment. Additionally, we design a Distribution Rehearsing-driven LReID Training (DRRT) module, which rehearses old distribution based on the new data via the old AKPNet model, achieving effective new-old knowledge accumulation under a joint knowledge consolidation scheme. Experimental results show our DASK outperforms the existing methods by 3.6%-6.8% and 4.5%-6.5% on anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntian Bo, Yazhou Zhu, Lunbo Li, Haofeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing few-shot medical image segmentation (FSMIS) models fail to address a practical issue in medical imaging: the domain shift caused by different imaging techniques, which limits the applicability to current FSMIS tasks. To overcome this limitation, we focus on the cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation (CD-FSMIS) task, aiming to develop a generalized model capable of adapting to a broader range of medical image segmentation scenarios with limited labeled data from the novel target domain. Inspired by the characteristics of frequency domain similarity across different domains, we propose a Frequency-aware Matching Network (FAMNet), which includes two key components: a Frequency-aware Matching (FAM) module and a Multi-Spectral Fusion (MSF) module. The FAM module tackles two problems during the meta-learning phase: 1) intra-domain variance caused by the inherent support-query bias, due to the different appearances of organs and lesions, and 2) inter-domain variance caused by different medical imaging techniques. Additionally, we design an MSF module to integrate the different frequency features decoupled by the FAM module, and further mitigate the impact of inter-domain variance on the model's segmentation performance. Combining these two modules, our FAMNet surpasses existing FSMIS models and Cross-domain Few-shot Semantic Segmentation models on three cross-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the CD-FSMIS task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Zhang, Shulin Tian, Ziqi Huang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in visual generative models have enabled high-quality image and video generation, opening diverse applications. However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sosuke Yamao, Natsuki Miyahara, Yuki Harazono, Shun Takeuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing complexity of video data and the need for more efficient long-term temporal understanding, existing long-term video understanding methods often fail to accurately capture and analyze extended video sequences. These methods typically struggle to maintain performance over longer durations and to handle the intricate dependencies within the video content. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective large multi-modal model framework for long-term video understanding that incorporates a novel visual compressor, the In-context, Question Adaptive Visual Compressor (IQViC). The key idea, inspired by humans' selective attention and in-context memory mechanisms, is to introduce a novel visual compressor and incorporate efficient memory management techniques to enhance long-term video question answering. Our framework utilizes IQViC, a transformer-based visual compressor, enabling question-conditioned in-context compression, unlike existing methods that rely on full video visual features. This selectively extracts relevant information, significantly reducing memory token requirements. Through extensive experiments on a new dataset based on InfiniBench for long-term video understanding, and standard benchmarks used for existing methods' evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IQViC framework and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of video understanding accuracy and memory efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Wang, Wenpeng Neng, Zhenao Wei, Yu Lei, Weiying Xue, Nan Zhuang, Yanwu Xu, Xinyu Jiang, Qi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-object contact (HOT) is designed to accurately identify the areas where humans and objects come into contact. Current methods frequently fail to account for scenarios where objects are frequently blocking the view, resulting in inaccurate identification of contact areas. To tackle this problem, we suggest using a perspective interaction HOT detector called PIHOT, which utilizes a depth map generation model to offer depth information of humans and objects related to the camera, thereby preventing false interaction detection. Furthermore, we use mask dilatation and object restoration techniques to restore the texture details in covered areas, improve the boundaries between objects, and enhance the perception of humans interacting with objects. Moreover, a spatial awareness perception is intended to concentrate on the characteristic features close to the points of contact. The experimental results show that the PIHOT algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets for HOT detection tasks. Compared to the most recent DHOT, our method enjoys an average improvement of 13%, 27.5%, 16%, and 18.5% on SC-Acc., C-Acc., mIoU, and wIoU metrics, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Li, Rui Zhao, Zeyu Wang, Huiying Xu, Xinzhong Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images has emerged as a focal area of research, which presents two significant challenges: i) objects are typically small and dense within vast images; ii) computational resource constraints render most models unsuitable for real-time deployment. Current real-time object detectors are not optimized for UAV images, and complex methods designed for small object detection often lack real-time capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detector, RemDet (Reparameter efficient multiplication Detector). Our contributions are as follows: 1) Rethinking the challenges of existing detectors for small and dense UAV images, and proposing information loss as a design guideline for efficient models. 2) We introduce the ChannelC2f module to enhance small object detection performance, demonstrating that high-dimensional representations can effectively mitigate information loss. 3) We design the GatedFFN module to provide not only strong performance but also low latency, effectively addressing the challenges of real-time detection. Our research reveals that GatedFFN, through the use of multiplication, is more cost-effective than feed-forward networks for high-dimensional representation. 4) We propose the CED module, which combines the advantages of ViT and CNN downsampling to effectively reduce information loss. It specifically enhances context information for small and dense objects. Extensive experiments on large UAV datasets, Visdrone and UAVDT, validate the real-time efficiency and superior performance of our methods. On the challenging UAV dataset VisDrone, our methods not only provided state-of-the-art results, improving detection by more than 3.4%, but also achieve 110 FPS on a single 4090.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuaiting Li, Chengxuan Wang, Juncan Deng, Zeyu Wang, Zewen Ye, Zongsheng Wang, Haibin Shen, Kejie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector quantization(VQ) is a hardware-friendly DNN compression method that can reduce the storage cost and weight-loading datawidth of hardware accelerators. However, conventional VQ techniques lead to significant accuracy loss because the important weights are not well preserved. To tackle this problem, a novel approach called MVQ is proposed, which aims at better approximating important weights with a limited number of codewords. At the algorithm level, our approach removes the less important weights through N:M pruning and then minimizes the vector clustering error between the remaining weights and codewords by the masked k-means algorithm. Only distances between the unpruned weights and the codewords are computed, which are then used to update the codewords. At the architecture level, our accelerator implements vector quantization on an EWS (Enhanced weight stationary) CNN accelerator and proposes a sparse systolic array design to maximize the benefits brought by masked vector quantization.\\ Our algorithm is validated on various models for image classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MVQ not only outperforms conventional vector quantization methods at comparable compression ratios but also reduces FLOPs. Under ASIC evaluation, our MVQ accelerator boosts energy efficiency by 2.3$\times$ and reduces the size of the systolic array by 55\% when compared with the base EWS accelerator. Compared to the previous sparse accelerators, MVQ achieves 1.73$\times$ higher energy efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingrui Wang, Xin Li, Yaosi Hu, Hanxin Zhu, Chen Hou, Cuiling Lan, Zhibo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-driven Image to Video Generation (TI2V) aims to generate controllable video given the first frame and corresponding textual description. The primary challenges of this task lie in two parts: (i) how to identify the target objects and ensure the consistency between the movement trajectory and the textual description. (ii) how to improve the subjective quality of generated videos. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a new diffusion-based TI2V framework, termed TIV-Diffusion, via object-centric textual-visual alignment, intending to achieve precise control and high-quality video generation based on textual-described motion for different objects. Concretely, we enable our TIV-Diffuion model to perceive the textual-described objects and their motion trajectory by incorporating the fused textual and visual knowledge through scale-offset modulation. Moreover, to mitigate the problems of object disappearance and misaligned objects and motion, we introduce an object-centric textual-visual alignment module, which reduces the risk of misaligned objects/motion by decoupling the objects in the reference image and aligning textual features with each object individually. Based on the above innovations, our TIV-Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art high-quality video generation compared with existing TI2V methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaowei Li, Yuxuan Bian, Xuan Ju, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ying Shan, Yuexian Zou, Qiang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image editing has advanced significantly with the development of diffusion models using both inversion-based and instruction-based methods. However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models are applied in a broad spectrum of settings with different inference constraints, from massive multi-accelerator clusters to resource-constrained standalone mobile devices. However, the substantial costs associated with training these models often limit the number of unique model sizes that can be offered. Consequently, practitioners are compelled to select a model that may not be optimally aligned with their specific latency and cost requirements. We present MatFormer, a novel Transformer architecture designed to provide elastic inference across diverse deployment constraints. MatFormer achieves this by incorporating a nested Feed Forward Network (FFN) block structure within a standard Transformer model. During training, we optimize the parameters of multiple nested FFN blocks with varying sizes, enabling the extraction of hundreds of accurate smaller models without incurring additional computational costs. We empirically validate the efficacy of MatFormer across different model classes (decoders and encoders) and modalities (language and vision), demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment. We show that a 850M decoder-only MatFormer language model (MatLM) allows us to extract multiple smaller models spanning from 582M to 850M parameters, each exhibiting better validation loss and one-shot downstream evaluations than independently trained counterparts. Furthermore, we observe that smaller encoders extracted from a universal MatFormer-based ViT (MatViT) encoder preserve the metric-space structure for adaptive large-scale retrieval. Finally, we showcase that speculative decoding with the accurate and consistent submodels extracted from MatFormer can lead to significant reduction in inference latency.

<p>Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has gained traction as an effective solution for image storage and transmission in recent years. However, existing LIC methods are redundant in latent representation due to limitations in capturing anisotropic frequency components and preserving directional details. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel frequency-aware transformer (FAT) block that for the first time achieves multiscale directional ananlysis for LIC. The FAT block comprises frequency-decomposition window attention (FDWA) modules to capture multiscale and directional frequency components of natural images. Additionally, we introduce frequency-modulation feed-forward network (FMFFN) to adaptively modulate different frequency components, improving rate-distortion performance. Furthermore, we present a transformer-based channel-wise autoregressive (T-CA) model that effectively exploits channel dependencies. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance compared to existing LIC methods, and evidently outperforms latest standardized codec VTM-12.1 by 14.5%, 15.1%, 13.0% in BD-rate on the Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: With rapid advances in generative artificial intelligence, the text-to-music synthesis task has emerged as a promising direction for music generation. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over multi-track generation remains an open challenge. While existing models excel in directly generating multi-track mix, their limitations become evident when it comes to composing individual tracks and integrating them in a controllable manner. This departure from the typical workflows of professional composers hinders the ability to refine details in specific tracks. To address this gap, we propose JEN-1 Composer, a unified framework designed to efficiently model marginal, conditional, and joint distributions over multi-track music using a single model. Building upon an audio latent diffusion model, JEN-1 Composer extends the versatility of multi-track music generation. We introduce a progressive curriculum training strategy, which gradually escalates the difficulty of training tasks while ensuring the model's generalization ability and facilitating smooth transitions between different scenarios. During inference, users can iteratively generate and select music tracks, thus incrementally composing entire musical pieces in accordance with the Human-AI co-composition workflow. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in controllable and high-fidelity multi-track music synthesis, marking a significant advancement in interactive AI-assisted music creation.

<p>Abstract: The massive proliferation of social media data represents a transformative opportunity for conflict studies and for tracking the proliferation and use of weaponry, as conflicts are increasingly documented in these online spaces. At the same time, the scale and types of data available are problematic for traditional open-source intelligence. This paper focuses on identifying specific weapon systems and the insignias of the armed groups using them as documented in the Ukraine war, as these tasks are critical to operational intelligence and tracking weapon proliferation, especially given the scale of international military aid given to Ukraine. The large scale of social media makes manual assessment difficult, however, so this paper presents early work that uses computer vision models to support this task. We demonstrate that these models can both identify weapons embedded in images shared in social media and how the resulting collection of military-relevant images and their post times interact with the offline, real-world conflict. Not only can we then track changes in the prevalence of images of tanks, land mines, military trucks, etc., we find correlations among time series data associated with these images and the daily fatalities in this conflict. This work shows substantial opportunity for examining similar online documentation of conflict contexts, and we also point to future avenues where computer vision can be further improved for these open-source intelligence tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuangpu Guo, Yuhe Ding, Jian Liang, Ran He, Zilei Wang, Tieniu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Label skews, characterized by disparities in local label distribution across clients, pose a significant challenge in federated learning. As minority classes suffer from worse accuracy due to overfitting on local imbalanced data, prior methods often incorporate class-balanced learning techniques during local training. Although these methods improve the mean accuracy across all classes, we observe that vacant classes-referring to categories absent from a client's data distribution-remain poorly recognized. Besides, there is still a gap in the accuracy of local models on minority classes compared to the global model. This paper introduces FedVLS, a novel approach to label-skewed federated learning that integrates both vacant-class distillation and logit suppression simultaneously. Specifically, vacant-class distillation leverages knowledge distillation during local training on each client to retain essential information related to vacant classes from the global model. Moreover, logit suppression directly penalizes network logits for non-label classes, effectively addressing misclassifications in minority classes that may be biased toward majority classes. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of FedVLS, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across diverse datasets with varying degrees of label skews.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Luo, Xilie Xu, Feng Liu, Yun Sing Koh, Di Wang, Jingfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is an efficient strategy for adapting latent diffusion models (LDMs) on a private dataset to generate specific images by minimizing the adaptation loss. However, the LoRA-adapted LDMs are vulnerable to membership inference (MI) attacks that can judge whether a particular data point belongs to the private dataset, thus leading to the privacy leakage. To defend against MI attacks, we first propose a straightforward solution: Membership-Privacy-preserving LoRA (MP-LoRA). MP-LoRA is formulated as a min-max optimization problem where a proxy attack model is trained by maximizing its MI gain while the LDM is adapted by minimizing the sum of the adaptation loss and the MI gain of the proxy attack model. However, we empirically find that MP-LoRA has the issue of unstable optimization, and theoretically analyze that the potential reason is the unconstrained local smoothness, which impedes the privacy-preserving adaptation. To mitigate this issue, we further propose a Stable Membership-Privacy-preserving LoRA (SMP-LoRA) that adapts the LDM by minimizing the ratio of the adaptation loss to the MI gain. Besides, we theoretically prove that the local smoothness of SMP-LoRA can be constrained by the gradient norm, leading to improved convergence. Our experimental results corroborate that SMP-LoRA can indeed defend against MI attacks and generate high-quality images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Hayashi, Kazuma Onishi, Toma Suzuki, Yusuke Ide, Seiji Gobara, Shigeki Saito, Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Taro Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process both images and text, excelling in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and description generation. However, while these models excel at generating factual content, their ability to generate and evaluate texts reflecting perspectives on the same image, depending on the context, has not been sufficiently explored. To address this, we propose IRR: Image Review Rank, a novel evaluation framework designed to assess critic review texts from multiple perspectives. IRR evaluates LVLMs by measuring how closely their judgments align with human interpretations. We validate it using a dataset of images from 15 categories, each with five critic review texts and annotated rankings in both English and Japanese, totaling over 2,000 data instances. The datasets are available at https://hf.co/datasets/naist-nlp/Wiki-ImageReview1.0. Our results indicate that, although LVLMs exhibited consistent performance across languages, their correlation with human annotations was insufficient, highlighting the need for further advancements. These findings highlight the limitations of current evaluation methods and the need for approaches that better capture human reasoning in Vision & Language tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Penghai Zhao, Xin Zhang, Jiayue Cao, Ming-Ming Cheng, Jian Yang, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) have led to an overwhelming expansion of scientific knowledge, spawning numerous literature reviews aimed at collecting and synthesizing fragmented information. This paper presents a thorough analysis of these literature reviews within the PAMI field, and tries to address three core research questions: (1) What are the prevalent structural and statistical characteristics of PAMI literature reviews? (2) What strategies can researchers employ to efficiently navigate the growing corpus of reviews? (3) What are the advantages and limitations of AI-generated reviews compared to human-authored ones? To address the first research question, we begin with a narrative overview to highlight common preferences in composing PAMI reviews, followed by a statistical analysis to quantitatively uncover patterns in these preferences. Our findings reveal several key insights. First, fewer than 20% of PAMI reviews currently comply with PRISMA standards, although this proportion is gradually increasing. Second, there is a moderate positive correlation between the quality of references and the scholarly impact of reviews, emphasizing the importance of reference selection. To further assist researchers in efficiently managing the rapidly growing number of literature reviews, we introduce four novel, real-time, article-level bibliometric indicators that facilitate the screening of numerous reviews. Finally, our comparative analysis reveals that AI-generated reviews currently fall short of human-authored ones in accurately evaluating the academic significance of newly published articles and integrating rich visual elements, which limits their practical utility. Overall, this study provides a deeper understanding of PAMI literature reviews by uncovering key trends, evaluating current practices, and highlighting areas for future improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjie Zhang, Shenyuan Gao, Zhening Liu, Jiawei Shao, Xingtong Ge, Dailan He, Tongda Xu, Yan Wang, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing learning-based stereo image codec adopt sophisticated transformation with simple entropy models derived from single image codecs to encode latent representations. However, those entropy models struggle to effectively capture the spatial-disparity characteristics inherent in stereo images, which leads to suboptimal rate-distortion results. In this paper, we propose a stereo image compression framework, named CAMSIC. CAMSIC independently transforms each image to latent representation and employs a powerful decoder-free Transformer entropy model to capture both spatial and disparity dependencies, by introducing a novel content-aware masked image modeling (MIM) technique. Our content-aware MIM facilitates efficient bidirectional interaction between prior information and estimated tokens, which naturally obviates the need for an extra Transformer decoder. Experiments show that our stereo image codec achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on two stereo image datasets Cityscapes and InStereo2K with fast encoding and decoding speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Waida, Kimihiro Yamazaki, Atsushi Tokuhisa, Mutsuyo Wada, Yuichiro Wada</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning for image denoising problems in the presence of denaturation for noisy data is a crucial approach in machine learning. However, theoretical understanding of the performance of the approach that uses denatured data is lacking. To provide better understanding of the approach, in this paper, we analyze a self-supervised denoising algorithm that uses denatured data in depth through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Through the theoretical analysis, we discuss that the algorithm finds desired solutions to the optimization problem with the population risk, while the guarantee for the empirical risk depends on the hardness of the denoising task in terms of denaturation levels. We also conduct several experiments to investigate the performance of an extended algorithm in practice. The results indicate that the algorithm training with denatured images works, and the empirical performance aligns with the theoretical results. These results suggest several insights for further improvement of self-supervised image denoising that uses denatured data in future directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Meanwhile, a novel quality evaluation criterion is proposed to quantitatively assess the quality of existing studies. Through an extensive review and analysis of 169 studies, we present recent technical advancements, discuss existing challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Henry Wu, Rishi Shah, Jing Yu Koh, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Daniel Fried, Aditi Raghunathan</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models (LMs) are used to build autonomous agents in real environments, ensuring their adversarial robustness becomes a critical challenge. Unlike chatbots, agents are compound systems with multiple components, which existing LM safety evaluations do not adequately address. To bridge this gap, we manually create 200 targeted adversarial tasks and evaluation functions in a realistic threat model on top of VisualWebArena, a real environment for web-based agents. In order to systematically examine the robustness of various multimodal we agents, we propose the Agent Robustness Evaluation (ARE) framework. ARE views the agent as a graph showing the flow of intermediate outputs between components and decomposes robustness as the flow of adversarial information on the graph. First, we find that we can successfully break a range of the latest agents that use black-box frontier LLMs, including those that perform reflection and tree-search. With imperceptible perturbations to a single product image (less than 5% of total web page pixels), an attacker can hijack these agents to execute targeted adversarial goals with success rates up to 67%. We also use ARE to rigorously evaluate how the robustness changes as new components are added. We find that new components that typically improve benign performance can open up new vulnerabilities and harm robustness. An attacker can compromise the evaluator used by the reflexion agent and the value function of the tree search agent, which increases the attack success relatively by 15% and 20%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Tang, Shohreh Deldari, Hao Xue, Celso De Melo, Flora D. Salim</p>
<p>Abstract: Video language continual learning involves continuously adapting to information from video and text inputs, enhancing a model's ability to handle new tasks while retaining prior knowledge. This field is a relatively under-explored area, and establishing appropriate datasets is crucial for facilitating communication and research in this field. In this study, we present the first dedicated benchmark, ViLCo-Bench, designed to evaluate continual learning models across a range of video-text tasks. The dataset comprises ten-minute-long videos and corresponding language queries collected from publicly available datasets. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-efficient framework that incorporates self-supervised learning and mimics long-term and short-term memory effects. This framework addresses challenges including memory complexity from long video clips, natural language complexity from open queries, and text-video misalignment. We posit that ViLCo-Bench, with greater complexity compared to existing continual learning benchmarks, would serve as a critical tool for exploring the video-language domain, extending beyond conventional class-incremental tasks, and addressing complex and limited annotation issues.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Chen, Hang Yu, Subin Huang, Sanmin Liu, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sarcasm in social media, often expressed through text-image combinations, poses challenges for sentiment analysis and intention mining. Current multi-modal sarcasm detection methods have been demonstrated to overly rely on spurious cues within the textual modality, revealing a limited ability to genuinely identify sarcasm through nuanced text-image interactions. To solve this problem, we propose InterCLIP-MEP, which introduces Interactive CLIP (InterCLIP) with an efficient training strategy to extract enriched text-image representations by embedding cross-modal information directly into each encoder. Additionally, we design a Memory-Enhanced Predictor (MEP) with a dynamic dual-channel memory that stores valuable test sample knowledge during inference, acting as a non-parametric classifier for robust sarcasm recognition. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that InterCLIP-MEP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant accuracy and F1 score improvements on MMSD and MMSD2.0.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Xu, Chang Yu, Jiangjun Peng, Xiangyong Cao, Deyu Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image restoration aims to reconstruct missing or corrupted areas within images. To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiying Wang, Abhirup Banerjee, Robin P. Choudhury, Vicente Grau</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the most common cause of death worldwide. Invasive x-ray coronary angiography (ICA) is one of the most important imaging modalities for the diagnosis of CVDs. ICA typically acquires only two 2D projections, which makes the 3D geometry of coronary vessels difficult to interpret, thus requiring 3D coronary artery tree reconstruction from two projections. State-of-the-art approaches require significant manual interactions and cannot correct the non-rigid cardiac and respiratory motions between non-simultaneous projections. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning pipeline named \emph{DeepCA}. We leverage the Wasserstein conditional generative adversarial network with gradient penalty, latent convolutional transformer layers, and a dynamic snake convolutional critic to implicitly compensate for the non-rigid motion and provide 3D coronary artery tree reconstruction. Through simulating projections from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), we achieve the generalisation of 3D coronary tree reconstruction on real non-simultaneous ICA projections. We incorporate an application-specific evaluation metric to validate our proposed model on both a CCTA dataset and a real ICA dataset, together with Chamfer $\ell_2$ distance. The results demonstrate promising performance of our DeepCA model in vessel topology preservation, recovery of missing features, and generalisation ability to real ICA data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that leverages deep learning to achieve 3D coronary tree reconstruction from two real non-simultaneous x-ray angiographic projections.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of new modalities into frontier AI systems offers exciting capabilities, but also increases the possibility such systems can be adversarially manipulated in undesirable ways. In this work, we focus on a popular class of vision-language models (VLMs) that generate text outputs conditioned on visual and textual inputs. We conducted a large-scale empirical study to assess the transferability of gradient-based universal image ``jailbreaks" using a diverse set of over 40 open-parameter VLMs, including 18 new VLMs that we publicly release. Overall, we find that transferable gradient-based image jailbreaks are extremely difficult to obtain. When an image jailbreak is optimized against a single VLM or against an ensemble of VLMs, the jailbreak successfully jailbreaks the attacked VLM(s), but exhibits little-to-no transfer to any other VLMs; transfer is not affected by whether the attacked and target VLMs possess matching vision backbones or language models, whether the language model underwent instruction-following and/or safety-alignment training, or many other factors. Only two settings display partially successful transfer: between identically-pretrained and identically-initialized VLMs with slightly different VLM training data, and between different training checkpoints of a single VLM. Leveraging these results, we then demonstrate that transfer can be significantly improved against a specific target VLM by attacking larger ensembles of ``highly-similar" VLMs. These results stand in stark contrast to existing evidence of universal and transferable text jailbreaks against language models and transferable adversarial attacks against image classifiers, suggesting that VLMs may be more robust to gradient-based transfer attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyun Sun, Chengxiao Dai, Zhongze Luo, Yangbo Chang, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Legal Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in providing legal consultations to non-experts. However, most existing Chinese legal consultation models are based on single-agent systems, which differ from real-world legal consultations, where multiple professionals collaborate to offer more tailored responses. To better simulate real consultations, we propose LawLuo, a multi-agent framework for multi-turn Chinese legal consultations. LawLuo includes four agents: the receptionist agent, which assesses user intent and selects a lawyer agent; the lawyer agent, which interacts with the user; the secretary agent, which organizes conversation records and generates consultation reports; and the boss agent, which evaluates the performance of the lawyer and secretary agents to ensure optimal results. These agents' interactions mimic the operations of real law firms. To train them to follow different legal instructions, we developed distinct fine-tuning datasets. We also introduce a case graph-based RAG to help the lawyer agent address vague user inputs. Experimental results show that LawLuo outperforms baselines in generating more personalized and professional responses, handling ambiguous queries, and following legal instructions in multi-turn conversations. Our full code and constructed datasets will be open-sourced upon paper acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eui Jun Hwang, Sukmin Cho, Junmyeong Lee, Jong C. Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) converts sign videos directly into spoken language sentences without relying on glosses. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable translation performance in gloss-free methods by harnessing their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these methods often rely on domain-specific fine-tuning of visual encoders to achieve optimal results. By contrast, this paper emphasizes the importance of capturing the spatial configurations and motion dynamics inherent in sign language. With this in mind, we introduce Spatial and Motion-based Sign Language Translation (SpaMo), a novel LLM-based SLT framework. The core idea of SpaMo is simple yet effective. We first extract spatial and motion features using off-the-shelf visual encoders and then input these features into an LLM with a language prompt. Additionally, we employ a visual-text alignment process as a warm-up before the SLT supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that SpaMo achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sizhe Hu, Wenming Wu, Yuntao Wang, Benzhu Xu, Liping Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Automating architectural floorplan design is vital for housing and interior design, offering a faster, cost-effective alternative to manual sketches by architects. However, existing methods, including rule-based and learning-based approaches, face challenges in design complexity and constrained generation with extensive post-processing, and tend to obvious geometric inconsistencies such as misalignment, overlap, and gaps. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework for vector floorplan design via structural graph generation, called GSDiff, focusing on wall junction generation and wall segment prediction to capture both geometric and semantic aspects of structural graphs. To improve the geometric rationality of generated structural graphs, we propose two innovative geometry enhancement methods. In wall junction generation, we propose a novel alignment loss function to improve geometric consistency. In wall segment prediction, we propose a random self-supervision method to enhance the model's perception of the overall geometric structure, thereby promoting the generation of reasonable geometric structures. Employing the diffusion model and the Transformer model, as well as the geometry enhancement strategies, our framework can generate wall junctions, wall segments and room polygons with structural and semantic information, resulting in structural graphs that accurately represent floorplans. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method surpasses existing techniques, enabling free generation and constrained generation, marking a shift towards structure generation in architectural design.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiying Wang, Abhirup Banerjee, Vicente Grau</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the most common health threats worldwide. 2D X-ray invasive coronary angiography (ICA) remains the most widely adopted imaging modality for CVD assessment during real-time cardiac interventions. However, it is often difficult for cardiologists to interpret the 3D geometry of coronary vessels based on 2D planes. Moreover, due to the radiation limit, often only two angiographic projections are acquired, providing limited information of the vessel geometry and necessitating 3D coronary tree reconstruction based only on two ICA projections. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised deep learning method called NeCA, which is based on neural implicit representation using the multiresolution hash encoder and differentiable cone-beam forward projector layer, in order to achieve 3D coronary artery tree reconstruction from two 2D projections. We validate our method using six different metrics on a dataset generated from coronary computed tomography angiography of right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The evaluation results demonstrate that our NeCA method, without requiring 3D ground truth for supervision or large datasets for training, achieves promising performance in both vessel topology and branch-connectivity preservation compared to the supervised deep learning model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Enhancing low-light images remains a critical challenge in computer vision, as does designing lightweight models for edge devices that can handle the computational demands of deep learning. In this article, we introduce an extended version of the Channel-Prior and Gamma-Estimation Network (CPGA-Net), termed CPGA-Net+, which incorporates an attention mechanism driven by a reformulated Atmospheric Scattering Model and effectively addresses both global and local image processing through Plug-in Attention with gamma correction. These innovations enable CPGA-Net+ to achieve superior performance on image enhancement tasks for supervised and unsupervised learning, surpassing lightweight state-of-the-art methods with high efficiency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that our approach inherently decomposes the enhancement process into restoration and lightening stages, aligning with the fundamental image degradation model. To further optimize efficiency, we introduce a block simplification technique that reduces computational costs by more than two-thirds. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of CPGA-Net+ and highlight its potential for applications in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements in multimodal large language models have enabled the creation of hyper-realistic images from textual descriptions. However, these advancements also raise significant concerns about unauthorized use, which hinders their broader distribution. Traditional watermarking methods often require complex integration or degrade image quality. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework Towards Effective user Attribution for latent diffusion models via Watermark-Informed Blending (TEAWIB). TEAWIB incorporates a unique ready-to-use configuration approach that allows seamless integration of user-specific watermarks into generative models. This approach ensures that each user can directly apply a pre-configured set of parameters to the model without altering the original model parameters or compromising image quality. Additionally, noise and augmentation operations are embedded at the pixel level to further secure and stabilize watermarked images. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of TEAWIB, showcasing the state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and attribution accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \c{S}aban \"Ozt\"urk, O\u{g}uz Can Duran, Tolga \c{C}ukur</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lower potential risks linked to radiation exposure while relying on advanced denoising algorithms to maintain diagnostic quality in reconstructed images. The reigning paradigm in LDCT denoising is based on neural network models that learn data-driven image priors to separate noise evoked by dose reduction from underlying tissue signals. Naturally, the fidelity of these priors depend on the model's ability to capture the broad range of contextual features evident in CT images. Earlier convolutional neural networks (CNN) are highly adept at efficiently capturing short-range spatial context, but their limited receptive fields reduce sensitivity to interactions over longer distances. Although transformers based on self-attention mechanisms have recently been posed to increase sensitivity to long-range context, they can suffer from suboptimal performance and efficiency due to elevated model complexity, particularly for high-resolution CT images. For high-quality restoration of LDCT images, here we introduce DenoMamba, a novel denoising method based on state-space modeling (SSM), that efficiently captures short- and long-range context in medical images. Following an hourglass architecture with encoder-decoder stages, DenoMamba employs a spatial SSM module to encode spatial context and a novel channel SSM module equipped with a secondary gated convolution network to encode latent features of channel context at each stage. Feature maps from the two modules are then consolidated with low-level input features via a convolution fusion module (CFM). Comprehensive experiments on LDCT datasets with 25\% and 10\% dose reduction demonstrate that DenoMamba outperforms state-of-the-art denoisers with average improvements of 1.4dB PSNR, 1.1% SSIM, and 1.6% RMSE in recovered image quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Xiling Li, Korbinian Franz Rudolf, Nils Blank, Rudolf Lioutikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Prototype Learning methods provide an interpretable alternative to black-box deep learning models. Approaches such as ProtoPNet learn, which part of a test image "look like" known prototypical parts from training images, combining predictive power with the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning. However, existing approaches have two main drawbacks: A) They rely solely on deterministic similarity scores without statistical confidence. B) The prototypes are learned in a black-box manner without human input. This work introduces HyperPg, a new prototype representation leveraging Gaussian distributions on a hypersphere in latent space, with learnable mean and variance. HyperPg prototypes adapt to the spread of clusters in the latent space and output likelihood scores. The new architecture, HyperPgNet, leverages HyperPg to learn prototypes aligned with human concepts from pixel-level annotations. Consequently, each prototype represents a specific concept such as color, image texture, or part of the image subject. A concept extraction pipeline built on foundation models provides pixel-level annotations, significantly reducing human labeling effort. Experiments on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets demonstrate that HyperPgNet outperforms other prototype learning architectures while using fewer parameters and training steps. Additionally, the concept-aligned HyperPg prototypes are learned transparently, enhancing model interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh Bui, Long Vuong, Khanh Doan, Trung Le, Paul Montague, Tamas Abraham, Dinh Phung</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating visually striking content from text but can inadvertently produce undesirable or harmful content when trained on unfiltered internet data. A practical solution is to selectively removing target concepts from the model, but this may impact the remaining concepts. Prior approaches have tried to balance this by introducing a loss term to preserve neutral content or a regularization term to minimize changes in the model parameters, yet resolving this trade-off remains challenging. In this work, we propose to identify and preserving concepts most affected by parameter changes, termed as \textit{adversarial concepts}. This approach ensures stable erasure with minimal impact on the other concepts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using the Stable Diffusion model, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods in eliminating unwanted content while maintaining the integrity of other unrelated elements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Gong, Guangyin Bao, Qi Zhang, Zhongwei Wan, Duoqian Miao, Shoujin Wang, Lei Zhu, Changwei Wang, Rongtao Xu, Liang Hu, Ke Liu, Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstruction of static visual stimuli from non-invasion brain activity fMRI achieves great success, owning to advanced deep learning models such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion. However, the research on fMRI-to-video reconstruction remains limited since decoding the spatiotemporal perception of continuous visual experiences is formidably challenging. We contend that the key to addressing these challenges lies in accurately decoding both high-level semantics and low-level perception flows, as perceived by the brain in response to video stimuli. To the end, we propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to decode high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a semantics reconstructor to reconstruct video keyframes, guiding semantic accuracy and consistency, and employs a perception reconstructor to capture low-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness. During inference, it adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both keyframes and low-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a publicly available fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity video reconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128% improvement in SSIM and an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Wang, Bocheng Guo, Yijie Li, Junyi Wang, Yuqian Chen, Jarrett Rushmore, Nikos Makris, Yogesh Rathi, Lauren J O'Donnell, Fan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial strategy for white matter (WM) parcellation. Current methods primarily use the geometric information of fibers (i.e., the spatial trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, overlooking the important functional signals present along the fiber tracts. There is increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using functional MRI (fMRI), offering potentially valuable multimodal information for fiber clustering. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), that uses joint dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber tracts. It includes two major components: 1) a multi-view pretraining module to compute embedding features from fiber geometric information and functional signals separately, and 2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine the two kinds of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05985">Emotional Images: Assessing Emotions in Images and Potential Biases in Generative Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maneet Mehta, Cody Buntain</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines potential biases and inconsistencies in emotional evocation of images produced by generative artificial intelligence (AI) models and their potential bias toward negative emotions. In particular, we assess this bias by comparing the emotions evoked by an AI-produced image to the emotions evoked by prompts used to create those images. As a first step, the study evaluates three approaches for identifying emotions in images -- traditional supervised learning, zero-shot learning with vision-language models, and cross-modal auto-captioning -- using EmoSet, a large dataset of image-emotion annotations that categorizes images across eight emotional types. Results show fine-tuned models, particularly Google's Vision Transformer (ViT), significantly outperform zero-shot and caption-based methods in recognizing emotions in images. For a cross-modality comparison, we then analyze the differences between emotions in text prompts -- via existing text-based emotion-recognition models -- and the emotions evoked in the resulting images. Findings indicate that AI-generated images frequently lean toward negative emotional content, regardless of the original prompt. This emotional skew in generative models could amplify negative affective content in digital spaces, perpetuating its prevalence and impact. The study advocates for a multidisciplinary approach to better align AI emotion recognition with psychological insights and address potential biases in generative AI outputs across digital media.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09502">Golden Noise for Diffusion Models: A Learning Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikai Zhou, Shitong Shao, Lichen Bai, Zhiqiang Xu, Bo Han, Zeke Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise. While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Maritime environmental sensing requires overcoming challenges from complex conditions such as harsh weather, platform perturbations, large dynamic objects, and the requirement for long detection ranges. While cameras and LiDAR are commonly used in ground vehicle navigation, their applicability in maritime settings is limited by range constraints and hardware maintenance issues. Radar sensors, however, offer robust long-range detection capabilities and resilience to physical contamination from weather and saline conditions, making it a powerful sensor for maritime navigation. Among various radar types, X-band radar (e.g., marine radar) is widely employed for maritime vessel navigation, providing effective long-range detection essential for situational awareness and collision avoidance. Nevertheless, it exhibits limitations during berthing operations where close-range object detection is critical. To address this shortcoming, we incorporate W-band radar (e.g., Navtech imaging radar), which excels in detecting nearby objects with a higher update rate. We present a comprehensive maritime sensor dataset featuring multi-range detection capabilities. This dataset integrates short-range LiDAR data, medium-range W-band radar data, and long-range X-band radar data into a unified framework. Additionally, it includes object labels for oceanic object detection usage, derived from radar and stereo camera images. The dataset comprises seven sequences collected from diverse regions with varying levels of estimation difficulty, ranging from easy to challenging, and includes common locations suitable for global localization tasks. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in place recognition, odometry estimation, SLAM, object detection, and dynamic object elimination within maritime environments.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05517">Test-time Cost-and-Quality Controllable Arbitrary-Scale Super-Resolution with Variable Fourier Components</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazutoshi Akita, Norimichi Ukita</p>
<p>Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) with arbitrary scale factor and cost-and-quality controllability at test time is essential for various applications. While several arbitrary-scale SR methods have been proposed, these methods require us to modify the model structure and retrain it to control the computational cost and SR quality. To address this limitation, we propose a novel SR method using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the Fourier representation. In our method, the RNN sequentially estimates Fourier components, each consisting of frequency and amplitude, and aggregates these components to reconstruct an SR image. Since the RNN can adjust the number of recurrences at test time, we can control the computational cost and SR quality in a single model: fewer recurrences (i.e., fewer Fourier components) lead to lower cost but lower quality, while more recurrences (i.e., more Fourier components) lead to better quality but more cost. Experimental results prove that more Fourier components improve the PSNR score. Furthermore, even with fewer Fourier components, our method achieves a lower PSNR drop than other state-of-the-art arbitrary-scale SR methods.</p>
