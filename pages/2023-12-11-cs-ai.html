<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03706">An Evaluation of State-of-the-Art Large Language Models for Sarcasm Detection. (arXiv:2312.03706v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Zhou_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Juliann Zhou</a></p>
<p>Sarcasm, as defined by Merriam-Webster, is the use of words by someone who
means the opposite of what he is trying to say. In the field of sentimental
analysis of Natural Language Processing, the ability to correctly identify
sarcasm is necessary for understanding people's true opinions. Because the use
of sarcasm is often context-based, previous research has used language
representation models, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM), to identify sarcasm with contextual-based information. Recent
innovations in NLP have provided more possibilities for detecting sarcasm. In
BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language
Understanding, Jacob Devlin et al. (2018) introduced a new language
representation model and demonstrated higher precision in interpreting
contextualized language. As proposed by Hazarika et al. (2018), CASCADE is a
context-driven model that produces good results for detecting sarcasm. This
study analyzes a Reddit corpus using these two state-of-the-art models and
evaluates their performance against baseline models to find the ideal approach
to sarcasm detection.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03708">Abstraction via exemplars? A representational case study on lexical category inference in BERT. (arXiv:2312.03708v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>

<p>Exemplar based accounts are often considered to be in direct opposition to
pure linguistic abstraction in explaining language learners' ability to
generalize to novel expressions. However, the recent success of neural network
language models on linguistically sensitive tasks suggests that perhaps
abstractions can arise via the encoding of exemplars. We provide empirical
evidence for this claim by adapting an existing experiment that studies how an
LM (BERT) generalizes the usage of novel tokens that belong to lexical
categories such as Noun/Verb/Adjective/Adverb from exposure to only a single
instance of their usage. We analyze the representational behavior of the novel
tokens in these experiments, and find that BERT's capacity to generalize to
unseen expressions involving the use of these novel tokens constitutes the
movement of novel token representations towards regions of known category
exemplars in two-dimensional space. Our results suggest that learners' encoding
of exemplars can indeed give rise to abstraction like behavior.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03716">Co-guiding for Multi-intent Spoken Language Understanding. (arXiv:2312.03716v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>

<p>Recent graph-based models for multi-intent SLU have obtained promising
results through modeling the guidance from the prediction of intents to the
decoding of slot filling. However, existing methods (1) only model the
unidirectional guidance from intent to slot, while there are bidirectional
inter-correlations between intent and slot; (2) adopt homogeneous graphs to
model the interactions between the slot semantics nodes and intent label nodes,
which limit the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel model termed
Co-guiding Net, which implements a two-stage framework achieving the mutual
guidances between the two tasks. In the first stage, the initial estimated
labels of both tasks are produced, and then they are leveraged in the second
stage to model the mutual guidances. Specifically, we propose two heterogeneous
graph attention networks working on the proposed two heterogeneous semantics
label graphs, which effectively represent the relations among the semantics
nodes and label nodes. Besides, we further propose Co-guiding-SCL Net, which
exploits the single-task and dual-task semantics contrastive relations. For the
first stage, we propose single-task supervised contrastive learning, and for
the second stage, we propose co-guiding supervised contrastive learning, which
considers the two tasks' mutual guidances in the contrastive learning
procedure. Experiment results on multi-intent SLU show that our model
outperforms existing models by a large margin, obtaining a relative improvement
of 21.3% over the previous best model on MixATIS dataset in overall accuracy.
We also evaluate our model on the zero-shot cross-lingual scenario and the
results show that our model can relatively improve the state-of-the-art model
by 33.5% on average in terms of overall accuracy for the total 9 languages.

<p>The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted the
traditional judicial industry. Moreover, recently, with the development of
AI-generated content (AIGC), AI and law have found applications in various
domains, including image recognition, automatic text generation, and
interactive chat. With the rapid emergence and growing popularity of large
models, it is evident that AI will drive transformation in the traditional
judicial industry. However, the application of legal large language models
(LLMs) is still in its nascent stage. Several challenges need to be addressed.
In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey of legal LLMs. We not
only conduct an extensive survey of LLMs, but also expose their applications in
the judicial system. We first provide an overview of AI technologies in the
legal field and showcase the recent research in LLMs. Then, we discuss the
practical implementation presented by legal LLMs, such as providing legal
advice to users and assisting judges during trials. In addition, we explore the
limitations of legal LLMs, including data, algorithms, and judicial practice.
Finally, we summarize practical recommendations and propose future development
directions to address these challenges.

<p>This research paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of
three artificial 10 intelligence chatbots: Bing, ChatGPT, and GPT-4, in
addressing standardized test questions. Graduate record examination, known as
GRE, serves as a case study in this paper, encompassing both quantitative
reasoning and verbal skills. A total of 137 quantitative reasoning questions,
featuring diverse styles and 157 verbal questions categorized into varying
levels of difficulty (easy, medium, and hard) were administered to assess the
chatbots' capabilities. This paper provides a detailed examination of the
results and their implications for the utilization of artificial intelligence
in standardized test preparation by presenting the performance of each chatbot
across various skills and styles tested in the exam. Additionally, this paper
explores the proficiency of artificial intelligence in addressing image-based
questions and illustrates the uncertainty level of each chatbot. The results
reveal varying degrees of success across the chatbots, demonstrating the
influence of model sophistication and training data. GPT-4 emerged as the most
proficient, especially in complex language understanding tasks, highlighting
the evolution of artificial intelligence in language comprehension and its
ability to pass the exam with a high score.

<p>Large language models LLMs like ChatGPT have reached the 100 Mio user barrier
in record time and might increasingly enter all areas of our life leading to a
diverse set of interactions between those Artificial Intelligence models and
humans. While many studies have discussed governance and regulations
deductively from first-order principles, few studies provide an inductive,
data-driven lens based on observing dialogues between humans and LLMs
especially when it comes to non-collaborative, competitive situations that have
the potential to pose a serious threat to people. In this work, we conduct a
user study engaging over 40 individuals across all age groups in price
negotiations with an LLM. We explore how people interact with an LLM,
investigating differences in negotiation outcomes and strategies. Furthermore,
we highlight shortcomings of LLMs with respect to their reasoning capabilities
and, in turn, susceptiveness to prompt hacking, which intends to manipulate the
LLM to make agreements that are against its instructions or beyond any
rationality. We also show that the negotiated prices humans manage to achieve
span a broad range, which points to a literacy gap in effectively interacting
with LLMs.

<p>There has been increasing interest in evaluations of language models for a
variety of risks and characteristics. Evaluations relying on natural language
understanding for grading can often be performed at scale by using other
language models. We test the robustness of these model-graded evaluations to
injections on different datasets including a new Deception Eval. These
injections resemble direct communication between the testee and the evaluator
to change their grading. We extrapolate that future, more intelligent models
might manipulate or cooperate with their evaluation model. We find significant
susceptibility to these injections in state-of-the-art commercial models on all
examined evaluations. Furthermore, similar injections can be used on automated
interpretability frameworks to produce misleading model-written explanations.
The results inspire future work and should caution against unqualified trust in

<p>Carbon accounting is a fundamental building block in our global path to
emissions reduction and decarbonization, yet many challenges exist in achieving
reliable and trusted carbon accounting measures. We motivate that carbon
accounting not only needs to be more data-driven, but also more
methodologically sound. We discuss the need for alternative, more diverse data
sources that can play a significant role on our path to trusted carbon
accounting procedures and elaborate on not only why, but how Artificial
Intelligence (AI) in general and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in
particular can unlock reasonable access to a treasure trove of alternative data
sets in light of the recent advances in the field that better enable the
utilization of unstructured data in this process. We present a case study of
the recent developments on real-world data via an NLP-powered analysis using
OpenAI's GPT API on financial and shipping data. We conclude the paper with a
discussion on how these methods and approaches can be integrated into a broader
framework for AI-enabled integrative carbon accounting.

<p>The pursuit of article or text summarization has captured the attention of
natural language processing (NLP) practitioners, presenting itself as a
formidable challenge. ChatGPT 3.5 exhibits the capacity to condense the content
of up to 3000 tokens into a single page, aiming to retain pivotal information
from a given text across diverse themes. In a conducted qualitative research
endeavor, we selected seven scientific articles and employed the publicly
available ChatGPT service to generate summaries of these articles.
Subsequently, we engaged six co-authors of the articles in a survey, presenting
five questions to evaluate the quality of the summaries compared to the
original content. The findings revealed that the summaries produced by ChatGPT
effectively encapsulated the crucial information present in the articles,
preserving the principal message of each manuscript. Nonetheless, there was a
slight diminishment in the technical depth of the summaries as opposed to the
original articles. As a result, our conclusion underscores ChatGPT's text
summarization capability as a potent tool for extracting essential insights in
a manner more aligned with reporting than purely scientific discourse.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as dominant tools for various
tasks, particularly when tailored for a specific target by prompt tuning.
Nevertheless, concerns surrounding data privacy present obstacles due to the
tuned prompts' dependency on sensitive private information. A practical
solution is to host a local LLM and optimize a soft prompt privately using
data. Yet, hosting a local model becomes problematic when model ownership is
protected. Alternative methods, like sending data to the model's provider for
training, intensify these privacy issues facing an untrusted provider. In this
paper, we present a novel solution called Differentially-Private Offsite Prompt
Tuning (DP-OPT) to address this challenge. Our approach involves tuning a
discrete prompt on the client side and then applying it to the desired cloud
models. We demonstrate that prompts suggested by LLMs themselves can be
transferred without compromising performance significantly. To ensure that the
prompts do not leak private information, we introduce the first private prompt
generation mechanism, by a differentially-private (DP) ensemble of in-context
learning with private demonstrations. With DP-OPT, generating
privacy-preserving prompts by Vicuna-7b can yield competitive performance
compared to non-private in-context learning on GPT3.5 or local private prompt
tuning. Codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/DP-OPT .

<p>We present a framework SCStory for online story discovery, that helps people
digest rapidly published news article streams in real-time without human
annotations. To organize news article streams into stories, existing approaches
directly encode the articles and cluster them based on representation
similarity. However, these methods yield noisy and inaccurate story discovery
results because the generic article embeddings do not effectively reflect the
story-indicative semantics in an article and cannot adapt to the rapidly
evolving news article streams. SCStory employs self-supervised and continual
learning with a novel idea of story-indicative adaptive modeling of news
article streams. With a lightweight hierarchical embedding module that first
learns sentence representations and then article representations, SCStory
identifies story-relevant information of news articles and uses them to
discover stories. The embedding module is continuously updated to adapt to
evolving news streams with a contrastive learning objective, backed up by two
unique techniques, confidence-aware memory replay and prioritized-augmentation,
employed for label absence and data scarcity problems. Thorough experiments on
real and the latest news data sets demonstrate that SCStory outperforms
existing state-of-the-art algorithms for unsupervised online story discovery.

<p>The social and implicit nature of human communication ramifies readers'
understandings of written sentences. Single gold-standard interpretations
rarely exist, challenging conventional assumptions in natural language
processing. This work introduces the interpretation modeling (IM) task which
involves modeling several interpretations of a sentence's underlying semantics
to unearth layers of implicit meaning. To obtain these, IM is guided by
multiple annotations of social relation and common ground - in this work
approximated by reader attitudes towards the author and their understanding of
moral judgments subtly embedded in the sentence. We propose a number of
modeling strategies that rely on one-to-one and one-to-many generation methods
that take inspiration from the philosophical study of interpretation. A
first-of-its-kind IM dataset is curated to support experiments and analyses.
The modeling results, coupled with scrutiny of the dataset, underline the
challenges of IM as conflicting and complex interpretations are socially
plausible. This interplay of diverse readings is affirmed by automated and
human evaluations on the generated interpretations. Finally, toxicity analyses
in the generated interpretations demonstrate the importance of IM for refining
filters of content and assisting content moderators in safeguarding the safety
in online discourse.

<p>Even though online social movements can quickly become viral on social media,
languages can be a barrier to timely monitoring and analyzing the underlying
online social behaviors (OSB). This is especially true for under-resourced
languages on social media like dialectal Arabic; the primary language used by
Arabs on social media. Therefore, it is crucial to provide solutions to
efficiently exploit resources from high-resourced languages to solve
language-dependent OSB analysis in under-resourced languages. This paper
proposes to localize content of resources in high-resourced languages into
under-resourced Arabic dialects. Content localization goes beyond content
translation that converts text from one language to another; content
localization adapts culture, language nuances and regional preferences from one
language to a specific language/dialect. Automating understanding of the
natural and familiar day-to-day expressions in different regions, is the key to
achieve a wider analysis of OSB especially for smart cities. In this paper, we
utilize content-localization based neural machine translation to develop
sentiment and hate classifiers for two low-resourced Arabic dialects: Levantine
and Gulf. Not only this but we also leverage unsupervised learning to
facilitate the analysis of sentiment and hate predictions by inferring hidden
topics from the corresponding data and providing coherent interpretations of
those topics in their native language/dialects. The experimental evaluations
and proof-of-concept COVID-19 case study on real data have validated the
effectiveness of our proposed system in precisely distinguishing sentiments and
accurately identifying hate content in both Levantine and Gulf Arabic dialects.
Our findings shed light on the importance of considering the unique nature of
dialects within the same language and ignoring the dialectal aspect would lead
to misleading analysis.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs), as the case of OpenAI ChatGPT-4 Turbo, are
revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this
context, LLMs can be personalized through a fine-tuning process to meet the
student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI
has launched the possibility to fine-tune their model with a natural language
web interface, enabling the possibility to create customized GPT version
deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. The objective
of this research is to assess the potential of the customized GPTs that have
recently been launched by OpenAI. After developing a Business Statistics
Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia
Comillas, its behavior was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo.
The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in
the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was
trained with, BSVP provided responses in a more relatable and friendly tone,
even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, and this is a matter of
relevance, when explicitly asked for something like, "I would like to practice
a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4," BSVP was capable of
providing a far superior response: having access to contextual documentation,
it could fulfill the request, something beyond ChatGPT-4 Turbo's capabilities.
On the downside, the response times were generally higher. Lastly, regarding
overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of
the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the
responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. It appears that customized
assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for
students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4
Turbo.

<p>Neural language models (LMs) can be used to evaluate the truth of factual
statements in two ways: they can be either queried for statement probabilities,
or probed for internal representations of truthfulness. Past work has found
that these two procedures sometimes disagree, and that probes tend to be more
accurate than LM outputs. This has led some researchers to conclude that LMs
"lie" or otherwise encode non-cooperative communicative intents. Is this an
accurate description of today's LMs, or can query-probe disagreement arise in
other ways? We identify three different classes of disagreement, which we term
confabulation, deception, and heterogeneity. In many cases, the superiority of
probes is simply attributable to better calibration on uncertain answers rather
than a greater fraction of correct, high-confidence answers. In some cases,
queries and probes perform better on different subsets of inputs, and accuracy
can further be improved by ensembling the two. Code is available at

<p>In today's technologically driven world, the spread of fake news,
particularly during crucial events such as elections, presents an increasing
challenge to the integrity of information. To address this challenge, we
introduce FakeWatch ElectionShield, an innovative framework carefully designed
to detect fake news. We have created a novel dataset of North American
election-related news articles through a blend of advanced language models
(LMs) and thorough human verification, for precision and relevance. We propose
a model hub of LMs for identifying fake news. Our goal is to provide the
research community with adaptable and accurate classification models in
recognizing the dynamic nature of misinformation. Extensive evaluation of fake
news classifiers on our dataset and a benchmark dataset shows our that while
state-of-the-art LMs slightly outperform the traditional ML models, classical
models are still competitive with their balance of accuracy, explainability,
and computational efficiency. This research sets the foundation for future
studies to address misinformation related to elections.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03733">Methods to Estimate Large Language Model Confidence. (arXiv:2312.03733v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>

<p>Large Language Models have difficulty communicating uncertainty, which is a
significant obstacle to applying LLMs to complex medical tasks. This study
evaluates methods to measure LLM confidence when suggesting a diagnosis for
challenging clinical vignettes. GPT4 was asked a series of challenging case
questions using Chain of Thought and Self Consistency prompting. Multiple
methods were investigated to assess model confidence and evaluated on their
ability to predict the models observed accuracy. The methods evaluated were
Intrinsic Confidence, SC Agreement Frequency and CoT Response Length. SC
Agreement Frequency correlated with observed accuracy, yielding a higher Area
under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve compared to Intrinsic
Confidence and CoT Length analysis. SC agreement is the most useful proxy for
model confidence, especially for medical diagnosis. Model Intrinsic Confidence
and CoT Response Length exhibit a weaker ability to differentiate between
correct and incorrect answers, preventing them from being reliable and
interpretable markers for model confidence. We conclude GPT4 has a limited
ability to assess its own diagnostic accuracy. SC Agreement Frequency is the
most useful method to measure GPT4 confidence.

<p>We show that the representation of one modality can effectively guide the
prompting of another modality for parameter-efficient multimodal fusion.
Specifically, we first encode one modality and use its representation as a
prior to conditionally prompt all frozen layers of the other modality. This is
achieved by disentangling the vanilla prompt vectors into three types of
specialized prompts that adaptively capture global-level and instance-level
features. To better produce the instance-wise prompt, we introduce the mixture
of prompt experts (MoPE) to dynamically route each instance to the most
suitable prompt experts for encoding. We further study a regularization term to
avoid degenerated prompt expert routing. Thanks to our design, our method can
effectively transfer the pretrained knowledge in unimodal encoders for
downstream multimodal tasks. Compared with vanilla prompting, we show that our
MoPE-based conditional prompting is more expressive, thereby scales better with
training data and the total number of prompts. We also demonstrate that our
prompt tuning is architecture-agnostic, thereby offering high modularity.
Extensive experiments over three multimodal datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art results, matching or surpassing the performance achieved
through fine-tuning, while only necessitating 0.7% of the trainable parameters.

<p>Generalization is arguably the most important goal of statistical language
modeling research. Publicly available benchmarks and papers published with an
open-source code have been critical to advancing the field. However, it is
often very difficult, and sometimes even impossible, to reproduce the results
fully as reported in publications. In this paper, we propose a simple framework
that should help advance the state of the art in language modeling in terms of
generalization. We propose to publish not just the code, but also probabilities
on dev and test sets with future publications so that one can easily add the
new model into an ensemble. This has crucial advantages: it is much easier to
determine whether a newly proposed model is actually complementary to the
current baseline. Therefore, instead of inventing new names for the old tricks,
the scientific community can advance faster. Finally, this approach promotes
diversity of ideas: one does not need to create an individual model that is the
new state of the art to attract attention; it will be sufficient to develop a
new model that learns patterns which other models do not. Thus, even a
suboptimal model can be found to have value. Remarkably, our approach has
yielded new state-of-the-art results across various language modeling
benchmarks up to 10%.

<p>Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a valuable resource for
data-driven medical research. However, the presence of protected health
information (PHI) makes EHRs unsuitable to be shared for research purposes.
De-identification, i.e. the process of removing PHI is a critical step in
making EHR data accessible. Natural language processing has repeatedly
demonstrated its feasibility in automating the de-identification process.
Objectives: Our study aims to provide systematic evidence on how the
de-identification of clinical free text has evolved in the last thirteen years,
and to report on the performances and limitations of the current
state-of-the-art systems. In addition, we aim to identify challenges and
potential research opportunities in this field. Methods: A systematic search in
PubMed, Web of Science and the DBLP was conducted for studies published between
January 2010 and February 2023. Titles and abstracts were examined to identify
the relevant studies. Selected studies were then analysed in-depth, and
information was collected on de-identification methodologies, data sources, and
measured performance. Results: A total of 2125 publications were identified for
the title and abstract screening. 69 studies were found to be relevant. Machine
learning (37 studies) and hybrid (26 studies) approaches are predominant, while
six studies relied only on rules. Majority of the approaches were trained and
evaluated on public corpora. The 2014 i2b2/UTHealth corpus is the most
frequently used (36 studies), followed by the 2006 i2b2 (18 studies) and 2016
CEGS N-GRID (10 studies) corpora.

<p>Business processes are commonly represented by modelling languages, such as
Event-driven Process Chain (EPC), Yet Another Workflow Language (YAWL), and the
most popular standard notation for modelling business processes, the Business
Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Most recently, chatbots, programs that allow
users to interact with a machine using natural language, have been increasingly
used for business process execution support. A recent category of chatbots
worth mentioning is generative-based chatbots, powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) model and
Google's Pathways Language Model (PaLM), which are trained on billions of
parameters and support conversational intelligence. However, it is not clear
whether generative-based chatbots are able to understand and meet the
requirements of constructs such as those provided by BPMN for process execution
support. This paper presents a case study to compare the performance of
prominent generative models, GPT and PaLM, in the context of process execution
support. The research sheds light into the challenging problem of using
conversational approaches supported by generative chatbots as a means to
understand process-aware modelling notations and support users to execute their
tasks.

<p>This paper assesses the potential for large language models (LLMs) to serve
as assistive tools in the creative writing process, by means of a single,

multi-voice prompting strategies that interleave background descriptions (scene
setting, plot elements), instructions that guide composition, samples of text
in the target style, and critical discussion of the given samples. We
qualitatively evaluate the results from a literary critical perspective, as
well as from the standpoint of computational creativity (a sub-field of
artificial intelligence). Our findings lend support to the view that the
sophistication of the results that can be achieved with an LLM mirrors the

<p>It is essential that healthcare professionals and members of the healthcare
community can access and easily understand patient experiences in the real
world, so that care standards can be improved and driven towards personalised
drug treatment. Social media platforms and message boards are deemed suitable
sources of patient experience information, as patients have been observed to
discuss and exchange knowledge, look for and provide support online. This paper
tests the hypothesis that not all online patient experience information can be
treated and collected in the same way, as a result of the inherent differences
in the way individuals talk about their journeys, in different therapeutic
domains and or data sources.
</p>
<p>We used linguistic analysis to understand and identify similarities between
datasets, across patient language, between data sources (Reddit, SocialGist)
and therapeutic domains (cardiovascular, oncology, immunology, neurology). We
detected common vocabulary used by patients in the same therapeutic domain
across data sources, except for immunology patients, who use unique vocabulary
between the two data sources, and compared to all other datasets. We combined
linguistically similar datasets to train classifiers (CNN, transformer) to
accurately identify patient experience posts from social media, a task we refer
to as patient voice classification. The cardiovascular and neurology
transformer classifiers perform the best in their respective comparisons for
the Reddit data source, achieving F1-scores of 0.865 and 1.0 respectively. The
overall best performing classifier is the transformer classifier trained on all
data collected for this experiment, achieving F1-scores ranging between 0.863
and 0.995 across all therapeutic domain and data source specific test datasets.

<p>This study investigates the application of large language models (LLMs),
specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with Chain-of-Though (CoT)in the automatic
scoring of student-written responses to science assessments. We focused on
overcoming the challenges of accessibility, technical complexity, and lack of
explainability that have previously limited the use of automatic assessment
tools among researchers and educators. We used a testing dataset comprising six
assessment tasks (three binomial and three trinomial) with 1,650 student
responses. We employed six prompt engineering strategies, combining zero-shot
or few-shot learning with CoT, either alone or alongside item stem and scoring
rubrics. Results indicated that few-shot (acc = .67) outperformed zero-shot
learning (acc = .60), with 12.6\% increase. CoT, when used without item stem
and scoring rubrics, did not significantly affect scoring accuracy (acc = .60).
However, CoT prompting paired with contextual item stems and rubrics proved to
be a significant contributor to scoring accuracy (13.44\% increase for
zero-shot; 3.7\% increase for few-shot). Using a novel approach PPEAS, we found
a more balanced accuracy across different proficiency categories, highlighting
the importance of domain-specific reasoning in enhancing the effectiveness of
LLMs in scoring tasks. Additionally, we also found that GPT-4 demonstrated
superior performance over GPT-3.5 in various scoring tasks, showing 8.64\%
difference. The study revealed that the single-call strategy with GPT-4,
particularly using greedy sampling, outperformed other approaches, including
ensemble voting strategies. This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs in
facilitating automatic scoring, emphasizing that CoT enhances accuracy,
particularly when used with item stem and scoring rubrics.

<p>When a damaging earthquake occurs, immediate information about casualties is
critical for time-sensitive decision-making by emergency response and aid
agencies in the first hours and days. Systems such as Prompt Assessment of
Global Earthquakes for Response (PAGER) by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
were developed to provide a forecast within about 30 minutes of any significant
earthquake globally. Traditional systems for estimating human loss in disasters
often depend on manually collected early casualty reports from global media, a
process that's labor-intensive and slow with notable time delays. Recently,
some systems have employed keyword matching and topic modeling to extract
relevant information from social media. However, these methods struggle with
the complex semantics in multilingual texts and the challenge of interpreting
ever-changing, often conflicting reports of death and injury numbers from
various unverified sources on social media platforms. In this work, we
introduce an end-to-end framework to significantly improve the timeliness and
accuracy of global earthquake-induced human loss forecasting using
multi-lingual, crowdsourced social media. Our framework integrates (1) a
hierarchical casualty extraction model built upon large language models, prompt
design, and few-shot learning to retrieve quantitative human loss claims from
social media, (2) a physical constraint-aware, dynamic-truth discovery model
that discovers the truthful human loss from massive noisy and potentially
conflicting human loss claims, and (3) a Bayesian updating loss projection
model that dynamically updates the final loss estimation using discovered
truths. We test the framework in real-time on a series of global earthquake
events in 2021 and 2022 and show that our framework streamlines casualty data
retrieval, achieving speed and accuracy comparable to manual methods by USGS.

<p>Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is a critical aspect of affective
computing, and it has many practical applications in healthcare, education,
chatbots, and social media platforms. Earlier approaches for ERC analysis
involved modeling both speaker and long-term contextual information using graph
neural network architectures. However, it is ideal to deploy
speaker-independent models for real-world applications. Additionally, long
context windows can potentially create confusion in recognizing the emotion of
an utterance in a conversation. To overcome these limitations, we propose novel
line conversation graph convolutional network (LineConGCN) and graph attention
(LineConGAT) models for ERC analysis. These models are speaker-independent and
built using a graph construction strategy for conversations -- line
conversation graphs (LineConGraphs). The conversational context in
LineConGraphs is short-term -- limited to one previous and future utterance,
and speaker information is not part of the graph. We evaluate the performance
of our proposed models on two benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, and show
that our LineConGAT model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with an
F1-score of 64.58% and 76.50%. Moreover, we demonstrate that embedding
sentiment shift information into line conversation graphs further enhances the
ERC performance in the case of GCN models.

<p>Predicting stock market is vital for investors and policymakers, acting as a
barometer of the economic health. We leverage social media data, a potent
source of public sentiment, in tandem with macroeconomic indicators as
government-compiled statistics, to refine stock market predictions. However,
prior research using tweet data for stock market prediction faces three
challenges. First, the quality of tweets varies widely. While many are filled
with noise and irrelevant details, only a few genuinely mirror the actual
market scenario. Second, solely focusing on the historical data of a particular
stock without considering its sector can lead to oversight. Stocks within the
same industry often exhibit correlated price behaviors. Lastly, simply
forecasting the direction of price movement without assessing its magnitude is
of limited value, as the extent of the rise or fall truly determines
profitability. In this paper, diverging from the conventional methods, we
pioneer an ECON. The framework has following advantages: First, ECON has an
adept tweets filter that efficiently extracts and decodes the vast array of
tweet data. Second, ECON discerns multi-level relationships among stocks,
sectors, and macroeconomic factors through a self-aware mechanism in semantic
space. Third, ECON offers enhanced accuracy in predicting substantial stock
price fluctuations by capitalizing on stock price movement. We showcase the
state-of-the-art performance of our proposed model using a dataset,
specifically curated by us, for predicting stock market movements and
volatility.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly incorporated into
scientific workflows. However, we have yet to fully grasp the implications of
this integration. How should the advent of large language models affect the
practice of science? For this opinion piece, we have invited four diverse
groups of scientists to reflect on this query, sharing their perspectives and
engaging in debate. Schulz et al. make the argument that working with LLMs is
not fundamentally different from working with human collaborators, while Bender
et al. argue that LLMs are often misused and over-hyped, and that their
limitations warrant a focus on more specialized, easily interpretable tools.
Marelli et al. emphasize the importance of transparent attribution and
responsible use of LLMs. Finally, Botvinick and Gershman advocate that humans
should retain responsibility for determining the scientific roadmap. To
facilitate the discussion, the four perspectives are complemented with a
response from each group. By putting these different perspectives in
conversation, we aim to bring attention to important considerations within the
academic community regarding the adoption of LLMs and their impact on both
current and future scientific practices.

<p>We explore colour versus shape goal misgeneralization originally demonstrated
by Di Langosco et al. (2022) in the Procgen Maze environment, where, given an
ambiguous choice, the agents seem to prefer generalization based on colour
rather than shape. After training over 1,000 agents in a simplified version of
the environment and evaluating them on over 10 million episodes, we conclude
that the behaviour can be attributed to the agents learning to detect the goal
object through a specific colour channel. This choice is arbitrary.
Additionally, we show how, due to underspecification, the preferences can
change when retraining the agents using exactly the same procedure except for
using a different random seed for the training run. Finally, we demonstrate the
existence of outliers in out-of-distribution behaviour based on training random
seed alone.

<p>Transferring knowledge in cross-domain reinforcement learning is a
challenging setting in which learning is accelerated by reusing knowledge from
a task with different observation and/or action space. However, it is often
necessary to carefully select the source of knowledge for the receiving end to
benefit from the transfer process. In this article, we study how to measure the
similarity between cross-domain reinforcement learning tasks to select a source
of knowledge that will improve the performance of the learning agent. We
developed a semi-supervised alignment loss to match different spaces with a set
of encoder-decoders, and use them to measure similarity and transfer policies
across tasks. In comparison to prior works, our method does not require data to
be aligned, paired or collected by expert policies. Experimental results, on a
set of varied Mujoco control tasks, show the robustness of our method in
effectively selecting and transferring knowledge, without the supervision of a
tailored set of source tasks.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03767">Unknown Sample Discovery for Source Free Open Set Domain Adaptation. (arXiv:2312.03767v1 [cs.CV])</a></h1>

<p>Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to adapt a model trained on a source
domain to a target domain that undergoes distribution shift and contains
samples from novel classes outside the source domain. Source-free OSDA
(SF-OSDA) techniques eliminate the need to access source domain samples, but
current SF-OSDA methods utilize only the known classes in the target domain for
adaptation, and require access to the entire target domain even during
inference after adaptation, to make the distinction between known and unknown
samples. In this paper, we introduce Unknown Sample Discovery (USD) as an
SF-OSDA method that utilizes a temporally ensembled teacher model to conduct
known-unknown target sample separation and adapts the student model to the
target domain over all classes using co-training and temporal consistency
between the teacher and the student. USD promotes Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD)
as an effective measure for known-unknown sample separation. Our
teacher-student framework significantly reduces error accumulation resulting
from imperfect known-unknown sample separation, while curriculum guidance helps
to reliably learn the distinction between target known and target unknown
subspaces. USD appends the target model with an unknown class node, thus
readily classifying a target sample into any of the known or unknown classes in
subsequent post-adaptation inference stages. Empirical results show that USD is
superior to existing SF-OSDA methods and is competitive with current OSDA
models that utilize both source and target domains during adaptation.

<p>The new polymath Large Language Models (LLMs) can speed-up greatly scientific
reviews, possibly using more unbiased quantitative metrics, facilitating
cross-disciplinary connections, and identifying emerging trends and research
gaps by analyzing large volumes of data. However, at the present time, they
lack the required deep understanding of complex methodologies, they have
difficulty in evaluating innovative claims, and they are unable to assess
ethical issues and conflicts of interest. Herein, we consider 13 GPT-related
papers across different scientific domains, reviewed by a human reviewer and
SciSpace, a large language model, with the reviews evaluated by three distinct
types of evaluators, namely GPT-3.5, a crowd panel, and GPT-4. We found that
50% of SciSpace's responses to objective questions align with those of a human
reviewer, with GPT-4 (informed evaluator) often rating the human reviewer
higher in accuracy, and SciSpace higher in structure, clarity, and
completeness. In subjective questions, the uninformed evaluators (GPT-3.5 and

with the crowd panel showing a preference for the human responses. However,
GPT-4 rated them equally in accuracy and structure but favored SciSpace for

<p>Research in decoding visual information from the brain, particularly through
the non-invasive fMRI method, is rapidly progressing. The challenge arises from
the limited data availability and the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI
signals, leading to a low-precision task of fMRI-to-image retrieval.
State-of-the-art MindEye remarkably improves fMRI-to-image retrieval
performance by leveraging a deep MLP with a high parameter count orders of
magnitude, i.e., a 996M MLP Backbone per subject, to align fMRI embeddings to
the final hidden layer of CLIP's vision transformer. However, significant
individual variations exist among subjects, even within identical experimental
setups, mandating the training of subject-specific models. The substantial
parameters pose significant challenges in deploying fMRI decoding on practical
devices, especially with the necessitating of specific models for each subject.
To this end, we propose Lite-Mind, a lightweight, efficient, and versatile
brain representation network based on discrete Fourier transform, that
efficiently aligns fMRI voxels to fine-grained information of CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that Lite-Mind achieves an impressive 94.3%
fMRI-to-image retrieval accuracy on the NSD dataset for Subject 1, with 98.7%
fewer parameters than MindEye. Lite-Mind is also proven to be able to be
migrated to smaller brain datasets and establishes a new state-of-the-art for
zero-shot classification on the GOD dataset. The code is available at

the recommendation of training practices, talent and team recommendation, and
the recommendation of specific tactics in competitions. With applications in
the virtual world, for example, the recommendation of maps or opponents in

<p>Multi-modal biomedical time series (MBTS) data offers a holistic view of the
physiological state, holding significant importance in various bio-medical
applications. Owing to inherent noise and distribution gaps across different
modalities, MBTS can be complex to model. Various deep learning models have
been developed to learn representations of MBTS but still fall short in
robustness due to the ignorance of modal-to-modal variations. This paper
presents a multi-scale and multi-modal biomedical time series representation
learning (MBSL) network with contrastive learning to migrate these variations.
Firstly, MBTS is grouped based on inter-modal distances, then each group with
minimum intra-modal variations can be effectively modeled by individual
encoders. Besides, to enhance the multi-scale feature extraction (encoder),
various patch lengths and mask ratios are designed to generate tokens with
semantic information at different scales and diverse contextual perspectives
respectively. Finally, cross-modal contrastive learning is proposed to maximize
consistency among inter-modal groups, maintaining useful information and
eliminating noises. Experiments against four bio-medical applications show that
MBSL outperforms state-of-the-art models by 33.9% mean average errors (MAE) in
respiration rate, by 13.8% MAE in exercise heart rate, by 1.41% accuracy in
human activity recognition, and by 1.14% F1-score in obstructive sleep

<p>Researchers in natural science need reliable methods for quantifying animal
behavior. Recently, numerous computer vision methods emerged to automate the
process. However, observing wild species at remote locations remains a
challenging task due to difficult lighting conditions and constraints on power
supply and data storage. Event cameras offer unique advantages for
battery-dependent remote monitoring due to their low power consumption and high
dynamic range capabilities. We use this novel sensor to quantify a behavior in
Chinstrap penguins called ecstatic display. We formulate the problem as a
temporal action detection task, determining the start and end times of the
behavior. For this purpose, we recorded a colony of breeding penguins in
Antarctica during several weeks and labeled event data on 16 nests. The
developed method consists of a generator of candidate time intervals
(proposals) and a classifier of the actions within them. The experiments show
that the event cameras' natural response to motion is effective for continuous
behavior monitoring and detection, reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of
58% (which increases to 63% in good weather conditions). The results also
demonstrate the robustness against various lighting conditions contained in the
challenging dataset. The low-power capabilities of the event camera allows to
record three times longer than with a conventional camera. This work pioneers
the use of event cameras for remote wildlife observation, opening new

<p>Training autonomous agents that can learn new tasks from only a handful of
demonstrations is a long-standing problem in machine learning. Recently,
transformers have been shown to learn new language or vision tasks without any
weight updates from only a few examples, also referred to as in-context
learning. However, the sequential decision making setting poses additional
challenges having a lower tolerance for errors since the environment's
stochasticity or the agent's actions can lead to unseen, and sometimes
unrecoverable, states. In this paper, we use an illustrative example to show
that naively applying transformers to sequential decision making problems does
not enable in-context learning of new tasks. We then demonstrate how training
on sequences of trajectories with certain distributional properties leads to
in-context learning of new sequential decision making tasks. We investigate
different design choices and find that larger model and dataset sizes, as well
as more task diversity, environment stochasticity, and trajectory burstiness,
all result in better in-context learning of new out-of-distribution tasks. By
training on large diverse offline datasets, our model is able to learn new
MiniHack and Procgen tasks without any weight updates from just a handful of

<p>Recent work in activation steering has demonstrated the potential to better
control the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs), but it involves finding
steering vectors. This is difficult because engineers do not typically know how
features are represented in these models. We seek to address this issue by
applying the idea of mean-centring to steering vectors. We find that taking the
average of activations associated with a target dataset, and then subtracting
the mean of all training activations, results in effective steering vectors. We
test this method on a variety of models on natural language tasks by steering
away from generating toxic text, and steering the completion of a story towards
a target genre. We also apply mean-centring to extract function vectors, more
effectively triggering the execution of a range of natural language tasks by a
significant margin (compared to previous baselines). This suggests that
mean-centring can be used to easily improve the effectiveness of activation
steering in a wide range of contexts.

<p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a versatile framework for achieving
long-term goals. Its generality allows us to formalize a wide range of problems
that real-world intelligent systems encounter, such as dealing with delayed
rewards, handling partial observability, addressing the exploration and
exploitation dilemma, utilizing offline data to improve online performance, and
ensuring safety constraints are met. Despite considerable progress made by the
RL research community in addressing these issues, existing open-source RL
libraries tend to focus on a narrow portion of the RL solution pipeline,
leaving other aspects largely unattended. This paper introduces Pearl, a
Production-ready RL agent software package explicitly designed to embrace these
challenges in a modular fashion. In addition to presenting preliminary

<p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) plays an essential role in
extracting valuable content information from images across diverse tasks. It
aligns textual and visual modalities to comprehend the entire image, including
all the details, even those irrelevant to specific tasks. However, for a finer
understanding and controlled editing of images, it becomes crucial to focus on
specific regions of interest, which can be indicated as points, masks, or boxes
by humans or perception models. To fulfill the requirements, we introduce
Alpha-CLIP, an enhanced version of CLIP with an auxiliary alpha channel to
suggest attentive regions and fine-tuned with constructed millions of RGBA
region-text pairs. Alpha-CLIP not only preserves the visual recognition ability
of CLIP but also enables precise control over the emphasis of image contents.
It demonstrates effectiveness in various tasks, including but not limited to
open-world recognition, multimodal large language models, and conditional 2D /
3D generation. It has a strong potential to serve as a versatile tool for
image-related tasks.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
important tasks such as natural language understanding, language generation,
and complex reasoning and have the potential to make a substantial impact on
our society. Such capabilities, however, come with the considerable resources
they demand, highlighting the strong need to develop effective techniques for
addressing their efficiency challenges. In this survey, we provide a systematic
and comprehensive review of efficient LLMs research. We organize the literature
in a taxonomy consisting of three main categories, covering distinct yet
interconnected efficient LLMs topics from model-centric, data-centric, and
framework-centric perspective, respectively. We have also created a GitHub
repository where we compile the papers featured in this survey at
https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/EfficientLLMs,
https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/Efficient-LLMs-Survey, and will actively
maintain this repository and incorporate new research as it emerges. We hope
our survey can serve as a valuable resource to help researchers and

<p>Weather forecasting is a fundamental problem for anticipating and mitigating
the impacts of climate change. Recently, data-driven approaches for weather
forecasting based on deep learning have shown great promise, achieving
accuracies that are competitive with operational systems. However, those
methods often employ complex, customized architectures without sufficient
ablation analysis, making it difficult to understand what truly contributes to
their success. Here we introduce Stormer, a simple transformer model that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on weather forecasting with minimal
changes to the standard transformer backbone. We identify the key components of
Stormer through careful empirical analyses, including weather-specific
embedding, randomized dynamics forecast, and pressure-weighted loss. At the
core of Stormer is a randomized forecasting objective that trains the model to
forecast the weather dynamics over varying time intervals. During inference,
this allows us to produce multiple forecasts for a target lead time and combine
them to obtain better forecast accuracy. On WeatherBench 2, Stormer performs
competitively at short to medium-range forecasts and outperforms current
methods beyond 7 days, while requiring orders-of-magnitude less training data
and compute. Additionally, we demonstrate Stormer's favorable scaling
properties, showing consistent improvements in forecast accuracy with increases
in model size and training tokens. Code and checkpoints will be made publicly
available.

<p>We explore the viability of casting foundation models as generic reward
functions for reinforcement learning. To this end, we propose a simple pipeline
that interfaces an off-the-shelf vision model with a large language model.
Specifically, given a trajectory of observations, we infer the likelihood of an
instruction describing the task that the user wants an agent to perform. We
show that this generic likelihood function exhibits the characteristics ideally
expected from a reward function: it associates high values with the desired
behaviour and lower values for several similar, but incorrect policies.
Overall, our work opens the possibility of designing open-ended agents for
interactive tasks via foundation models.

<p>In the machine learning ecosystem, hardware selection is often regarded as a
mere utility, overshadowed by the spotlight on algorithms and data. This
oversight is particularly problematic in contexts like ML-as-a-service
platforms, where users often lack control over the hardware used for model
deployment. How does the choice of hardware impact generalization properties?
This paper investigates the influence of hardware on the delicate balance
between model performance and fairness. We demonstrate that hardware choices
can exacerbate existing disparities, attributing these discrepancies to
variations in gradient flows and loss surfaces across different demographic
groups. Through both theoretical and empirical analysis, the paper not only
identifies the underlying factors but also proposes an effective strategy for
mitigating hardware-induced performance imbalances.

<p>Federated Learning (FL) represents a growing machine learning (ML) paradigm
designed for training models across numerous nodes that retain local datasets,
all without directly exchanging the underlying private data with the parameter
server (PS). Its increasing popularity is attributed to notable advantages in
terms of training deep neural network (DNN) models under privacy aspects and
efficient utilization of communication resources. Unfortunately, DNNs suffer
from high computational and communication costs, as well as memory consumption
in intricate tasks. These factors restrict the applicability of FL algorithms
in communication-constrained systems with limited hardware resources.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining a pruning-based method with the FL process,
resulting in low-dimensional representations of the model with minimal
communication cost, dubbed Masked Pruning over FL (MPFL). The algorithm
operates by initially distributing weights to the nodes through the PS.
Subsequently, each node locally trains its model and computes pruning masks.
These low-dimensional masks are then transmitted back to the PS, which
generates a consensus pruning mask, broadcasted back to the nodes. This
iterative process enhances the robustness and stability of the masked pruning
model. The generated mask is used to train the FL model, achieving significant
bandwidth savings. We present an extensive experimental study demonstrating the
superior performance of MPFL compared to existing methods. Additionally, we
have developed an open-source software package for the benefit of researchers
and developers in related fields.

<p>Neuro-symbolic AI bridges the gap between purely symbolic and neural
approaches to learning. This often requires maximizing the likelihood of a
symbolic constraint w.r.t the neural network's output distribution. Such output
distributions are typically assumed to be fully-factorized. This limits the
applicability of neuro-symbolic learning to the more expressive autoregressive
distributions, e.g., transformers. Under such distributions, computing the
likelihood of even simple constraints is #P-hard. Instead of attempting to
enforce the constraint on the entire output distribution, we propose to do so
on a random, local approximation thereof. More precisely, we optimize the
likelihood of the constraint under a pseudolikelihood-based approximation
centered around a model sample. Our approximation is factorized, allowing the
reuse of solutions to sub-problems, a main tenet for efficiently computing
neuro-symbolic losses. Moreover, it is a local, high-fidelity approximation of
the likelihood, exhibiting low entropy and KL-divergence around the model
sample. We evaluate our approach on Sudoku and shortest-path prediction cast as
autoregressive generation, and observe that we greatly improve upon the base
model's ability to predict logically-consistent outputs. We also evaluate on
the task of detoxifying large language models. Using a simple constraint
disallowing a list of toxic words, we are able to steer the model's outputs
away from toxic generations, achieving SoTA detoxification compared to previous
approaches.

<p>Medical report generation demands automatic creation of coherent and precise
descriptions for medical images. However, the scarcity of labelled medical
image-report pairs poses formidable challenges in developing large-scale neural
networks capable of harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence,
exemplified by large language models. This study builds upon the
state-of-the-art vision-language pre-training and fine-tuning approach, BLIP-2,
to customize general large-scale foundation models. Integrating adapter tuning
and a medical knowledge enhancement loss, our model significantly improves
accuracy and coherence. Validation on the dataset of ImageCLEFmedical 2023
demonstrates our model's prowess, achieving the best-averaged results against
several state-of-the-art methods. Significant improvements in ROUGE and CIDEr
underscore our method's efficacy, highlighting promising outcomes for the rapid

<p>Entity resolution (ER) is an important data integration task with a wide
spectrum of applications. The state-of-the-art solutions on ER rely on
pre-trained language models (PLMs), which require fine-tuning on a lot of
labeled matching/non-matching entity pairs. Recently, large languages models
(LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown the ability to perform many tasks without
tuning model parameters, which is known as in-context learning (ICL) that
facilitates effective learning from a few labeled input context demonstrations.
However, existing ICL approaches to ER typically necessitate providing a task
description and a set of demonstrations for each entity pair and thus have
limitations on the monetary cost of interfacing LLMs. To address the problem,
in this paper, we provide a comprehensive study to investigate how to develop a
cost-effective batch prompting approach to ER. We introduce a framework BATCHER
consisting of demonstration selection and question batching and explore
different design choices that support batch prompting for ER. We also devise a
covering-based demonstration selection strategy that achieves an effective
balance between matching accuracy and monetary cost. We conduct a thorough
evaluation to explore the design space and evaluate our proposed strategies.
Through extensive experiments, we find that batch prompting is very
cost-effective for ER, compared with not only PLM-based methods fine-tuned with
extensive labeled data but also LLM-based methods with manually designed
prompting. We also provide guidance for selecting appropriate design choices
for batch prompting.

<p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) faces a significant challenge of
distribution shift. Model-free offline RL penalizes the Q value for
out-of-distribution (OOD) data or constrains the policy closed to the behavior
policy to tackle this problem, but this inhibits the exploration of the OOD
region. Model-based offline RL, which uses the trained environment model to
generate more OOD data and performs conservative policy optimization within
that model, has become an effective method for this problem. However, the
current model-based algorithms rarely consider agent robustness when
incorporating conservatism into policy. Therefore, the new model-based offline
algorithm with a conservative Bellman operator (MICRO) is proposed. This method
trades off performance and robustness via introducing the robust Bellman
operator into the algorithm. Compared with previous model-based algorithms with
robust adversarial models, MICRO can significantly reduce the computation cost
by only choosing the minimal Q value in the state uncertainty set. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MICRO outperforms prior RL algorithms in offline
RL benchmark and is considerably robust to adversarial perturbations.

<p>Stable diffusion is the mainstay of the text-to-image (T2I) synthesis in the
community due to its generation performance and open-source nature. Recently,
Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), the successor of stable diffusion, has received a
lot of attention due to its significant performance improvements with a higher
resolution of 1024x1024 and a larger model. However, its increased computation
cost and model size require higher-end hardware(e.g., bigger VRAM GPU) for
end-users, incurring higher costs of operation. To address this problem, in
this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion model for text-to-image
synthesis obtained by distilling the knowledge of SDXL. To this end, we first
perform an in-depth analysis of the denoising U-Net in SDXL, which is the main
bottleneck of the model, and then design a more efficient U-Net based on the
analysis. Secondly, we explore how to effectively distill the generation
capability of SDXL into an efficient U-Net and eventually identify four
essential factors, the core of which is that self-attention is the most
important part. With our efficient U-Net and self-attention-based knowledge
distillation strategy, we build our efficient T2I models, called KOALA-1B &amp;
-700M, while reducing the model size up to 54% and 69% of the original SDXL
model. In particular, the KOALA-700M is more than twice as fast as SDXL while
still retaining a decent generation quality. We hope that due to its balanced
speed-performance tradeoff, our KOALA models can serve as a cost-effective
alternative to SDXL in resource-constrained environments.

<p>Predicting protein stability changes induced by single-point mutations has
been a persistent challenge over the years, attracting immense interest from
numerous researchers. The ability to precisely predict protein thermostability
is pivotal for various subfields and applications in biochemistry, including
drug development, protein evolution analysis, and enzyme synthesis. Despite the
proposition of multiple methodologies aimed at addressing this issue, few
approaches have successfully achieved optimal performance coupled with high
computational efficiency. Two principal hurdles contribute to the existing
challenges in this domain. The first is the complexity of extracting and
aggregating sufficiently representative features from proteins. The second
refers to the limited availability of experimental data for protein mutation
analysis, further complicating the comprehensive evaluation of model
performance on unseen data samples. With the advent of Large Language
Models(LLM), such as the ESM models in protein research, profound
interpretation of protein features is now accessibly aided by enormous training
data. Therefore, LLMs are indeed to facilitate a wide range of protein
research. In our study, we introduce an ESM-assisted efficient approach that
integrates protein sequence and structural features to predict the
thermostability changes in protein upon single-point mutations. Furthermore, we
have curated a dataset meticulously designed to preclude data leakage,
corresponding to two extensively employed test datasets, to facilitate a more
equitable model comparison.

<p>Modern auto-regressive language models are trained to minimize log loss on
broad data by predicting the next token so they are expected to get calibrated
answers when framing a problem as a next-token prediction task. We study this
for in-context learning (ICL), a widely used way to adapt frozen large language
models (LLMs) via crafting prompts, and investigate the trade-offs between
performance and calibration on a wide range of natural language understanding
and reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to show that such
trade-offs may get worse as we increase model size, incorporate more ICL
examples, and fine-tune models using instruction, dialog, or reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) on carefully curated datasets. Furthermore,
we find that common recalibration techniques that are widely effective such as
temperature scaling provide limited gains in calibration errors, suggesting
that new methods may be required for settings where models are expected to be
reliable.

<p>Most examinations of neural networks' learned latent spaces typically employ
dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE or UMAP. While these methods
effectively capture the overall sample distribution in the entire learned
latent space, they tend to distort the structure of sample distributions within
specific classes in the subset of the latent space. This distortion complicates
the task of easily distinguishing classes identifiable by neural networks. In
response to this challenge, we introduce the k* Distribution methodology. This
approach focuses on capturing the characteristics and structure of sample
distributions for individual classes within the subset of the learned latent
space using local neighborhood analysis. The key concept is to facilitate easy
comparison of different k* distributions, enabling analysis of how various
classes are processed by the same neural network. This provides a more profound
understanding of existing contemporary visualizations. Our study reveals three
distinct distributions of samples within the learned latent space subset: a)
Fractured, b) Overlapped, and c) Clustered. We note and demonstrate that the
distribution of samples within the network's learned latent space significantly
varies depending on the class. Furthermore, we illustrate that our analysis can
be applied to explore the latent space of diverse neural network architectures,
various layers within neural networks, transformations applied to input
samples, and the distribution of training and testing data for neural networks.
We anticipate that our approach will facilitate more targeted investigations
into neural networks by collectively examining the distribution of different
samples within the learned latent space.

<p>The escalating size of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has spurred a growing
research interest in hosting and serving DNN models across multiple devices. A
number of studies have been reported to partition a DNN model across devices,
providing device placement solutions. The methods appeared in the literature,
however, either suffer from poor placement performance due to the exponential
search space or miss an optimal placement as a consequence of the reduced
search space with limited heuristics. Moreover, these methods have ignored the
runtime inter-operator optimization of a computation graph when coarsening the
graph, which degrades the end-to-end inference performance. This paper presents
Moirai that better exploits runtime inter-operator fusion in a model to render
a coarsened computation graph, reducing the search space while maintaining the
inter-operator optimization provided by inference backends. Moirai also
generalizes the device placement algorithm from multiple perspectives by
considering inference constraints and device heterogeneity.Extensive
experimental evaluation with 11 large DNNs demonstrates that Moirai outperforms
the state-of-the-art counterparts, i.e., Placeto, m-SCT, and GETF, up to
4.28$\times$ in reduction of the end-to-end inference latency. Moirai code is

<p>Multi-distribution learning generalizes the classic PAC learning to handle
data coming from multiple distributions. Given a set of $k$ data distributions
and a hypothesis class of VC dimension $d$, the goal is to learn a hypothesis
that minimizes the maximum population loss over $k$ distributions, up to
$\epsilon$ additive error. In this paper, we settle the sample complexity of
multi-distribution learning by giving an algorithm of sample complexity
$\widetilde{O}((d+k)\epsilon^{-2}) \cdot (k/\epsilon)^{o(1)}$. This matches the
lower bound up to sub-polynomial factor and resolves the COLT 2023 open problem

<p>Face clustering tasks can learn hierarchical semantic information from
large-scale data, which has the potential to help facilitate face recognition.
However, there are few works on this problem. This paper explores it by
proposing a joint optimization task of label classification and supervised
contrastive clustering to introduce the cluster knowledge to the traditional
face recognition task in two ways. We first extend ArcFace with a
cluster-guided angular margin to adjust the within-class feature distribution
according to the hard level of face clustering. Secondly, we propose a
supervised contrastive clustering approach to pull the features to the cluster
center and propose the cluster-aligning procedure to align the cluster center
and the learnable class center in the classifier for joint training. Finally,
extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on popular facial benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our paradigm and its superiority over the
existing approaches to face recognition.

<p>We study the problem of modeling a population of agents pursuing unknown
goals subject to unknown computational constraints. In standard models of
bounded rationality, sub-optimal decision-making is simulated by adding
homoscedastic noise to optimal decisions rather than explicitly simulating
constrained inference. In this work, we introduce a latent inference budget
model (L-IBM) that models agents' computational constraints explicitly, via a
latent variable (inferred jointly with a model of agents' goals) that controls
the runtime of an iterative inference algorithm. L-IBMs make it possible to
learn agent models using data from diverse populations of suboptimal actors. In
three modeling tasks -- inferring navigation goals from routes, inferring
communicative intents from human utterances, and predicting next moves in human
chess games -- we show that L-IBMs match or outperform Boltzmann models of
decision-making under uncertainty. Inferred inference budgets are themselves
meaningful, efficient to compute, and correlated with measures of player skill,
partner skill and task difficulty.

<p>Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for downlink precoding
at the base station (BS), especially for frequency FDD wideband massive MIMO
systems with OFDM. In FDD systems, CSI is attained through CSI feedback from
the user equipment (UE). However, large-scale antennas and large number of
subcarriers significantly increase CSI feedback overhead. Deep learning-based
CSI feedback methods have received tremendous attention in recent years due to
their great capability of compressing CSI. Nonetheless, large amounts of
collected samples are required to train deep learning models, which is severely
challenging in practice. Besides, with the rapidly increasing number of
antennas and subcarriers, most of these deep learning methods' CSI feedback
overhead also grow dramatically, owing to their focus on full-dimensional CSI
feedback. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a low-overhead
Incorporation-Extrapolation based Few-Shot CSI feedback Framework (IEFSF) for
massive MIMO systems. To further reduce the feedback overhead, a
low-dimensional eigenvector-based CSI matrix is first formed with the
incorporation process at the UE, and then recovered to the full-dimensional
eigenvector-based CSI matrix at the BS via the extrapolation process. After
that, to alleviate the necessity of the extensive collected samples and enable
few-shot CSI feedback, we further propose a knowledge-driven data augmentation
method and an artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) -based data
augmentation method by exploiting the domain knowledge of wireless channels and
by exploiting a novel generative model, respectively. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed IEFSF can significantly reduce CSI feedback
overhead by 16 times compared with existing CSI feedback methods while
maintaining higher feedback accuracy using only several hundreds of collected
samples.

<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Sato_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ryoma Sato</a></p>
<p>We propose PRISM to enable users of machine translation systems to preserve
the privacy of data on their own initiative. There is a growing demand to apply
machine translation systems to data that require privacy protection. While
several machine translation engines claim to prioritize privacy, the extent and
specifics of such protection are largely ambiguous. First, there is often a
lack of clarity on how and to what degree the data is protected. Even if
service providers believe they have sufficient safeguards in place,
sophisticated adversaries might still extract sensitive information. Second,
vulnerabilities may exist outside of these protective measures, such as within
communication channels, potentially leading to data leakage. As a result, users
are hesitant to utilize machine translation engines for data demanding high
levels of privacy protection, thereby missing out on their benefits. PRISM
resolves this problem. Instead of relying on the translation service to keep
data safe, PRISM provides the means to protect data on the user's side. This
approach ensures that even machine translation engines with inadequate privacy
measures can be used securely. For platforms already equipped with privacy
safeguards, PRISM acts as an additional protection layer, reinforcing their
security furthermore. PRISM adds these privacy features without significantly
compromising translation accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of PRISM using real-world translators, T5 and ChatGPT
(GPT-3.5-turbo), and the datasets with two languages. PRISM effectively
balances privacy protection with translation accuracy.

<p>Given a set of candidate entities (e.g. movie titles), the ability to
identify similar entities is a core capability of many recommender systems.
Most often this is achieved by collaborative filtering approaches, i.e. if
users co-engage with a pair of entities frequently enough, the embeddings
should be similar. However, relying on co-engagement data alone can result in
lower-quality embeddings for new and unpopular entities. We study this problem
in the context recommender systems at Netflix. We observe that there is
abundant semantic information such as genre, content maturity level, themes,
etc. that complements co-engagement signals and provides interpretability in
similarity models. To learn entity similarities from both data sources
holistically, we propose a novel graph-based approach called SemanticGNN.
SemanticGNN models entities, semantic concepts, collaborative edges, and
semantic edges within a large-scale knowledge graph and conducts representation
learning over it. Our key technical contributions are twofold: (1) we develop a
novel relation-aware attention graph neural network (GNN) to handle the
imbalanced distribution of relation types in our graph; (2) to handle web-scale
graph data that has millions of nodes and billions of edges, we develop a novel
distributed graph training paradigm. The proposed model is successfully
deployed within Netflix and empirical experiments indicate it yields up to 35%
improvement in performance on similarity judgment tasks.

<p>With recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across various
domains, a novel prompting method called visual referring prompting has
emerged, showing significant potential in enhancing human-computer interaction
within multimodal systems. This method offers a more natural and flexible
approach to human interaction with these systems compared to traditional text
descriptions or coordinates. However, the categorization of visual referring
prompting remains undefined, and its impact on the performance of LMMs has yet
to be formally examined. In this study, we conduct the first comprehensive
analysis of LMMs using a variety of visual referring prompting strategies. We
introduce a benchmark dataset called VRPTEST, comprising 3 different visual
tasks and 2,275 images, spanning diverse combinations of prompt strategies.
Using VRPTEST, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of eight versions of
prominent open-source and proprietary foundation models, including two early
versions of GPT-4V. We develop an automated assessment framework based on
software metamorphic testing techniques to evaluate the accuracy of LMMs
without the need for human intervention or manual labeling. We find that the
current proprietary models generally outperform the open-source ones, showing
an average accuracy improvement of 22.70%; however, there is still potential
for improvement. Moreover, our quantitative analysis shows that the choice of
prompt strategy significantly affects the accuracy of LMMs, with variations
ranging from -17.5% to +7.3%. Further case studies indicate that an appropriate
visual referring prompting strategy can improve LMMs' understanding of context
and location information, while an unsuitable one might lead to answer
rejection. We also provide insights on minimizing the negative impact of visual
referring prompting on LMMs.

<p>Rationalization empowers deep learning models with self-explaining
capabilities through a cooperative game, where a generator selects a
semantically consistent subset of the input as a rationale, and a subsequent
predictor makes predictions based on the selected rationale. In this paper, we
discover that rationalization is prone to a problem named \emph{rationale
shift}, which arises from the algorithmic bias of the cooperative game.
Rationale shift refers to a situation where the semantics of the selected
rationale may deviate from the original input, but the predictor still produces
accurate predictions based on the deviation, resulting in a compromised
generator with misleading feedback.
</p>
<p>To address this issue, we first demonstrate the importance of the alignment
between the rationale and the full input through both empirical observations
and theoretical analysis. Subsequently, we introduce a novel approach called
DAR (\textbf{D}iscriminatively \textbf{A}ligned \textbf{R}ationalization),
which utilizes an auxiliary module pretrained on the full input to
discriminatively align the selected rationale and the original input. We
theoretically illustrate how DAR accomplishes the desired alignment, thereby
overcoming the rationale shift problem. The experiments on two widely used
real-world benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves the
explanation quality (measured by the overlap between the model-selected
explanation and the human-annotated rationale) as compared to state-of-the-art
techniques. Additionally, results on two synthetic settings further validate
the effectiveness of DAR in addressing the rationale shift problem.

<p>Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown prominent performance in
semi-supervised node classification by leveraging knowledge from the graph
database. However, most existing GNNs follow the homophily assumption, where
connected nodes are more likely to exhibit similar feature distributions and
the same labels, and such an assumption has proven to be vulnerable in a
growing number of practical applications. As a supplement, heterophily reflects
dissimilarity in connected nodes, which has gained significant attention in
graph learning. To this end, data engineers aim to develop a powerful GNN model
that can ensure performance under both homophily and heterophily. Despite
numerous attempts, most existing GNNs struggle to achieve optimal node
representations due to the constraints of undirected graphs. The neglect of
directed edges results in sub-optimal graph representations, thereby hindering
the capacity of GNNs. To address this issue, we introduce AMUD, which
quantifies the relationship between node profiles and topology from a
statistical perspective, offering valuable insights for \underline{A}daptively
\underline{M}odeling the natural directed graphs as the \underline{U}ndirected
or \underline{D}irected graph to maximize the benefits from subsequent graph
learning. Furthermore, we propose \underline{A}daptive \underline{D}irected
\underline{P}attern \underline{A}ggregation (ADPA) as a new directed graph
learning paradigm for AMUD. Empirical studies have demonstrated that AMUD
guides efficient graph learning. Meanwhile, extensive experiments on 14
benchmark datasets substantiate the impressive performance of ADPA,
outperforming baselines by significant margins of 3.96\%.

<p>Infants' ability to recognize and categorize objects develops gradually. The
second year of life is marked by both the emergence of more semantic visual
representations and a better understanding of word meaning. This suggests that
language input may play an important role in shaping visual representations.
However, even in suitable contexts for word learning like dyadic play sessions,
caregivers utterances are sparse and ambiguous, often referring to objects that
are different from the one to which the child attends. Here, we systematically
investigate to what extent caregivers' utterances can nevertheless enhance
visual representations. For this we propose a computational model of visual
representation learning during dyadic play. We introduce a synthetic dataset of
ego-centric images perceived by a toddler-agent that moves and rotates toy
objects in different parts of its home environment while hearing caregivers'
utterances, modeled as captions. We propose to model toddlers' learning as
simultaneously aligning representations for 1) close-in-time images and 2)
co-occurring images and utterances. We show that utterances with statistics
matching those of real caregivers give rise to representations supporting
improved category recognition. Our analysis reveals that a small
decrease/increase in object-relevant naming frequencies can drastically impact
the learned representations. This affects the attention on object names within
an utterance, which is required for efficient visuo-linguistic alignment.
Overall, our results support the hypothesis that caregivers' naming utterances
can improve toddlers' visual representations.

<p>The Design Structure Matrix (DSM) is an established method used in dependency
modelling, especially in the design of complex engineering systems. The
generation of DSM is traditionally carried out through manual means and can
involve interviewing experts to elicit critical system elements and the
relationships between them. Such manual approaches can be time-consuming and
costly. This paper presents a workflow that uses a Large Language Model (LLM)
to support the generation of DSM and improve productivity. A prototype of the
workflow was developed in this work and applied on a diesel engine DSM
published previously. It was found that the prototype could reproduce 357 out
of 462 DSM entries published (i.e. 77.3%), suggesting that the work can aid DSM
generation. A no-code version of the prototype is made available online to

<p>Multivariate time-series data in numerous real-world applications (e.g.,
healthcare and industry) are informative but challenging due to the lack of
labels and high dimensionality. Recent studies in self-supervised learning have
shown their potential in learning rich representations without relying on
labels, yet they fall short in learning disentangled embeddings and addressing
issues of inductive bias (e.g., transformation-invariance). To tackle these
challenges, we propose TimeDRL, a generic multivariate time-series
representation learning framework with disentangled dual-level embeddings.
TimeDRL is characterized by three novel features: (i) disentangled derivation
of timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings from patched time-series data
using a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) utilization of timestamp-predictive and
instance-contrastive tasks for disentangled representation learning, with the
former optimizing timestamp-level embeddings with predictive loss, and the
latter optimizing instance-level embeddings with contrastive loss; and (iii)
avoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases, such as
transformation-invariance from cropping and masking. Comprehensive experiments
on 6 time-series forecasting datasets and 5 time-series classification datasets
have shown that TimeDRL consistently surpasses existing representation learning
approaches, achieving an average improvement of forecasting by 57.98% in MSE
and classification by 1.25% in accuracy. Furthermore, extensive ablation
studies confirmed the relative contribution of each component in TimeDRL's
architecture, and semi-supervised learning evaluations demonstrated its
effectiveness in real-world scenarios, even with limited labeled data.

<p>In recent years, knowledge distillation methods based on contrastive learning
have achieved promising results on image classification and object detection
tasks. However, in this line of research, we note that less attention is paid
to semantic segmentation. Existing methods heavily rely on data augmentation
and memory buffer, which entail high computational resource demands when
applying them to handle semantic segmentation that requires to preserve
high-resolution feature maps for making dense pixel-wise predictions. In order
to address this problem, we present Augmentation-free Dense Contrastive
Knowledge Distillation (Af-DCD), a new contrastive distillation learning
paradigm to train compact and accurate deep neural networks for semantic
segmentation applications. Af-DCD leverages a masked feature mimicking
strategy, and formulates a novel contrastive learning loss via taking advantage
of tactful feature partitions across both channel and spatial dimensions,
allowing to effectively transfer dense and structured local knowledge learnt by
the teacher model to a target student model while maintaining training
efficiency. Extensive experiments on five mainstream benchmarks with various
teacher-student network pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
For instance, the DeepLabV3-Res18|DeepLabV3-MBV2 model trained by Af-DCD

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines or software to
mimic or even surpass human intelligence in a given cognitive task. While
humans learn by both induction and deduction, the success of current AI is
rooted in induction, relying on its ability to detect statistical regularities
in task input -- an ability learnt from a vast amount of training data using
enormous computation resources. We examine the performance of such a
statistical AI in a human task through the lens of four factors, including task
learnability, statistical resource, computation resource, and learning
techniques, and then propose a three-phase visual framework to understand the
evolving relation between AI and jobs. Based on this conceptual framework, we
develop a simple economic model of competition to show the existence of an
inflection point for each occupation. Before AI performance crosses the
inflection point, human workers always benefit from an improvement in AI
performance, but after the inflection point, human workers become worse off
whenever such an improvement occurs. To offer empirical evidence, we first
argue that AI performance has passed the inflection point for the occupation of
translation but not for the occupation of web development. We then study how
the launch of ChatGPT, which led to significant improvement of AI performance
on many tasks, has affected workers in these two occupations on a large online
labor platform. Consistent with the inflection point conjecture, we find that
translators are negatively affected by the shock both in terms of the number of
accepted jobs and the earnings from those jobs, while web developers are
positively affected by the very same shock. Given the potentially large
disruption of AI on employment, more studies on more occupations using data
from different platforms are urgently needed.

<p>Most convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods for skin cancer
classification obtain their results using only dermatological images. Although
good classification results have been shown, more accurate results can be
achieved by considering the patient's metadata, which is valuable clinical
information for dermatologists. Current methods only use the simple joint
fusion structure (FS) and fusion modules (FMs) for the multi-modal
classification methods, there still is room to increase the accuracy by
exploring more advanced FS and FM. Therefore, in this paper, we design a new
fusion method that combines dermatological images (dermoscopy images or
clinical images) and patient metadata for skin cancer classification from the
perspectives of FS and FM. First, we propose a joint-individual fusion (JIF)
structure that learns the shared features of multi-modality data and preserves
specific features simultaneously. Second, we introduce a fusion attention (FA)
module that enhances the most relevant image and metadata features based on
both the self and mutual attention mechanism to support the decision-making
pipeline. We compare the proposed JIF-MMFA method with other state-of-the-art
fusion methods on three different public datasets. The results show that our
JIF-MMFA method improves the classification results for all tested CNN
backbones and performs better than the other fusion methods on the three public
datasets, demonstrating our method's effectiveness and robustness

<p>Satellite imagery solutions are widely used to study and monitor different
regions of the Earth. However, a single satellite image can cover only a
limited area. In cases where a larger area of interest is studied, several
images must be stitched together to create a single larger image, called a
mosaic, that can cover the area. Today, with the increasing number of satellite
images available for commercial use, selecting the images to build the mosaic
is challenging, especially when the user wants to optimize one or more
parameters, such as the total cost and the cloud coverage percentage in the
mosaic. More precisely, for this problem the input is an area of interest,
several satellite images intersecting the area, a list of requirements relative
to the image and the mosaic, such as cloud coverage percentage, image
resolution, and a list of objectives to optimize. We contribute to the
constraint and mixed integer lineal programming formulation of this new
problem, which we call the \textit{satellite image mosaic selection problem},
which is a multi-objective extension of the polygon cover problem. We propose a
dataset of realistic and challenging instances, where the images were captured
by the satellite constellations SPOT, Pl\'eiades and Pl\'eiades Neo. We
evaluate and compare the two proposed models and show their efficiency for

systems in non-financial applications, looking to benefit from what the
technology has to offer. Although many fields have managed to include
blockchain in their core functionalities, the adoption of blockchain, in
general, is constrained by the so-called trilemma trade-off between
decentralization, scalability, and security. In our previous work, we have
shown that using a digital twin for dynamically managing blockchain systems
during runtime can be effective in managing the trilemma trade-off. Our Digital
Twin leverages DDDAS feedback loop, which is responsible for getting the data

attributed to the capabilities offered by attention mechanisms and the

<p>Transformers, renowned for their self-attention mechanism, have achieved
state-of-the-art performance across various tasks in natural language
processing, computer vision, time-series modeling, etc. However, one of the
challenges with deep Transformer models is the oversmoothing problem, where
representations across layers converge to indistinguishable values, leading to
significant performance degradation. We interpret the original self-attention
as a simple graph filter and redesign it from a graph signal processing (GSP)
perspective. We propose graph-filter-based self-attention (GFSA) to learn a
general yet effective one, whose complexity, however, is slightly larger than
that of the original self-attention mechanism. We demonstrate that GFSA

<p>Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a widely used declarative programming
paradigm that has shown great potential in solving complex computational
problems. However, the inability to natively support non-integer arithmetic has
been highlighted as a major drawback in real-world applications. This feature
is crucial to accurately model and manage real-world data and information as
emerged in various contexts, such as the smooth movement of video game
characters, the 3D movement of mechanical arms, and data streamed by sensors.
Nevertheless, extending ASP in this direction, without affecting its
declarative nature and its well-defined semantics, poses non-trivial
challenges; thus, no ASP system is able to reason natively with non-integer
domains. Indeed, the widespread floating-point arithmetic is not applicable to
the ASP case, as the reproducibility of results cannot be guaranteed and the
semantics of an ASP program would not be uniquely and declaratively determined,
regardless of the employed machine or solver. To overcome such limitations and
in the realm of pure ASP, this paper proposes an extension of ASP in which
non-integers are approximated to rational numbers, fully granting
reproducibility and declarativity. We provide a well-defined semantics for the
ASP-Core-2 standard extended with rational numbers and an implementation
thereof. We hope this work could serve as a stepping stone towards a more
expressive and versatile ASP language that can handle a broader range of
real-world problems.

<p>This paper explores the emerging knowledge-driven autonomous driving
technologies. Our investigation highlights the limitations of current
autonomous driving systems, in particular their sensitivity to data bias,
difficulty in handling long-tail scenarios, and lack of interpretability.
Conversely, knowledge-driven methods with the abilities of cognition,
generalization and life-long learning emerge as a promising way to overcome
these challenges. This paper delves into the essence of knowledge-driven
autonomous driving and examines its core components: dataset \&amp; benchmark,
environment, and driver agent. By leveraging large language models, world
models, neural rendering, and other advanced artificial intelligence
techniques, these components collectively contribute to a more holistic,
adaptive, and intelligent autonomous driving system. The paper systematically
organizes and reviews previous research efforts in this area, and provides
insights and guidance for future research and practical applications of
autonomous driving. We will continually share the latest updates on
cutting-edge developments in knowledge-driven autonomous driving along with the

<p>Human intelligence and human consciousness emerge gradually during the
process of cognitive development. Understanding this development is an
essential aspect of understanding the human mind and may facilitate the
construction of artificial minds with similar properties. Importantly, human
cognitive development relies on embodied interactions with the physical and
social environment, which is perceived via complementary sensory modalities.
These interactions allow the developing mind to probe the causal structure of
the world. This is in stark contrast to common machine learning approaches,
e.g., for large language models, which are merely passively ``digesting'' large
amounts of training data, but are not in control of their sensory inputs.
However, computational modeling of the kind of self-determined embodied
interactions that lead to human intelligence and consciousness is a formidable
challenge. Here we present MIMo, an open-source multi-modal infant model for
studying early cognitive development through computer simulations. MIMo's body
is modeled after an 18-month-old child with detailed five-fingered hands. MIMo
perceives its surroundings via binocular vision, a vestibular system,
proprioception, and touch perception through a full-body virtual skin, while
two different actuation models allow control of his body. We describe the
design and interfaces of MIMo and provide examples illustrating its use. All

<p>The modeling and forecasting of sea ice conditions in the Arctic region are
important tasks for ship routing, offshore oil production, and environmental
monitoring. We propose the adaptive surrogate modeling approach named LANE-SI
(Lightweight Automated Neural Ensembling for Sea Ice) that uses ensemble of
relatively simple deep learning models with different loss functions for
forecasting of spatial distribution for sea ice concentration in the specified
water area. Experimental studies confirm the quality of a long-term forecast
based on a deep learning model fitted to the specific water area is comparable
to resource-intensive physical modeling, and for some periods of the year, it
is superior. We achieved a 20% improvement against the state-of-the-art
physics-based forecast system SEAS5 for the Kara Sea.

<p>Pesticides serve as a common tool in agricultural pest control but
significantly contribute to the climate crisis. To combat this, Integrated Pest
Management (IPM) stands as a climate-smart alternative. Despite its potential,
IPM faces low adoption rates due to farmers' skepticism about its
effectiveness. To address this challenge, we introduce an advanced data
analysis framework tailored to enhance IPM adoption. Our framework provides i)
robust pest population predictions across diverse environments with invariant
and causal learning, ii) interpretable pest presence predictions using
transparent models, iii) actionable advice through counterfactual explanations
for in-season IPM interventions, iv) field-specific treatment effect
estimations, and v) assessments of the effectiveness of our advice using causal
inference. By incorporating these features, our framework aims to alleviate
skepticism and encourage wider adoption of IPM practices among farmers.

<p>OpenAI's latest large vision-language model (LVLM), GPT-4V(ision), has piqued
considerable interest for its potential in medical applications. Despite its
promise, recent studies and internal reviews highlight its underperformance in
specialized medical tasks. This paper explores the boundary of GPT-4V's
capabilities in medicine, particularly in processing complex imaging data from
endoscopies, CT scans, and MRIs etc. Leveraging open-source datasets, we
assessed its foundational competencies, identifying substantial areas for
enhancement. Our research emphasizes prompt engineering, an often-underutilized
strategy for improving AI responsiveness. Through iterative testing, we refined
the model's prompts, significantly improving its interpretative accuracy and
relevance in medical imaging. From our comprehensive evaluations, we distilled
10 effective prompt engineering techniques, each fortifying GPT-4V's medical
acumen. These methodical enhancements facilitate more reliable, precise, and
clinically valuable insights from GPT-4V, advancing its operability in critical
healthcare environments. Our findings are pivotal for those employing AI in
medicine, providing clear, actionable guidance on harnessing GPT-4V's full

<p>The ability to perform causal reasoning is widely considered a core feature
of intelligence. In this work, we investigate whether large language models
(LLMs) can coherently reason about causality. Much of the existing work in
natural language processing (NLP) focuses on evaluating commonsense causal
reasoning in LLMs, thus failing to assess whether a model can perform causal
inference in accordance with a set of well-defined formal rules. To address
this, we propose a new NLP task, causal inference in natural language, inspired
by the "causal inference engine" postulated by Judea Pearl et al. We compose a
large dataset, CLadder, with 10K samples: based on a collection of causal
graphs and queries (associational, interventional, and counterfactual), we
obtain symbolic questions and ground-truth answers, through an oracle causal
inference engine. These are then translated into natural language. We evaluate
multiple LLMs on our dataset, and we introduce and evaluate a bespoke
chain-of-thought prompting strategy, CausalCoT. We show that our task is highly
challenging for LLMs, and we conduct an in-depth analysis to gain deeper
insight into the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our data is open-sourced

<p>Humans seek information regarding a specific topic through performing a
conversation containing a series of questions and answers. In the pursuit of
conversational question answering research, we introduce the PCoQA, the first
\textbf{P}ersian \textbf{Co}nversational \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering
dataset, a resource comprising information-seeking dialogs encompassing a total
of 9,026 contextually-driven questions. Each dialog involves a questioner, a
responder, and a document from the Wikipedia; The questioner asks several
inter-connected questions from the text and the responder provides a span of
the document as the answer for each question. PCoQA is designed to present
novel challenges compared to previous question answering datasets including
having more open-ended non-factual answers, longer answers, and fewer lexical
overlaps. This paper not only presents the comprehensive PCoQA dataset but also
reports the performance of various benchmark models. Our models include

<p>Autonomous racing is a critical research area for autonomous driving,
presenting significant challenges in vehicle dynamics modeling, such as
balancing model precision and computational efficiency at high speeds
(&gt;280kmph), where minor errors in modeling have severe consequences. Existing
physics-based models for vehicle dynamics require elaborate testing setups and
tuning, which are hard to implement, time-intensive, and cost-prohibitive.
Conversely, purely data-driven approaches do not generalize well and cannot
adequately ensure physical constraints on predictions. This paper introduces
Deep Dynamics, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) for vehicle dynamics
modeling of an autonomous racecar. It combines physics coefficient estimation
and dynamical equations to accurately predict vehicle states at high speeds and
includes a unique Physics Guard layer to ensure internal coefficient estimates
remain within their nominal physical ranges. Open-loop and closed-loop
performance assessments, using a physics-based simulator and full-scale
autonomous Indy racecar data, highlight Deep Dynamics as a promising approach
for modeling racecar vehicle dynamics.

<p>There is an increasing consensus about the effectiveness of user-centred
approaches in the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) field. Indeed, the
number and complexity of personalised and user-centred approaches to XAI have
rapidly grown in recent years. Often, these works have a two-fold objective:
(1) proposing novel XAI techniques able to consider the users and (2) assessing
the \textit{goodness} of such techniques with respect to others. From these new
works, it emerged that user-centred approaches to XAI positively affect the
interaction between users and systems. However, so far, the goodness of XAI
systems has been measured through indirect measures, such as performance. In
this paper, we propose an assessment task to objectively and quantitatively
measure the goodness of XAI systems in terms of their \textit{information
power}, which we intended as the amount of information the system provides to
the users during the interaction. Moreover, we plan to use our task to
objectively compare two XAI techniques in a human-robot decision-making task to
understand deeper whether user-centred approaches are more informative than
classical ones.

<p>In this paper, we propose the Adversarial Denoising Diffusion Model (ADDM).
The ADDM is based on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) but
complementarily trained by adversarial learning. The proposed adversarial
learning is achieved by classifying model-based denoised samples and samples to
which random Gaussian noise is added to a specific sampling step. With the
addition of explicit adversarial learning on data samples, ADDM can learn the
semantic characteristics of the data more robustly during training, which
achieves a similar data sampling performance with much fewer sampling steps
than DDPM. We apply ADDM to anomaly detection in unsupervised MRI images.
Experimental results show that the proposed ADDM outperformed existing
generative model-based unsupervised anomaly detection methods. In particular,
compared to other DDPM-based anomaly detection methods, the proposed ADDM shows
better performance with the same number of sampling steps and similar
performance with 50% fewer sampling steps.

<p>We consider the problem of quantifying uncertainty over expected cumulative
rewards in model-based reinforcement learning. In particular, we focus on
characterizing the variance over values induced by a distribution over MDPs.
Previous work upper bounds the posterior variance over values by solving a
so-called uncertainty Bellman equation (UBE), but the over-approximation may
result in inefficient exploration. We propose a new UBE whose solution
converges to the true posterior variance over values and leads to lower regret
in tabular exploration problems. We identify challenges to apply the UBE theory
beyond tabular problems and propose a suitable approximation. Based on this
approximation, we introduce a general-purpose policy optimization algorithm,
Q-Uncertainty Soft Actor-Critic (QU-SAC), that can be applied for either
risk-seeking or risk-averse policy optimization with minimal changes.
Experiments in both online and offline RL demonstrate improved performance
compared to other uncertainty estimation methods.

<p>The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great
convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane
rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such
anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to
unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and
effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image
anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase
pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with
the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using
cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it
leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those
involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of
the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits
superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably,
the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection
accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance,
employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised
pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an
improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin
Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an
AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the
original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of
self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning
techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and
efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation
systems.

<p>Multiwinner voting captures a wide variety of settings, from parliamentary
elections in democratic systems to product placement in online shopping
platforms. There is a large body of work dealing with axiomatic
characterizations, computational complexity, and algorithmic analysis of
multiwinner voting rules. Although many challenges remain, significant progress
has been made in showing existence of fair and representative outcomes as well
as efficient algorithmic solutions for many commonly studied settings. However,
much of this work focuses on single-shot elections, even though in numerous
real-world settings elections are held periodically and repeatedly. Hence, it
is imperative to extend the study of multiwinner voting to temporal settings.
Recently, there have been several efforts to address this challenge. However,
these works are difficult to compare, as they model multi-period voting in very
different ways. We propose a unified framework for studying temporal fairness
in this domain, drawing connections with various existing bodies of work, and
consolidating them within a general framework. We also identify gaps in
existing literature, outline multiple opportunities for future work, and put
forward a vision for the future of multiwinner voting in temporal settings.

<p>Real-world knowledge can be represented as a graph consisting of entities and
relationships between the entities. The need for efficient and scalable
solutions arises when dealing with vast genomic data, like RNA-sequencing.
Knowledge graphs offer a powerful approach for various tasks in such
large-scale genomic data, such as analysis and inference. In this work,
variant-level information extracted from the RNA-sequences of vaccine-na\"ive
COVID-19 patients have been represented as a unified, large knowledge graph.
Variant call format (VCF) files containing the variant-level information were
annotated to include further information for each variant. The data records in
the annotated files were then converted to Resource Description Framework (RDF)
triples. Each VCF file obtained had an associated CADD scores file that
contained the raw and Phred-scaled scores for each variant. An ontology was
defined for the VCF and CADD scores files. Using this ontology and the
extracted information, a large, scalable knowledge graph was created. Available
graph storage was then leveraged to query and create datasets for further
downstream tasks. We also present a case study using the knowledge graph and
perform a classification task using graph machine learning. We also draw
comparisons between different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the case study.

<p>Whereas adversarial training can be useful against specific adversarial
perturbations, they have also proven ineffective in generalizing towards
attacks deviating from those used for training. However, we observe that this
ineffectiveness is intrinsically connected to domain adaptability, another
crucial issue in deep learning for which adversarial domain adaptation appears
to be a promising solution. Consequently, we proposed Adv-4-Adv as a novel
adversarial training method that aims to retain robustness against unseen
adversarial perturbations. Essentially, Adv-4-Adv treats attacks incurring
different perturbations as distinct domains, and by leveraging the power of
adversarial domain adaptation, it aims to remove the domain/attack-specific
features. This forces a trained model to learn a robust domain-invariant
representation, which in turn enhances its generalization ability. Extensive
evaluations on Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that a
model trained by Adv-4-Adv based on samples crafted by simple attacks (e.g.,
FGSM) can be generalized to more advanced attacks (e.g., PGD), and the
performance exceeds state-of-the-art proposals on these datasets.

<p>Automated hate speech detection is an important tool in combating the spread
of hate speech, particularly in social media. Numerous methods have been
developed for the task, including a recent proliferation of deep-learning based
approaches. A variety of datasets have also been developed, exemplifying
various manifestations of the hate-speech detection problem. We present here a

<p>Face recognition systems are widely deployed in safety-critical applications,
including law enforcement, yet they exhibit bias across a range of
socio-demographic dimensions, such as gender and race. Conventional wisdom
dictates that model biases arise from biased training data. As a consequence,
previous works on bias mitigation largely focused on pre-processing the
training data, adding penalties to prevent bias from effecting the model during
training, or post-processing predictions to debias them, yet these approaches
have shown limited success on hard problems such as face recognition. In our
work, we discover that biases are actually inherent to neural network
architectures themselves. Following this reframing, we conduct the first neural
architecture search for fairness, jointly with a search for hyperparameters.
Our search outputs a suite of models which Pareto-dominate all other
high-performance architectures and existing bias mitigation methods in terms of
accuracy and fairness, often by large margins, on the two most widely used
datasets for face identification, CelebA and VGGFace2. Furthermore, these
models generalize to other datasets and sensitive attributes. We release our

<p>Generative artificial intelligence has made significant strides, producing
text indistinguishable from human prose and remarkably photorealistic images.
Automatically measuring how close the generated data distribution is to the
target distribution is central to diagnosing existing models and developing
better ones. We present MAUVE, a family of comparison measures between pairs of
distributions such as those encountered in the generative modeling of text or
images. These scores are statistical summaries of divergence frontiers
capturing two types of errors in generative modeling. We explore three
approaches to statistically estimate these scores: vector quantization,
non-parametric estimation, and classifier-based estimation. We provide
statistical bounds for the vector quantization approach.
</p>
<p>Empirically, we find that the proposed scores paired with a range of
$f$-divergences and statistical estimation methods can quantify the gaps
between the distributions of human-written text and those of modern neural
language models by correlating with human judgments and identifying known
properties of the generated texts. We demonstrate in the vision domain that
MAUVE can identify known properties of generated images on par with or better
than existing metrics. In conclusion, we present practical recommendations for
using MAUVE effectively with language and image modalities.

<p>This study demonstrates the feasibility of point cloud-based proactive link
quality prediction for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Previous
studies have proposed machine learning-based methods to predict received signal
strength for future time periods using time series of depth images to mitigate
the line-of-sight (LOS) path blockage by pedestrians in mmWave communication.
However, these image-based methods have limited applicability due to privacy
concerns as camera images may contain sensitive information. This study
proposes a point cloud-based method for mmWave link quality prediction and
demonstrates its feasibility through experiments. Point clouds represent
three-dimensional (3D) spaces as a set of points and are sparser and less
likely to contain sensitive information than camera images. Additionally, point
clouds provide 3D position and motion information, which is necessary for
understanding the radio propagation environment involving pedestrians. This
study designs the mmWave link quality prediction method and conducts realistic
indoor experiments, where the link quality fluctuates significantly due to
human blockage, using commercially available IEEE 802.11ad-based 60 GHz
wireless LAN devices and Kinect v2 RGB-D camera and Velodyne VLP-16 light
detection and ranging (LiDAR) for point cloud acquisition. The experimental
results showed that our proposed method can predict future large attenuation of
mmWave received signal strength and throughput induced by the LOS path blockage
by pedestrians with comparable or superior accuracy to image-based prediction
methods. Hence, our point cloud-based method can serve as a viable alternative
to image-based methods.

<p>Using knowledge graph embedding models (KGEMs) is a popular approach for
predicting links in knowledge graphs (KGs). Traditionally, the performance of
KGEMs for link prediction is assessed using rank-based metrics, which evaluate
their ability to give high scores to ground-truth entities. However, the
literature claims that the KGEM evaluation procedure would benefit from adding
supplementary dimensions to assess. That is why, in this paper, we extend our
previously introduced metric Sem@K that measures the capability of models to
predict valid entities w.r.t. domain and range constraints. In particular, we
consider a broad range of KGs and take their respective characteristics into
account to propose different versions of Sem@K. We also perform an extensive
study to qualify the abilities of KGEMs as measured by our metric. Our
experiments show that Sem@K provides a new perspective on KGEM quality. Its
joint analysis with rank-based metrics offers different conclusions on the
predictive power of models. Regarding Sem@K, some KGEMs are inherently better
than others, but this semantic superiority is not indicative of their
performance w.r.t. rank-based metrics. In this work, we generalize conclusions
about the relative performance of KGEMs w.r.t. rank-based and semantic-oriented
metrics at the level of families of models. The joint analysis of the
aforementioned metrics gives more insight into the peculiarities of each model.
This work paves the way for a more comprehensive evaluation of KGEM adequacy
for specific downstream tasks.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09820">A Stability Analysis of Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained Model. (arXiv:2301.09820v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Fine-tuning a pre-trained model (such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, T5, GPT,
etc.) has proven to be one of the most promising paradigms in recent NLP
research. However, numerous recent works indicate that fine-tuning suffers from
the instability problem, i.e., tuning the same model under the same setting
results in significantly different performance. Many recent works have proposed
different methods to solve this problem, but there is no theoretical
understanding of why and how these methods work. In this paper, we propose a
novel theoretical stability analysis of fine-tuning that focuses on two
commonly used settings, namely, full fine-tuning and head tuning. We define the
stability under each setting and prove the corresponding stability bounds. The
theoretical bounds explain why and how several existing methods can stabilize
the fine-tuning procedure. In addition to being able to explain most of the
observed empirical discoveries, our proposed theoretical analysis framework can
also help in the design of effective and provable methods. Based on our theory,
we propose three novel strategies to stabilize the fine-tuning procedure,
namely, Maximal Margin Regularizer (MMR), Multi-Head Loss (MHLoss), and Self
Unsupervised Re-Training (SURT). We extensively evaluate our proposed
approaches on 11 widely used real-world benchmark datasets, as well as hundreds
of synthetic classification datasets. The experiment results show that our
proposed methods significantly stabilize the fine-tuning procedure and also
corroborate our theoretical analysis.

<p>Data poisoning considers cases when an adversary manipulates the behavior of
machine learning algorithms through malicious training data. Existing threat
models of data poisoning center around a single metric, the number of poisoned
samples. In consequence, if attackers can poison more samples than expected
with affordable overhead, as in many practical scenarios, they may be able to
render existing defenses ineffective in a short time. To address this issue, we
leverage timestamps denoting the birth dates of data, which are often available
but neglected in the past. Benefiting from these timestamps, we propose a
temporal threat model of data poisoning with two novel metrics, earliness and
duration, which respectively measure how long an attack started in advance and
how long an attack lasted. Using these metrics, we define the notions of
temporal robustness against data poisoning, providing a meaningful sense of
protection even with unbounded amounts of poisoned samples when the attacks are
temporally bounded. We present a benchmark with an evaluation protocol
simulating continuous data collection and periodic deployments of updated
models, thus enabling empirical evaluation of temporal robustness. Lastly, we
develop and also empirically verify a baseline defense, namely temporal
aggregation, offering provable temporal robustness and highlighting the
potential of our temporal threat model for data poisoning.

<p>Trajectory-User Linking (TUL) is crucial for human mobility modeling by
linking diferent trajectories to users with the exploration of complex mobility
patterns. Existing works mainly rely on the recurrent neural framework to
encode the temporal dependencies in trajectories, have fall short in capturing
spatial-temporal global context for TUL prediction. To ill this gap, this work
presents a new hierarchical spatio-temporal attention neural network, called
AttnTUL, to jointly encode the local trajectory transitional patterns and
global spatial dependencies for TUL. Speciically, our irst model component is
built over the graph neural architecture to preserve the local and global
context and enhance the representation paradigm of geographical regions and
user trajectories. Additionally, a hierarchically structured attention network
is designed to simultaneously encode the intra-trajectory and inter-trajectory
dependencies, with the integration of the temporal attention mechanism and
global elastic attentional encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate the

<p>Calibrating agent-based models (ABMs) in economics and finance typically
involves a derivative-free search in a very large parameter space. In this
work, we benchmark a number of search methods in the calibration of a
well-known macroeconomic ABM on real data, and further assess the performance
of "mixed strategies" made by combining different methods. We find that methods
based on random-forest surrogates are particularly efficient, and that
combining search methods generally increases performance since the biases of
any single method are mitigated. Moving from these observations, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL) scheme to automatically select and combine search
methods on-the-fly during a calibration run. The RL agent keeps exploiting a
specific method only as long as this keeps performing well, but explores new
strategies when the specific method reaches a performance plateau. The
resulting RL search scheme outperforms any other method or method combination
tested, and does not rely on any prior information or trial and error
procedure.

<p>Natural Language Generation (NLG) accepts input data in the form of images,
videos, or text and generates corresponding natural language text as output.
Existing NLG methods mainly adopt a supervised approach and rely heavily on
coupled data-to-text pairs. However, for many targeted scenarios and for
non-English languages, sufficient quantities of labeled data are often not
available. To relax the dependency on labeled data of downstream tasks, we
propose an intuitive and effective zero-shot learning framework, ZeroNLG, which
can deal with multiple NLG tasks, including image-to-text (image captioning),
video-to-text (video captioning), and text-to-text (neural machine
translation), across English, Chinese, German, and French within a unified
framework. ZeroNLG does not require any labeled downstream pairs for training.
During training, ZeroNLG (i) projects different domains (across modalities and
languages) to corresponding coordinates in a shared common latent space; (ii)
bridges different domains by aligning their corresponding coordinates in this
space; and (iii) builds an unsupervised multilingual auto-encoder to learn to
generate text by reconstructing the input text given its coordinate in shared
latent space. Consequently, during inference, based on the data-to-text
pipeline, ZeroNLG can generate target sentences across different languages
given the coordinate of input data in the common space. Within this unified
framework, given visual (imaging or video) data as input, ZeroNLG can perform
zero-shot visual captioning; given textual sentences as input, ZeroNLG can
perform zero-shot machine translation. We present the results of extensive
experiments on twelve NLG tasks, showing that, without using any labeled
downstream pairs for training, ZeroNLG generates high-quality and believable
outputs and significantly outperforms existing zero-shot methods.

<p>Neural video game simulators emerged as powerful tools to generate and edit
videos. Their idea is to represent games as the evolution of an environment's
state driven by the actions of its agents. While such a paradigm enables users
to play a game action-by-action, its rigidity precludes more semantic forms of
control. To overcome this limitation, we augment game models with prompts
specified as a set of natural language actions and desired states. The result-a
Promptable Game Model (PGM)-makes it possible for a user to play the game by
prompting it with high- and low-level action sequences. Most captivatingly, our
PGM unlocks the director's mode, where the game is played by specifying goals
for the agents in the form of a prompt. This requires learning "game AI",
encapsulated by our animation model, to navigate the scene using high-level
constraints, play against an adversary, and devise a strategy to win a point.
To render the resulting state, we use a compositional NeRF representation
encapsulated in our synthesis model. To foster future research, we present
newly collected, annotated and calibrated Tennis and Minecraft datasets. Our
method significantly outperforms existing neural video game simulators in terms
of rendering quality and unlocks applications beyond the capabilities of the
current state of the art. Our framework, data, and models are available at

<p>Generative DNNs are a powerful tool for image synthesis, but they are limited
by their computational load. On the other hand, given a trained model and a
task, e.g. faces generation within a range of characteristics, the output image
quality will be unevenly distributed among images with different
characteristics. It follows, that we might restrain the models complexity on
some instances, maintaining a high quality. We propose a method for diminishing
computations by adding so-called early exit branches to the original
architecture, and dynamically switching the computational path depending on how
difficult it will be to render the output. We apply our method on two different
SOTA models performing generative tasks: generation from a semantic map, and
cross-reenactment of face expressions; showing it is able to output images with
custom lower-quality thresholds. For a threshold of LPIPS &lt;=0.1, we diminish
their computations by up to a half. This is especially relevant for real-time
applications such as synthesis of faces, when quality loss needs to be
contained, but most of the inputs need fewer computations than the complex
instances.

<p>Traditionally, data valuation (DV) is posed as a problem of equitably
splitting the validation performance of a learning algorithm among the training
data. As a result, the calculated data values depend on many design choices of
the underlying learning algorithm. However, this dependence is undesirable for
many DV use cases, such as setting priorities over different data sources in a
data acquisition process and informing pricing mechanisms in a data
marketplace. In these scenarios, data needs to be valued before the actual
analysis and the choice of the learning algorithm is still undetermined then.
Another side-effect of the dependence is that to assess the value of individual
points, one needs to re-run the learning algorithm with and without a point,
which incurs a large computation burden. This work leapfrogs over the current
limits of data valuation methods by introducing a new framework that can value
training data in a way that is oblivious to the downstream learning algorithm.
Our main results are as follows. (1) We develop a proxy for the validation
performance associated with a training set based on a non-conventional
class-wise Wasserstein distance between training and validation sets. We show
that the distance characterizes the upper bound of the validation performance
for any given model under certain Lipschitz conditions. (2) We develop a novel
method to value individual data based on the sensitivity analysis of the
class-wise Wasserstein distance. Importantly, these values can be directly
obtained for free from the output of off-the-shelf optimization solvers when
computing the distance. (3) We evaluate our new data valuation framework over
various use cases related to detecting low-quality data and show that,
surprisingly, the learning-agnostic feature of our framework enables a
significant improvement over SOTA performance while being orders of magnitude
faster.

<p>Proteins are complex biomolecules that perform a variety of crucial functions
within living organisms. Designing and generating novel proteins can pave the
way for many future synthetic biology applications, including drug discovery.
However, it remains a challenging computational task due to the large modeling
space of protein structures. In this study, we propose a latent diffusion model
that can reduce the complexity of protein modeling while flexibly capturing the
distribution of natural protein structures in a condensed latent space.
Specifically, we propose an equivariant protein autoencoder that embeds
proteins into a latent space and then uses an equivariant diffusion model to
learn the distribution of the latent protein representations. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method can effectively generate novel protein
backbone structures with high designability and efficiency. The code will be

<p>In this paper we consider the task of conversational semantic parsing over
general purpose knowledge graphs (KGs) with millions of entities, and thousands
of relation-types. We focus on models which are capable of interactively
mapping user utterances into executable logical forms (e.g., Sparql) in the
context of the conversational history. Our key idea is to represent information
about an utterance and its context via a subgraph which is created dynamically,
i.e., the number of nodes varies per utterance. Rather than treating the
subgraph as a sequence, we exploit its underlying structure and encode it with
a graph neural network which further allows us to represent a large number of
(unseen) nodes. Experimental results show that dynamic context modeling is
superior to static approaches, delivering performance improvements across the
board (i.e., for simple and complex questions). Our results further confirm
that modeling the structure of context is better at processing discourse
information, (i.e., at handling ellipsis and resolving coreference) and longer
interactions.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
performing complex tasks. Moreover, recent research has shown that
incorporating human-annotated rationales (e.g., Chain-of-Thought prompting)
during in-context learning can significantly enhance the performance of these
models, particularly on tasks that require reasoning capabilities. However,
incorporating such rationales poses challenges in terms of scalability as this
requires a high degree of human involvement. In this work, we present a novel
framework, Amplifying Model Performance by Leveraging In-Context Learning with
Post Hoc Explanations (AMPLIFY), which addresses the aforementioned challenges
by automating the process of rationale generation. To this end, we leverage
post hoc explanation methods which output attribution scores (explanations)
capturing the influence of each of the input features on model predictions.
More specifically, we construct automated natural language rationales that
embed insights from post hoc explanations to provide corrective signals to
LLMs. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets demonstrates that our
framework, AMPLIFY, leads to prediction accuracy improvements of about 10-25%
over a wide range of tasks, including those where prior approaches which rely
on human-annotated rationales such as Chain-of-Thought prompting fall short.
Our work makes one of the first attempts at highlighting the potential of post
hoc explanations as valuable tools for enhancing the effectiveness of LLMs.
Furthermore, we conduct additional empirical analyses and ablation studies to
demonstrate the impact of each of the components of AMPLIFY, which, in turn,
leads to critical insights for refining in-context learning.

<p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have unlocked unprecedented abilities
in visual creation. However, current text-to-video generation models struggle
with the trade-off among movement range, action coherence and object
consistency. To mitigate this issue, we present a controllable text-to-video
(T2V) diffusion model, called Control-A-Video, capable of maintaining
consistency while customizable video synthesis. Based on a pre-trained
conditional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, our model aims to generate
videos conditioned on a sequence of control signals, such as edge or depth
maps. For the purpose of improving object consistency, Control-A-Video
integrates motion priors and content priors into video generation. We propose
two motion-adaptive noise initialization strategies, which are based on pixel
residual and optical flow, to introduce motion priors from input videos,
producing more coherent videos. Moreover, a first-frame conditioned controller
is proposed to generate videos from content priors of the first frame, which
facilitates the semantic alignment with text and allows longer video generation
in an auto-regressive manner. With the proposed architecture and strategies,
our model achieves resource-efficient convergence and generate consistent and
coherent videos with fine-grained control. Extensive experiments demonstrate
its success in various video generative tasks such as video editing and video
style transfer, outperforming previous methods in terms of consistency and
quality.

<p>Personalized text-to-image generation using diffusion models has recently
emerged and garnered significant interest. This task learns a novel concept
(e.g., a unique toy), illustrated in a handful of images, into a generative
model that captures fine visual details and generates photorealistic images
based on textual embeddings. In this paper, we present ViCo, a novel
lightweight plug-and-play method that seamlessly integrates visual condition
into personalized text-to-image generation. ViCo stands out for its unique
feature of not requiring any fine-tuning of the original diffusion model
parameters, thereby facilitating more flexible and scalable model deployment.
This key advantage distinguishes ViCo from most existing models that
necessitate partial or full diffusion fine-tuning. ViCo incorporates an image
attention module that conditions the diffusion process on patch-wise visual
semantics, and an attention-based object mask that comes at no extra cost from
the attention module. Despite only requiring light parameter training (~6%
compared to the diffusion U-Net), ViCo delivers performance that is on par
with, or even surpasses, all state-of-the-art models, both qualitatively and
quantitatively. This underscores the efficacy of ViCo, making it a highly
promising solution for personalized text-to-image generation without the need
for diffusion model fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/haoosz/ViCo

<p>Functional brain dynamics is supported by parallel and overlapping functional
network modes that are associated with specific neural circuits. Decomposing
these network modes from fMRI data and finding their temporal characteristics
is challenging due to their time-varying nature and the non-linearity of the
functional dynamics. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) algorithms have been
quite popular for solving this decomposition problem in recent years. In this
work, we apply GraphDMD -- an extension of the DMD for network data -- to
extract the dynamic network modes and their temporal characteristics from the
fMRI time series in an interpretable manner. GraphDMD, however, regards the
underlying system as a linear dynamical system that is sub-optimal for
extracting the network modes from non-linear functional data. In this work, we
develop a generalized version of the GraphDMD algorithm -- DeepGraphDMD --
applicable to arbitrary non-linear graph dynamical systems. DeepGraphDMD is an
autoencoder-based deep learning model that learns Koopman eigenfunctions for
graph data and embeds the non-linear graph dynamics into a latent linear space.
We show the effectiveness of our method in both simulated data and the HCP
resting-state fMRI data. In the HCP data, DeepGraphDMD provides novel insights

<p>Developing robust and effective artificial intelligence (AI) models in
medicine requires access to large amounts of patient data. The use of AI models
solely trained on large multi-institutional datasets can help with this, yet
the imperative to ensure data privacy remains, particularly as membership
inference risks breaching patient confidentiality. As a proposed remedy, we
advocate for the integration of differential privacy (DP). We specifically
investigate the performance of models trained with DP as compared to models
trained without DP on data from institutions that the model had not seen during
its training (i.e., external validation) - the situation that is reflective of
the clinical use of AI models. By leveraging more than 590,000 chest
radiographs from five institutions, we evaluated the efficacy of DP-enhanced
domain transfer (DP-DT) in diagnosing cardiomegaly, pleural effusion,
pneumonia, atelectasis, and in identifying healthy subjects. We juxtaposed
DP-DT with non-DP-DT and examined diagnostic accuracy and demographic fairness
using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the
main metric, as well as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Our results
show that DP-DT, even with exceptionally high privacy levels (epsilon around
1), performs comparably to non-DP-DT (P&gt;0.119 across all domains). Furthermore,
DP-DT led to marginal AUC differences - less than 1% - for nearly all
subgroups, relative to non-DP-DT. Despite consistent evidence suggesting that
DP models induce significant performance degradation for on-domain
applications, we show that off-domain performance is almost not affected.
Therefore, we ardently advocate for the adoption of DP in training diagnostic
medical AI models, given its minimal impact on performance.

<p>The field of 'explainable' artificial intelligence (XAI) has produced highly
cited methods that seek to make the decisions of complex machine learning (ML)
methods 'understandable' to humans, for example by attributing 'importance'
scores to input features. Yet, a lack of formal underpinning leaves it unclear
as to what conclusions can safely be drawn from the results of a given XAI
method and has also so far hindered the theoretical verification and empirical
validation of XAI methods. This means that challenging non-linear problems,
typically solved by deep neural networks, presently lack appropriate remedies.
Here, we craft benchmark datasets for three different non-linear classification
scenarios, in which the important class-conditional features are known by
design, serving as ground truth explanations. Using novel quantitative metrics,
we benchmark the explanation performance of a wide set of XAI methods across
three deep learning model architectures. We show that popular XAI methods are
often unable to significantly outperform random performance baselines and edge
detection methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that explanations derived from
different model architectures can be vastly different; thus, prone to

<p>Learning accurate and parsimonious point cloud representations of scene
surfaces from scratch remains a challenge in 3D representation learning.
Existing point-based methods often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem
or require a large number of points to accurately model scene geometry and
texture. To address these limitations, we propose Proximity Attention Point
Rendering (PAPR), a novel method that consists of a point-based scene
representation and a differentiable renderer. Our scene representation uses a
point cloud where each point is characterized by its spatial position,
influence score, and view-independent feature vector. The renderer selects the
relevant points for each ray and produces accurate colours using their
associated features. PAPR effectively learns point cloud positions to represent
the correct scene geometry, even when the initialization drastically differs
from the target geometry. Notably, our method captures fine texture details
while using only a parsimonious set of points. We also demonstrate four
practical applications of our method: zero-shot geometry editing, object
manipulation, texture transfer, and exposure control. More results and code are

<p>Recommender Systems are built to retrieve relevant items to satisfy users'
information needs. The candidate corpus usually consists of a finite set of
items that are ready to be served, such as videos, products, or articles. With
recent advances in Generative AI such as GPT and Diffusion models, a new form
of recommendation task is yet to be explored where items are to be created by
generative models with personalized prompts. Taking image generation as an
example, with a single prompt from the user and access to a generative model,
it is possible to generate hundreds of new images in a few minutes. How shall
we attain personalization in the presence of "infinite" items? In this
preliminary study, we propose a two-stage framework, namely Prompt-Model
Retrieval and Generated Item Ranking, to approach this new task formulation. We
release GEMRec-18K, a prompt-model interaction dataset with 18K images
generated by 200 publicly-available generative models paired with a diverse set
of 90 textual prompts. Our findings demonstrate the promise of generative model
recommendation as a novel personalization problem and the limitations of
existing evaluation metrics. We highlight future directions for the RecSys
community to advance towards generative recommender systems. Our code and

<p>Optimization is ubiquitous. While derivative-based algorithms have been
powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges
on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by
PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language
models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in
natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions
from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values,
then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next
optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling
salesman problems, then move on to prompt optimization where the goal is to
find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we
demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed
prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks. Code at

<p>Synthetic Time Series Generation (TSG) is crucial in a range of applications,
including data augmentation, anomaly detection, and privacy preservation.
Although significant strides have been made in this field, existing methods
exhibit three key limitations: (1) They often benchmark against similar model
types, constraining a holistic view of performance capabilities. (2) The use of
specialized synthetic and private datasets introduces biases and hampers
generalizability. (3) Ambiguous evaluation measures, often tied to custom
networks or downstream tasks, hinder consistent and fair comparison.
</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, we introduce \textsf{TSGBench}, the inaugural
Time Series Generation Benchmark, designed for a unified and comprehensive
assessment of TSG methods. It comprises three modules: (1) a curated collection
of publicly available, real-world datasets tailored for TSG, together with a
standardized preprocessing pipeline; (2) a comprehensive evaluation measures
suite including vanilla measures, new distance-based assessments, and
visualization tools; (3) a pioneering generalization test rooted in Domain
Adaptation (DA), compatible with all methods. We have conducted comprehensive
experiments using \textsf{TSGBench} across a spectrum of ten real-world
datasets from diverse domains, utilizing ten advanced TSG methods and twelve
evaluation measures. The results highlight the reliability and efficacy of
\textsf{TSGBench} in evaluating TSG methods. Crucially, \textsf{TSGBench}
delivers a statistical analysis of the performance rankings of these methods,

<p>Previous studies regarding the perception of emotions for embodied virtual
agents have shown the effectiveness of using virtual characters in conveying
emotions through interactions with humans. However, creating an autonomous
embodied conversational agent with expressive behaviors presents two major
challenges. The first challenge is the difficulty of synthesizing the
conversational behaviors for each modality that are as expressive as real human
behaviors. The second challenge is that the affects are modeled independently,
which makes it difficult to generate multimodal responses with consistent
emotions across all modalities. In this work, we propose a conceptual
framework, ACTOR (Affect-Consistent mulTimodal behaviOR generation), that aims
to increase the perception of affects by generating multimodal behaviors
conditioned on a consistent driving affect. We have conducted a user study with
199 participants to assess how the average person judges the affects perceived
from multimodal behaviors that are consistent and inconsistent with respect to
a driving affect. The result shows that among all model conditions, our
affect-consistent framework receives the highest Likert scores for the
perception of driving affects. Our statistical analysis suggests that making a
modality affect-inconsistent significantly decreases the perception of driving
affects. We also observe that multimodal behaviors conditioned on consistent
affects are more expressive compared to behaviors with inconsistent affects.
Therefore, we conclude that multimodal emotion conditioning and affect
consistency are vital to enhancing the perception of affects for embodied
conversational agents.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive inferential
capabilities, with numerous research endeavors devoted to enhancing this
capacity through prompting. Despite these efforts, a unified epistemological
foundation is still conspicuously absent. Drawing inspiration from Kant's a
priori philosophy, we propose the UPAR prompting framework, designed to emulate
the structure of human cognition within LLMs. The UPAR framework is delineated
into four phases: "Understand", "Plan", "Act", and "Reflect", enabling the
extraction of structured information from complex contexts, prior planning of
solutions, execution according to plan, and self-reflection. This structure
significantly augments the explainability and accuracy of LLM inference,
producing a human-understandable and inspectable inferential trajectory.
Furthermore, our work offers an epistemological foundation for existing
prompting techniques, allowing for a possible systematic integration of these
methods. With GPT-4, our approach elevates the accuracy from COT baseline of
22.92% to 58.33% in a challenging subset of GSM8K, and from 67.91% to 75.40% in
the causal judgment task. Without using few-shot examples or external tools,
UPAR significantly outperforms existing prompting methods on SCIBENCH, a
challenging dataset containing collegiate-level mathematics, chemistry, and
physics scientific problems.

<p>Emotions lie on a continuum, but current models treat emotions as a finite
valued discrete variable. This representation does not capture the diversity in
the expression of emotion. To better represent emotions we propose the use of
natural language descriptions (or prompts). In this work, we address the
challenge of automatically generating these prompts and training a model to
better learn emotion representations from audio and prompt pairs. We use
acoustic properties that are correlated to emotion like pitch, intensity,
speech rate, and articulation rate to automatically generate prompts i.e.
'acoustic prompts'. We use a contrastive learning objective to map speech to
their respective acoustic prompts. We evaluate our model on Emotion Audio
Retrieval and Speech Emotion Recognition. Our results show that the acoustic
prompts significantly improve the model's performance in EAR, in various
Precision@K metrics. In SER, we observe a 3.8% relative accuracy improvement on
the Ravdess dataset.

<p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially
expanded the range of tasks they can address. In the field of Natural Language
Processing (NLP), researchers have shifted their focus from conventional NLP
tasks (e.g., sequence tagging and parsing) towards tasks that revolve around
aligning with human needs (e.g., brainstorming and email writing). This shift
in task distribution imposes new requirements on evaluating these aligned
models regarding generality (i.e., assessing performance across diverse
scenarios), flexibility (i.e., examining under different protocols), and
interpretability (i.e., scrutinizing models with explanations). In this paper,
we propose a generative judge with 13B parameters, Auto-J, designed to address
these challenges. Our model is trained on user queries and LLM-generated
responses under massive real-world scenarios and accommodates diverse
evaluation protocols (e.g., pairwise response comparison and single-response
evaluation) with well-structured natural language critiques. To demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach, we construct a new testbed covering 58 different
scenarios. Experimentally, Auto-J outperforms a series of strong competitors,
including both open-source and closed-source models, by a large margin. We also
provide detailed analysis and case studies to further reveal the potential of
our method and make a variety of resources public at

<p>Collaborative perception enables agents to share complementary perceptual
information with nearby agents. This would improve the perception performance
and alleviate the issues of single-view perception, such as occlusion and
sparsity. Most existing approaches mainly focus on single modality (especially
LiDAR), and not fully exploit the superiority of multi-modal perception. We
propose a collaborative perception paradigm, BM2CP, which employs LiDAR and
camera to achieve efficient multi-modal perception. It utilizes LiDAR-guided
modal fusion, cooperative depth generation and modality-guided intermediate
fusion to acquire deep interactions among modalities of different agents,
Moreover, it is capable to cope with the special case where one of the sensors,
same or different type, of any agent is missing. Extensive experiments validate
that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with 50X lower

<p>Incorporating a customized object into image generation presents an
attractive feature in text-to-image generation. However, existing
optimization-based and encoder-based methods are hindered by drawbacks such as
time-consuming optimization, insufficient identity preservation, and a
prevalent copy-pasting effect. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
CustomNet, a novel object customization approach that explicitly incorporates
3D novel view synthesis capabilities into the object customization process.
This integration facilitates the adjustment of spatial position relationships

<p>Image-text retrieval is a widely studied topic in the field of computer
vision due to the exponential growth of multimedia data, whose core concept is
to measure the similarity between images and text. However, most existing
retrieval methods heavily rely on cross-attention mechanisms for cross-modal
fine-grained alignment, which takes into account excessive irrelevant regions
and treats prominent and non-significant words equally, thereby limiting
retrieval accuracy. This paper aims to investigate an alignment approach that
reduces the involvement of non-significant fragments in images and text while
enhancing the alignment of prominent segments. For this purpose, we introduce
the Cross-Modal Prominent Fragments Enhancement Aligning Network(CPFEAN), which
achieves improved retrieval accuracy by diminishing the participation of
irrelevant regions during alignment and relatively increasing the alignment
similarity of prominent words. Additionally, we incorporate prior textual
information into image regions to reduce misalignment occurrences. In practice,
we first design a novel intra-modal fragments relationship reasoning method,
and subsequently employ our proposed alignment mechanism to compute the
similarity between images and text. Extensive quantitative comparative
experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by about 5% to 10% in the rSum metric.

<p>The Exponential Mechanism (ExpM), a differentially private optimization
method, promises many advantages over Differentially Private Stochastic
Gradient Descent (DPSGD), the state-of-the-art (SOTA) and de facto method for
differentially private machine learning (ML). Yet, ExpM has been historically
stymied from differentially private training of modern ML algorithms by two
obstructions: ExpM requires a sensitivity bound for the given loss function;
ExpM requires sampling from a historically intractable density. We prove a
sensitivity bound for $\ell(2)$ loss, and investigate using Normalizing Flows
(NFs), deep networks furnishing approximate sampling from the otherwise
intractable ExpM distribution. We prove that as the NF output converges to ExpM
distribution, the privacy ($\varepsilon$) of an NF sample converges to that of
the ExpM distribution. Under the assumption that the NF output distribution is
the ExpM distribution, we empirically test ExpM+NF against DPSGD using the SOTA
implementation (Opacus \cite{opacus} with PRV accounting) in multiple
classification tasks on the Adult Dataset (census data) and MIMIC-III Dataset
(healthcare records) using Logistic Regression and GRU-D, a deep learning
recurrent neural network with \smallsim 20K-100K parameters. In all experiments
we find ExpM+NF achieves greater than 94\% of the non-private training accuracy
(AUC) with $\varepsilon$-DP for $\varepsilon$ a low as $1\mathrm{e}{-3}$ --
three orders of magnitude stronger privacy with similar accuracy. Further,
performance results show ExpM+NF training time is comparable to (slightly less)
than DPSGD. Limitations and future directions are provided; notably, research
on NF approximation accuracy and its effect on privacy are a promising avenue
to substantially advancing the field. Code for these experiments \hl{will be

<p>Video face re-aging deals with altering the apparent age of a person to the
target age in videos. This problem is challenging due to the lack of paired
video datasets maintaining temporal consistency in identity and age. Most
re-aging methods process each image individually without considering the
temporal consistency of videos. While some existing works address the issue of
temporal coherence through video facial attribute manipulation in latent space,
they often fail to deliver satisfactory performance in age transformation. To
tackle the issues, we propose (1) a novel synthetic video dataset that features
subjects across a diverse range of age groups; (2) a baseline architecture
designed to validate the effectiveness of our proposed dataset, and (3) the
development of three novel metrics tailored explicitly for evaluating the
temporal consistency of video re-aging techniques. Our comprehensive
experiments on public datasets, such as VFHQ and CelebV-HQ, show that our
method outperforms the existing approaches in terms of both age transformation
and temporal consistency.

<p>Over the years, RDF streaming was explored in research and practice from many
angles, resulting in a wide range of RDF stream definitions. This variety
presents a major challenge in discussing and integrating streaming solutions,
due to the lack of a common language. This work attempts to address this
critical research gap, by systematizing RDF stream types present in the
literature in a novel taxonomy. The proposed RDF Stream Taxonomy (RDF-STaX) is
embodied in an OWL 2 DL ontology that follows the FAIR principles, making it
readily applicable in practice. Extensive documentation and additional
resources are provided, to foster the adoption of the ontology. Two realized
use cases are presented, demonstrating the usefulness of the resource in
discussing research works and annotating streaming datasets. Another result of
this contribution is the novel nanopublications dataset, which serves as a
collaborative, living state-of-the-art review of RDF streaming. The aim of
RDF-STaX is to address a real need of the community for a better way to
systematize and describe RDF streams. The resource is designed to help drive
innovation in RDF streaming, by fostering scientific discussion, cooperation,
and tool interoperability.

<p>Materials discovery driven by statistical property models is an iterative
decision process, during which an initial data collection is extended with new
data proposed by a model-informed acquisition function--with the goal to
maximize a certain "reward" over time, such as the maximum property value
discovered so far. While the materials science community achieved much progress
in developing property models that predict well on average with respect to the
training distribution, this form of in-distribution performance measurement is
not directly coupled with the discovery reward. This is because an iterative
discovery process has a shifting reward distribution that is
over-proportionally determined by the model performance for exceptional
materials. We demonstrate this problem using the example of bulk modulus
maximization among double perovskite oxides. We find that the in-distribution
predictive performance suggests random forests as superior to Gaussian process
regression, while the results are inverse in terms of the discovery rewards. We
argue that the lack of proper performance estimation methods from pre-computed
data collections is a fundamental problem for improving data-driven materials
discovery, and we propose a novel such estimator that, in contrast to na\"ive
reward estimation, successfully predicts Gaussian processes with the "expected
improvement" acquisition function as the best out of four options in our
demonstrational study for double perovskites. Importantly, it does so without
requiring the over thousand ab initio computations that were needed to confirm
this prediction.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have been touted to enable increased
productivity in many areas of today's work life. Scientific research as an area
of work is no exception: the potential of LLM-based tools to assist in the
daily work of scientists has become a highly discussed topic across
disciplines. However, we are only at the very onset of this subject of study.
It is still unclear how the potential of LLMs will materialise in research
practice. With this study, we give first empirical evidence on the use of LLMs
in the research process. We have investigated a set of use cases for LLM-based
tools in scientific research, and conducted a first study to assess to which
degree current tools are helpful. In this paper we report specifically on use
cases related to software engineering, such as generating application code and
developing scripts for data analytics. While we studied seemingly simple use
cases, results across tools differ significantly. Our results highlight the
promise of LLM-based tools in general, yet we also observe various issues,
particularly regarding the integrity of the output these tools provide.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00052">A Case for Competent AI Systems $-$ A Concept Note. (arXiv:2312.00052v2 [cs.CY] UPDATED)</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Karlapalem_K/0/1/0/all/0/1">Kamalakar Karlapalem</a></p>
<p>The efficiency of an AI system is contingent upon its ability to align with
the specified requirements of a given task. How-ever, the inherent complexity
of tasks often introduces the potential for harmful implications or adverse
actions. This note explores the critical concept of capability within AI
systems, representing what the system is expected to deliver. The articulation
of capability involves specifying well-defined out-comes. Yet, the achievement
of this capability may be hindered by deficiencies in implementation and
testing, reflecting a gap in the system's competency (what it can do vs. what
it does successfully).
</p>
<p>A central challenge arises in elucidating the competency of an AI system to
execute tasks effectively. The exploration of system competency in AI remains
in its early stages, occasionally manifesting as confidence intervals denoting
the probability of success. Trust in an AI system hinges on the explicit
modeling and detailed specification of its competency, connected intricately to
the system's capability. This note explores this gap by proposing a framework
for articulating the competency of AI systems.
</p>
<p>Motivated by practical scenarios such as the Glass Door problem, where an
individual inadvertently encounters a glass obstacle due to a failure in their
competency, this research underscores the imperative of delving into competency
dynamics. Bridging the gap between capability and competency at a detailed
level, this note contributes to advancing the discourse on bolstering the
reliability of AI systems in real-world applications.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00209">On the Interplay Between Stepsize Tuning and Progressive Sharpening. (arXiv:2312.00209v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Recent empirical work has revealed an intriguing property of deep learning
models by which the sharpness (largest eigenvalue of the Hessian) increases
throughout optimization until it stabilizes around a critical value at which
the optimizer operates at the edge of stability, given a fixed stepsize (Cohen
et al, 2022). We investigate empirically how the sharpness evolves when using
stepsize-tuners, the Armijo linesearch and Polyak stepsizes, that adapt the
stepsize along the iterations to local quantities such as, implicitly, the
sharpness itself. We find that the surprisingly poor performance of a classical
Armijo linesearch may be well explained by its tendency to ever-increase the
sharpness of the objective in the full or large batch regimes. On the other
hand, we observe that Polyak stepsizes operate generally at the edge of
stability or even slightly beyond, while outperforming its Armijo and constant
stepsizes counterparts. We conclude with an analysis that suggests unlocking
stepsize tuners requires an understanding of the joint dynamics of the step
size and the sharpness.

<p>The capabilities of large language models have grown significantly in recent
years and so too have concerns about their misuse. In this context, the ability
to distinguish machine-generated text from human-authored content becomes
important. Prior works have proposed numerous schemes to watermark text, which
would benefit from a systematic evaluation framework. This work focuses on text
watermarking techniques - as opposed to image watermarks - and proposes
MARKMYWORDS, a comprehensive benchmark for them under different tasks as well
as practical attacks. We focus on three main metrics: quality, size (e.g. the
number of tokens needed to detect a watermark), and tamper-resistance. Current
watermarking techniques are good enough to be deployed: Kirchenbauer et al. [1]
can watermark Llama2-7B-chat with no perceivable loss in quality, the watermark
can be detected with fewer than 100 tokens, and the scheme offers good
tamper-resistance to simple attacks. We argue that watermark
indistinguishability, a criteria emphasized in some prior works, is too strong
a requirement: schemes that slightly modify logit distributions outperform
their indistinguishable counterparts with no noticeable loss in generation
quality. We publicly release our benchmark

<p>We introduce X-Adapter, a universal upgrader to enable the pretrained
plug-and-play modules (e.g., ControlNet, LoRA) to work directly with the
upgraded text-to-image diffusion model (e.g., SDXL) without further retraining.
We achieve this goal by training an additional network to control the frozen
upgraded model with the new text-image data pairs. In detail, X-Adapter keeps a
frozen copy of the old model to preserve the connectors of different plugins.
Additionally, X-Adapter adds trainable mapping layers that bridge the decoders
from models of different versions for feature remapping. The remapped features
will be used as guidance for the upgraded model. To enhance the guidance
ability of X-Adapter, we employ a null-text training strategy for the upgraded
model. After training, we also introduce a two-stage denoising strategy to
align the initial latents of X-Adapter and the upgraded model. Thanks to our
strategies, X-Adapter demonstrates universal compatibility with various plugins
and also enables plugins of different versions to work together, thereby
expanding the functionalities of diffusion community. To verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments and the
results show that X-Adapter may facilitate wider application in the upgraded
foundational diffusion model.

<p>Training on multiple modalities of input can augment the capabilities of a
language model. Here, we ask whether such a training regime can improve the
quality and efficiency of these systems as well. We focus on text--audio and
introduce Whisbert, which is inspired by the text--image approach of FLAVA
(Singh et al., 2022). In accordance with Babylm guidelines (Warstadt et al.,
2023), we pretrain Whisbert on a dataset comprising only 100 million words plus
their corresponding speech from the word-aligned version of the People's Speech
dataset (Galvez et al., 2021). To assess the impact of multimodality, we
compare versions of the model that are trained on text only and on both audio
and text simultaneously. We find that while Whisbert is able to perform well on
multimodal masked modeling and surpasses the Babylm baselines in most benchmark
tasks, it struggles to optimize its complex objective and outperform its
text-only Whisbert baseline.

<p>We argue that many general evaluation problems can be viewed through the lens
of voting theory. Each task is interpreted as a separate voter, which requires
only ordinal rankings or pairwise comparisons of agents to produce an overall
evaluation. By viewing the aggregator as a social welfare function, we are able
to leverage centuries of research in social choice theory to derive principled
evaluation frameworks with axiomatic foundations. These evaluations are
interpretable and flexible, while avoiding many of the problems currently
facing cross-task evaluation. We apply this Voting-as-Evaluation (VasE)
framework across multiple settings, including reinforcement learning, large
language models, and humans. In practice, we observe that VasE can be more
robust than popular evaluation frameworks (Elo and Nash averaging), discovers
properties in the evaluation data not evident from scores alone, and can
predict outcomes better than Elo in a complex seven-player game. We identify
one particular approach, maximal lotteries, that satisfies important
consistency properties relevant to evaluation, is computationally efficient
(polynomial in the size of the evaluation data), and identifies game-theoretic
cycles.

<p>Despite significant advancements in network-based image harmonization
techniques, there still exists a domain disparity between typical training
pairs and real-world composites encountered during inference. Most existing
methods are trained to reverse global edits made on segmented image regions,
which fail to accurately capture the lighting inconsistencies between the
foreground and background found in composited images. In this work, we
introduce a self-supervised illumination harmonization approach formulated in
the intrinsic image domain. First, we estimate a simple global lighting model
from mid-level vision representations to generate a rough shading for the
foreground region. A network then refines this inferred shading to generate a
harmonious re-shading that aligns with the background scene. In order to match
the color appearance of the foreground and background, we utilize ideas from
prior harmonization approaches to perform parameterized image edits in the
albedo domain. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we present
results from challenging real-world composites and conduct a user study to
objectively measure the enhanced realism achieved compared to state-of-the-art
harmonization methods.
