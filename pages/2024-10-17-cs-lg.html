<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiyam Lin, Benjamin Joachimi, Jason D. McEwen</p>
<p>Abstract: We demonstrate the first successful use of scattering representations without further compression for simulation-based inference (SBI) with images (i.e. field-level), illustrated with a cosmological case study. Scattering representations provide a highly effective representational space for subsequent learning tasks, although the higher dimensional compressed space introduces challenges. We overcome these through spatial averaging, coupled with more expressive density estimators. Compared to alternative methods, such an approach does not require additional simulations for either training or computing derivatives, is interpretable, and resilient to covariate shift. As expected, we show that a scattering only approach extracts more information than traditional second order summary statistics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moirangthem Tiken Singh, Rabinder Kumar Prasad, Gurumayum Robert Michael, N. Hemarjit Singh, N. K. Kaphungkui</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: This paper aims to enhance bearing fault diagnosis in industrial machinery by introducing a novel method that combines Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This approach captures both spatial and temporal dependencies within sensor data, improving the accuracy of bearing fault detection under various conditions. Methodology: The proposed method converts time series sensor data into graph representations. GAT captures spatial relationships between components, while LSTM models temporal patterns. The model is validated using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Dataset, which includes data under different horsepower levels and both normal and faulty conditions. Its performance is compared with methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest (IForest) and GNN-based method for bearing fault detection (GNNBFD). Findings: The model achieved outstanding results, with precision, recall, and F1-scores reaching 100\% across various testing conditions. It not only identifies faults accurately but also generalizes effectively across different operational scenarios, outperforming traditional methods. Originality: This research presents a unique combination of GAT and LSTM for fault detection, overcoming the limitations of traditional time series methods by capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Its superior performance demonstrates significant potential for predictive maintenance in industrial applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengfei Lyu, Jindong Han, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Nuclear radiation (NR), which refers to the energy emitted from atomic nuclei during decay, poses substantial risks to human health and environmental safety. Accurate forecasting of nuclear radiation levels is crucial for informed decision-making by both individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, an innovative framework tailored for national-wide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against seven baselines. This research not only enhances the accuracy and reliability in nuclear radiation forecasting but also contributes to advancing emergency response strategies and monitoring systems, thereby safeguarding environmental and public health.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Enouen, Mahito Sugiyama</p>
<p>Abstract: The log-linear model has received a significant amount of theoretical attention in previous decades and remains the fundamental tool used for learning probability distributions over discrete variables. Despite its large popularity in statistical mechanics and high-dimensional statistics, the vast majority of such energy-based modeling approaches only focus on the two-variable relationships, such as Boltzmann machines and Markov graphical models. Although these approaches have easier-to-solve structure learning problems and easier-to-optimize parametric distributions, they often ignore the rich structure which exists in the higher-order interactions between different variables. Using more recent tools from the field of information geometry, we revisit the classical formulation of the log-linear model with a focus on higher-order mode interactions, going beyond the 1-body modes of independent distributions and the 2-body modes of Boltzmann distributions. This perspective allows us to define a complete decomposition of the KL error. This then motivates the formulation of a sparse selection problem over the set of possible mode interactions. In the same way as sparse graph selection allows for better generalization, we find that our learned distributions are able to more efficiently use the finite amount of data which is available in practice. On both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in maximizing the log-likelihood for the generative task and also the ease of adaptability to the discriminative task of classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Risheek Garrepalli, Shweta Mahajan, Munawar Hayat, Fatih Porikli</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generative modeling (e.g., text-to-image) but sampling requires multiple denoising network passes, limiting practicality. Efforts such as progressive distillation or consistency distillation have shown promise by reducing the number of passes at the expense of quality of the generated samples. In this work we identify co-variate shift as one of reason for poor performance of multi-step distilled models from compounding error at inference time. To address co-variate shift, we formulate diffusion distillation within imitation learning (DDIL) framework and enhance training distribution for distilling diffusion models on both data distribution (forward diffusion) and student induced distributions (backward diffusion). Training on data distribution helps to diversify the generations by preserving marginal data distribution and training on student distribution addresses compounding error by correcting covariate shift. In addition, we adopt reflected diffusion formulation for distillation and demonstrate improved performance, stable training across different distillation methods. We show that DDIL consistency improves on baseline algorithms of progressive distillation (PD), Latent consistency models (LCM) and Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD2).</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11986">Age-of-Gradient Updates for Federated Learning over Random Access Channels</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Heng Wu, Houman Asgari, Stefano Rini, Andrea Munari</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of federated training of a deep neural network (DNN) over a random access channel (RACH) such as in computer networks, wireless networks, and cellular systems. More precisely, a set of remote users participate in training a centralized DNN model using SGD under the coordination of a parameter server (PS). The local model updates are transmitted from the remote users to the PS over a RACH using a slotted ALOHA protocol. The PS collects the updates from the remote users, accumulates them, and sends central model updates to the users at regular time intervals. We refer to this setting as the RACH-FL setting. The RACH-FL setting crucially addresses the problem of jointly designing a (i) client selection and (ii) gradient compression strategy which addresses the communication constraints between the remote users and the PS when transmission occurs over a RACH. For the RACH-FL setting, we propose a policy, which we term the ''age-of-gradient'' (AoG) policy in which (i) gradient sparsification is performed using top-K sparsification, (ii) the error correction is performed using memory accumulation, and (iii) the slot transmission probability is obtained by comparing the current local memory magnitude minus the magnitude of the gradient update to a threshold. Intuitively, the AoG measure of ''freshness'' of the memory state is reminiscent of the concept of age-of-information (AoI) in the context of communication theory and provides a rather natural interpretation of this policy. Numerical simulations show the superior performance of the AoG policy as compared to other RACH-FL policies.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12010">Bias Similarity Across Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyejun Jeong, Shiqing Ma, Amir Houmansadr</p>
<p>Abstract: Bias in machine learning models has been a chronic problem, especially as these models influence decision-making in human society. In generative AI, such as Large Language Models, the impact of bias is even more profound compared to the classification models. LLMs produce realistic and human-like content that users may unconsciously trust, which could perpetuate harmful stereotypes to the uncontrolled public. It becomes particularly concerning when utilized in journalism or education. While prior studies have explored and quantified bias in individual AI models, no work has yet compared bias similarity across different LLMs. To fill this gap, we take a comprehensive look at ten open- and closed-source LLMs from four model families, assessing the extent of biases through output distribution. Using two datasets-one containing 4k questions and another with one million questions for each of the four bias dimensions -- we measure functional similarity to understand how biases manifest across models. Our findings reveal that 1) fine-tuning does not significantly alter output distributions, which would limit its ability to mitigate bias, 2) LLMs within the same family tree do not produce similar output distributions, implying that addressing bias in one model could have limited implications for others in the same family, and 3) there is a possible risk of training data information leakage, raising concerns about privacy and data security. Our analysis provides insight into LLM behavior and highlights potential risks in real-world deployment.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12025">Geometric Inductive Biases of Deep Networks: The Role of Data and Architecture</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sajad Movahedi, Antonio Orvieto, Seyed-Mohsen Moosavi-Dezfooli</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose the $\textit{geometric invariance hypothesis (GIH)}$, which argues that when training a neural network, the input space curvature remains invariant under transformation in certain directions determined by its architecture. Starting with a simple non-linear binary classification problem residing on a plane in a high dimensional space, we observe that while an MLP can solve this problem regardless of the orientation of the plane, this is not the case for a ResNet. Motivated by this example, we define two maps that provide a compact $\textit{architecture-dependent}$ summary of the input space geometry of a neural network and its evolution during training, which we dub the $\textbf{average geometry}$ and $\textbf{average geometry evolution}$, respectively. By investigating average geometry evolution at initialization, we discover that the geometry of a neural network evolves according to the projection of data covariance onto average geometry. As a result, in cases where the average geometry is low-rank (such as in a ResNet), the geometry only changes in a subset of the input space. This causes an architecture-dependent invariance property in input-space curvature, which we dub GIH. Finally, we present extensive experimental results to observe the consequences of GIH and how it relates to generalization in neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shriyank Somvanshi, Subasish Das, Syed Aaqib Javed, Gian Antariksa, Ahmed Hossain</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data, widely used in industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation, presents unique challenges for deep learning due to its heterogeneous nature and lack of spatial structure. This survey reviews the evolution of deep learning models for tabular data, from early fully connected networks (FCNs) to advanced architectures like TabNet, SAINT, TabTranSELU, and MambaNet. These models incorporate attention mechanisms, feature embeddings, and hybrid architectures to address tabular data complexities. TabNet uses sequential attention for instance-wise feature selection, improving interpretability, while SAINT combines self-attention and intersample attention to capture complex interactions across features and data points, both advancing scalability and reducing computational overhead. Hybrid architectures such as TabTransformer and FT-Transformer integrate attention mechanisms with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to handle categorical and numerical data, with FT-Transformer adapting transformers for tabular datasets. Research continues to balance performance and efficiency for large datasets. Graph-based models like GNN4TDL and GANDALF combine neural networks with decision trees or graph structures, enhancing feature representation and mitigating overfitting in small datasets through advanced regularization techniques. Diffusion-based models like the Tabular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (TabDDPM) generate synthetic data to address data scarcity, improving model robustness. Similarly, models like TabPFN and Ptab leverage pre-trained language models, incorporating transfer learning and self-supervised techniques into tabular tasks. This survey highlights key advancements and outlines future research directions on scalability, generalization, and interpretability in diverse tabular data applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the standard for evaluating the effectiveness of clinical interventions. To address the limitations of RCTs on real-world populations, we developed a methodology that uses a large observational electronic health record (EHR) dataset. Principles of regression discontinuity (rd) were used to derive randomized data subsets to test expert-driven interventions using dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) do-operations. This combined method was applied to a chronic kidney disease (CKD) cohort of more than two million individuals and used to understand the associational and causal relationships of CKD variables with respect to a surrogate outcome of >=40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The associational and causal analyses depicted similar findings across DBNs from two independent healthcare systems. The associational analysis showed that the most influential variables were eGFR, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and pulse pressure, whereas the causal analysis showed eGFR as the most influential variable, followed by modifiable factors such as medications that may impact kidney function over time. This methodology demonstrates how real-world EHR data can be used to provide population-level insights to inform improved healthcare delivery.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12076">Taking off the Rose-Tinted Glasses: A Critical Look at Adversarial ML Through the Lens of Evasion Attacks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Eykholt, Farhan Ahmed, Pratik Vaishnavi, Amir Rahmati</p>
<p>Abstract: The vulnerability of machine learning models in adversarial scenarios has garnered significant interest in the academic community over the past decade, resulting in a myriad of attacks and defenses. However, while the community appears to be overtly successful in devising new attacks across new contexts, the development of defenses has stalled. After a decade of research, we appear no closer to securing AI applications beyond additional training. Despite a lack of effective mitigations, AI development and its incorporation into existing systems charge full speed ahead with the rise of generative AI and large language models. Will our ineffectiveness in developing solutions to adversarial threats further extend to these new technologies?
  In this paper, we argue that overly permissive attack and overly restrictive defensive threat models have hampered defense development in the ML domain. Through the lens of adversarial evasion attacks against neural networks, we critically examine common attack assumptions, such as the ability to bypass any defense not explicitly built into the model. We argue that these flawed assumptions, seen as reasonable by the community based on paper acceptance, have encouraged the development of adversarial attacks that map poorly to real-world scenarios. In turn, new defenses evaluated against these very attacks are inadvertently required to be almost perfect and incorporated as part of the model. But do they need to? In practice, machine learning models are deployed as a small component of a larger system. We analyze adversarial machine learning from a system security perspective rather than an AI perspective and its implications for emerging AI paradigms.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12086">Comparative Performance of Collaborative Bandit Algorithms: Effect of Sparsity and Exploration Intensity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eren Ozbay</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of collaborative bandit algorithms and provides a thorough comparison of their performance. Collaborative bandits aim to improve the performance of contextual bandits by introducing relationships between arms (or items), allowing effective propagation of information. Collaboration among arms allows the feedback obtained through a single user (item) to be shared across related users (items). Introducing collaboration also alleviates the cold user (item) problem, i.e., lack of historical information when a new user (item) arriving to the platform with no prior record of interactions. In the context of modeling the relationships between arms (items), there are two main approaches: Hard and soft clustering. We call approaches that model the relationship between arms in an \textit{absolute} manner as hard clustering, i.e., the relationship is binary. Soft clustering relaxes membership constraints, allowing \textit{fuzzy} assignment. Focusing on the latter, we provide extensive experiments on the state-of-the-art collaborative contextual bandit algorithms and investigate the effect of sparsity and how the exploration intensity acts as a correction mechanism. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that controlling for sparsity in collaboration improves data efficiency and performance as it better informs learning. Meanwhile, increasing the exploration intensity acts as a correction because it effectively reduces variance due to potentially misspecified relationships among users. We observe that this misspecification is further remedied by introducing latent factors, and thus, increasing the dimensionality of the bandit parameters.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12096">Bridging Large Language Models and Graph Structure Learning Models for Robust Representation Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangxin Su, Yifan Zhu, Wenjie Zhang, Hanchen Wang, Ying Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning, involving both node features and graph structures, is crucial for real-world applications but often encounters pervasive noise. State-of-the-art methods typically address noise by focusing separately on node features with large language models (LLMs) and on graph structures with graph structure learning models (GSLMs). In this paper, we introduce LangGSL, a robust framework that integrates the complementary strengths of pre-trained language models and GSLMs to jointly enhance both node feature and graph structure learning. In LangGSL, we first leverage LLMs to filter noise in the raw data and extract valuable cleaned information as features, enhancing the synergy of downstream models. During the mutual learning phase in LangGSL, the core idea is to leverage the relatively small language model (LM) to process local attributes and generate reliable pseudo-labels and informative node embeddings, which are then integrated into the GSLM's prediction phase. This approach enriches the global context and enhances overall performance. Meanwhile, GSLM refines the evolving graph structure constructed from the LM's output, offering updated labels back to the LM as additional guidance, thus facilitating a more effective mutual learning process. The LM and GSLM work synergistically, complementing each other's strengths and offsetting weaknesses within a variational information-maximizing framework, resulting in enhanced node features and a more robust graph structure. Extensive experiments on diverse graph datasets of varying scales and across different task scenarios demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12101">The Persian Rug: solving toy models of superposition using large-scale symmetries</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Cowsik, Kfir Dolev, Alex Infanger</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a complete mechanistic description of the algorithm learned by a minimal non-linear sparse data autoencoder in the limit of large input dimension. The model, originally presented in arXiv:2209.10652, compresses sparse data vectors through a linear layer and decompresses using another linear layer followed by a ReLU activation. We notice that when the data is permutation symmetric (no input feature is privileged) large models reliably learn an algorithm that is sensitive to individual weights only through their large-scale statistics. For these models, the loss function becomes analytically tractable. Using this understanding, we give the explicit scalings of the loss at high sparsity, and show that the model is near-optimal among recently proposed architectures. In particular, changing or adding to the activation function any elementwise or filtering operation can at best improve the model's performance by a constant factor. Finally, we forward-engineer a model with the requisite symmetries and show that its loss precisely matches that of the trained models. Unlike the trained model weights, the low randomness in the artificial weights results in miraculous fractal structures resembling a Persian rug, to which the algorithm is oblivious. Our work contributes to neural network interpretability by introducing techniques for understanding the structure of autoencoders.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifei Xu, Alexander Lan, Wanzin Yazar, Tristan Webb, Sayeh Sharify, Xin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalization abilities of well-trained large language models (LLMs) are known to scale predictably as a function of model size. In contrast to the existence of practical scaling laws governing pre-training, the quality of LLMs after post-training compression remains highly unpredictable, often requiring case-by-case validation in practice. In this work, we attempted to close this gap for post-training weight quantization of LLMs by conducting a systematic empirical study on multiple LLM families quantized to numerous low-precision tensor data types using popular weight quantization techniques. We identified key scaling factors pertaining to characteristics of the local loss landscape, based on which the performance of quantized LLMs can be reasonably well predicted by a statistical model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, have been driven by extensive pretraining on large datasets followed by post-training. However, current post-training methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct alignment from preference methods (DAP) primarily utilize single-sample comparisons. These approaches often fail to capture critical characteristics such as generative diversity and bias, which are more accurately assessed through multiple samples. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that extends post-training to include multi-sample comparisons. To achieve this, we propose Multi-sample Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) and Multi-sample Identity Preference Optimization (mIPO). These methods improve traditional DAP methods by focusing on group-wise characteristics. Empirically, we demonstrate that multi-sample comparison is more effective in optimizing collective characteristics~(e.g., diversity and bias) for generative models than single-sample comparison. Additionally, our findings suggest that multi-sample comparisons provide a more robust optimization framework, particularly for dataset with label noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gihan Panapitiya, Peiyuan Gao, C Mark Maupin, Emily G Saldanha</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial step in many modern-day scientific applications including drug discovery and energy storage material design. Despite the availability of numerous machine learning models for this task, we are lacking in models that provide both high accuracies and interpretability of the predictions. We introduce the FragNet architecture, a graph neural network not only capable of achieving prediction accuracies comparable to the current state-of-the-art models, but also able to provide insight on four levels of molecular substructures. This model enables understanding of which atoms, bonds, molecular fragments, and molecular fragment connections are critical in the prediction of a given molecular property. The ability to interpret the importance of connections between fragments is of particular interest for molecules which have substructures that are not connected with regular covalent bonds. The interpretable capabilities of FragNet are key to gaining scientific insights from the model's learned patterns between molecular structure and molecular properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Liang, Weishan Ye, Qile Liu, Li Zhang, Gan Huang, Yongjie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a serious threat to the physical and mental health of adolescents, significantly increasing the risk of suicide and attracting widespread public concern. Electroencephalography (EEG), as an objective tool for identifying brain disorders, holds great promise. However, extracting meaningful and reliable features from high-dimensional EEG data, especially by integrating spatiotemporal brain dynamics into informative representations, remains a major challenge. In this study, we introduce an advanced semi-supervised adversarial network, NSSI-Net, to effectively model EEG features related to NSSI. NSSI-Net consists of two key modules: a spatial-temporal feature extraction module and a multi-concept discriminator. In the spatial-temporal feature extraction module, an integrated 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) and a bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) are used to capture both spatial and temporal dynamics in EEG data. In the multi-concept discriminator, signal, gender, domain, and disease levels are fully explored to extract meaningful EEG features, considering individual, demographic, disease variations across a diverse population. Based on self-collected NSSI data (n=114), the model's effectiveness and reliability are demonstrated, with a 7.44% improvement in performance compared to existing machine learning and deep learning methods. This study advances the understanding and early diagnosis of NSSI in adolescents with depression, enabling timely intervention.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansong Li, Zeyu Dong, Ertai Luo, Yu Wu, Shuo Wu, Shuo Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be divided into two classes: model-free algorithms, which are sample-inefficient, and model-based algorithms, which suffer from model bias. Dyna-style algorithms combine these two approaches by using simulated data from an estimated environmental model to accelerate model-free training. However, their efficiency is compromised when the estimated model is inaccurate. Previous works address this issue by using model ensembles or pretraining the estimated model with data collected from the real environment, increasing computational and sample complexity. To tackle this issue, we introduce an out-of-distribution (OOD) data filter that removes simulated data from the estimated model that significantly diverges from data collected in the real environment. We show theoretically that this technique enhances the quality of simulated data. With the help of the OOD data filter, the data simulated from the estimated model better mimics the data collected by interacting with the real model. This improvement is evident in the critic updates compared to using the simulated data without the OOD data filter. Our experiment integrates the data filter into the model-based policy optimization (MBPO) algorithm. The results demonstrate that our method requires fewer interactions with the real environment to achieve a higher level of optimality than MBPO, even without a model ensemble.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tales H. Carvalho, Kenneth Tjhia, Levi H. S. Lelis</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have introduced LEAPS and HPRL, systems that learn latent spaces of domain-specific languages, which are used to define programmatic policies for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). These systems induce a latent space while optimizing losses such as the behavior loss, which aim to achieve locality in program behavior, meaning that vectors close in the latent space should correspond to similarly behaving programs. In this paper, we show that the programmatic space, induced by the domain-specific language and requiring no training, presents values for the behavior loss similar to those observed in latent spaces presented in previous work. Moreover, algorithms searching in the programmatic space significantly outperform those in LEAPS and HPRL. To explain our results, we measured the "friendliness" of the two spaces to local search algorithms. We discovered that algorithms are more likely to stop at local maxima when searching in the latent space than when searching in the programmatic space. This implies that the optimization topology of the programmatic space, induced by the reward function in conjunction with the neighborhood function, is more conducive to search than that of the latent space. This result provides an explanation for the superior performance in the programmatic space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan-Bach Le, Dominik Wagner, Leon Witzman, Alexander Rabinovich, Luke Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) and, more generally, $\omega$-regular objectives are alternatives to the traditional discount sum and average reward objectives in reinforcement learning (RL), offering the advantage of greater comprehensibility and hence explainability. In this work, we study the relationship between these objectives. Our main result is that each RL problem for $\omega$-regular objectives can be reduced to a limit-average reward problem in an optimality-preserving fashion, via (finite-memory) reward machines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by showing that optimal policies for limit-average problems can be found asymptotically by solving a sequence of discount-sum problems approximately. Consequently, we resolve an open problem: optimal policies for LTL and $\omega$-regular objectives can be learned asymptotically.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinran Liu, Roc\'io D\'iaz Mart\'in, Yikun Bai, Ashkan Shahbazi, Matthew Thorpe, Akram Aldroubi, Soheil Kolouri</p>
<p>Abstract: The optimal transport (OT) problem has gained significant traction in modern machine learning for its ability to: (1) provide versatile metrics, such as Wasserstein distances and their variants, and (2) determine optimal couplings between probability measures. To reduce the computational complexity of OT solvers, methods like entropic regularization and sliced optimal transport have been proposed. The sliced OT framework improves efficiency by comparing one-dimensional projections (slices) of high-dimensional distributions. However, despite their computational efficiency, sliced-Wasserstein approaches lack a transportation plan between the input measures, limiting their use in scenarios requiring explicit coupling. In this paper, we address two key questions: Can a transportation plan be constructed between two probability measures using the sliced transport framework? If so, can this plan be used to define a metric between the measures? We propose a "lifting" operation to extend one-dimensional optimal transport plans back to the original space of the measures. By computing the expectation of these lifted plans, we derive a new transportation plan, termed expected sliced transport (EST) plans. We prove that using the EST plan to weight the sum of the individual Euclidean costs for moving from one point to another results in a valid metric between the input discrete probability measures. We demonstrate the connection between our approach and the recently proposed min-SWGG, along with illustrative numerical examples that support our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihang Liu, Yuanzhe Hu, Tianyu Pang, Yefan Zhou, Pu Ren, Yaoqing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have emphasized the need to align pre-trained models with specialized domains using small, curated datasets. Studies on these foundation models underscore the importance of low-data training and fine-tuning. This topic, well-known in natural language processing (NLP), has also gained increasing attention in the emerging field of scientific machine learning (SciML). To address the limitations of low-data training and fine-tuning, we draw inspiration from Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, analyzing the shape of empirical spectral densities (ESDs) and revealing an imbalance in training quality across different model layers. To mitigate this issue, we adapt a recently proposed layer-wise learning rate scheduler, TempBalance, which effectively balances training quality across layers and enhances low-data training and fine-tuning for both NLP and SciML tasks. Notably, TempBalance demonstrates increasing performance gains as the amount of available tuning data decreases. Comparative analyses further highlight the effectiveness of TempBalance and its adaptability as an "add-on" method for improving model performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12184">ExoTST: Exogenous-Aware Temporal Sequence Transformer for Time Series Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kshitij Tayal, Arvind Renganathan, Xiaowei Jia, Vipin Kumar, Dan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate long-term predictions are the foundations for many machine learning applications and decision-making processes. Traditional time series approaches for prediction often focus on either autoregressive modeling, which relies solely on past observations of the target ``endogenous variables'', or forward modeling, which considers only current covariate drivers ``exogenous variables''. However, effectively integrating past endogenous and past exogenous with current exogenous variables remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ExoTST, a novel transformer-based framework that effectively incorporates current exogenous variables alongside past context for improved time series prediction. To integrate exogenous information efficiently, ExoTST leverages the strengths of attention mechanisms and introduces a novel cross-temporal modality fusion module. This module enables the model to jointly learn from both past and current exogenous series, treating them as distinct modalities. By considering these series separately, ExoTST provides robustness and flexibility in handling data uncertainties that arise from the inherent distribution shift between historical and current exogenous variables. Extensive experiments on real-world carbon flux datasets and time series benchmarks demonstrate ExoTST's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 10\% in prediction accuracy. Moreover, ExoTST exhibits strong robustness against missing values and noise in exogenous drivers, maintaining consistent performance in real-world situations where these imperfections are common.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingsong Luo, Ling Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in various tasks but face deployment challenges due to hardware constraints. We propose density-aware post-training weight-only quantization (DAQ), which has two stages: 1) density-centric alignment, which identifies the center of high-density weights and centers the dynamic range on this point to align high-density weight regions with floating-point high-precision regions; 2) learnable dynamic range adjustment, which adjusts the dynamic range by optimizing quantization parameters (i.e., scale and zero-point) based on the impact of weights on the model output. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 show that DAQ consistently outperforms the best baseline method, reducing perplexity loss by an average of 22.8% on LLaMA and 19.6% on LLaMA-2.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grant C. Forbes, Leonardo Villalobos-Arias, Jianxun Wang, Arnav Jhala, David L. Roberts</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently there has been a proliferation of intrinsic motivation (IM) reward-shaping methods to learn in complex and sparse-reward environments. These methods can often inadvertently change the set of optimal policies in an environment, leading to suboptimal behavior. Previous work on mitigating the risks of reward shaping, particularly through potential-based reward shaping (PBRS), has not been applicable to many IM methods, as they are often complex, trainable functions themselves, and therefore dependent on a wider set of variables than the traditional reward functions that PBRS was developed for. We present an extension to PBRS that we prove preserves the set of optimal policies under a more general set of functions than has been previously proven. We also present {\em Potential-Based Intrinsic Motivation} (PBIM) and {\em Generalized Reward Matching} (GRM), methods for converting IM rewards into a potential-based form that are useable without altering the set of optimal policies. Testing in the MiniGrid DoorKey and Cliff Walking environments, we demonstrate that PBIM and GRM successfully prevent the agent from converging to a suboptimal policy and can speed up training. Additionally, we prove that GRM is sufficiently general as to encompass all potential-based reward shaping functions. This paper expands on previous work introducing the PBIM method, and provides an extension to the more general method of GRM, as well as additional proofs, experimental results, and discussion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghao Qin, Jianliang He, Bowen Gang, Yin Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of uncertainty sets has diverse applications but also presents challenges, particularly when only initial sets and their control levels are available, along with potential dependencies. Examples include merging confidence sets from different distributed sites with communication constraints, as well as combining conformal prediction sets generated by different learning algorithms or data splits. In this article, we introduce an efficient and flexible Synthetic, Aggregation, and Test inversion (SAT) approach to merge various potentially dependent uncertainty sets into a single set. The proposed method constructs a novel class of synthetic test statistics, aggregates them, and then derives merged sets through test inversion. Our approach leverages the duality between set estimation and hypothesis testing, ensuring reliable coverage in dependent scenarios. The procedure is data-light, meaning it relies solely on initial sets and control levels without requiring raw data, and it adapts to any user-specified initial uncertainty sets, accommodating potentially varying coverage levels. Theoretical analyses and numerical experiments confirm that SAT provides finite-sample coverage guarantees and achieves small set sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sinong Zhao, Wenrui Wang, Hongzuo Xu, Zhaoyang Yu, Qingsong Wen, Gang Wang, xiaoguang Liu, Guansong Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying anomalies from time series data plays an important role in various fields such as infrastructure security, intelligent operation and maintenance, and space exploration. Current research focuses on detecting the anomalies after they occur, which can lead to significant financial/reputation loss or infrastructure damage. In this work we instead study a more practical yet very challenging problem, time series anomaly prediction, aiming at providing early warnings for abnormal events before their occurrence. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel principled approach, namely future context modeling (FCM). Its key insight is that the future abnormal events in a target window can be accurately predicted if their preceding observation window exhibits any subtle difference to normal data. To effectively capture such differences, FCM first leverages long-term forecasting models to generate a discriminative future context based on the observation data, aiming to amplify those subtle but unusual difference. It then models a normality correlation of the observation data with the forecasting future context to complement the normality modeling of the observation data in foreseeing possible abnormality in the target window. A joint variate-time attention learning is also introduced in FCM to leverage both temporal signals and features of the time series data for more discriminative normality modeling in the aforementioned two views. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that FCM gains good recall rate (70\%+) on multiple datasets and significantly outperforms all baselines in F1 score.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongxin Shen, Yanyong Huang, Minbo Ma, Tianrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) has recently gained attention for its effectiveness in processing unlabeled high-dimensional data. However, existing methods overlook the intrinsic causal mechanisms within the data, resulting in the selection of irrelevant features and poor interpretability. Additionally, previous graph-based methods fail to account for the differing impacts of non-causal and causal features in constructing the similarity graph, which leads to false links in the generated graph. To address these issues, a novel UFS method, called Causally-Aware UnSupErvised Feature Selection learning (CAUSE-FS), is proposed. CAUSE-FS introduces a novel causal regularizer that reweights samples to balance the confounding distribution of each treatment feature. This regularizer is subsequently integrated into a generalized unsupervised spectral regression model to mitigate spurious associations between features and clustering labels, thus achieving causal feature selection. Furthermore, CAUSE-FS employs causality-guided hierarchical clustering to partition features with varying causal contributions into multiple granularities. By integrating similarity graphs learned adaptively at different granularities, CAUSE-FS increases the importance of causal features when constructing the fused similarity graph to capture the reliable local structure of data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CAUSE-FS over state-of-the-art methods, with its interpretability further validated through feature visualization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Chen, Kaiyan Zhao, Yiming Wang, Ming Yang, Jian Zhang, Xiaoguang Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays transformer-based Large Language Models (LLM) for code generation tasks usually apply sampling and filtering pipelines. Due to the sparse reward problem in code generation tasks caused by one-token incorrectness, transformer-based models will sample redundant programs till they find a correct one, leading to low efficiency. To overcome the challenge, we incorporate Experience Replay (ER) in the fine-tuning phase, where codes and programs produced are stored and will be replayed to give the LLM agent a chance to learn from past experiences. Based on the spirit of ER, we introduce a novel approach called BTP pipeline which consists of three phases: beam search sampling, testing phase, and prioritized experience replay phase. The approach makes use of failed programs collected by code models and replays programs with high Possibility and Pass-rate Prioritized value (P2Value) from the replay buffer to improve efficiency. P2Value comprehensively considers the possibility of transformers' output and pass rate and can make use of the redundant resources caused by the problem that most programs collected by LLMs fail to pass any tests. We empirically apply our approach in several LLMs, demonstrating that it enhances their performance in code generation tasks and surpasses existing baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative to interactive data acquisition by leveraging pre-existing datasets. However, its effectiveness hinges on the quantity and quality of the data samples. This work explores the use of more readily available, albeit off-dynamics datasets, to address the challenge of data scarcity in Offline RL. We propose a novel approach using conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) to learn the joint distribution of the large-scale off-dynamics dataset and the limited target dataset. To enable the model to capture the underlying dynamics structure, we introduce two contexts for the conditional model: (1) a continuous dynamics score allows for partial overlap between trajectories from both datasets, providing the model with richer information; (2) an inverse-dynamics context guides the model to generate trajectories that adhere to the target environment's dynamic constraints. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several strong baselines. Ablation studies further reveal the critical role of each dynamics context. Additionally, our model demonstrates that by modifying the context, we can interpolate between source and target dynamics, making it more robust to subtle shifts in the environment.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of efficient surrogates of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a critical step towards scalable modeling of complex, multiscale systems-of-systems. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained popularity as the basis for such surrogate models due to their success in capturing high-dimensional input-output mappings and the negligible cost of a forward pass. However, the high cost of generating training data -- typically via classical numerical solvers -- raises the question of whether these models are worth pursuing over more straightforward alternatives with well-established theoretical foundations, such as Monte Carlo methods. To reduce the cost of data generation, we propose training a CNN surrogate model on a mixture of numerical solutions to both the $d$-dimensional problem and its ($d-1$)-dimensional approximation, taking advantage of the efficiency savings guaranteed by the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate our approach on a multiphase flow test problem, using transfer learning to train a dense fully-convolutional encoder-decoder CNN on the two classes of data. Numerical results from a sample uncertainty quantification task demonstrate that our surrogate model outperforms Monte Carlo with several times the data generation budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangwei Nathan Zheng, Chang George Dong, Wei Emma Zhang, Xin Chen, Lin Yue, Weitong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) identification is a crucial aspect of pharmacology research. There are many DDI types (hundreds), and they are not evenly distributed with equal chance to occur. Some of the rarely occurred DDI types are often high risk and could be life-critical if overlooked, exemplifying the long-tailed distribution problem. Existing models falter against this distribution challenge and overlook the multi-faceted nature of drugs in DDI prediction. In this paper, a novel multi-modal deep learning-based framework, namely TFDM, is introduced to leverage multiple properties of a drug to achieve DDI classification. The proposed framework fuses multimodal features of drugs, including graph-based, molecular structure, Target and Enzyme, for DDI identification. To tackle the challenge posed by the distribution skewness across categories, a novel loss function called Tailed Focal Loss is introduced, aimed at further enhancing the model performance and address gradient vanishing problem of focal loss in extremely long-tailed dataset. Intensive experiments over 4 challenging long-tailed dataset demonstrate that the TFMD outperforms the most recent SOTA methods in long-tailed DDI classification tasks.

DAP uses a single policy to predict two sets of actions: one for maximizing task rewards in simulation and another specifically for domain adaptation via reward adjustments. This decoupling makes it easier to maximize the overall reward in the source domain during training. Additionally, DAP incorporates uncertainty-based exploration during training to enhance agent robustness. Experimental results demonstrate DAP's effectiveness in bridging the sim-to-real gap, outperforming baselines on challenging tasks in simulation, and further improvement is achieved by incorporating uncertainty estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Irregular Time Series Data (IRTS) has shown increasing prevalence in real-world applications. We observed that IRTS can be divided into two specialized types: Natural Irregular Time Series (NIRTS) and Accidental Irregular Time Series (AIRTS). Various existing methods either ignore the impacts of irregular patterns or statically learn the irregular dynamics of NIRTS and AIRTS data and suffer from limited data availability due to the sparsity of IRTS. We proposed a novel transformer-based framework for general irregular time series data that treats IRTS from four views: Locality, Time, Spatio and Irregularity to motivate the data usage to the highest potential. Moreover, we design a sophisticated irregularity-gate mechanism to adaptively select task-relevant information from irregularity, which improves the generalization ability to various IRTS data. We implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the resistance of our work to three highly missing ratio datasets (88.4\%, 94.9\%, 60\% missing value) and investigate the significance of the irregularity information for both NIRTS and AIRTS by additional ablation study. We release our implementation in https://github.com/IcurasLW/MTSFormer-Irregular_Time_Series.git</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanqi Yan, Huy Nguyen, Dung Le, Pedram Akbarian, Nhat Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: We conduct the convergence analysis of parameter estimation in the contaminated mixture of experts. This model is motivated from the prompt learning problem where ones utilize prompts, which can be formulated as experts, to fine-tune a large-scaled pre-trained model for learning downstream tasks. There are two fundamental challenges emerging from the analysis: (i) the proportion in the mixture of the pre-trained model and the prompt may converge to zero where the prompt vanishes during the training; (ii) the algebraic interaction among parameters of the pre-trained model and the prompt can occur via some partial differential equation and decelerate the prompt learning. In response, we introduce a distinguishability condition to control the previous parameter interaction. Additionally, we also consider various types of expert structures to understand their effects on the parameter estimation. In each scenario, we provide comprehensive convergence rates of parameter estimation along with the corresponding minimax lower bounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingjian Wu, Xiangfei Qiu, Zhengyu Li, Yihang Wang, Jilin Hu, Chenjuan Guo, Hui Xiong, Bin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is challenging as heterogeneous subsequence anomalies may occur. Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning nomral patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising resutls, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Djamel Bouchaffra, Fay\c{c}al Ykhlef, Bilal Faye, Hanane Azzag, Mustapha Lebbah</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel deep graphical representation that seamlessly merges principles of game theory with laws of statistical mechanics. It performs feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and pattern classification within a single learning framework. Our approach draws an analogy between neurons in a network and players in a game theory model. Furthermore, each neuron viewed as a classical particle (subject to statistical physics' laws) is mapped to a set of actions representing specific activation value, and neural network layers are conceptualized as games in a sequential cooperative game theory setting. The feed-forward process in deep learning is interpreted as a sequential game, where each game comprises a set of players. During training, neurons are iteratively evaluated and filtered based on their contributions to a payoff function, which is quantified using the Shapley value driven by an energy function. Each set of neurons that significantly contributes to the payoff function forms a strong coalition. These neurons are the only ones permitted to propagate the information forward to the next layers. We applied this methodology to the task of facial age estimation and gender classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network models in terms of efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasin Hasanpoor, Bahram Tarvirdizadeh, Khalil Alipour, Mohammad Ghamari</p>
<p>Abstract: Stress is one of the main issues of nowadays lifestyle. If it becomes chronic it can have adverse effects on the human body. Thus, the early detection of stress is crucial to prevent its hurting effects on the human body and have a healthier life. Stress can be assessed using physiological signals. To this end, Photoplethysmography (PPG) is one of the most favorable physiological signals for stress assessment. This research is focused on developing a novel technique to assess stressful events using raw PPG signals recorded by Empatica E4 sensor. To achieve this goal, an adaptive convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) has been utilized to realize the detection of stressful events. This research will use a dataset that is publicly available and named wearable stress and effect detection (WESAD). This dataset will be used to simulate the proposed model and to examine the advantages of the proposed developed model. The proposed model in this research will be able to distinguish between normal events and stressful events. This model will be able to detect stressful events with an accuracy of 96.7%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Surbhi Khetrapal, Jaswin Kasi</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving non-linear partial differential equations which exhibit chaotic dynamics is an important problem with a wide-range of applications such as predicting weather extremes and financial market risk. Fourier neural operators (FNOs) have been shown to be efficient in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work we demonstrate simulation of dynamics in the chaotic regime of the two-dimensional (2d) Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation using FNOs. Particularly, we analyze the effect of Fourier mode cutoff on the results obtained by using FNOs vs those obtained using traditional PDE solvers. We compare the outputs using metrics such as the 2d power spectrum and the radial power spectrum. In addition we propose the normalised error power spectrum which measures the percentage error in the FNO model outputs. We conclude that FNOs capture the dynamics in the chaotic regime of the 2d K-S equation, provided the Fourier mode cutoff is kept sufficiently high.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) and its variants are among the most celebrated algorithms in signal processing. These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model-agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation, and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task-oriented and SS model-oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study, whose code is publicly available, illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs. We also discuss existing challenges and future research directions that arise from fusing AI and Kalman-type algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Sch\"afer, Ulf Leser</p>
<p>Abstract: A leitmotif is a recurring theme in literature, movies or music that carries symbolic significance for the piece it is contained in. When this piece can be represented as a multi-dimensional time series (MDTS), such as acoustic or visual observations, finding a leitmotif is equivalent to the pattern discovery problem, which is an unsupervised and complex problem in time series analytics. Compared to the univariate case, it carries additional complexity because patterns typically do not occur in all dimensions but only in a few - which are, however, unknown and must be detected by the method itself. In this paper, we present the novel, efficient and highly effective leitmotif discovery algorithm LAMA for MDTS. LAMA rests on two core principals: (a) a leitmotif manifests solely given a yet unknown number of sub-dimensions - neither too few, nor too many, and (b) the set of sub-dimensions are not independent from the best pattern found therein, necessitating both problems to be approached in a joint manner. In contrast to most previous methods, LAMA tackles both problems jointly - instead of independently selecting dimensions (or leitmotifs) and finding the best leitmotifs (or dimensions). Our experimental evaluation on a novel ground-truth annotated benchmark of 14 distinct real-life data sets shows that LAMA, when compared to four state-of-the-art baselines, shows superior performance in detecting meaningful patterns without increased computational complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linwei Tao, Haolan Guo, Minjing Dong, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Calibration is crucial in deep learning applications, especially in fields like healthcare and autonomous driving, where accurate confidence estimates are vital for decision-making. However, deep neural networks often suffer from miscalibration, with reliability diagrams and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) being the only standard perspective for evaluating calibration performance. In this paper, we introduce the concept of consistency as an alternative perspective on model calibration, inspired by uncertainty estimation literature in large language models (LLMs). We highlight its advantages over the traditional reliability-based view. Building on this concept, we propose a post-hoc calibration method called Consistency Calibration (CC), which adjusts confidence based on the model's consistency across perturbed inputs. CC is particularly effective in locally uncertainty estimation, as it requires no additional data samples or label information, instead generating input perturbations directly from the source data. Moreover, we show that performing perturbations at the logit level significantly improves computational efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of CC through extensive comparisons with various post-hoc and training-time calibration methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, as well as on long-tailed datasets like ImageNet-LT.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new classifier, which integrates significance testing results over different random subspaces to yield consensus p-values for quantifying the uncertainty of classification decision. The null hypothesis is that the test sample has no association with the target class on a randomly chosen subspace, and hence the classification problem can be formulated as a problem of testing for the conjunction of hypotheses. The proposed classifier can be easily deployed for the purpose of conformal prediction and selective classification with reject and refine options by simply thresholding the consensus p-values. The theoretical analysis on the generalization error bound of the proposed classifier is provided and empirical studies on real data sets are conducted as well to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengpeng Li, Kemou Li, Haiwei Wu, Jinyu Tian, Jiantao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: To protect deep neural networks (DNNs) from adversarial attacks, adversarial training (AT) is developed by incorporating adversarial examples (AEs) into model training. Recent studies show that adversarial attacks disproportionately impact the patterns within the phase of the sample's frequency spectrum -- typically containing crucial semantic information -- more than those in the amplitude, resulting in the model's erroneous categorization of AEs. We find that, by mixing the amplitude of training samples' frequency spectrum with those of distractor images for AT, the model can be guided to focus on phase patterns unaffected by adversarial perturbations. As a result, the model's robustness can be improved. Unfortunately, it is still challenging to select appropriate distractor images, which should mix the amplitude without affecting the phase patterns. To this end, in this paper, we propose an optimized Adversarial Amplitude Generator (AAG) to achieve a better tradeoff between improving the model's robustness and retaining phase patterns. Based on this generator, together with an efficient AE production procedure, we design a new Dual Adversarial Training (DAT) strategy. Experiments on various datasets show that our proposed DAT leads to significantly improved robustness against diverse adversarial attacks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12316">TPFL: A Trustworthy Personalized Federated Learning Framework via Subjective Logic</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinqian Chen, Jihua Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. Despite its widespread adoption, most FL approaches focusing solely on privacy protection fall short in scenarios where trustworthiness is crucial, necessitating advancements in secure training, dependable decision-making mechanisms, robustness on corruptions, and enhanced performance with Non-IID data. To bridge this gap, we introduce Trustworthy Personalized Federated Learning (TPFL) framework designed for classification tasks via subjective logic in this paper. Specifically, TPFL adopts a unique approach by employing subjective logic to construct federated models, providing probabilistic decisions coupled with an assessment of uncertainty rather than mere probability assignments. By incorporating a trainable heterogeneity prior to the local training phase, TPFL effectively mitigates the adverse effects of data heterogeneity. Model uncertainty and instance uncertainty are further utilized to ensure the safety and reliability of the training and inference stages. Through extensive experiments on widely recognized federated learning benchmarks, we demonstrate that TPFL not only achieves competitive performance compared with advanced methods but also exhibits resilience against prevalent malicious attacks, robustness on domain shifts, and reliability in high-stake scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangwei Nathan Zheng, Chang George Dong, Wei Emma Zhang, Lin Yue, Miao Xu, Olaf Maennel, Weitong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive performance in many pivotal web applications such as sensor data analysis. However, since LLMs are not designed for time series tasks, simpler models like linear regressions can often achieve comparable performance with far less complexity. In this study, we perform extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of applying LLMs to key time series tasks, including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection. We compare the performance of LLMs against simpler baseline models, such as single-layer linear models and randomly initialized LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs offer minimal advantages for these core time series tasks and may even distort the temporal structure of the data. In contrast, simpler models consistently outperform LLMs while requiring far fewer parameters. Furthermore, we analyze existing reprogramming techniques and show, through data manifold analysis, that these methods fail to effectively align time series data with language and display pseudo-alignment behaviour in embedding space. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLM-based methods in time series tasks arises from the intrinsic characteristics and structure of time series data, rather than any meaningful alignment with the language model architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oskar {\AA}str\"om, Alexandros Sopasakis</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel Conditional Latent space Variational Autoencoder (CL-VAE) to perform improved pre-processing for anomaly detection on data with known inlier classes and unknown outlier classes. This proposed variational autoencoder (VAE) improves latent space separation by conditioning on information within the data. The method fits a unique prior distribution to each class in the dataset, effectively expanding the classic prior distribution for VAEs to include a Gaussian mixture model. An ensemble of these VAEs are merged in the latent spaces to form a group consensus that greatly improves the accuracy of anomaly detection across data sets. Our approach is compared against the capabilities of a typical VAE, a CNN, and a PCA, with regards AUC for anomaly detection. The proposed model shows increased accuracy in anomaly detection, achieving an AUC of 97.4% on the MNIST dataset compared to 95.7% for the second best model. In addition, the CL-VAE shows increased benefits from ensembling, a more interpretable latent space, and an increased ability to learn patterns in complex data with limited model sizes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-training foundation models has become the de-facto procedure for deep learning approaches, yet its application remains limited in the geological studies, where in needs of the model transferability to break the shackle of data scarcity. Here we target on the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning data, a standard high-resolution measurement in extensive scientific drilling projects. We propose a scalable self-supervised learner, masked autoencoders on XRF spectra (MAX), to pre-train a foundation model covering geological records from multiple regions of the Pacific and Southern Ocean. In pre-training, we find that masking a high proportion of the input spectrum (50\%) yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. For downstream tasks, we select the quantification of XRF spectra into two costly geochemical measurements, CaCO$_3$ and total organic carbon, due to their importance in understanding the paleo-oceanic carbon system. Our results show that MAX, requiring only one-third of the data, outperforms models without pre-training in terms of quantification accuracy. Additionally, the model's generalizability improves by more than 60\% in zero-shot tests on new materials, with explainability further ensuring its robustness. Thus, our approach offers a promising pathway to overcome data scarcity in geological discovery by leveraging the self-supervised foundation model and fast-acquired XRF scanning data.</p>

In this work, we introduce a novel Federated Temporal Graph Clustering (FTGC) framework that enables decentralized training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple clients, ensuring data privacy throughout the process. Our approach incorporates a temporal aggregation mechanism to effectively capture the evolution of graph structures over time and a federated optimization strategy to collaboratively learn high-quality clustering representations. By preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead, our framework achieves competitive performance on temporal graph datasets, making it a promising solution for privacy-sensitive, real-world applications involving dynamic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingren Yao, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Renhe Jiang, Yuxuan Liang, Ming Jin, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Xia, Huijun Wu, Duanyu Li, Min Xie, Ruibo Wang, Wenzhe Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at handling graph data but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing defense methods typically rely on assumptions like graph sparsity and homophily to either preprocess the graph or guide structure learning. However, preprocessing methods often struggle to accurately distinguish between normal edges and adversarial perturbations, leading to suboptimal results due to the loss of valuable edge information. Robust graph neural network models train directly on graph data affected by adversarial perturbations, without preprocessing. This can cause the model to get stuck in poor local optima, negatively affecting its performance. To address these challenges, we propose Perseus, a novel adversarial defense method based on curriculum learning. Perseus assesses edge difficulty using global homophily and applies a curriculum learning strategy to adjust the learning order, guiding the model to learn the full graph structure while adaptively focusing on common data patterns. This approach mitigates the impact of adversarial perturbations. Experiments show that models trained with Perseus achieve superior performance and are significantly more robust to adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gustavo Assun\c{c}\~ao, Paulo Menezes</p>
<p>Abstract: Lack of data on which to perform experimentation is a recurring issue in many areas of research, particularly in machine learning. The inability of most automated data mining techniques to be generalized to all types of data is inherently related with their dependency on those types which deems them ineffective against anything slightly different. Meta-heuristics are algorithms which attempt to optimize some solution independently of the type of data used, whilst classifiers or neural networks focus on feature extrapolation and dimensionality reduction to fit some model onto data arranged in a particular way. These two algorithmic fields encompass a group of characteristics which when combined are seemingly capable of achieving data mining regardless of how it is arranged. To this end, this work proposes a means of combining meta-heuristic methods with conventional classifiers and neural networks in order to perform automated data mining. Experiments on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition were performed and it was empirically observed that using a ground truth labeled dataset's validation accuracy is inadequate for correcting labels of other previously unseen data instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Liu, Haonan Yu, Xin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancements of various machine learning models, there is a significant demand for model-agnostic explanation techniques, which can explain these models across different architectures. Mainstream model-agnostic explanation techniques generate local explanations based on basic features (e.g., words for text models and (super-)pixels for image models). However, these explanations often do not align with the decision-making processes of the target models and end-users, resulting in explanations that are unfaithful and difficult for users to understand. On the other hand, concept-based techniques provide explanations based on high-level features (e.g., topics for text models and objects for image models), but most are model-specific or require additional pre-defined external concept knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose \toolname, a general framework to provide concept-based local explanations for any machine learning models. Our key insight is that we can automatically extract high-level concepts from large pre-trained models, and uniformly extend existing local model-agnostic techniques to provide unified concept-based explanations. We have instantiated \toolname on four different types of explanation techniques: LIME, Kernel SHAP, Anchor, and LORE, and applied these techniques to text and image models. Our evaluation results demonstrate that 1) compared to the vanilla versions, \toolname offers more faithful explanations and makes them more understandable to users, and 2) by offering multiple forms of explanations, \toolname outperforms state-of-the-art concept-based explanation techniques specifically designed for text and image models, respectively.</p>

In this work, we focus on the fairness of partition- and prototype-based models. The contribution of this work is twofold: 1) we develop a general framework for fair machine learning of partition-based models that does not depend on a specific fairness definition, and 2) we derive a fair version of learning vector quantization (LVQ) as a specific instantiation. We compare the resulting algorithm against other algorithms from the literature on theoretical and real-world data showing its practical relevance.</p>

These successes are even more remarkable given the complex non-convex nature of the loss landscape of these models. Yet, ensuring the convergence of optimization methods requires specific structural conditions on the objective function that are rarely satisfied in practice. One prominent example is the widely recognized Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality, which has gained considerable attention in recent years. However, validating such assumptions for deep neural networks entails substantial and often impractical levels of over-parametrization. In order to address this limitation, we propose a novel class of functions that can characterize the loss landscape of modern deep models without requiring extensive over-parametrization and can also include saddle points. Crucially, we prove that gradient-based optimizers possess theoretical guarantees of convergence under this assumption. Finally, we validate the soundness of our new function class through both theoretical analysis and empirical experimentation across a diverse range of deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun He, Wenlin Chen, Mingtian Zhang, David Barber, Jos\'e Miguel Hern\'andez-Lobato</p>
<p>Abstract: Training generative models to sample from unnormalized density functions is an important and challenging task in machine learning. Traditional training methods often rely on the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence due to its tractability. However, the mode-seeking behavior of reverse KL hinders effective approximation of multi-modal target distributions. To address this, we propose to minimize the reverse KL along diffusion trajectories of both model and target densities. We refer to this objective as the reverse diffusive KL divergence, which allows the model to capture multiple modes. Leveraging this objective, we train neural samplers that can efficiently generate samples from the target distribution in one step. We demonstrate that our method enhances sampling performance across various Boltzmann distributions, including both synthetic multi-modal densities and n-body particle systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiyang Ye, Yueming Lyu, Xuehao Wang, Masashi Sugiyama, Yu Zhang, Ivor Tsang</p>
<p>Abstract: Black-box optimization algorithms have been widely used in various machine learning problems, including reinforcement learning and prompt fine-tuning. However, directly optimizing the training loss value, as commonly done in existing black-box optimization methods, could lead to suboptimal model quality and generalization performance. To address those problems in black-box optimization, we propose a novel Sharpness-Aware Black-box Optimization (SABO) algorithm, which applies a sharpness-aware minimization strategy to improve the model generalization. Specifically, the proposed SABO method first reparameterizes the objective function by its expectation over a Gaussian distribution. Then it iteratively updates the parameterized distribution by approximated stochastic gradients of the maximum objective value within a small neighborhood around the current solution in the Gaussian distribution space. Theoretically, we prove the convergence rate and generalization bound of the proposed SABO algorithm. Empirically, extensive experiments on the black-box prompt fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SABO method in improving model generalization performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Yazdani-Jahromi, Mangal Prakash, Tommaso Mansi, Artem Moskalev, Rui Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Messenger RNA (mRNA) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, with its codon structure directly impacting biological properties. While Language Models (LMs) have shown promise in analyzing biological sequences, existing approaches fail to account for the hierarchical nature of mRNA's codon structure. We introduce Hierarchical Encoding for mRNA Language Modeling (HELM), a novel pre-training strategy that incorporates codon-level hierarchical structure into language model training. HELM modulates the loss function based on codon synonymity, aligning the model's learning process with the biological reality of mRNA sequences. We evaluate HELM on diverse mRNA datasets and tasks, demonstrating that HELM outperforms standard language model pre-training as well as existing foundation model baselines on six diverse downstream property prediction tasks and an antibody region annotation tasks on average by around 8\%. Additionally, HELM enhances the generative capabilities of language model, producing diverse mRNA sequences that better align with the underlying true data distribution compared to non-hierarchical baselines.</p>

This work presents the main tasks in water distribution networks, discusses how they relate to machine learning and analyses how the particularities of the domain pose challenges to and can be leveraged by machine learning approaches. Besides, it provides a technical toolkit by presenting evaluation benchmarks and a structured survey of the exemplary task of leakage detection and localization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Loris Gaven, Clement Romac, Thomas Carta, Sylvain Lamprier, Olivier Sigaud, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</p>
<p>Abstract: The past years have seen Large Language Models (LLMs) strive not only as generative models but also as agents solving textual sequential decision-making tasks. When facing complex environments where their zero-shot abilities are insufficient, recent work showed online Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be used for the LLM agent to discover and learn efficient strategies interactively. However, most prior work sticks to on-policy algorithms, which greatly reduces the scope of methods such agents could use for both exploration and exploitation, such as experience replay and hindsight relabeling. Yet, such methods may be key for LLM learning agents, and in particular when designing autonomous intrinsically motivated agents sampling and pursuing their own goals (i.e. autotelic agents). This paper presents and studies an adaptation of Soft Actor-Critic and hindsight relabeling to LLM agents. Our method not only paves the path towards autotelic LLM agents that learn online but can also outperform on-policy methods in more classic multi-goal RL environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gyroscopes are inertial sensors that measure the angular velocity of the platforms to which they are attached. To estimate the gyroscope deterministic error terms prior mission start, a calibration procedure is performed. When considering low-cost gyroscopes, the calibration requires a turntable as the gyros are incapable of sensing the Earth turn rate. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework to estimate the scale factor and bias of a gyroscope. To train and validate our approach, a dataset of 56 minutes was recorded using a turntable. We demonstrated that our proposed approach outperforms the model-based approach, in terms of accuracy and convergence time. Specifically, we improved the scale factor and bias estimation by an average of 72% during six seconds of calibration time, demonstrating an average of 75% calibration time improvement. That is, instead of minutes, our approach requires only several seconds for the calibration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Van Khoa Nguyen, Maciej Falkiewicz, Giangiacomo Mercatali, Alexandros Kalousis</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional molecule generation methods often rely on sequence or graph-based representations, which can limit their expressive power or require complex permutation-equivariant architectures. This paper introduces a novel paradigm for learning molecule generative models based on functional representations. Specifically, we propose Molecular Implicit Neural Generation (MING), a diffusion-based model that learns molecular distributions in function space. Unlike standard diffusion processes in data space, MING employs a novel functional denoising probabilistic process, which jointly denoises the information in both the function's input and output spaces by leveraging an expectation-maximization procedure for latent implicit neural representations of data. This approach allows for a simple yet effective model design that accurately captures underlying function distributions. Experimental results on molecule-related datasets demonstrate MING's superior performance and ability to generate plausible molecular samples, surpassing state-of-the-art data-space methods while offering a more streamlined architecture and significantly faster generation times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cosimo Gregucci, Bo Xiong, Daniel Hernandez, Lorenzo Loconte, Pasquale Minervini, Steffen Staab, Antonio Vergari</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) on knowledge graphs (KGs) is gaining momentum as a challenging reasoning task. In this paper, we show that the current benchmarks for CQA are not really complex, and the way they are built distorts our perception of progress in this field. For example, we find that in these benchmarks, most queries (up to 98% for some query types) can be reduced to simpler problems, e.g., link prediction, where only one link needs to be predicted. The performance of state-of-the-art CQA models drops significantly when such models are evaluated on queries that cannot be reduced to easier types. Thus, we propose a set of more challenging benchmarks, composed of queries that require models to reason over multiple hops and better reflect the construction of real-world KGs. In a systematic empirical investigation, the new benchmarks show that current methods leave much to be desired from current CQA methods.</p>

We extend the sensitive directions work by introducing an improved baseline for perturbation directions. We demonstrate that KL divergence for Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) reconstruction errors are no longer pathologically high compared to the improved baseline. We also show that feature directions uncovered by SAEs have varying impacts on model outputs depending on the SAE's sparsity, with lower L0 SAE feature directions exerting a greater influence. Additionally, we find that end-to-end SAE features do not exhibit stronger effects on model outputs compared to traditional SAEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Frans, Danijar Hafner, Sergey Levine, Pieter Abbeel</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models and flow-matching models have enabled generating diverse and realistic images by learning to transfer noise to data. However, sampling from these models involves iterative denoising over many neural network passes, making generation slow and expensive. Previous approaches for speeding up sampling require complex training regimes, such as multiple training phases, multiple networks, or fragile scheduling. We introduce shortcut models, a family of generative models that use a single network and training phase to produce high-quality samples in a single or multiple sampling steps. Shortcut models condition the network not only on the current noise level but also on the desired step size, allowing the model to skip ahead in the generation process. Across a wide range of sampling step budgets, shortcut models consistently produce higher quality samples than previous approaches, such as consistency models and reflow. Compared to distillation, shortcut models reduce complexity to a single network and training phase and additionally allow varying step budgets at inference time.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, much interdisciplinary research has been conducted exploring potential use cases of neuroscience to advance the field of information retrieval. Initial research concentrated on the use of fMRI data, but fMRI was deemed to be not suitable for real-world applications, and soon, research shifted towards using EEG data. In this paper, we try to improve the original performance of a first attempt at generating text using EEG by focusing on the less explored area of optimising neural network performance. We test a set of different activation functions and compare their performance. Our results show that introducing a higher degree polynomial activation function can enhance model performance without changing the model architecture. We also show that the learnable 3rd-degree activation function performs better on the 1-gram evaluation compared to a 3rd-degree non-learnable function. However, when evaluating the model on 2-grams and above, the polynomial function lacks in performance, whilst the leaky ReLU activation function outperforms the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Chen, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of sensing devices leads to a surge in data for spatio-temporal forecasting applications such as traffic flow, air quality, and wind energy. Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a widespread chronic condition that impairs mobility and diminishes quality of life. Despite the proven benefits of exercise therapy and patient education in managing the OA symptoms pain and functional limitations, these strategies are often underutilized. Personalized outcome prediction models can help motivate and engage patients, but the accuracy of existing models in predicting changes in knee pain remains insufficiently examined. To validate existing models and introduce a concise personalized model predicting changes in knee pain before to after participating in a supervised education and exercise therapy program (GLA:D) for knee OA patients. Our models use self-reported patient information and functional measures. To refine the number of variables, we evaluated the variable importance and applied clinical reasoning. We trained random forest regression models and compared the rate of true predictions of our models with those utilizing average values. We evaluated the performance of a full, continuous, and concise model including all 34, all 11 continuous, and the six most predictive variables respectively. All three models performed similarly and were comparable to the existing model, with R-squares of 0.31-0.32 and RMSEs of 18.65-18.85 - despite our increased sample size. Allowing a deviation of 15 VAS points from the true change in pain, our concise model and utilizing the average values estimated the change in pain at 58% and 51% correctly, respectively. Our supplementary analysis led to similar outcomes. Our concise personalized prediction model more accurately predicts changes in knee pain following the GLA:D program compared to average pain improvement values. Neither the increase in sample size nor the inclusion of additional variables improved previous models. To improve predictions, new variables beyond those in the GLA:D are required.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henrique Don\^ancio, Antoine Barrier, Leah F. South, Florence Forbes</p>
<p>Abstract: In Deep Reinforcement Learning models trained using gradient-based techniques, the choice of optimizer and its learning rate are crucial to achieving good performance: higher learning rates can prevent the model from learning effectively, while lower ones might slow convergence. Additionally, due to the non-stationarity of the objective function, the best-performing learning rate can change over the training steps. To adapt the learning rate, a standard technique consists of using decay schedulers. However, these schedulers assume that the model is progressively approaching convergence, which may not always be true, leading to delayed or premature adjustments. In this work, we propose dynamic Learning Rate for deep Reinforcement Learning (LRRL), a meta-learning approach that selects the learning rate based on the agent's performance during training. LRRL is based on a multi-armed bandit algorithm, where each arm represents a different learning rate, and the bandit feedback is provided by the cumulative returns of the RL policy to update the arms' probability distribution. Our empirical results demonstrate that LRRL can substantially improve the performance of deep RL algorithms.</p>

This estimator provides superior ECE and ACE calibration error compared to Softmax for ResNet-18 at 85% network accuracy, and EfficientNet-B0 at 95% network accuracy, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with an imbalanced test set, except for very high accuracy edge cases. In addition, when using the ACE metric, BACON demonstrated improved calibration error when estimating probabilities for the imbalanced test set when using actual class distribution fractions.</p>

Recent self-supervised learning methods excel in learning rich representations without labels but struggle with disentangled embeddings and inductive bias issues like transformation-invariance. To address these challenges, we introduce TimeDRL, a framework for multivariate time-series representation learning with dual-level disentangled embeddings. TimeDRL features: (i) disentangled timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings using a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) timestamp-predictive and instance-contrastive tasks for representation learning; and (iii) avoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases. Experiments on forecasting and classification datasets show TimeDRL outperforms existing methods, with further validation in semi-supervised settings with limited labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayana Savostianova, Emanuele Zangrando, Francesco Tudisco</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks on deep neural network models have seen rapid development and are extensively used to study the stability of these networks. Among various adversarial strategies, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) is a widely adopted method in computer vision due to its effectiveness and quick implementation, making it suitable for adversarial training. In this work, we observe that in many cases, the perturbations computed using PGD predominantly affect only a portion of the singular value spectrum of the original image, suggesting that these perturbations are approximately low-rank. Motivated by this observation, we propose a variation of PGD that efficiently computes a low-rank attack. We extensively validate our method on a range of standard models as well as robust models that have undergone adversarial training. Our analysis indicates that the proposed low-rank PGD can be effectively used in adversarial training due to its straightforward and fast implementation coupled with competitive performance. Notably, we find that low-rank PGD often performs comparably to, and sometimes even outperforms, the traditional full-rank PGD attack, while using significantly less memory.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by the success of artificial general intelligence, there is a trend towards developing Graph Foundation Models that excel in generalization across various graph tasks and domains. However, current models often require extensive training or fine-tuning to capture structural and semantic insights on new graphs, which limits their versatility. In this work, we explore graph foundation models from the perspective of zero-shot reasoning on Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Our focus is on utilizing KGs as a unified topological structure to tackle diverse tasks, while addressing semantic isolation challenges in KG reasoning to effectively integrate diverse semantic and structural features. This brings us new methodological insights into KG reasoning, as well as high generalizability towards foundation models in practice. Methodologically, we introduce SCORE, a unified graph reasoning framework that effectively generalizes diverse graph tasks using zero-shot learning. At the core of SCORE is semantic conditional message passing, a technique designed to capture both structural and semantic invariances in graphs, with theoretical backing for its expressive power. Practically, we evaluate the zero-shot reasoning capability of SCORE using 38 diverse graph datasets, covering node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks across multiple domains. Our experiments reveal a substantial performance improvement over prior foundation models and supervised baselines, highlighting the efficacy and adaptability of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamaledin Ghiasi-Shirazi, Mohammadreza Qaraei</p>
<p>Abstract: Kernel methods in machine learning use a kernel function that takes two data points as input and returns their inner product after mapping them to a Hilbert space, implicitly and without actually computing the mapping. For many kernel functions, such as Gaussian and Laplacian kernels, the feature space is known to be infinite-dimensional, making operations in this space possible only implicitly. This implicit nature necessitates algorithms to be expressed using dual representations and the kernel trick. In this paper, given an arbitrary kernel function, we introduce an explicit, finite-dimensional feature map for any arbitrary kernel function that ensures the inner product of data points in the feature space equals the kernel function value, during both training and testing. The existence of this explicit mapping allows for kernelized algorithms to be formulated in their primal form, without the need for the kernel trick or the dual representation. As a first application, we demonstrate how to derive kernelized machine learning algorithms directly, without resorting to the dual representation, and apply this method specifically to PCA. As another application, without any changes to the t-SNE algorithm and its implementation, we use it for visualizing the feature space of kernel functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Shankar Narasimhan, Shubhankar Agarwal, Litu Rout, Sanjay Shakkottai, Sandeep P. Chinchali</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stress-testing models and protecting user privacy by using synthetic data. In engineering and safety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints (~100) without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 10% and 42%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarwan Ali, Taslim Murad, Prakash Chourasia, Haris Mansoor, Imdad Ullah Khan, Pin-Yu Chen, Murray Patterson</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the structural and functional characteristics of proteins are crucial for developing preventative and curative strategies that impact fields from drug discovery to policy development. An important and popular technique for examining how amino acids make up these characteristics of the protein sequences with position-specific scoring (PSS). While the string kernel is crucial in natural language processing (NLP), it is unclear if string kernels can extract biologically meaningful information from protein sequences, despite the fact that they have been shown to be effective in the general sequence analysis tasks. In this work, we propose a weighted PSS kernel matrix (or W-PSSKM), that combines a PSS representation of protein sequences, which encodes the frequency information of each amino acid in a sequence, with the notion of the string kernel. This results in a novel kernel function that outperforms many other approaches for protein sequence classification. We perform extensive experimentation to evaluate the proposed method. Our findings demonstrate that the W-PSSKM significantly outperforms existing baselines and state-of-the-art methods and achieves up to 45.1\% improvement in classification accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuomin Chen, Jingchao Ni, Hojat Allah Salehi, Xu Zheng, Esteban Schafir, Farhad Shirani, Dongsheng Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL), enhanced by graph augmentation methods, has emerged as an effective technique achieving performance improvements in wide tasks such as node classification and graph classification. In self-supervised GRL, paired graph augmentations are generated from each graph. Its objective is to infer similar representations for augmentations of the same graph, but maximally distinguishable representations for augmentations of different graphs. Analogous to image and language domains, the desiderata of an ideal augmentation method include both (1) semantics-preservation; and (2) data-perturbation; i.e., an augmented graph should preserve the semantics of its original graph while carrying sufficient variance. However, most existing (un-)/self-supervised GRL methods focus on data perturbation but largely neglect semantics preservation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel method, Explanation-Preserving Augmentation (EPA), that leverages graph explanation techniques for generating augmented graphs that can bridge the gap between semantics-preservation and data-perturbation. EPA first uses a small number of labels to train a graph explainer to infer the sub-structures (explanations) that are most relevant to a graph's semantics. These explanations are then used to generate semantics-preserving augmentations for self-supervised GRL, namely EPA-GRL. We demonstrate theoretically, using an analytical example, and through extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets that EPA-GRL outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) GRL methods, which are built upon semantics-agnostic data augmentations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12671">New Paradigm of Adversarial Training: Breaking Inherent Trade-Off between Accuracy and Robustness via Dummy Classes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanyun Wang, Li Liu, Zi Liang, Qingqing Ye, Haibo Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to enhance the robustness of DNNs. However, existing AT methods suffer from an inherent trade-off between adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, which seriously hinders their real-world deployment. While this problem has been widely studied within the current AT paradigm, existing AT methods still typically experience a reduction in clean accuracy by over 10% to date, without significant improvements in robustness compared with simple baselines like PGD-AT. This inherent trade-off raises a question: whether the current AT paradigm, which assumes to learn the corresponding benign and adversarial samples as the same class, inappropriately combines clean and robust objectives that may be essentially inconsistent. In this work, we surprisingly reveal that up to 40% of CIFAR-10 adversarial samples always fail to satisfy such an assumption across various AT methods and robust models, explicitly indicating the improvement room for the current AT paradigm. Accordingly, to relax the tension between clean and robust learning derived from this overstrict assumption, we propose a new AT paradigm by introducing an additional dummy class for each original class, aiming to accommodate the hard adversarial samples with shifted distribution after perturbation. The robustness w.r.t. these adversarial samples can be achieved by runtime recovery from the predicted dummy classes to their corresponding original ones, eliminating the compromise with clean learning. Building on this new paradigm, we propose a novel plug-and-play AT technology named DUmmy Classes-based Adversarial Training (DUCAT). Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that the DUCAT concurrently improves clean accuracy and adversarial robustness compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, effectively breaking the existing inherent trade-off.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sameep Chattopadhyay, Pulkit Paliwal, Sai Shankar Narasimhan, Shubhankar Agarwal, Sandeep P. Chinchali</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasts are often influenced by exogenous contextual features in addition to their corresponding history. For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Evangelisti, Francesco Rossi, Tobia Giani, Ilaria Bloise, Mattia Varile</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate satellite pose estimation is crucial for autonomous guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems in in-orbit servicing (IOS) missions. This paper explores the impact of different tasks within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for satellite pose estimation using monocular images. By integrating tasks such as direct pose estimation, keypoint prediction, object localization, and segmentation into a single network, the study aims to evaluate the reciprocal influence between tasks by testing different multi-task configurations thanks to the modularity of the convolutional neural network (CNN) used in this work. The trends of mutual bias between the analyzed tasks are found by employing different weighting strategies to further test the robustness of the findings. A synthetic dataset was developed to train and test the MTL network. Results indicate that direct pose estimation and heatmap-based pose estimation positively influence each other in general, while both the bounding box and segmentation tasks do not provide significant contributions and tend to degrade the overall estimation accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (RVD) have been extensively studied in recent years, addressing the stringent requirements of spacecraft dynamics variations and the limitations of GNC systems. This paper presents an innovative approach employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) trained through Reinforcement Learning (RL) for autonomous spacecraft guidance and control during the final phase of the rendezvous maneuver. The proposed strategy is easily implementable onboard and offers fast adaptability and robustness to disturbances by learning control policies from experience rather than relying on predefined models. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations within a relevant environment are conducted in 6DoF settings to validate our approach, along with hardware tests that demonstrate deployment feasibility. Our findings highlight the efficacy of RL in assuring the adaptability and efficiency of spacecraft RVD, offering insights into future mission expectations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lazar {\DJ}okovi\'c, Marko Robnik-\v{S}ikonja</p>
<p>Abstract: The sarcasm detection task in natural language processing tries to classify whether an utterance is sarcastic or not. It is related to sentiment analysis since it often inverts surface sentiment. Because sarcastic sentences are highly dependent on context, and they are often accompanied by various non-verbal cues, the task is challenging. Most of related work focuses on high-resourced languages like English. To build a sarcasm detection dataset for a less-resourced language, such as Slovenian, we leverage two modern techniques: a machine translation specific medium-size transformer model, and a very large generative language model. We explore the viability of translated datasets and how the size of a pretrained transformer affects its ability to detect sarcasm. We train ensembles of detection models and evaluate models' performance. The results show that larger models generally outperform smaller ones and that ensembling can slightly improve sarcasm detection performance. Our best ensemble approach achieves an $\text{F}_1$-score of 0.765 which is close to annotators' agreement in the source language.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12713">How Does Variance Shape the Regret in Contextual Bandits?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Jia, Jian Qian, Alexander Rakhlin, Chen-Yu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider realizable contextual bandits with general function approximation, investigating how small reward variance can lead to better-than-minimax regret bounds. Unlike in minimax bounds, we show that the eluder dimension $d_\text{elu}$$-$a complexity measure of the function class$-$plays a crucial role in variance-dependent bounds. We consider two types of adversary:
  (1) Weak adversary: The adversary sets the reward variance before observing the learner's action. In this setting, we prove that a regret of $\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{A,d_\text{elu}\}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ is unavoidable when $d_{\text{elu}}\leq\sqrt{AT}$, where $A$ is the number of actions, $T$ is the total number of rounds, and $\Lambda$ is the total variance over $T$ rounds. For the $A\leq d_\text{elu}$ regime, we derive a nearly matching upper bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{A\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ for the special case where the variance is revealed at the beginning of each round.
  (2) Strong adversary: The adversary sets the reward variance after observing the learner's action. We show that a regret of $\Omega(\sqrt{d_\text{elu}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ is unavoidable when $\sqrt{d_\text{elu}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu}\leq\sqrt{AT}$. In this setting, we provide an upper bound of order $\tilde{O}(d_\text{elu}\sqrt{\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$.
  Furthermore, we examine the setting where the function class additionally provides distributional information of the reward, as studied by Wang et al. (2024). We demonstrate that the regret bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d_\text{elu}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ established in their work is unimprovable when $\sqrt{d_{\text{elu}}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu}\leq\sqrt{AT}$. However, with a slightly different definition of the total variance and with the assumption that the reward follows a Gaussian distribution, one can achieve a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{A\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio P\'erez, Mario Santa Cruz, Daniel San Mart\'in, Jos\'e Manuel Guti\'errez</p>
<p>Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is a promising cost-effective downscaling methodology for producing high-resolution climate information from coarser counterparts. A particular application is downscaling regional reanalysis outputs (predictand) from the driving global counterparts (predictor). This study conducts an intercomparison of various SR downscaling methods focusing on temperature and using the CERRA reanalysis (5.5 km resolution, produced with a regional atmospheric model driven by ERA5) as example. The method proposed in this work is the Swin transformer and two alternative methods are used as benchmark (fully convolutional U-Net and convolutional and dense DeepESD) as well as the simple bicubic interpolation. We compare two approaches, the standard one using the full domain as input and a more scalable tiling approach, dividing the full domain into tiles that are used as input. The methods are trained to downscale CERRA surface temperature, based on temperature information from the driving ERA5; in addition, the tiling approach includes static orographic information. We show that the tiling approach, which requires spatial transferability, comes at the cost of a lower performance (although it outperforms some full-domain benchmarks), but provides an efficient scalable solution that allows SR reduction on a pan-European scale and is valuable for real-time applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulun Wu, Louie McConnell, Claudia Iriondo</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating an individual's potential outcomes under counterfactual treatments is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, facial images) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to predict one's outcomes under counterfactual treatments, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in its high-dimensional observed outcome in addition to the covariates. Prior works using variational inference in counterfactual generative modeling have been focusing on neural adaptations and model variants within the conditional variational autoencoder formulation, which we argue is fundamentally ill-suited to the notion of counterfactual in causal inference. In this work, we present a novel variational Bayesian causal inference framework and its theoretical backings to properly handle counterfactual generative modeling tasks, through which we are able to conduct counterfactual supervision end-to-end during training without any counterfactual samples, and encourage latent disentanglement that aids the correct identification of causal effect in counterfactual generations. In experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of our framework compared to state-of-the-art models in counterfactual generative modeling on multiple benchmarks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12735">CREAM: Consistency Regularized Self-Rewarding Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyang Wang, Weilei He, Zhiyuan Liang, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Ying Wei, Weitong Zhang, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent self-rewarding large language models (LLM) have successfully applied LLM-as-a-Judge to iteratively improve the alignment performance without the need of human annotations for preference data. These methods commonly utilize the same LLM to act as both the policy model (which generates responses) and the reward model (which scores and ranks those responses). The ranked responses are then used as preference pairs to train the LLM via direct alignment technologies (e.g. DPO). However, it is noteworthy that throughout this process, there is no guarantee of accuracy in the rewarding and ranking, which is critical for ensuring accurate rewards and high-quality preference data. Empirical results from relatively small LLMs (e.g., 7B parameters) also indicate that improvements from self-rewarding may diminish after several iterations in certain situations, which we hypothesize is due to accumulated bias in the reward system. This bias can lead to unreliable preference data for training the LLM. To address this issue, we first formulate and analyze the generalized iterative preference fine-tuning framework for self-rewarding language model. We then introduce the regularization to this generalized framework to mitigate the overconfident preference labeling in the self-rewarding process. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a Consistency Regularized sElf-rewarding lAnguage Model (CREAM) that leverages the rewarding consistency across different iterations to regularize the self-rewarding training, helping the model to learn from more reliable preference data. With this explicit regularization, our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CREAM in improving both reward consistency and alignment performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuya Seki, Hyakka Nakada, Shu Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an initialization method that can approximate a given approximate Ising model with a high degree of accuracy using the Factorization Machine (FM), a machine learning model. The construction of Ising models using FM is applied to the combinatorial optimization problem using the factorization machine with quantum annealing. It is anticipated that the optimization performance of FMQA will be enhanced through the implementation of the warm-start method. Nevertheless, the optimal initialization method for leveraging the warm-start approach in FMQA remains undetermined. Consequently, the present study compares a number of initialization methods and identifies the most appropriate for use with a warm-start in FMQA through numerical experimentation. Furthermore, the properties of the proposed FM initialization method are analyzed using random matrix theory, demonstrating that the approximation accuracy of the proposed method is not significantly influenced by the specific Ising model under consideration. The findings of this study will facilitate the advancement of combinatorial optimization problem-solving through the use of Ising machines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ekansh Sharma, Daniel M. Roy, Gintare Karolina Dziugaite</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging aims to efficiently combine the weights of multiple expert models, each trained on a specific task, into a single multi-task model, with strong performance across all tasks. When applied to all but the last layer of weights, existing methods -- such as Task Arithmetic, TIES-merging, and TALL mask merging -- work well to combine expert models obtained by fine-tuning a common foundation model, operating within a "local" neighborhood of the foundation model. This work explores the more challenging scenario of "non-local" merging, which we find arises when an expert model changes significantly during pretraining or where the expert models do not even share a common foundation model.
  We observe that standard merging techniques often fail to generalize effectively in this non-local setting, even when accounting for permutation symmetries using standard techniques. We identify that this failure is, in part, due to "variance collapse", a phenomenon identified also in the setting of linear mode connectivity by Jordan et al. (2023). To address this, we propose a multi-task technique to re-scale and shift the output activations of the merged model for each task, aligning its output statistics with those of the corresponding task-specific expert models. Our experiments demonstrate that this correction significantly improves the performance of various model merging approaches in non-local settings, providing a strong baseline for future research on this problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial genomics has led to unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery, but it also presents unique computational and statistical challenges. Traditional methods struggle with geometry-aware data generation, interpolation along meaningful trajectories, and transporting populations via feasible paths. To address these issues, we introduce Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoder (GAGA), a novel framework that combines extensible manifold learning with generative modeling. GAGA constructs a neural network embedding space that respects the intrinsic geometries discovered by manifold learning and learns a novel warped Riemannian metric on the data space. This warped metric is derived from both the points on the data manifold and negative samples off the manifold, allowing it to characterize a meaningful geometry across the entire latent space. Using this metric, GAGA can uniformly sample points on the manifold, generate points along geodesics, and interpolate between populations across the learned manifold. GAGA shows competitive performance in simulated and real world datasets, including a 30% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in single-cell population-level trajectory inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhesam Abedsoltan, Adityanarayanan Radhakrishnan, Jingfeng Wu, Mikhail Belkin</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), where these models solve new tasks by using examples in the prompt without additional training. In our work, we identify and analyze two key components of ICL: (1) context-scaling, where model performance improves as the number of in-context examples increases and (2) task-scaling, where model performance improves as the number of pre-training tasks increases. While transformers are capable of both context-scaling and task-scaling, we empirically show that standard Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with vectorized input are only capable of task-scaling. To understand how transformers are capable of context-scaling, we first propose a significantly simplified transformer architecture without key, query, value weights. We show that it performs ICL comparably to the original GPT-2 model in various statistical learning tasks including linear regression, teacher-student settings. Furthermore, a single block of our simplified transformer can be viewed as data dependent feature map followed by an MLP. This feature map on its own is a powerful predictor that is capable of context-scaling but is not capable of task-scaling. We show empirically that concatenating the output of this feature map with vectorized data as an input to MLPs enables both context-scaling and task-scaling. This finding provides a simple setting to study context and task-scaling for ICL.</p>

This framework is designed to enhance predictive accuracy by correcting individual model errors and offering interpretability through rule-based explanations. We show that our method provides up to 6.42% improvement in precision, 29.41% increase in recall at 13.24% increase in F1 over the best performing neural models. Further, our method, as it is based on logical rules, has the benefit of affording an explanation as to which combination of neural models directly contribute to a given prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider coverless steganography where a Large Language Model (LLM) drives an arithmetic coding decoder to generate stego-texts. An efficient method should embed secret message bits in as few language tokens as possible, while still keeping the stego-text natural and fluent. We show that on the individual token level, this problem is mathematically equivalent to maximizing the entropy of a replacement probability distribution of the next token generation, subject to a constraint on the KL divergence between the chosen probability distribution and the original distribution given by the LLM. A closed-form solution is provided for the optimization problem, which can be computed efficiently. Several important practical issues are also tackled: 1) An often-overlooked tokenization mismatch issue is resolved with a simple prompt selection approach, 2) The combination of the optimized distribution and the vocabulary truncation technique is considered, and 3) The combination of the optimized distribution with other sequence-level selection heuristics to further enhance the efficiency and reliability is studied.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mutual information provides a powerful, general-purpose metric for quantifying the amount of shared information between variables. Estimating normalized mutual information using a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) based approach involves the calculation of the scaling-invariant k-NN radius. Calculation of the radius suffers from numerical overflow when the joint dimensionality of the data becomes high, typically in the range of several hundred dimensions. To address this issue, we propose a logarithmic transformation technique that improves the numerical stability of the radius calculation in high-dimensional spaces. By applying the proposed transformation during the calculation of the radius, numerical overflow is avoided, and precision is maintained. Proposed transformation is validated through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, demonstrating its ability to stabilize the calculation without compromizing the precision of the results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image matching is a fundamental and critical task of multisource remote sensing image applications. However, remote sensing images are susceptible to various noises. Accordingly, how to effectively achieve accurate matching in noise images is a challenging problem. To solve this issue, we propose a robust multisource remote sensing image matching method utilizing attention and feature enhancement against noise interference. In the first stage, we combine deep convolution with the attention mechanism of transformer to perform dense feature extraction, constructing feature descriptors with higher discriminability and robustness. Subsequently, we employ a coarse-to-fine matching strategy to achieve dense matches. In the second stage, we introduce an outlier removal network based on a binary classification mechanism, which can establish effective and geometrically consistent correspondences between images; through weighting for each correspondence, inliers vs. outliers classification are performed, as well as removing outliers from dense matches. Ultimately, we can accomplish more efficient and accurate matches. To validate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct experiments using multisource remote sensing image datasets for comparison with other state-of-the-art methods under different scenarios, including noise-free, additive random noise, and periodic stripe noise. Comparative results indicate that the proposed method has a more well-balanced performance and robustness. The proposed method contributes a valuable reference for solving the difficult problem of noise image matching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Amiri, Richard Yang, Andreas Zufle</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing individual human trajectory data helps our understanding of human mobility and finds many commercial and academic applications. There are two main approaches to accessing trajectory data for research: one involves using real-world datasets like GeoLife, while the other employs simulations to synthesize data. Real-world data provides insights from real human activities, but such data is generally sparse due to voluntary participation. Conversely, simulated data can be more comprehensive but may capture unrealistic human behavior. In this Data and Resource paper, we combine the benefit of both by leveraging the statistical features of real-world data and the comprehensiveness of simulated data. Specifically, we extract features from the real-world GeoLife dataset such as the average number of individual daily trips, average radius of gyration, and maximum and minimum trip distances. We calibrate the Pattern of Life Simulation, a realistic simulation of human mobility, to reproduce these features. Therefore, we use a genetic algorithm to calibrate the parameters of the simulation to mimic the GeoLife features. For this calibration, we simulated numerous random simulation settings, measured the similarity of generated trajectories to GeoLife, and iteratively (over many generations) combined parameter settings of trajectory datasets most similar to GeoLife. Using the calibrated simulation, we simulate large trajectory datasets that we call GeoLife+, where + denotes the Kleene Plus, indicating unlimited replication with at least one occurrence. We provide simulated GeoLife+ data with 182, 1k, and 5k over 5 years, 10k, and 50k over a year and 100k users over 6 months of simulation lifetime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiongxiao Xu, Solomon Abera Bekele, Brice Videau, Kai Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Energy consumption has become a critical design metric and a limiting factor in the development of future computing architectures, from small wearable devices to large-scale leadership computing facilities. The predominant methods in energy management optimization are focused on CPUs. However, GPUs are increasingly significant and account for the majority of energy consumption in heterogeneous high performance computing (HPC) systems. Moreover, they typically rely on either purely offline training or a hybrid of offline and online training, which are impractical and lead to energy loss during data collection. Therefore, this paper studies a novel and practical online energy optimization problem for GPUs in HPC scenarios. The problem is challenging due to the inherent performance-energy trade-offs of GPUs, the exploration & exploitation dilemma across frequencies, and the lack of explicit performance counters in GPUs. To address these challenges, we formulate the online energy consumption optimization problem as a multi-armed bandit framework and develop a novel bandit based framework EnergyUCB. EnergyUCB is designed to dynamically adjust GPU core frequencies in real-time, reducing energy consumption with minimal impact on performance. Specifically, the proposed framework EnergyUCB (1) balances the performance-energy trade-off in the reward function, (2) effectively navigates the exploration & exploitation dilemma when adjusting GPU core frequencies online, and (3) leverages the ratio of GPU core utilization to uncore utilization as a real-time GPU performance metric. Experiments on a wide range of real-world HPC benchmarks demonstrate that EnergyUCB can achieve substantial energy savings.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we make a case for a proxy for large language models which has explicit support for cost-saving optimizations. We design LLMProxy, which supports three key optimizations: model selection, context management, and caching. These optimizations present tradeoffs in terms of cost, inference time, and response quality, which applications can navigate through our high level, bidirectional interface. As a case study, we implement a WhatsApp-based Q&A service that uses LLMProxy to provide a rich set of features to the users. This service is deployed on a small scale (100+ users) leveraging the cloud; it has been operational for 15+ weeks and users have asked 1400+ questions so far. We report on the experiences of running this service as well as microbenchmark the specific benefits of the various cost-optimizations we present in this paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakub Hoscilowicz, Bartosz Maj, Bartosz Kozakiewicz, Oleksii Tymoschuk, Artur Janicki</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing reliance on digital devices equipped with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), such as computers and smartphones, the need for effective automation tools has become increasingly important. Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V excel at tasks such as drafting emails, they struggle with GUI interactions, which limits their effectiveness in automating everyday tasks. In this paper, we introduce ClickAgent, a novel framework for building autonomous agents. In ClickAgent, the MLLM handles reasoning and action planning, while a separate UI location model (e.g., SeeClick) identifies the relevant UI elements on the screen. This approach addresses a key limitation of current-generation MLLMs: their difficulty in accurately locating UI elements.
  ClickAgent significantly outperforms other prompt-based autonomous agents (such as CogAgent, AppAgent, and Auto-UI) on the AITW benchmark. Our evaluation was conducted on both an Android smartphone emulator and an actual Android smartphone, using the task success rate as the key metric for measuring agent performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a growing cloud computing paradigm that is expected to reduce the user cost of service over traditional serverful approaches. However, the environmental impact of FaaS has not received much attention. We investigate FaaS scheduling and scaling from a sustainability perspective in this work. We find that the service-level objectives (SLOs) of FaaS and carbon emissions conflict with each other. We also find that SLO-focused FaaS scheduling can exacerbate water use in a datacenter. We propose a novel sustainability-focused FaaS scheduling and scaling framework to co-optimize SLO performance, carbon emissions, and wastewater generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyi Yang, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new learning paradigm termed Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta), which aims to build self-morphable neural networks. Contrary to crafting separate models for different architectures or sizes, NeuMeta directly learns the continuous weight manifold of neural networks. Once trained, we can sample weights for any-sized network directly from the manifold, even for previously unseen configurations, without retraining. To achieve this ambitious goal, NeuMeta trains neural implicit functions as hypernetworks. They accept coordinates within the model space as input, and generate corresponding weight values on the manifold. In other words, the implicit function is learned in a way, that the predicted weights is well-performed across various models sizes. In training those models, we notice that, the final performance closely relates on smoothness of the learned manifold. In pursuit of enhancing this smoothness, we employ two strategies. First, we permute weight matrices to achieve intra-model smoothness, by solving the Shortest Hamiltonian Path problem. Besides, we add a noise on the input coordinates when training the implicit function, ensuring models with various sizes shows consistent outputs. As such, NeuMeta shows promising results in synthesizing parameters for various network configurations. Our extensive tests in image classification, semantic segmentation, and image generation reveal that NeuMeta sustains full-size performance even at a 75% compression rate.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates whether the hexagonal structure of grid cells provides any performance benefits or if it merely represents a biologically convenient configuration. Utilizing the Vector-HaSH content addressable memory model as a model of the grid cell -- place cell network of the mammalian brain, we compare the performance of square and hexagonal grid cells in tasks of storing and retrieving spatial memories. Our experiments across different path types, path lengths and grid configurations, reveal that hexagonal grid cells perform similarly to square grid cells with respect to spatial representation and memory recall. Our results show comparable accuracy and robustness across different datasets and noise levels on images to recall. These findings suggest that the brain's use of hexagonal grids may be more a matter of biological convenience and ease of implementation rather than because they provide superior performance over square grid cells (which are easier to implement in silico).</p>

We propose an approach to discover a set of state variables that preserve the smoothness of the system dynamics and to construct a vector field representing the system's dynamics equation, automatically from video streams without prior physical knowledge. The prominence and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative analyses of various dynamical systems, including the prediction of characteristic frequencies and the identification of chaotic and limit cycle behaviors. This shows the potential of our approach to assist human scientists in scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Arakelyan, Pasquale Minervini, Pat Verga, Patrick Lewis, Isabelle Augenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce \textbf{F}aithful \textbf{L}ogic-\textbf{A}ided \textbf{R}easoning and \textbf{E}xploration (\textbf{\ours}), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that {\textbf{\ours}} allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.</p>

<p>Abstract: Communication is a prerequisite for collaboration. When scaling networks of AI-powered agents, communication must be versatile, efficient, and portable. These requisites, which we refer to as the Agent Communication Trilemma, are hard to achieve in large networks of agents. We introduce Agora, a meta protocol that leverages existing communication standards to make LLM-powered agents solve complex problems efficiently. In Agora, agents typically use standardised routines for frequent communications, natural language for rare communications, and LLM-written routines for everything in between. Agora sidesteps the Agent Communication Trilemma and robustly handles changes in interfaces and members, allowing unprecedented scalability with full decentralisation and minimal involvement of human beings. On large Agora networks, we observe the emergence of self-organising, fully automated protocols that achieve complex goals without human intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Hussein, Mukesh Prasad, Ali Braytee</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in high-throughput technologies have led to a shift from traditional hypothesis-driven methodologies to data-driven approaches. Multi-omics refers to the integrative analysis of data derived from multiple 'omes', such as genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics. This approach enables a comprehensive understanding of biological systems by capturing different layers of biological information. Deep learning methods are increasingly utilized to integrate multi-omics data, offering insights into molecular interactions and enhancing research into complex diseases. However, these models, with their numerous interconnected layers and nonlinear relationships, often function as black boxes, lacking transparency in decision-making processes. To overcome this challenge, explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods are crucial for creating transparent models that allow clinicians to interpret and work with complex data more effectively. This review explores how xAI can improve the interpretability of deep learning models in multi-omics research, highlighting its potential to provide clinicians with clear insights, thereby facilitating the effective application of such models in clinical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-training machine learning models on molecular properties has proven effective for generating robust and generalizable representations, which is critical for advancements in drug discovery and materials science. While recent work has primarily focused on data-driven approaches, the KANO model introduces a novel paradigm by incorporating knowledge-enhanced pre-training. In this work, we expand upon KANO by integrating the large-scale ChEBI knowledge graph, which includes 2,840 functional groups -- significantly more than the original 82 used in KANO. We explore two approaches, Replace and Integrate, to incorporate this extensive knowledge into the KANO framework. Our results demonstrate that including ChEBI leads to improved performance on 9 out of 14 molecular property prediction datasets. This highlights the importance of utilizing a larger and more diverse set of functional groups to enhance molecular representations for property predictions.

<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular hemodynamic fields provide valuable medical decision markers for coronary artery disease. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the gold standard for accurate, non-invasive evaluation of these quantities in vivo. In this work, we propose a time-efficient surrogate model, powered by machine learning, for the estimation of pulsatile hemodynamics based on steady-state priors. We introduce deep vectorised operators, a modelling framework for discretisation independent learning on infinite-dimensional function spaces. The underlying neural architecture is a neural field conditioned on hemodynamic boundary conditions. Importantly, we show how relaxing the requirement of point-wise action to permutation-equivariance leads to a family of models that can be parametrised by message passing and self-attention layers. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 74 stenotic coronary arteries extracted from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with patient-specific pulsatile CFD simulations as ground truth. We show that our model produces accurate estimates of the pulsatile velocity and pressure while being agnostic to re-sampling of the source domain (discretisation independence). This shows that deep vectorised operators are a powerful modelling tool for cardiovascular hemodynamics estimation in coronary arteries and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Xu, Artem Moskalev, Tommaso Mansi, Mangal Prakash, Rui Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA properties, such as stability and interactions, is crucial for advancing our understanding of biological processes and developing RNA-based therapeutics. RNA structures can be represented as 1D sequences, 2D topological graphs, or 3D all-atom models, each offering different insights into its function. Existing works predominantly focus on 1D sequence-based models, which overlook the geometric context provided by 2D and 3D geometries. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of incorporating explicit 2D and 3D geometric information into RNA property prediction, considering not only performance but also real-world challenges such as limited data availability, partial labeling, sequencing noise, and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a newly curated set of RNA datasets with enhanced 2D and 3D structural annotations, providing a resource for model evaluation on RNA data. Our findings reveal that models with explicit geometry encoding generally outperform sequence-based models, with an average prediction RMSE reduction of around 12% across all various RNA tasks and excelling in low-data and partial labeling regimes, underscoring the value of explicitly incorporating geometric context. On the other hand, geometry-unaware sequence-based models are more robust under sequencing noise but often require around 2-5x training data to match the performance of geometry-aware models. Our study offers further insights into the trade-offs between different RNA representations in practical applications and addresses a significant gap in evaluating deep learning models for RNA tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Characterizing a quantum system by learning its state or evolution is a fundamental problem in quantum physics and learning theory with a myriad of applications. Recently, as a new approach to this problem, the task of agnostic state tomography was defined, in which one aims to approximate an arbitrary quantum state by a simpler one in a given class. Generalizing this notion to quantum processes, we initiate the study of agnostic process tomography: given query access to an unknown quantum channel $\Phi$ and a known concept class $\mathcal{C}$ of channels, output a quantum channel that approximates $\Phi$ as well as any channel in the concept class $\mathcal{C}$, up to some error. In this work, we propose several natural applications for this new task in quantum machine learning, quantum metrology, classical simulation, and error mitigation. In addition, we give efficient agnostic process tomography algorithms for a wide variety of concept classes, including Pauli strings, Pauli channels, quantum junta channels, low-degree channels, and a class of channels produced by $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits. The main technical tool we use is Pauli spectrum analysis of operators and superoperators. We also prove that, using ancilla qubits, any agnostic state tomography algorithm can be extended to one solving agnostic process tomography for a compatible concept class of unitaries, immediately giving us efficient agnostic learning algorithms for Clifford circuits, Clifford circuits with few T gates, and circuits consisting of a tensor product of single-qubit gates. Together, our results provide insight into the conditions and new algorithms necessary to extend the learnability of a concept class from the standard tomographic setting to the agnostic one.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the past utilities relied on in-field inspections to identify asset defects. Recently, utilities have started using drone-based inspections to enhance the field-inspection process. We consider a vast repository of drone images, providing a wealth of information about asset health and potential issues. However, making the collected imagery data useful for automated defect detection requires significant manual labeling effort. We propose a novel solution that combines synthetic asset defect images with manually labeled drone images. This solution has several benefits: improves performance of defect detection, reduces the number of hours spent on manual labeling, and enables the capability to generate realistic images of rare defects where not enough real-world data is available. We employ a workflow that combines 3D modeling tools such as Maya and Unreal Engine to create photorealistic 3D models and 2D renderings of defective assets and their surroundings. These synthetic images are then integrated into our training pipeline augmenting the real data. This study implements an end-to-end Artificial Intelligence solution to detect assets and asset defects from the combined imagery repository. The unique contribution of this research lies in the application of advanced computer vision models and the generation of photorealistic 3D renderings of defective assets, aiming to transform the asset inspection process. Our asset detection model has achieved an accuracy of 92 percent, we achieved a performance lift of 67 percent when introducing approximately 2,000 synthetic images of 2k resolution. In our tests, the defect detection model achieved an accuracy of 73 percent across two batches of images. Our analysis demonstrated that synthetic data can be successfully used in place of real-world manually labeled data to train defect detection model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs are present in various domains, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and biological networks. Unlike homogeneous graphs, heterogeneous graphs consist of multiple types of nodes and edges, each representing different entities and relationships. Generating realistic heterogeneous graphs that capture the complex interactions among diverse entities is a difficult task due to several reasons. The generator has to model both the node type distribution along with the feature distribution for each node type. In this paper, we look into solving challenges in heterogeneous graph generation, by employing a two phase hierarchical structure, wherein the first phase creates a skeleton graph with node types using a prior diffusion based model and in the second phase, we use an encoder and a sampler structure as generator to assign node type specific features to the nodes. A discriminator is used to guide training of the generator and feature vectors are sampled from a node feature pool. We conduct extensive experiments with subsets of IMDB and DBLP datasets to show the effectiveness of our method and also the need for various architecture components.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in real-world applications, yet little is known about their training dynamics at the token level. Evaluation typically relies on aggregated training loss, measured at the batch level, which overlooks subtle per-token biases arising from (i) varying token-level dynamics and (ii) structural biases introduced by hyperparameters. While weight decay is commonly used to stabilize training, we reveal that it silently introduces performance biases detectable only at the token level. In fact, we empirically show across different dataset sizes, model architectures and sizes ranging from 270M to 3B parameters that as weight decay increases, low-frequency tokens are disproportionately depreciated. This is particularly concerning, as these neglected low-frequency tokens represent the vast majority of the token distribution in most languages, calling for novel regularization techniques that ensure fairness across all available tokens.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, including language modeling, understanding, and generation. However, the increased memory and computational costs associated with these models pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-limited devices. Structural pruning has emerged as a promising solution to reduce the costs of LLMs without requiring post-processing steps. Prior structural pruning methods either follow the dependence of structures at the cost of limiting flexibility, or introduce non-trivial additional parameters by incorporating different projection matrices. In this work, we propose a novel approach that relaxes the constraint imposed by regular structural pruning methods and eliminates the structural dependence along the embedding dimension. Our dimension-independent structural pruning method offers several benefits. Firstly, our method enables different blocks to utilize different subsets of the feature maps. Secondly, by removing structural dependence, we facilitate each block to possess varying widths along its input and output dimensions, thereby significantly enhancing the flexibility of structural pruning. We evaluate our method on various LLMs, including OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA-2, Phi-1.5, and Phi-2. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, showing for the first time that structural pruning can achieve an accuracy similar to semi-structural pruning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zesen Wang, Jiaojiao Zhang, Xuyang Wu, Mikael Johansson</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized training of deep neural networks has attracted significant attention for its theoretically superior scalability over synchronous data-parallel methods like All-Reduce. However, realizing this potential in multi-node training is challenging due to the complex design space that involves communication topologies, computation patterns, and optimization algorithms. This paper identifies three key factors that can lead to speedups over All-Reduce training and constructs a runtime model to determine when, how, and to what degree decentralization can yield shorter per-iteration runtimes. Furthermore, to support the decentralized training of transformer-based models, we study a decentralized Adam algorithm that allows for overlapping communications and computations, prove its convergence, and propose an accumulation technique to mitigate the high variance caused by small local batch sizes. We deploy the proposed approach in clusters with up to 64 GPUs and demonstrate its practicality and advantages in both runtime and generalization performance under a fixed iteration budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jules Berman, Tobias Blickhan, Benjamin Peherstorfer</p>
<p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to learn models of population dynamics of physical systems that feature stochastic and mean-field effects and that depend on physics parameters. The learned models can act as surrogates of classical numerical models to efficiently predict the system behavior over the physics parameters. Building on the Benamou-Brenier formula from optimal transport and action matching, we use a variational problem to infer parameter- and time-dependent gradient fields that represent approximations of the population dynamics. The inferred gradient fields can then be used to rapidly generate sample trajectories that mimic the dynamics of the physical system on a population level over varying physics parameters. We show that combining Monte Carlo sampling with higher-order quadrature rules is critical for accurately estimating the training objective from sample data and for stabilizing the training process. We demonstrate on Vlasov-Poisson instabilities as well as on high-dimensional particle and chaotic systems that our approach accurately predicts population dynamics over a wide range of parameters and outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based modeling that simply condition on time and physics parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work contributes to breast cancer sub-type classification using histopathological images. We utilize masked autoencoders (MAEs) to learn a self-supervised embedding tailored for computer vision tasks in this domain. This embedding captures informative representations of histopathological data, facilitating feature learning without extensive labeled datasets. During pre-training, we investigate employing a random crop technique to generate a large dataset from WSIs automatically. Additionally, we assess the performance of linear probes for multi-class classification tasks of cancer sub-types using the representations learnt by the MAE. Our approach aims to achieve strong performance on downstream tasks by leveraging the complementary strengths of ViTs and autoencoders. We evaluate our model's performance on the BRACS dataset and compare it with existing benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanyue Xie, Zhi Zhang, Ding Zhou, Cong Xie, Ziang Song, Xin Liu, Yanzhi Wang, Xue Lin, An Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures face challenges such as high memory consumption and redundancy in experts. Pruning MoE can reduce network weights while maintaining model performance. Motivated by the recent observation of emergent large magnitude features in Large Language Models (LLM) and MoE routing policy, we propose MoE-Pruner, a method that prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations and router weights, on each output neuron. Our pruning method is one-shot, requiring no retraining or weight updates. We evaluate our method on Mixtral-8x7B and Mixtral-8x22B across multiple language benchmarks. Experimental results show that our pruning method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM pruning methods. Furthermore, our pruned MoE models can benefit from a pretrained teacher model through expert-wise knowledge distillation, improving performance post-pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Mixtral-8x7B model with 50% sparsity maintains 99% of the performance of the original model after the expert-wise knowledge distillation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mithun Manivannan (New Jersey Institute of Technology), Vignesh Nethrapalli (New Jersey Institute of Technology), Mark Cartwright (New Jersey Institute of Technology)</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in audio-language modeling, such as automated audio captioning, has benefited from training on synthetic data generated with the aid of large-language models. However, such approaches for environmental sound captioning have primarily focused on audio event tags and have not explored leveraging emotional information that may be present in recordings. In this work, we explore the benefit of generating emotion-augmented synthetic audio caption data by instructing ChatGPT with additional acoustic information in the form of estimated soundscape emotion. To do so, we introduce EmotionCaps, an audio captioning dataset comprised of approximately 120,000 audio clips with paired synthetic descriptions enriched with soundscape emotion recognition (SER) information. We hypothesize that this additional information will result in higher-quality captions that match the emotional tone of the audio recording, which will, in turn, improve the performance of captioning models trained with this data. We test this hypothesis through both objective and subjective evaluation, comparing models trained with the EmotionCaps dataset to multiple baseline models. Our findings challenge current approaches to captioning and suggest new directions for developing and assessing captioning models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) technologies has led to a surge in power consumption across diverse systems, from tiny IoT devices to massive datacenter clusters. Benchmarking the energy efficiency of these systems is crucial for optimization, but presents novel challenges due to the variety of hardware platforms, workload characteristics, and system-level interactions. This paper introduces MLPerf Power, a comprehensive benchmarking methodology with capabilities to evaluate the energy efficiency of ML systems at power levels ranging from microwatts to megawatts. Developed by a consortium of industry professionals from more than 20 organizations, MLPerf Power establishes rules and best practices to ensure comparability across diverse architectures. We use representative workloads from the MLPerf benchmark suite to collect 1,841 reproducible measurements from 60 systems across the entire range of ML deployment scales. Our analysis reveals trade-offs between performance, complexity, and energy efficiency across this wide range of systems, providing actionable insights for designing optimized ML solutions from the smallest edge devices to the largest cloud infrastructures. This work emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency as a key metric in the evaluation and comparison of the ML system, laying the foundation for future research in this critical area. We discuss the implications for developing sustainable AI solutions and standardizing energy efficiency benchmarking for ML systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kam\'elia Daudel, Fran\c{c}ois Roueff</p>
<p>Abstract: Several popular variational bounds involving importance weighting ideas have been proposed to generalize and improve on the Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) in the context of maximum likelihood optimization, such as the Importance Weighted Auto-Encoder (IWAE) and the Variational R\'enyi (VR) bounds. The methodology to learn the parameters of interest using these bounds typically amounts to running gradient-based variational inference algorithms that incorporate the reparameterization trick. However, the way the choice of the variational bound impacts the outcome of variational inference algorithms can be unclear. Recently, the VR-IWAE bound was introduced as a variational bound that unifies the ELBO, IWAE and VR bounds methodologies. In this paper, we provide two analyses for the reparameterized and doubly-reparameterized gradient estimators of the VR-IWAE bound, which reveal the advantages and limitations of these gradient estimators while enabling us to compare of the ELBO, IWAE and VR bounds methodologies. Our work advances the understanding of importance weighted variational inference methods and we illustrate our theoretical findings empirically.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paula Cordero-Encinar, Tobias Schr\"oder, Peter Yatsyshin, Andrew Duncan</p>
<p>Abstract: Selecting cost-effective optimal sensor configurations for subsequent inference of parameters in black-box stochastic systems faces significant computational barriers. We propose a novel and robust approach, modelling the joint distribution over input parameters and solution with a joint energy-based model, trained on simulation data. Unlike existing simulation-based inference approaches, which must be tied to a specific set of point evaluations, we learn a functional representation of parameters and solution. This is used as a resolution-independent plug-and-play surrogate for the joint distribution, which can be conditioned over any set of points, permitting an efficient approach to sensor placement. We demonstrate the validity of our framework on a variety of stochastic problems, showing that our method provides highly informative sensor locations at a lower computational cost compared to conventional approaches.</p>

Specifically, given a trust graph where vertices correspond to parties and neighbors are mutually trusting, we give a DP algorithm for aggregation with a much better privacy-utility trade-off than in the well-studied local model of DP (where each party trusts no other party). We further study a robust variant where each party trusts all but an unknown subset of at most $t$ of its neighbors (where $t$ is a given parameter), and give an algorithm for this setting. We complement our algorithms with lower bounds, and discuss implications of our work to other tasks in private learning and analytics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Petr Tsvetkov, Aleksandra Eliseeva, Danny Dig, Alexander Bezzubov, Yaroslav Golubev, Timofey Bryksin, Yaroslav Zharov</p>
<p>Abstract: Commit message generation (CMG) is a crucial task in software engineering that is challenging to evaluate correctly. When a CMG system is integrated into the IDEs and other products at JetBrains, we perform online evaluation based on user acceptance of the generated messages. However, performing online experiments with every change to a CMG system is troublesome, as each iteration affects users and requires time to collect enough statistics. On the other hand, offline evaluation, a prevalent approach in the research literature, facilitates fast experiments but employs automatic metrics that are not guaranteed to represent the preferences of real users. In this work, we describe a novel way we employed to deal with this problem at JetBrains, by leveraging an online metric - the number of edits users introduce before committing the generated messages to the VCS - to select metrics for offline experiments.
  To support this new type of evaluation, we develop a novel markup collection tool mimicking the real workflow with a CMG system, collect a dataset with 57 pairs consisting of commit messages generated by GPT-4 and their counterparts edited by human experts, and design and verify a way to synthetically extend such a dataset. Then, we use the final dataset of 656 pairs to study how the widely used similarity metrics correlate with the online metric reflecting the real users' experience.
  Our results indicate that edit distance exhibits the highest correlation, whereas commonly used similarity metrics such as BLEU and METEOR demonstrate low correlation. This contradicts the previous studies on similarity metrics for CMG, suggesting that user interactions with a CMG system in real-world settings differ significantly from the responses by human labelers operating within controlled research environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiushi Lin, Hang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a decentralized version of Moving Agents in Formation (MAiF), a variant of Multi-Agent Path Finding aiming to plan collision-free paths for multiple agents with the dual objectives of reaching their goals quickly while maintaining a desired formation. The agents must balance these objectives under conditions of partial observation and limited communication. The formation maintenance depends on the joint state of all agents, whose dimensionality increases exponentially with the number of agents, rendering the learning process intractable. Additionally, learning a single policy that can accommodate different linear preferences for these two objectives presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose Mean-Field Control with Envelop $Q$-learning (MFC-EQ), a scalable and adaptable learning framework for this bi-objective multi-agent problem. We approximate the dynamics of all agents using mean-field theory while learning a universal preference-agnostic policy through envelop $Q$-learning. Our empirical evaluation of MFC-EQ across numerous instances shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art centralized MAiF baselines. Furthermore, MFC-EQ effectively handles more complex scenarios where the desired formation changes dynamically -- a challenge that existing MAiF planners cannot address.</p>

Using an enhanced LegalLens dataset covering labor, privacy, and consumer protection domains, 38 teams participated in the task. Our analysis reveals that while a mix of approaches was used, the top-performing teams in both tasks consistently relied on fine-tuning pre-trained language models, outperforming legal-specific models and few-shot methods. The top-performing team achieved a 7.11% improvement in NER over the baseline, while NLI saw a more marginal improvement of 5.7%.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into software products across diverse industries, enhancing user experiences, but at the same time introducing numerous challenges for developers. Unique characteristics of LLMs force developers, who are accustomed to traditional software development and evaluation, out of their comfort zones as the LLM components shatter standard assumptions about software systems. This study explores the emerging solutions that software developers are adopting to navigate the encountered challenges. Leveraging a mixed-method research, including 26 interviews and a survey with 332 responses, the study identifies 19 emerging solutions regarding quality assurance that practitioners across several product teams at Microsoft are exploring. The findings provide valuable insights that can guide the development and evaluation of LLM-based products more broadly in the face of these challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christiaan M. Geldenhuys, Thomas R. Niesler</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of detecting, isolating and classifying elephant calls in continuously recorded audio. Such automatic call characterisation can assist conservation efforts and inform environmental management strategies. In contrast to previous work in which call detection was performed at a segment level, we perform call detection at a frame level which implicitly also allows call endpointing, the isolation of a call in a longer recording. For experimentation, we employ two annotated datasets, one containing Asian and the other African elephant vocalisations. We evaluate several shallow and deep classifier models, and show that the current best performance can be improved by using an audio spectrogram transformer (AST), a neural architecture which has not been used for this purpose before, and which we have configured in a novel sequence-to-sequence manner. We also show that using transfer learning by pre-training leads to further improvements both in terms of computational complexity and performance. Finally, we consider sub-call classification using an accepted taxonomy of call types, a task which has not previously been considered. We show that also in this case the transformer architectures provide the best performance. Our best classifiers achieve an average precision (AP) of 0.962 for framewise binary call classification, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.957 and 0.979 for call classification with 5 classes and sub-call classification with 7 classes respectively. All of these represent either new benchmarks (sub-call classifications) or improvements on previously best systems. We conclude that a fully-automated elephant call detection and subcall classification system is within reach. Such a system would provide valuable information on the behaviour and state of elephant herds for the purposes of conservation and management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphs have been widely used in the past decades of big data and AI to model comprehensive relational data. When analyzing a graph's statistical properties, graph laws serve as essential tools for parameterizing its structure. Identifying meaningful graph laws can significantly enhance the effectiveness of various applications, such as graph generation and link prediction. Facing the large-scale foundation model developments nowadays, the study of graph laws reveals new research potential, e.g., providing multi-modal information for graph neural representation learning and breaking the domain inconsistency of different graph data. In this survey, we first review the previous study of graph laws from multiple perspectives, i.e., macroscope and microscope of graphs, low-order and high-order graphs, static and dynamic graphs, different observation spaces, and newly proposed graph parameters. After we review various real-world applications benefiting from the guidance of graph laws, we conclude the paper with current challenges and future research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose Table-LLM-Specialist, or Table-Specialist for short, as a new self-trained fine-tuning paradigm specifically designed for table tasks. Our insight is that for each table task, there often exist two dual versions of the same task, one generative and one classification in nature. Leveraging their duality, we propose a Generator-Validator paradigm, to iteratively generate-then-validate training data from language-models, to fine-tune stronger \sys models that can specialize in a given task, without requiring manually-labeled data.
  Our extensive evaluations suggest that our Table-Specialist has (1) \textit{strong performance} on diverse table tasks over vanilla language-models -- for example, Table-Specialist fine-tuned on GPT-3.5 not only outperforms vanilla GPT-3.5, but can often match or surpass GPT-4 level quality, (2) \textit{lower cost} to deploy, because when Table-Specialist fine-tuned on GPT-3.5 achieve GPT-4 level quality, it becomes possible to deploy smaller models with lower latency and inference cost, with comparable quality, and (3) \textit{better generalizability} when evaluated across multiple benchmarks, since \sys is fine-tuned on a broad range of training data systematically generated from diverse real tables.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lian Liu, Haimeng Ren, Long Cheng, Zhaohui Xu, Yudong Pan, Mengdi Wang, Xiaowei Li, Yinhe Han, Ying Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization is a widely-used compression technology to reduce the overhead of serving large language models (LLMs) on terminal devices and in cloud data centers. However, prevalent quantization methods, such as 8-bit weight-activation or 4-bit weight-only quantization, achieve limited performance improvements due to poor support for low-precision (e.g., 4-bit) activation. This work, for the first time, realizes practical W4A4KV4 serving for LLMs, fully utilizing the INT4 tensor cores on modern GPUs and reducing the memory bottleneck caused by the KV cache. Specifically, we propose a novel fine-grained mixed-precision quantization algorithm (FMPQ) that compresses most activations into 4-bit with negligible accuracy loss. To support mixed-precision matrix multiplication for W4A4 and W4A8, we develop a highly optimized W4Ax kernel. Our approach introduces a novel mixed-precision data layout to facilitate access and fast dequantization for activation and weight tensors, utilizing the GPU's software pipeline to hide the overhead of data loading and conversion. Additionally, we propose fine-grained streaming multiprocessor (SM) scheduling to achieve load balance across different SMs. We integrate the optimized W4Ax kernel into our inference framework, COMET, and provide efficient management to support popular LLMs such as LLaMA-3-70B. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, when running LLaMA family models on a single A100-80G-SMX4, COMET achieves a kernel-level speedup of \textbf{$2.88\times$} over cuBLAS and a \textbf{$2.02 \times$} throughput improvement compared to TensorRT-LLM from an end-to-end framework perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brahim Mefgouda, Raviha Khan, Omar Alhussein, Hani Saleh, Hossien B. Eldeeb, Anshul Pandey, Sami Muhaidat</p>
<p>Abstract: By 2025, the internet of things (IoT) is projected to connect over 75 billion devices globally, fundamentally altering how we interact with our environments in both urban and rural settings. However, IoT device security remains challenging, particularly in the authentication process. Traditional cryptographic methods often struggle with the constraints of IoT devices, such as limited computational power and storage. This paper considers physical unclonable functions (PUFs) as robust security solutions, utilizing their inherent physical uniqueness to authenticate devices securely. However, traditional PUF systems are vulnerable to machine learning (ML) attacks and burdened by large datasets. Our proposed solution introduces a lightweight PUF mechanism, called LPUF-AuthNet, combining tandem neural networks (TNN) with a split learning (SL) paradigm. The proposed approach provides scalability, supports mutual authentication, and enhances security by resisting various types of attacks, paving the way for secure integration into future 6G technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianren Zhang, Xianfeng Tang, Hui Liu, Zongyu Wu, Qi He, Dongwon Lee, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies show that LLMs, particularly open-source models, struggle to follow complex instructions with multiple constraints. Despite the importance, methods to improve LLMs' adherence to such constraints remain unexplored, and current research focuses on evaluating this ability rather than developing solutions. While a few studies enhance constraint adherence through model tuning, this approach is computationally expensive and heavily reliant on training data quality. An alternative is to leverage LLMs' self-correction capabilities, allowing them to adjust responses to better meet specified constraints. However, this self-correction ability of LLMs is limited by the feedback quality, as LLMs cannot autonomously generate reliable feedback or detect errors. Moreover, the self-refinement process heavily depends on few-shot examples that illustrate how to modify responses to meet constraints. As constraints in complex instructions are diverse and vary widely, manually crafting few-shot examples for each constraint type can be labor-intensive and sub-optimal. To deal with these two challenges, we propose the Divide-Verify-Refine (DVR) framework with three steps: (1) Divide complex instructions into single constraints and prepare appropriate tools; (2) Verify: To address the feedback quality problem, these tools will rigorously verify responses and provide reliable feedback; (3) Refine: To address the constraint diversity challenge, we design a refinement repository that collects successful refinement processes and uses them as few-shot demonstrations for future cases, allowing LLMs to learn from the past experience during inference. Additionally, we develop a new dataset of complex instructions, each containing 1-6 constraints. Experiments show that the framework significantly improves performance, doubling LLama3.1-8B's constraint adherence on instructions with 6 constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyu Zhou, Limin Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, censored quantile regression has enjoyed an increasing popularity for survival analysis while many existing works rely on linearity assumptions. In this work, we propose a Global Censored Quantile Random Forest (GCQRF) for predicting a conditional quantile process on data subject to right censoring, a forest-based flexible, competitive method able to capture complex nonlinear relationships. Taking into account the randomness in trees and connecting the proposed method to a randomized incomplete infinite degree U-process (IDUP), we quantify the prediction process' variation without assuming an infinite forest and establish its weak convergence. Moreover, feature importance ranking measures based on out-of-sample predictive accuracy are proposed. We demonstrate the superior predictive accuracy of the proposed method over a number of existing alternatives and illustrate the use of the proposed importance ranking measures on both simulated and real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> D. W. Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, new attractions ways are tended to be adapted by compelling sites to provide tours product and services, such as virtual reality (VR) to visitors. Based on a systematic human-computer interaction (HCI) user engagement and Narrative transportation theory, we develop and test a theoretical framework using a hybrid partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) machine learning approach that examines key user engagement drivers of visitors' imagery and in-person tour intentions (ITI) during COVID-19. Further, we proposed a novel and hybrid approach called Reflective and Formative PLS-SEM-ANN (FRPSA) with considering both reflective and second-order formative constructs in PLS-SEM giving scope to their different advantages in a complex model. According to a sample of visitors' responses, the results demonstrate that a) user engagement, including felt involvement, aesthetic appeal, perceived usability, focused attention, endurability, and novelty, all directly affect in-person tour intentions; b) environment concern of touristic travel (EC) positively moderates the relationships between user engagement and ITI; c) EC negatively moderates the relationships between imagery and ITI; d) imagery exerts the mediating effect between user engagement and ITI; e) the felt involvement and aesthetic appeal show both the linear significance impact and nonlinear importance. Finally, contributions to theories and practical implications are discussed accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Zheng Terence Ng, Jianda Chen, Sinno Jialin Pan, Tianwei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying a safe mobile robot policy in scenarios with human pedestrians is challenging due to their unpredictable movements. Current Reinforcement Learning-based motion planners rely on a single policy to simulate pedestrian movements and could suffer from the over-fitting issue. Alternatively, framing the collision avoidance problem as a multi-agent framework, where agents generate dynamic movements while learning to reach their goals, can lead to conflicts with human pedestrians due to their homogeneity.
  To tackle this problem, we introduce an efficient method that enhances agent diversity within a single policy by maximizing an information-theoretic objective. This diversity enriches each agent's experiences, improving its adaptability to unseen crowd behaviors. In assessing an agent's robustness against unseen crowds, we propose diverse scenarios inspired by pedestrian crowd behaviors. Our behavior-conditioned policies outperform existing works in these challenging scenes, reducing potential collisions without additional time or travel.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanming Huang, Aoran Shen, Yuxiang Hu, Junliang Du, Jiacheng Hu, Yingbin Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of knowledge distillation technology in target detection tasks, especially the impact of different distillation temperatures on the performance of student models. By using YOLOv5l as the teacher network and a smaller YOLOv5s as the student network, we found that with the increase of distillation temperature, the student's detection accuracy gradually improved, and finally achieved mAP50 and mAP50-95 indicators that were better than the original YOLOv5s model at a specific temperature. Experimental results show that appropriate knowledge distillation strategies can not only improve the accuracy of the model but also help improve the reliability and stability of the model in practical applications. This paper also records in detail the accuracy curve and loss function descent curve during the model training process and shows that the model converges to a stable state after 150 training cycles. These findings provide a theoretical basis and technical reference for further optimizing target detection algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowei Jiang, Beining Cao, Liang Ou, Yu-Cheng Chang, Thomas Do, Chin-Teng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) has significantly influenced the domain of human-computer interaction, with Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) emerging as a notably robust paradigm. This study explores advanced classification techniques leveraging interpretable fuzzy transfer learning (iFuzzyTL) to enhance the adaptability and performance of SSVEP-based systems. Recent efforts have strengthened to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification. However, these methods often require complex tuning and extensive data, limiting immediate applicability. iFuzzyTL introduces an adaptive framework that combines fuzzy logic principles with neural network architectures, focusing on efficient knowledge transfer and domain adaptation. iFuzzyTL refines input signal processing and classification in a human-interpretable format by integrating fuzzy inference systems and attention mechanisms. This approach bolsters the model's precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data. The model's efficacy is demonstrated across three datasets: 12JFPM (89.70% accuracy for 1s with an information transfer rate (ITR) of 149.58), Benchmark (85.81% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 213.99), and eldBETA (76.50% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 94.63), achieving state-of-the-art results and setting new benchmarks for SSVEP BCI performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Sonkar, Xinghe Chen, Naiming Liu, Richard G. Baraniuk, Mrinmaya Sachan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately modeling student cognition is crucial for developing effective AI-driven educational technologies. A key challenge is creating realistic student models that satisfy two essential properties: (1) accurately replicating specific misconceptions, and (2) correctly solving problems where these misconceptions are not applicable. This dual requirement reflects the complex nature of student understanding, where misconceptions coexist with correct knowledge. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can be instruction-tuned to meet this dual requirement and effectively simulate student thinking in algebra. We introduce MalAlgoPy, a novel Python library that generates datasets reflecting authentic student solution patterns through a graph-based representation of algebraic problem-solving. Utilizing MalAlgoPy, we define and examine Cognitive Student Models (CSMs) - LLMs instruction tuned to faithfully emulate realistic student behavior. Our findings reveal that LLMs trained on misconception examples can efficiently learn to replicate errors. However, the training diminishes the model's ability to solve problems correctly, particularly for problem types where the misconceptions are not applicable, thus failing to satisfy second property of CSMs. We demonstrate that by carefully calibrating the ratio of correct to misconception examples in the training data - sometimes as low as 0.25 - it is possible to develop CSMs that satisfy both properties. Our insights enhance our understanding of AI-based student models and pave the way for effective adaptive learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Cao, Tong Wu, Zhiyong Chen, Yin Xu, Meixia Tao, Wenjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task, multi-link relay semantic communications (MTML-RSC) scheme that enables the destination node to simultaneously perform image reconstruction and classification with one transmission from the source node. In the MTML-RSC scheme, the source node broadcasts a signal using semantic communications, and the relay node forwards the signal to the destination. We analyze the coupling relationship between the two tasks and the two links (source-to-relay and source-to-destination) and design a semantic-focused forward method for the relay node, where it selectively forwards only the semantics of the relevant class while ignoring others. At the destination, the node combines signals from both the source node and the relay node to perform classification, and then uses the classification result to assist in decoding the signal from the relay node for image reconstructing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MTML-RSC scheme achieves significant performance gains, e.g., $1.73$ dB improvement in peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for image reconstruction and increasing the accuracy from $64.89\%$ to $70.31\%$ for classification.</p>

We propose robust subsampling techniques, specifically Adaptive Importance Sampling (AIS) and Stratified Subsampling, designed to enhance the reliability and efficiency of parameter estimation. Under some clearly outlined conditions, we establish consistency and asymptotic normality for the proposed estimators, providing non-asymptotic error bounds that quantify their performance. Our theoretical foundations are complemented by controlled experiments demonstrating the superiority of our methods over conventional approaches. By bridging the gap between theory and practice, this work offers significant contributions to robust statistical estimation, paving the way for advancements in various applied domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel Bayesian tomography approach for Coherence Imaging Spectroscopy (CIS) that simultaneously reconstructs ion temperature and velocity distributions in plasmas. Utilizing nonlinear Gaussian Process Tomography (GPT) with the Laplace approximation, we model prior distributions of log-emissivity, temperature, and velocity as Gaussian processes. This framework rigorously incorporates nonlinear effects and temperature dependencies often neglected in conventional CIS tomography, enabling robust reconstruction even in the region of high temperature and velocity. By applying a log-Gaussian process, we also address issues like velocity divergence in low-emissivity regions. Validated with phantom simulations and experimental data from the RT-1 device, our method reveals detailed spatial structures of ion temperature and toroidal ion flow characteristic of magnetospheric plasma. This work significantly broadens the scope of CIS tomography, offering a robust tool for plasma diagnostics and facilitating integration with complementary measurement techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchao Pang, Zhigang Lu, Haichen Wang, Peng Fu, Yongbin Zhou, Minhui Xue, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the de facto privacy standard against privacy leakage attacks, including many recently discovered ones against large language models (LLMs). However, we discovered that LLMs could reconstruct the altered/removed privacy from given DP-sanitized prompts. We propose two attacks (black-box and white-box) based on the accessibility to LLMs and show that LLMs could connect the pair of DP-sanitized text and the corresponding private training data of LLMs by giving sample text pairs as instructions (in the black-box attacks) or fine-tuning data (in the white-box attacks). To illustrate our findings, we conduct comprehensive experiments on modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-4o, Claude-3, Claude-3.5, OPT, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, Gemma-2, and Pythia) using commonly used datasets (such as WikiMIA, Pile-CC, and Pile-Wiki) against both word-level and sentence-level DP. The experimental results show promising recovery rates, e.g., the black-box attacks against the word-level DP over WikiMIA dataset gave 72.18% on LLaMA-2 (70B), 82.39% on LLaMA-3 (70B), 75.35% on Gemma-2, 91.2% on ChatGPT-4o, and 94.01% on Claude-3.5 (Sonnet). More urgently, this study indicates that these well-known LLMs have emerged as a new security risk for existing DP text sanitization approaches in the current environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongduan Tian, Feng Liu, Zhanke Zhou, Tongliang Liu, Chengqi Zhang, Bo Han</p>
<p>Abstract: In cross-domain few-shot classification (CFC), recent works mainly focus on adapting a simple transformation head on top of a frozen pre-trained backbone with few labeled data to project embeddings into a task-specific metric space where classification can be performed by measuring similarities between image instance and prototype representations. Technically, an assumption implicitly adopted in such a framework is that the prototype and image instance embeddings share the same representation transformation. However, in this paper, we find that there naturally exists a gap, which resembles the modality gap, between the prototype and image instance embeddings extracted from the frozen pre-trained backbone, and simply applying the same transformation during the adaptation phase constrains exploring the optimal representations and shrinks the gap between prototype and image representations. To solve this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method, contrastive prototype-image adaptation (CoPA), to adapt different transformations respectively for prototypes and images similarly to CLIP by treating prototypes as text prompts. Extensive experiments on Meta-Dataset demonstrate that CoPA achieves the state-of-the-art performance more efficiently. Meanwhile, further analyses also indicate that CoPA can learn better representation clusters, enlarge the gap, and achieve minimal validation loss at the enlarged gap.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) exhibits promise in the clinical domain. However, it is constrained by data scarcity and ethical considerations, as the generation of clinical trials presents significant challenges due to stringent privacy regulations, high costs, and the extended duration required for conducting studies with human participants. Despite the advancements of large language models (LLMs) in general generation tasks, their potential in facilitating the generation of synthetic clinical trials is under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Retrieval-Reasoning few-shot framework that leverages LLMs to generate artificial yet realistic and diverse clinical trials with binary success/failure labels. Experiments conducted on real clinical trials from the \url{ClinicalTrials.gov} database demonstrate that our synthetic data can effectively augment real datasets. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pre-trained model as a binary classifier on synthetic clinical trial datasets, we demonstrate that this augmentation enhances model training for downstream tasks such as trial outcome prediction. Our findings suggest that LLMs for synthetic clinical trial generation hold promise for accelerating clinical research and upholding ethical standards for patient privacy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqin Xu, Huan Li, Ke Chen, Lidan Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Schema and entity matching tasks are crucial for data integration and management. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in these tasks, they suffer from hallucinations and confusion about task instructions. In this paper, we present the Knowledge-Compliant Matching Framework (KcMF), an LLM-based approach that addresses these issues without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. KcMF employs a pseudo-code-based task decomposition strategy to adopt task-specific natural language statements that guide LLM reasoning and reduce confusion. We also propose two mechanisms, Dataset as Knowledge (DaK) and Example as Knowledge (EaK), to build domain knowledge sets when unstructured domain knowledge is lacking. Additionally, we introduce a result-ensembling strategy to leverage multiple knowledge sources and suppress poorly formatted outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on schema and entity matching tasks demonstrate that KcMF outperforms previous non-LLM state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by an average F1 score of 22.9% and competes effectively with SOTA fine-tuned LLMs. Moreover, KcMF generalizes well across different LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Through end-to-end training to predict the next token, LLMs have become valuable tools for various tasks. Enhancing their core training in language modeling can improve numerous downstream applications. A successful approach to enhance language modeling uses a separate planning module to predict abstract labels of future sentences and conditions the LM on these predictions. However, this method is non-differentiable, preventing joint end-to-end tuning of the planner with the LM. We propose an effective method to improve this approach by enabling joint fine-tuning of the planner and the LM. We show that a naive way of approximating the gradient of selecting a label via the straight-through estimator is not effective. Instead, we propose to use the predicted label probabilities as mixing weights to condition the LM on a weighted average of label embeddings in a differentiable manner. This not only enables joint fine-tuning of the planner and the LM, but also allows the LM to draw on the full label distribution predicted by the planner, retaining more information. Our experimental results show consistent improvements in perplexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative training of a global model whose performance is boosted by private data owned by distributed clients, without compromising data privacy. Yet the wide applicability of FL is hindered by entanglement of data distributions across different clients. This paper demonstrates for the first time that by disentangling data distributions FL can in principle achieve efficiencies comparable to those of distributed systems, requiring only one round of communication. To this end, we propose a novel FedDistr algorithm, which employs stable diffusion models to decouple and recover data distributions. Empirical results on the CIFAR100 and DomainNet datasets show that FedDistr significantly enhances model utility and efficiency in both disentangled and near-disentangled scenarios while ensuring privacy, outperforming traditional federated learning methods.</p>

To address the issue that the coupling of mel-spectrogram features with F0 information may introduce errors during F0 prediction, we consider two strategies. Firstly, we leverage mel-cepstrum (mcep) features to decouple the intertwined mel-spectrogram and F0 characteristics. Secondly, inspired by the neural source-filter models, we introduce source excitation signals as the representation of F0 in the SVS system, aiming to capture pitch nuances more accurately. Meanwhile, differentiable mcep and F0 losses are employed as the waveform decoder supervision to fortify the prediction accuracy of speech envelope and pitch in the generated speech. Experiments on the Opencpop dataset demonstrate efficacy of the proposed model in synthesis quality and intonation accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kathrin Khadra, Utku T\"urkbey</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of publicly available medical imaging data limits the development of effective AI models. This work proposes a memory-efficient patch-wise denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for generating synthetic medical images, focusing on CT scans with lung nodules. Our approach generates high-utility synthetic images with nodule segmentation while efficiently managing memory constraints, enabling the creation of training datasets. We evaluate the method in two scenarios: training a segmentation model exclusively on synthetic data, and augmenting real-world training data with synthetic images. In the first case, models trained solely on synthetic data achieve Dice scores comparable to those trained on real-world data benchmarks. In the second case, augmenting real-world data with synthetic images significantly improves segmentation performance. The generated images demonstrate their potential to enhance medical image datasets in scenarios with limited real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Sohanur Rahman, Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury, Hasib Ryan Rahman, Mosabber Uddin Ahmed, Muhammad Ashad Kabir, Sanjiban Sekhar Roy, Rusab Sarmun</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel and robust framework, Self-DenseMobileNet, designed to enhance the classification of nodules and non-nodules in chest radiographs (CXRs). Our approach integrates advanced image standardization and enhancement techniques to optimize the input quality, thereby improving classification accuracy. To enhance predictive accuracy and leverage the strengths of multiple models, the prediction probabilities from Self-DenseMobileNet were transformed into tabular data and used to train eight classical machine learning (ML) models; the top three performers were then combined via a stacking algorithm, creating a robust meta-classifier that integrates their collective insights for superior classification performance. To enhance the interpretability of our results, we employed class activation mapping (CAM) to visualize the decision-making process of the best-performing model. Our proposed framework demonstrated remarkable performance on internal validation data, achieving an accuracy of 99.28\% using a Meta-Random Forest Classifier. When tested on an external dataset, the framework maintained strong generalizability with an accuracy of 89.40\%. These results highlight a significant improvement in the classification of CXRs with lung nodules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danny Falero, Muhammad Ashad Kabir, Nusrat Homaira</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for predicting COVID-19 from medical images. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning-based approach and present the design and implementation of a mobile application for screening COVID-19. Our approach demonstrates the ability to adapt to evolving datasets, including data collected from different locations or hospitals, varying virus strains, and diverse clinical presentations, without retraining from scratch. We have evaluated state-of-the-art continual learning methods for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-rays and selected the best-performing model for our mobile app. We evaluated various deep learning architectures to select the best-performing one as a foundation model for continual learning. Both regularization and memory-based methods for continual learning were tested, using different memory sizes to develop the optimal continual learning model for our app. DenseNet161 emerged as the best foundation model with 96.87\% accuracy, and Learning without Forgetting (LwF) was the top continual learning method with an overall performance of 71.99\%. The mobile app design considers both patient and doctor perspectives. It incorporates the continual learning DenseNet161 LwF model on a cloud server, enabling the model to learn from new instances of chest X-rays and their classifications as they are submitted. The app is designed, implemented, and evaluated to ensure it provides an efficient tool for COVID-19 screening.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minkyoung Cho, Yulong Cao, Jiachen Sun, Qingzhao Zhang, Marco Pavone, Jeong Joon Park, Heng Yang, Z. Morley Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: An important paradigm in 3D object detection is the use of multiple modalities to enhance accuracy in both normal and challenging conditions, particularly for long-tail scenarios. To address this, recent studies have explored two directions of adaptive approaches: MoE-based adaptive fusion, which struggles with uncertainties arising from distinct object configurations, and late fusion for output-level adaptive fusion, which relies on separate detection pipelines and limits comprehensive understanding. In this work, we introduce Cocoon, an object- and feature-level uncertainty-aware fusion framework. The key innovation lies in uncertainty quantification for heterogeneous representations, enabling fair comparison across modalities through the introduction of a feature aligner and a learnable surrogate ground truth, termed feature impression. We also define a training objective to ensure that their relationship provides a valid metric for uncertainty quantification. Cocoon consistently outperforms existing static and adaptive methods in both normal and challenging conditions, including those with natural and artificial corruptions. Furthermore, we show the validity and efficacy of our uncertainty metric across diverse datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yedi Hu, Yunzhi Yao, Ningyu Zhang, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging has become one of the key technologies for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, our understanding of the expected performance gains and principles when merging any two models remains limited. In this work, we introduce model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs, analogous to biological evolution. With comprehensive empirical analysis, we find that there is a certain relationship between model kinship and the performance gains after model merging, which can help guide our selection of candidate models. Inspired by this, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can yield better performance on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we discover that using model kinship as a criterion can assist us in continuously performing model merging, alleviating the degradation (local optima) in model evolution, whereas model kinship can serve as a guide to escape these traps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruimeng Ye, Yang Xiao, Bo Hui</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, ensuring their alignment with human values becomes increasingly critical. Traditional alignment methods heavily rely on human feedback to fine-tune models. With the emergence of superhuman models whose outputs may surpass human understanding, evaluating and aligning these models using human judgments poses significant challenges. To address the challenges, recent works use weak supervisors to elicit knowledge from much stronger models. However, there are important disanalogies between the empirical setup in the existing works and the genuine goal of alignment. We remark that existing works investigate the phenomenon of weak-to-strong generation in analogous setup (i.e., binary classification), rather than practical alignment-relevant tasks (e.g., safety). In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending weak-to-strong generation to the context of practical alignment. We empirically demonstrate the widespread phenomenon of weak-to-strong generation in three complicated alignment tasks: safety, toxicity, and legal reasoning}. Furthermore, we explore efficient strategies for improving alignment performance to enhance the quality of model outcomes. Lastly, we summarize and analyze the challenges and potential solutions in regard to specific alignment tasks, which we hope to catalyze the research progress on the topic of weak-to-strong generalization.

<p>Abstract: This work explores the integration of ontology-based reasoning and Machine Learning techniques for explainable value classification. By relying on an ontological formalization of moral values as in the Moral Foundations Theory, relying on the DnS Ontology Design Pattern, the \textit{sandra} neuro-symbolic reasoner is used to infer values (fomalized as descriptions) that are \emph{satisfied by} a certain sentence. Sentences, alongside their structured representation, are automatically generated using an open-source Large Language Model. The inferred descriptions are used to automatically detect the value associated with a sentence. We show that only relying on the reasoner's inference results in explainable classification comparable to other more complex approaches. We show that combining the reasoner's inferences with distributional semantics methods largely outperforms all the baselines, including complex models based on neural network architectures. Finally, we build a visualization tool to explore the potential of theory-based values classification, which is publicly available at http://xmv.geomeaning.com/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chia-Tso Lai, Carsten Blank, Peter Schmelcher, Rick Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) sits at the heart of many industries and academic fields such as logistics, supply chain, finance, pharmaceutical science, chemistry, IT, and energy sectors, among others. These problems typically involve optimizing a large number of binary variables, which makes finding exact solutions exponentially more difficult. Consequently, most QUBO problems are classified as NP-hard. To address this challenge, we developed a powerful feedforward neural network (FNN) optimizer for arbitrary QUBO problems. In this work, we demonstrate that the FNN optimizer can provide high-quality approximate solutions for large problems, including dense 80-variable weighted MaxCut and random QUBOs, achieving an average accuracy of over 99% in less than 1.1 seconds on an 8-core CPU. Additionally, the FNN optimizer outperformed the Gurobi optimizer by 72% on 200-variable random QUBO problems within a 100-second computation time limit, exhibiting strong potential for real-time optimization tasks. Building on this model, we explored the novel approach of integrating FNNs with a quantum annealer-based activation function to create a quantum-classical encoder-decoder (QCED) optimizer, aiming to further enhance the performance of FNNs in QUBO optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adversarial training can be used to learn models that are robust against perturbations. For linear models, it can be formulated as a convex optimization problem. Compared to methods proposed in the context of deep learning, leveraging the optimization structure allows significantly faster convergence rates. Still, the use of generic convex solvers can be inefficient for large-scale problems. Here, we propose tailored optimization algorithms for the adversarial training of linear models, which render large-scale regression and classification problems more tractable. For regression problems, we propose a family of solvers based on iterative ridge regression and, for classification, a family of solvers based on projected gradient descent. The methods are based on extended variable reformulations of the original problem. We illustrate their efficiency in numerical examples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Partial-differential-equation (PDE)-constrained optimization is a well-worn technique for acquiring optimal parameters of systems governed by PDEs. However, this approach is limited to providing a single set of optimal parameters per optimization. Given a differentiable PDE solver, if the free parameters are reparameterized as the output of a neural network, that neural network can be trained to learn a map from a probability distribution to the distribution of optimal parameters. This proves useful in the case where there are many well performing local minima for the PDE. We apply this technique to train a neural network that generates optimal parameters that minimize laser-plasma instabilities relevant to laser fusion and show that the neural network generates many well performing and diverse minima.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anatomical landmarks are vital in medical imaging for navigation and anomaly detection. Modern large language models (LLMs), like Llama-2, offer promise for automating the mapping of these landmarks in free-text radiology reports to corresponding positions in image data. Recent studies propose LLMs may develop coherent representations of generative processes. Motivated by these insights, we investigated whether LLMs accurately represent the spatial positions of anatomical landmarks. Through experiments with Llama-2 models, we found that they can linearly represent anatomical landmarks in space with considerable robustness to different prompts. These results underscore the potential of LLMs to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical imaging workflows.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motivated by information geometry, a distance function on the space of stochastic matrices is advocated. Starting with sequences of Markov chains the Bhattacharyya angle is advocated as the natural tool for comparing both short and long term Markov chain runs. Bounds on the convergence of the distance and mixing times are derived. Guided by the desire to compare different Markov chain models, especially in the setting of healthcare processes, a new distance function on the space of stochastic matrices is presented. It is a true distance measure which has a closed form and is efficient to implement for numerical evaluation. In the case of ergodic Markov chains, it is shown that considering either the Bhattacharyya angle on Markov sequences or the new stochastic matrix distance leads to the same distance between models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinming Wang, Simon Mak, John Miller, Jianguo Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: A critical bottleneck for scientific progress is the costly nature of computer simulations for complex systems. Surrogate models provide an appealing solution: such models are trained on simulator evaluations, then used to emulate and quantify uncertainty on the expensive simulator at unexplored inputs. In many applications, one often has available data on related systems. For example, in designing a new jet turbine, there may be existing studies on turbines with similar configurations. A key question is how information from such "source" systems can be transferred for effective surrogate training on the "target" system of interest. We thus propose a new LOcal transfer Learning Gaussian Process (LOL-GP) model, which leverages a carefully-designed Gaussian process to transfer such information for surrogate modeling. The key novelty of the LOL-GP is a latent regularization model, which identifies regions where transfer should be performed and regions where it should be avoided. This "local transfer" property is desirable in scientific systems: at certain parameters, such systems may behave similarly and thus transfer is beneficial; at other parameters, they may behave differently and thus transfer is detrimental. By accounting for local transfer, the LOL-GP can rectify a critical limitation of "negative transfer" in existing transfer learning models, where the transfer of information worsens predictive performance. We derive a Gibbs sampling algorithm for efficient posterior predictive sampling on the LOL-GP, for both the multi-source and multi-fidelity transfer settings. We then show, via a suite of numerical experiments and an application for jet turbine design, the improved surrogate performance of the LOL-GP over existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain tumor detection and classification are critical tasks in medical image analysis, particularly in early-stage diagnosis, where accurate and timely detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. In this study, we apply various statistical and machine learning models to detect and classify brain tumors using brain MRI images. We explore a variety of statistical models including linear, logistic, and Bayesian regressions, and the machine learning models including decision tree, random forest, single-layer perceptron, multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network, and long short-term memory. Our findings show that CNN outperforms other models, achieving the best performance. Additionally, we confirm that the CNN model can also work for multi-class classification, distinguishing between four categories of brain MRI images such as normal, glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumor images. This study demonstrates that machine learning approaches are suitable for brain tumor detection and classification, facilitating real-world medical applications in assisting radiologists with early and accurate diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingqi Wang, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xing Xie, Jia Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models trained on large-scale data have enabled the generation of indistinguishable human-level images, yet they often produce harmful content misaligned with human values, e.g., social bias, and offensive content. Despite extensive research on Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of Text-to-Image (T2I) model alignment remains largely unexplored. Addressing this problem, we propose LiVO (Lightweight Value Optimization), a novel lightweight method for aligning T2I models with human values. LiVO only optimizes a plug-and-play value encoder to integrate a specified value principle with the input prompt, allowing the control of generated images over both semantics and values. Specifically, we design a diffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically approximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more flexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the value encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a text-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image, value principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through adaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces harmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong baselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models.</p>

<p>Abstract: To alleviate hardware scarcity in training large deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large language models (LLMs), we present FusionLLM, a decentralized training system designed and implemented for training DNNs using geo-distributed GPUs across different computing clusters or individual devices. Decentralized training faces significant challenges regarding system design and efficiency, including: 1) the need for remote automatic differentiation (RAD), 2) support for flexible model definitions and heterogeneous software, 3) heterogeneous hardware leading to low resource utilization or the straggler problem, and 4) slow network communication. To address these challenges, in the system design, we represent the model as a directed acyclic graph of operators (OP-DAG). Each node in the DAG represents the operator in the DNNs, while the edge represents the data dependency between operators. Based on this design, 1) users are allowed to customize any DNN without caring low-level operator implementation; 2) we enable the task scheduling with the more fine-grained sub-tasks, offering more optimization space; 3) a DAG runtime executor can implement RAD withour requiring the consistent low-level ML framework versions.
  To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an OP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and partition the DAG to increase throughput. Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK compressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the slowest communication links. To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our system and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world testbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our system and method can achieve 1.45 - 9.39x speedup compared to baseline methods while ensuring convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiyuan Gong, Jonas Haferkamp, Qi Ye, Zhihan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the sample complexity of the prototypical tasks quantum purity estimation and quantum inner product estimation. In purity estimation, we are to estimate $tr(\rho^2)$ of an unknown quantum state $\rho$ to additive error $\epsilon$. Meanwhile, for quantum inner product estimation, Alice and Bob are to estimate $tr(\rho\sigma)$ to additive error $\epsilon$ given copies of unknown quantum state $\rho$ and $\sigma$ using classical communication and restricted quantum communication.
  In this paper, we show a strong connection between the sample complexity of purity estimation with bounded quantum memory and inner product estimation with bounded quantum communication and unentangled measurements. We propose a protocol that solves quantum inner product estimation with $k$-qubit one-way quantum communication and unentangled local measurements using $O(median\{1/\epsilon^2,2^{n/2}/\epsilon,2^{n-k}/\epsilon^2\})$ copies of $\rho$ and $\sigma$. Our protocol can be modified to estimate the purity of an unknown quantum state $\rho$ using $k$-qubit quantum memory with the same complexity. We prove that arbitrary protocols with $k$-qubit quantum memory that estimate purity to error $\epsilon$ require $\Omega(median\{1/\epsilon^2,2^{n/2}/\sqrt{\epsilon},2^{n-k}/\epsilon^2\})$ copies of $\rho$. This indicates the same lower bound for quantum inner product estimation with one-way $k$-qubit quantum communication and classical communication, and unentangled local measurements. For purity estimation, we further improve the lower bound to $\Omega(\max\{1/\epsilon^2,2^{n/2}/\epsilon\})$ for any protocols using an identical single-copy projection-valued measurement.
  Additionally, we investigate a decisional variant of quantum distributed inner product estimation without quantum communication for mixed state and provide a lower bound on the sample complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Fan, Przemyslaw Musialski</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representations have emerged as a powerful tool in learning 3D geometry, offering unparalleled advantages over conventional representations like mesh-based methods. A common type of INR implicitly encodes a shape's boundary as the zero-level set of the learned continuous function and learns a mapping from a low-dimensional latent space to the space of all possible shapes represented by its signed distance function. However, most INRs struggle to retain high-frequency details, which are crucial for accurate geometric depiction, and they are computationally expensive. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach that both reduces computational expenses and enhances the capture of fine details. Our method integrates periodic activation functions, positional encodings, and normals into the neural network architecture. This integration significantly enhances the model's ability to learn the entire space of 3D shapes while preserving intricate details and sharp features, areas where conventional representations often fall short.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajay Patel, Jiacheng Zhu, Justin Qiu, Zachary Horvitz, Marianna Apidianaki, Kathleen McKeown, Chris Callison-Burch</p>
<p>Abstract: Style representations aim to embed texts with similar writing styles closely and texts with different styles far apart, regardless of content. However, the contrastive triplets often used for training these representations may vary in both style and content, leading to potential content leakage in the representations. We introduce StyleDistance, a novel approach to training stronger content-independent style embeddings. We use a large language model to create a synthetic dataset of near-exact paraphrases with controlled style variations, and produce positive and negative examples across 40 distinct style features for precise contrastive learning. We assess the quality of our synthetic data and embeddings through human and automatic evaluations. StyleDistance enhances the content-independence of style embeddings, which generalize to real-world benchmarks and outperform leading style representations in downstream applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehong Yoon, Shoubin Yu, Vaidehi Patil, Huaxiu Yao, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly enhanced their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, but they have also increased the risk of producing unsafe content. Existing unlearning/editing-based methods for safe generation remove harmful concepts from models but face several challenges: (1) They cannot instantly remove harmful concepts without training. (2) Their safe generation capabilities depend on collected training data. (3) They alter model weights, risking degradation in quality for content unrelated to toxic concepts. To address these, we propose SAFREE, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I and T2V, that does not alter the model's weights. Specifically, we detect a subspace corresponding to a set of toxic concepts in the text embedding space and steer prompt embeddings away from this subspace, thereby filtering out harmful content while preserving intended semantics. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving safe concepts, SAFREE incorporates a novel self-validating filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the denoising steps when applying the filtered embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate adaptive re-attention mechanisms within the diffusion latent space to selectively diminish the influence of features related to toxic concepts at the pixel level. In the end, SAFREE ensures coherent safety checking, preserving the fidelity, quality, and safety of the output. SAFREE achieves SOTA performance in suppressing unsafe content in T2I generation compared to training-free baselines and effectively filters targeted concepts while maintaining high-quality images. It also shows competitive results against training-based methods. We extend SAFREE to various T2I backbones and T2V tasks, showcasing its flexibility and generalization. SAFREE provides a robust and adaptable safeguard for ensuring safe visual generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongcheng Gao, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Taihang Hu, Zhijie Deng, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid progress of diffusion-based content generation, significant efforts are being made to unlearn harmful or copyrighted concepts from pretrained diffusion models (DMs) to prevent potential model misuse. However, it is observed that even when DMs are properly unlearned before release, malicious finetuning can compromise this process, causing DMs to relearn the unlearned concepts. This occurs partly because certain benign concepts (e.g., "skin") retained in DMs are related to the unlearned ones (e.g., "nudity"), facilitating their relearning via finetuning. To address this, we propose meta-unlearning on DMs. Intuitively, a meta-unlearned DM should behave like an unlearned DM when used as is; moreover, if the meta-unlearned DM undergoes malicious finetuning on unlearned concepts, the related benign concepts retained within it will be triggered to self-destruct, hindering the relearning of unlearned concepts. Our meta-unlearning framework is compatible with most existing unlearning methods, requiring only the addition of an easy-to-implement meta objective. We validate our approach through empirical experiments on meta-unlearning concepts from Stable Diffusion models (SD-v1-4 and SDXL), supported by extensive ablation studies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijun Tan, Siyuan Zhuang, Kyle Montgomery, William Y. Tang, Alejandro Cuadron, Chenguang Wang, Raluca Ada Popa, Ion Stoica</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges. Data and code are available at https://github.com/ScalerLab/JudgeBench .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ce Zhang, Simon Stepputtis, Katia Sycara, Yaqi Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation, which enables models to generalize to diverse data with unlabeled test samples, holds significant value in real-world scenarios. Recently, researchers have applied this setting to advanced pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), developing approaches such as test-time prompt tuning to further extend their practical applicability. However, these methods typically focus solely on adapting VLMs from a single modality and fail to accumulate task-specific knowledge as more samples are processed. To address this, we introduce Dual Prototype Evolving (DPE), a novel test-time adaptation approach for VLMs that effectively accumulates task-specific knowledge from multi-modalities. Specifically, we create and evolve two sets of prototypes--textual and visual--to progressively capture more accurate multi-modal representations for target classes during test time. Moreover, to promote consistent multi-modal representations, we introduce and optimize learnable residuals for each test sample to align the prototypes from both modalities. Extensive experimental results on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed DPE consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while also exhibiting competitive computational efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Burak \"Unal, Nico Pfeifer, Mete Akg\"un</p>
<p>Abstract: Since ML algorithms have proven their success in many different applications, there is also a big interest in privacy preserving (PP) ML methods for building models on sensitive data. Moreover, the increase in the number of data sources and the high computational power required by those algorithms force individuals to outsource the training and/or the inference of a ML model to the clouds providing such services. To address this, we propose a secure 3-party computation framework, CECILIA, offering PP building blocks to enable complex operations privately. In addition to the adapted and common operations like addition and multiplication, it offers multiplexer, most significant bit and modulus conversion. The first two are novel in terms of methodology and the last one is novel in terms of both functionality and methodology. CECILIA also has two complex novel methods, which are the exact exponential of a public base raised to the power of a secret value and the inverse square root of a secret Gram matrix. We use CECILIA to realize the private inference on pre-trained RKNs, which require more complex operations than most other DNNs, on the structural classification of proteins as the first study ever accomplishing the PP inference on RKNs. In addition to the successful private computation of basic building blocks, the results demonstrate that we perform the exact and fully private exponential computation, which is done by approximation in the literature so far. Moreover, they also show that we compute the exact inverse square root of a secret Gram matrix up to a certain privacy level, which has not been addressed in the literature at all. We also analyze the scalability of CECILIA to various settings on a synthetic dataset. The framework shows a great promise to make other ML algorithms as well as further computations privately computable by the building blocks of the framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawei Wang, Weizi Li, Lei Zhu, Jia Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Intersections are essential road infrastructures for traffic in modern metropolises. However, they can also be the bottleneck of traffic flows as a result of traffic incidents or the absence of traffic coordination mechanisms such as traffic lights. Recently, various control and coordination mechanisms that are beyond traditional control methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency of intersection traffic. Amongst these methods, the control of foreseeable mixed traffic that consists of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robot vehicles (RVs) has emerged. In this project, we propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for the control and coordination of mixed traffic at real-world, complex intersections--a topic that has not been previously explored. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we show that using 5% RVs, we can prevent congestion formation inside a complex intersection under the actual traffic demand of 700 vehicles per hour. In contrast, without RVs, congestion starts to develop when the traffic demand reaches as low as 200 vehicles per hour. When there exist more than 60% RVs in traffic, our method starts to achieve comparable or even better performance to traffic signals on the average waiting time of all vehicles at the intersection. Our method is also robust against both blackout events and sudden RV percentage drops, and enjoys excellent generalizablility, which is illustrated by its successful deployment in two unseen intersections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoling Zhou, Ou Wu, Michael K. Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are prone to capturing the spurious correlations between non-causal attributes and classes, with counterfactual data augmentation being a promising direction for breaking these spurious associations. However, generating counterfactual data explicitly poses a challenge, and incorporating augmented data into the training process decreases training efficiency. This study proposes an Implicit Counterfactual Data Augmentation (ICDA) method to remove spurious correlations and make stable predictions. Specifically, first, a novel sample-wise augmentation strategy is developed that generates semantically and counterfactually meaningful deep features with distinct augmentation strength for each sample. Second, we derive an easy-to-compute surrogate loss on the augmented feature set when the number of augmented samples becomes infinite. Third, two concrete schemes are proposed, including direct quantification and meta-learning, to derive the key parameters for the robust loss. In addition, ICDA is explained from a regularization perspective, revealing its capacity to improve intra-class compactness and augment margins at both class and sample levels. Extensive experiments have been conducted across various biased learning scenarios covering both image and text datasets, demonstrating that ICDA consistently enhances the generalization and robustness performance of popular networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqing Xu, Finale Doshi-Velez, David Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms often rely on (forward) reinforcement learning or planning over a given time horizon to compute an approximately optimal policy for a hypothesized reward function and then match this policy with expert demonstrations. The time horizon plays a critical role in determining both the accuracy of reward estimates and the computational efficiency of IRL algorithms. Interestingly, an \emph{effective time horizon} shorter than the ground-truth value often produces better results faster. This work formally analyzes this phenomenon and provides an explanation: the time horizon controls the complexity of an induced policy class and mitigates overfitting with limited data. This analysis serves as a guide for the principled choice of the effective horizon for IRL. It also prompts us to re-examine the classic IRL formulation: it is more natural to learn jointly the reward and the effective horizon rather than the reward alone with a given horizon. To validate our findings, we implement a cross-validation extension and the experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Liu, Liangxi Liu, Feiyang Ye, Yunheng Shen, Xia Li, Linshan Jiang, Jialin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently aggregating trained neural networks from local clients into a global model on a server is a widely researched topic in federated learning. Recently, motivated by diminishing privacy concerns, mitigating potential attacks, and reducing communication overhead, one-shot federated learning (i.e., limiting client-server communication into a single round) has gained popularity among researchers. However, the one-shot aggregation performances are sensitively affected by the non-identical training data distribution, which exhibits high statistical heterogeneity in some real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel one-shot aggregation method with layer-wise posterior aggregation, named FedLPA. FedLPA aggregates local models to obtain a more accurate global model without requiring extra auxiliary datasets or exposing any private label information, e.g., label distributions. To effectively capture the statistics maintained in the biased local datasets in the practical non-IID scenario, we efficiently infer the posteriors of each layer in each local model using layer-wise Laplace approximation and aggregate them to train the global parameters. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedLPA significantly improves learning performance over state-of-the-art methods across several metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arvind Renganathan, Rahul Ghosh, Ankush Khandelwal, Vipin Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce TAM-RL (Task Aware Modulation using Representation Learning), a novel multimodal meta-learning framework for few-shot learning in heterogeneous systems, designed for science and engineering problems where entities share a common underlying forward model but exhibit heterogeneity due to entity-specific characteristics. TAM-RL leverages an amortized training process with a modulation network and a base network to learn task-specific modulation parameters, enabling efficient adaptation to new tasks with limited data. We evaluate TAM-RL on two real-world environmental datasets: Gross Primary Product (GPP) prediction and streamflow forecasting, demonstrating significant improvements over existing meta-learning methods. On the FLUXNET dataset, TAM-RL improves RMSE by 18.9\% over MMAML with just one month of few-shot data, while for streamflow prediction, it achieves an 8.21\% improvement with one year of data. Synthetic data experiments further validate TAM-RL's superior performance in heterogeneous task distributions, outperforming the baselines in the most heterogeneous setting. Notably, TAM-RL offers substantial computational efficiency, with at least 3x faster training times compared to gradient-based meta-learning approaches while being much simpler to train due to reduced complexity. Ablation studies highlight the importance of pretraining and adaptation mechanisms in TAM-RL's performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mufei Li, Eleonora Krea\v{c}i\'c, Vamsi K. Potluru, Pan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale graphs with node attributes are increasingly common in various real-world applications. Creating synthetic, attribute-rich graphs that mirror real-world examples is crucial, especially for sharing graph data for analysis and developing learning models when original data is restricted to be shared. Traditional graph generation methods are limited in their capacity to handle these complex structures. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown potential in generating graph structures without attributes and smaller molecular graphs. However, these models face challenges in generating large attributed graphs due to the complex attribute-structure correlations and the large size of these graphs. This paper introduces a novel diffusion model, GraphMaker, specifically designed for generating large attributed graphs. We explore various combinations of node attribute and graph structure generation processes, finding that an asynchronous approach more effectively captures the intricate attribute-structure correlations. We also address scalability issues through edge mini-batching generation. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach in graph data dissemination, we introduce a new evaluation pipeline. The evaluation demonstrates that synthetic graphs generated by GraphMaker can be used to develop competitive graph machine learning models for the tasks defined over the original graphs without actually accessing these graphs, while many leading graph generation methods fall short in this evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bijan Mazaheri, Spencer Gordon, Yuval Rabani, Leonard Schulman</p>
<p>Abstract: An acyclic causal structure can be described with directed acyclic graph (DAG), where arrows indicate the possibility of direct causation. The task of learning this structure from data is known as "causal discovery." Diverse populations or changing environments can sometimes give rise to data that is heterogeneous in the following sense: each population/environment is a "source" which idiosyncratically determines the forms of those direct causal effects. From this perspective, the source is a latent common cause for every observed variable. While some methods for causal discovery are able to work around latent confounding in special cases, especially when only few observables are confounded, a global confounder is a difficult challenge. The only known ways to deal with latent global confounding involve assumptions that limit the structural equations and/or noise functions. We demonstrate that globally confounded causal structures can still be identifiable with arbitrary structural equations and noise functions, so long as the number of latent classes remains small relative to the size and sparsity of the underlying DAG.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of commercial AI products based on generative, multi-purpose AI systems promising a unified approach to building machine learning (ML) models into technology. However, this ambition of ``generality'' comes at a steep cost to the environment, given the amount of energy these systems require and the amount of carbon that they emit. In this work, we propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific (i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and `general-purpose' models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks). We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models. We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters. We conclude with a discussion around the current trend of deploying multi-purpose generative ML systems, and caution that their utility should be more intentionally weighed against increased costs in terms of energy and emissions. All the data from our study can be accessed via an interactive demo to carry out further exploration and analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been successfully applied to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Their loss function is founded on a strong residual minimization scheme. Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks (VPINNs) are their natural extension to weak variational settings. In this context, the recent work of Robust Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks (RVPINNs) highlights the importance of conveniently translating the norms of the underlying continuum-level spaces to the discrete level. Otherwise, VPINNs might become unrobust, implying that residual minimization might be highly uncorrelated with a desired minimization of the error in the energy norm. However, applying this robustness to VPINNs typically entails dealing with the inverse of a Gram matrix, usually producing slow convergence speeds during training. In this work, we accelerate the implementation of RVPINN, establishing a LU factorization of sparse Gram matrix in a kind of point-collocation scheme with the same spirit as original PINNs. We call out method the Collocation-based Robust Variational Physics Informed Neural Networks (CRVPINN). We test our efficient CRVPINN algorithm on Laplace, advection-diffusion, and Stokes problems in two spatial dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Zhao, Emanuel Adamiak, Christos Kozyrakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.
  To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinliang Deng, Feiyang Ye, Du Yin, Xuan Song, Ivor W. Tsang, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) represents a critical frontier in time series analysis, characterized by extensive input sequences, as opposed to the shorter spans typical of traditional approaches. While longer sequences inherently offer richer information for enhanced predictive precision, prevailing studies often respond by escalating model complexity. These intricate models can inflate into millions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive parameter scales. Our study demonstrates, through both analytical and empirical evidence, that decomposition is key to containing excessive model inflation while achieving uniformly superior and robust results across various datasets. Remarkably, by tailoring decomposition to the intrinsic dynamics of time series data, our proposed model outperforms existing benchmarks, using over 99 \% fewer parameters than the majority of competing methods. Through this work, we aim to unleash the power of a restricted set of parameters by capitalizing on domain characteristics--a timely reminder that in the realm of LTSF, bigger is not invariably better.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juliusz Ziomek, Masaki Adachi, Michael A. Osborne</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimisation requires fitting a Gaussian process model, which in turn requires specifying prior on the unknown black-box function -- most of the theoretical literature assumes this prior is known. However, it is common to have more than one possible prior for a given black-box function, for example suggested by domain experts with differing opinions. In some cases, the type-II maximum likelihood estimator for selecting prior enjoys the consistency guarantee, but it does not universally apply to all types of priors. If the problem is stationary, one could rely on the Regret Balancing scheme to conduct the optimisation, but in the case of time-varying problems, such a scheme cannot be used. To address this gap in existing research, we propose a novel algorithm, PE-GP-UCB, which is capable of solving time-varying Bayesian optimisation problems even without the exact knowledge of the function's prior. The algorithm relies on the fact that either the observed function values are consistent with some of the priors, in which case it is easy to reject the wrong priors, or the observations are consistent with all candidate priors, in which case it does not matter which prior our model relies on. We provide a regret bound on the proposed algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm on toy and real-world time-varying problems and show that it outperforms the maximum likelihood estimator, fully Bayesian treatment of unknown prior and Regret Balancing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yatong Bai, Mo Zhou, Vishal M. Patel, Somayeh Sojoudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial robustness often comes at the cost of degraded accuracy, impeding real-life applications of robust classification models. Training-based solutions for better trade-offs are limited by incompatibilities with already-trained high-performance large models, necessitating the exploration of training-free ensemble approaches. Observing that robust models are more confident in correct predictions than in incorrect ones on clean and adversarial data alike, we speculate amplifying this "benign confidence property" can reconcile accuracy and robustness in an ensemble setting. To achieve so, we propose "MixedNUTS", a training-free method where the output logits of a robust classifier and a standard non-robust classifier are processed by nonlinear transformations with only three parameters, which are optimized through an efficient algorithm. MixedNUTS then converts the transformed logits into probabilities and mixes them as the overall output. On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, experimental results with custom strong adaptive attacks demonstrate MixedNUTS's vastly improved accuracy and near-SOTA robustness -- it boosts CIFAR-100 clean accuracy by 7.86 points, sacrificing merely 0.87 points in robust accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiafei Lyu, Le Wan, Xiu Li, Zongqing Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there are many efforts attempting to learn useful policies for continuous control in visual reinforcement learning (RL). In this scenario, it is important to learn a generalizable policy, as the testing environment may differ from the training environment, e.g., there exist distractors during deployment. Many practical algorithms are proposed to handle this problem. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them provide a theoretical understanding of what affects the generalization gap and why their proposed methods work. In this paper, we bridge this issue by theoretically answering the key factors that contribute to the generalization gap when the testing environment has distractors. Our theories indicate that minimizing the representation distance between training and testing environments, which aligns with human intuition, is the most critical for the benefit of reducing the generalization gap. Our theoretical results are supported by the empirical evidence in the DMControl Generalization Benchmark (DMC-GB).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Ding, Amy Zhang, Yuandong Tian, Qinqing Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Diffusion World Model (DWM), a conditional diffusion model capable of predicting multistep future states and rewards concurrently. As opposed to traditional one-step dynamics models, DWM offers long-horizon predictions in a single forward pass, eliminating the need for recursive queries. We integrate DWM into model-based value estimation, where the short-term return is simulated by future trajectories sampled from DWM. In the context of offline reinforcement learning, DWM can be viewed as a conservative value regularization through generative modeling. Alternatively, it can be seen as a data source that enables offline Q-learning with synthetic data. Our experiments on the D4RL dataset confirm the robustness of DWM to long-horizon simulation. In terms of absolute performance, DWM significantly surpasses one-step dynamics models with a $44\%$ performance gain, and is comparable to or slightly surpassing their model-free counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Cui, Freya Behrens, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborov\'a</p>
<p>Abstract: Many empirical studies have provided evidence for the emergence of algorithmic mechanisms (abilities) in the learning of language models, that lead to qualitative improvements of the model capabilities. Yet, a theoretical characterization of how such mechanisms emerge remains elusive. In this paper, we take a step in this direction by providing a tight theoretical analysis of the emergence of semantic attention in a solvable model of dot-product attention. More precisely, we consider a non-linear self-attention layer with trainable tied and low-rank query and key matrices. In the asymptotic limit of high-dimensional data and a comparably large number of training samples we provide a tight closed-form characterization of the global minimum of the non-convex empirical loss landscape. We show that this minimum corresponds to either a positional attention mechanism (with tokens attending to each other based on their respective positions) or a semantic attention mechanism (with tokens attending to each other based on their meaning), and evidence an emergent phase transition from the former to the latter with increasing sample complexity. Finally, we compare the dot-product attention layer to a linear positional baseline, and show that it outperforms the latter using the semantic mechanism provided it has access to sufficient data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reabetswe M. Nkhumise, Debabrota Basu, Tony J. Prescott, Aditya Gilra</p>
<p>Abstract: The rising successes of RL are propelled by combining smart algorithmic strategies and deep architectures to optimize the distribution of returns and visitations over the state-action space. A quantitative framework to compare the learning processes of these eclectic RL algorithms is currently absent but desired in practice. We address this gap by representing the learning process of an RL algorithm as a sequence of policies generated during training, and then studying the policy trajectory induced in the manifold of state-action occupancy measures. Using an optimal transport-based metric, we measure the length of the paths induced by the policy sequence yielded by an RL algorithm between an initial policy and a final optimal policy. Hence, we first define the 'Effort of Sequential Learning' (ESL). ESL quantifies the relative distance that an RL algorithm travels compared to the shortest path from the initial to the optimal policy. Further, we connect the dynamics of policies in the occupancy measure space and regret (another metric to understand the suboptimality of an RL algorithm), by defining the 'Optimal Movement Ratio' (OMR). OMR assesses the fraction of movements in the occupancy measure space that effectively reduce an analogue of regret. Finally, we derive approximation guarantees to estimate ESL and OMR with finite number of samples and without access to an optimal policy. Through empirical analyses across various environments and algorithms, we demonstrate that ESL and OMR provide insights into the exploration processes of RL algorithms and hardness of different tasks in discrete and continuous MDPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In the evolving landscape of machine learning, a pivotal challenge lies in deciphering the internal representations harnessed by neural networks and Transformers. Building on recent progress toward comprehending how networks execute distinct target functions, our study embarks on an exploration of the underlying reasons behind networks adopting specific computational strategies. We direct our focus to the complex algebraic learning task of modular addition involving $k$ inputs. Our research presents a thorough analytical characterization of the features learned by stylized one-hidden layer neural networks and one-layer Transformers in addressing this task. A cornerstone of our theoretical framework is the elucidation of how the principle of margin maximization shapes the features adopted by one-hidden layer neural networks. Let $p$ denote the modulus, $D_p$ denote the dataset of modular arithmetic with $k$ inputs and $m$ denote the network width. We demonstrate that a neuron count of $ m \geq 2^{2k-2} \cdot (p-1) $, these networks attain a maximum $ L_{2,k+1} $-margin on the dataset $ D_p $. Furthermore, we establish that each hidden-layer neuron aligns with a specific Fourier spectrum, integral to solving modular addition problems. By correlating our findings with the empirical observations of similar studies, we contribute to a deeper comprehension of the intrinsic computational mechanisms of neural networks. Furthermore, we observe similar computational mechanisms in attention matrices of one-layer Transformers. Our work stands as a significant stride in unraveling their operation complexities, particularly in the realm of complex algebraic tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyou Wang, Zaixiang Zheng, Fei Ye, Dongyu Xue, Shujian Huang, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces diffusion protein language model (DPLM), a versatile protein language model that demonstrates strong generative and predictive capabilities for protein sequences. We first pre-train scalable DPLMs from evolutionary-scale protein sequences within a generative self-supervised discrete diffusion probabilistic framework, which generalizes language modeling for proteins in a principled way. After pre-training, DPLM exhibits the ability to generate structurally plausible, novel, and diverse protein sequences for unconditional generation. We further demonstrate the proposed diffusion generative pre-training makes DPLM possess a better understanding of proteins, making it a superior representation learner, which can be fine-tuned for various predictive tasks, comparing favorably to ESM2 (Lin et al., 2022). Moreover, DPLM can be tailored for various needs, which showcases its prowess of conditional generation in several ways: (1) conditioning on partial peptide sequences, e.g., generating scaffolds for functional motifs with high success rate; (2) incorporating other modalities as conditioner, e.g., structure-conditioned generation for inverse folding; and (3) steering sequence generation towards desired properties, e.g., satisfying specified secondary structures, through a plug-and-play classifier guidance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Beikmohammadi, Sarit Khirirat, Sindri Magn\'usson</p>
<p>Abstract: Parallel stochastic gradient methods are gaining prominence in solving large-scale machine learning problems that involve data distributed across multiple nodes. However, obtaining unbiased stochastic gradients, which have been the focus of most theoretical research, is challenging in many distributed machine learning applications. The gradient estimations easily become biased, for example, when gradients are compressed or clipped, when data is shuffled, and in meta-learning and reinforcement learning. In this work, we establish worst-case bounds on parallel momentum methods under biased gradient estimation on both general non-convex and $\mu$-PL problems. Our analysis covers general distributed optimization problems, and we work out the implications for special cases where gradient estimates are biased, i.e. in meta-learning and when the gradients are compressed or clipped. Our numerical experiments verify our theoretical findings and show faster convergence performance of momentum methods than traditional biased gradient descent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models can exhibit what appears to be a sudden ability to solve a new problem as training time, training data, or model size increases, a phenomenon known as emergence. In this paper, we present a framework where each new ability (a skill) is represented as a basis function. We solve a simple multi-linear model in this skill-basis, finding analytic expressions for the emergence of new skills, as well as for scaling laws of the loss with training time, data size, model size, and optimal compute. We compare our detailed calculations to direct simulations of a two-layer neural network trained on multitask sparse parity, where the tasks in the dataset are distributed according to a power-law. Our simple model captures, using a single fit parameter, the sigmoidal emergence of multiple new skills as training time, data size or model size increases in the neural network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingyu Liang, Heshan Liu, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Zhuoyan Xu, Junze Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The self-attention mechanism is the key to the success of transformers in recent Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the quadratic computational cost $O(n^2)$ in the input sequence length $n$ is a notorious obstacle for further improvement and scalability in longer contexts. In this work, we leverage the convolution-like structure of attention matrices to develop an efficient approximation method for attention computation using convolution matrices. We propose a $\mathsf{conv}$ basis system, analogous to the rank basis, and show that any lower triangular matrix can always be decomposed as a sum of structured convolution matrices in this basis. We then design a fast algorithm to approximate the attention matrix via a sum of such $k$ convolution matrices. This allows us to compute the attention {\it inference} via Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) in $O(knd \log n)$ time, where $d$ is the hidden dimension, and thus achieve almost linear time $n^{1+o(1)}$ in the practical scenario where $kd = n^{o(1)}$. Furthermore, the attention {\it training forward} and {\it backward gradient} can be computed in $n^{1+o(1)}$ as well. We provide theoretical guarantees on the run time and approximation error and conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. We hope our new paradigm for accelerating attention computation in transformer models can help their application to longer contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have distinguished themselves with outstanding performance in complex language modeling tasks, yet they come with significant computational and storage challenges. This paper explores the potential of quantization to mitigate these challenges. We systematically study the combined application of three well-known post-training techniques, SmoothQuant, AWQ, and GPTQ, and provide a comprehensive analysis of their interactions and implications for advancing LLM quantization. We enhance the versatility of these methods by enabling quantization to microscaling (MX) formats, extending the applicability of these PTQ algorithms beyond their original fixed-point format targets. We show that combining different PTQ methods enables us to quantize models to 4-bit weights and 8-bit activations using the MXINT format with negligible accuracy loss compared to the uncompressed baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Kuelbs, Sanjay Lall, Mert Pilanci</p>
<p>Abstract: Training neural networks which are robust to adversarial attacks remains an important problem in deep learning, especially as heavily overparameterized models are adopted in safety-critical settings. Drawing from recent work which reformulates the training problems for two-layer ReLU and polynomial activation networks as convex programs, we devise a convex semidefinite program (SDP) for adversarial training of two-layer polynomial activation networks and prove that the convex SDP achieves the same globally optimal solution as its nonconvex counterpart. The convex SDP is observed to improve robust test accuracy against $\ell_\infty$ attacks relative to the original convex training formulation on multiple datasets. Additionally, we present scalable implementations of adversarial training for two-layer polynomial and ReLU networks which are compatible with standard machine learning libraries and GPU acceleration. Leveraging these implementations, we retrain the final two fully connected layers of a Pre-Activation ResNet-18 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset with both polynomial and ReLU activations. The two `robustified' models achieve significantly higher robust test accuracies against $\ell_\infty$ attacks than a Pre-Activation ResNet-18 model trained with sharpness-aware minimization, demonstrating the practical utility of convex adversarial training on large-scale problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyosoon Jang, Yunhui Jang, Minsu Kim, Jinkyoo Park, Sungsoo Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), which learn to sample objects proportionally to a given reward function through the trajectory of state transitions. In this work, we observe that GFlowNets tend to under-exploit the high-reward objects due to training on insufficient number of trajectories, which may lead to a large gap between the estimated flow and the (known) reward value. In response to this challenge, we propose a pessimistic backward policy for GFlowNets (PBP-GFN), which maximizes the observed flow to align closely with the true reward for the object. We extensively evaluate PBP-GFN across eight benchmarks, including hyper-grid environment, bag generation, structured set generation, molecular generation, and four RNA sequence generation tasks. In particular, PBP-GFN enhances the discovery of high-reward objects, maintains the diversity of the objects, and consistently outperforms existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Antibodies are crucial proteins produced by the immune system to eliminate harmful foreign substances and have become pivotal therapeutic agents for treating human diseases. To accelerate the discovery of antibody therapeutics, there is growing interest in constructing language models using antibody sequences. However, the applicability of pre-trained language models for antibody discovery has not been thoroughly evaluated due to the scarcity of labeled datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2, a dataset featuring the antigen-variable domain of heavy chain of heavy chain antibody (VHH) interactions obtained from two alpacas immunized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike proteins. AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2 includes binary labels indicating the binding or non-binding of diverse VHH sequences to 12 SARS-CoV-2 mutants, such as the Delta and Omicron variants. Furthermore, we release VHHCorpus-2M, a pre-training dataset for antibody language models, containing over two million VHH sequences. We report benchmark results for predicting SARS-CoV-2-VHH binding using VHHBERT pre-trained on VHHCorpus-2M and existing general protein and antibody-specific pre-trained language models. These results confirm that AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2 provides valuable benchmarks for evaluating the representation capabilities of antibody language models for binding prediction, thereby facilitating the development of AI-driven antibody discovery.

<p><b>Authors:</b> John T. Halloran, Manbir Gulati, Paul F. Roysdon</p>
<p>Abstract: Mamba state-space models (SSMs) were recently shown to outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer large language models (LLMs) across various tasks. Despite subsequent widespread adaptation, little work has focused on Mamba LLMs' amenability for fine-tuning frameworks ubiquitously used for Transformer-based LLMs, e.g., mixed-precision fine-tuning (MPFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). For the former, it currently remains an open question whether Mamba's recurrent dynamics are robust to small input changes, such as those encountered during MPFT. Using dynamical systems theory (in particular, Lyapunov exponents), we answer this question in the affirmative. We empirically validate this result through several experiments, showing that Mamba SSMs are significantly more stable to changes introduced by mixed-precision than comparable Transformers, even when both MPFT and PEFT are combined. For PEFT, we show how targeting specific memory buffers in Mamba's customized CUDA kernels for low-rank adaptation regularizes SSM parameters, thus providing both parameter efficient learning and computational savings. Finally, with both MPFT and PEFT enabled, we explore the impact of instruction tuning Mamba SSMs for in-context learning (ICL) on natural language tasks. While pretrained Mamba and Mamba-2 models only achieve 38% and 82% (respectively) of the ICL improvements of comparable Transformer-based LLMs, we show that instruction tuning allows Mamba models to narrow this gap to 81% and Mamba-2 models to skyrocket over this gap to 132%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinsheng Yuan, Zhuangkun Wei, Weisi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Over-the-Air Federated Learning (OTA-FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed learning mechanism, by aggregating updates in the electromagnetic channel rather than at the server. A critical research gap in existing OTA-FL research is the assumption of homogeneous client computational bit precision. While in real world application, clients with varying hardware resources may exploit approximate computing (AxC) to operate at different bit precisions optimized for energy and computational efficiency. And model updates of various precisions amongst clients poses an open challenge for OTA-FL, as it is incompatible in the wireless modulation superposition. Here, we propose an mixed-precision OTA-FL framework of clients with multiple bit precisions, demonstrating the following innovations: (i) the superior trade-off for both server and clients within the constraints of varying edge computing capabilities, energy efficiency, and learning accuracy requirements comparing to homogeneous client bit precision, and (ii) a multi-precision gradient modulation scheme to ensure compatibility with OTA aggregation and eliminate the overheads of precision conversion. Through case study with real world data, we validate our modulation scheme that enables AxC based mixed-precision OTA-FL. In comparison to homogeneous standard precision of 32-bit and 16-bit, our framework presents more than 10% in 4-bit ultra low precision client performance and over 65%and 13% of energy savings respectively. This demonstrates the great potential of our mixed-precision OTA-FL approach in heterogeneous edge computing environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Birgit K\"uhbacher, Fernando Iglesias-Suarez, Niki Kilbertus, Veronika Eyring</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate models play a critical role in understanding and projecting climate change. Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of about 40-100 km remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which need to be approximated via parameterizations. These parameterizations are a major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate projections. Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on data from computationally expensive short, high-resolution simulations, have shown great promise for improving climate models in that regard. However, their lack of interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations result in reduced trust in the climate simulation. We propose an efficient supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible computational overhead compared to standard supervised training. First, key features determining the target physical processes are uncovered. Subsequently, the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features. We show empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as actual physical drivers, therefore removing spurious non-physical relationships. This results in by design physically consistent and interpretable neural networks while maintaining the predictive performance of unconstrained black-box DL-based parameterizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Chiwun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompting and context-based fine-tuning methods, which we call Prefix Learning, have been proposed to enhance the performance of language models on various downstream tasks. They are empirically efficient and effective, matching the performance of full parameter fine-tuning, but the theoretical understandings are limited. In this paper, we aim to address this limitation by studying their ability from the perspective of prefix length. In particular, we provide a convergence guarantee for training an ultra-long prefix in a stylized setting using the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework. Based on this strong theoretical guarantee, we design and implement an algorithm that only needs to introduce and fine-tune a few extra trainable parameters instead of an infinite-long prefix in each layer of a transformer, and can approximate the prefix attention to a guaranteed polynomial-small error. Preliminary experimental results on vision, natural language, and math data show that our method achieves superior or competitive performance compared to existing methods like full parameters fine-tuning, P-Tuning V2, and LoRA. This demonstrates our method is promising for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/ChristianYang37/chiwun/tree/main/src/NTK-Attention}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Wong, Alfonso Amayuelas, Liangming Pan, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on code generation tasks. A recent use case is iterative code repair, where an LLM fixes an incorrect program by rationalizing about errors and generating new code. Recent works augment the code repair process by integrating modern techniques such as chain-of-thought reasoning or distillation, but only study their benefits on high-resource languages like Python, and ignore low-resource languages like Perl. To address this gap of knowledge, we investigate the benefits of distilling code repair for both high and low resource languages to determine if the techniques that are effective in a high resource setting are also applicable in a low resource setting. Our evaluation shows that distilling the ability to repair code has language dependent benefits. To explain this behavior, we perform a further analysis and find that contrary to preexisting beliefs, the correlation between reasoning ability and code correction ability is weak. We hypothesize this weak correlation is magnified in low-resource settings where base models lack deep knowledge of a programming language, leading to wavering benefits of code repair.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury, Krzysztof Choromanski, Arijit Sehanobish, Avinava Dubey, Snigdha Chaturvedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning is the process of efficiently removing the influence of a training data instance from a trained machine learning model without retraining it from scratch. A popular subclass of unlearning approaches is exact machine unlearning, which focuses on techniques that explicitly guarantee the removal of the influence of a data instance from a model. Exact unlearning approaches use a machine learning model in which individual components are trained on disjoint subsets of the data. During deletion, exact unlearning approaches only retrain the affected components rather than the entire model. While existing approaches reduce retraining costs, it can still be expensive for an organization to retrain a model component as it requires halting a system in production, which leads to service failure and adversely impacts customers. To address these challenges, we introduce an exact unlearning framework -- Sequence-aware Sharded Sliced Training (S3T), which is designed to enhance the deletion capabilities of an exact unlearning system while minimizing the impact on model's performance. At the core of S3T, we utilize a lightweight parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach that enables parameter isolation by sequentially training layers with disjoint data slices. This enables efficient unlearning by simply deactivating the layers affected by data deletion. Furthermore, to reduce the retraining cost and improve model performance, we train the model on multiple data sequences, which allows S3T to handle an increased number of deletion requests. Both theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that S3T attains superior deletion capabilities and enhanced performance compared to baselines across a wide range of settings.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11215">Mechanistic interpretability of large language models with applications to the financial services industry</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashkan Golgoon, Khashayar Filom, Arjun Ravi Kannan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models such as GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a broad spectrum of applications. Nevertheless, due to their intrinsic complexity, these models present substantial challenges in interpreting their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency poses critical challenges when it comes to their adaptation by financial institutions, where concerns and accountability regarding bias, fairness, and reliability are of paramount importance. Mechanistic interpretability aims at reverse engineering complex AI models such as transformers. In this paper, we are pioneering the use of mechanistic interpretability to shed some light on the inner workings of large language models for use in financial services applications. We offer several examples of how algorithmic tasks can be designed for compliance monitoring purposes. In particular, we investigate GPT-2 Small's attention pattern when prompted to identify potential violation of Fair Lending laws. Using direct logit attribution, we study the contributions of each layer and its corresponding attention heads to the logit difference in the residual stream. Finally, we design clean and corrupted prompts and use activation patching as a causal intervention method to localize our task completion components further. We observe that the (positive) heads $10.2$ (head $2$, layer $10$), $10.7$, and $11.3$, as well as the (negative) heads $9.6$ and $10.6$ play a significant role in the task completion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> V\'ictor Franc\'es-Belda, Alberto Solera-Rico, Javier Nieto-Centenero, Esther Andr\'es, Carlos Sanmiguel Vila, Rodrigo Castellanos</p>
<p>Abstract: Surrogate models that combine dimensionality reduction and regression techniques are essential to reduce the need for costly high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics data. New approaches using $\beta$-Variational Autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE) architectures have shown promise in obtaining high-quality low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional flow data while enabling physical interpretation of their latent spaces. We propose a surrogate model based on latent space regression to predict pressure distributions on a transonic wing given the flight conditions: Mach number and angle of attack. The $\beta$-VAE model, enhanced with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), maps high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional latent space, showing a direct correlation with flight conditions. Regularization through $\beta$ requires careful tuning to improve overall performance, while PCA preprocessing helps to construct an effective latent space, improving autoencoder training and performance. Gaussian Process Regression is used to predict latent space variables from flight conditions, showing robust behavior independent of $\beta$, and the decoder reconstructs the high-dimensional pressure field data. This pipeline provides insight into unexplored flight conditions. Furthermore, a fine-tuning process of the decoder further refines the model, reducing the dependence on $\beta$ and enhancing accuracy. Structured latent space, robust regression performance, and significant improvements in fine-tuning collectively create a highly accurate and efficient surrogate model. Our methodology demonstrates the effectiveness of $\beta$-VAEs for aerodynamic surrogate modeling, offering a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable alternative for aerodynamic data prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihao Wu, Xingyu Zhao, Xiaowei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data efficiency of learning, which plays a key role in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) training process, becomes even more important in continual RL with sequential environments. In continual RL, the learner interacts with non-stationary, sequential tasks and is required to learn new tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. However, there is little work on implementing data augmentation for continual RL. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of data augmentation for continual RL. Specifically, we provide benchmarking data augmentations for continual RL, by (1) summarising existing data augmentation methods and (2) including a new augmentation method for continual RL: Adversarial Augmentation with Gradient Episodic Memory (Adv-GEM). Extensive experiments show that data augmentations, such as random amplitude scaling, state-switch, mixup, adversarial augmentation, and Adv-GEM, can improve existing continual RL algorithms in terms of their average performance, catastrophic forgetting, and forward transfer, on robot control tasks. All data augmentation methods are implemented as plug-in modules for trivial integration into continual RL methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Rida Rammal, Ruida Zhou, Suhas Diggavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Data valuation seeks to answer the important question, "How much is this data worth?" Existing data valuation methods have largely focused on discriminative models, primarily examining data value through the lens of its utility in training. However, with the push for ever-larger language models, relying on valuation methods that require training becomes increasingly expensive and dependent on specific techniques. We propose an alternative perspective on the data value problem for language models, centering around the plausibility of the data. We posit that data holds lesser value if it can be plausibly generated by the model itself. Starting from some intuitive criteria that align with our notions of valuable data, we develop a novel value function that is computationally tractable and derived from first principles with provable properties. We conduct a theoretical analysis of our value function and evaluate it across multiple scenarios and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kota Okudo, Kei Kobayashi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the phenomenon of benign overfitting in binary classification problems with heavy-tailed input distributions, extending the analysis of maximum margin classifiers to $\alpha$ sub-exponential distributions ($\alpha \in (0, 2]$). This generalizes previous work focused on sub-gaussian inputs. We provide generalization error bounds for linear classifiers trained using gradient descent on unregularized logistic loss in this heavy-tailed setting. Our results show that, under certain conditions on the dimensionality $p$ and the distance between the centers of the distributions, the misclassification error of the maximum margin classifier asymptotically approaches the noise level, the theoretical optimal value. Moreover, we derive an upper bound on the learning rate $\beta$ for benign overfitting to occur and show that as the tail heaviness of the input distribution $\alpha$ increases, the upper bound on the learning rate decreases. These results demonstrate that benign overfitting persists even in settings with heavier-tailed inputs than previously studied, contributing to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon in more realistic data environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vighnesh Birodkar, Gabriel Barcik, James Lyon, Sergey Ioffe, David Minnen, Joshua V. Dillon</p>
<p>Abstract: For learned image representations, basic autoencoders often produce blurry results. Reconstruction quality can be improved by incorporating additional penalties such as adversarial (GAN) and perceptual losses. Arguably, these approaches lack a principled interpretation. Concurrently, in generative settings diffusion has demonstrated a remarkable ability to create crisp, high quality results and has solid theoretical underpinnings (from variational inference to direct study as the Fisher Divergence). Our work combines autoencoder representation learning with diffusion and is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the efficacy of jointly learning a continuous encoder and decoder under a diffusion-based loss. We demonstrate that this approach yields better reconstruction quality as compared to GAN-based autoencoders while being easier to tune. We also show that the resulting representation is easier to model with a latent diffusion model as compared to the representation obtained from a state-of-the-art GAN-based loss. Since our decoder is stochastic, it can generate details not encoded in the otherwise deterministic latent representation; we therefore name our approach "Sample what you can't compress", or SWYCC for short.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeno Kujawa, John Poole, Dobrik Georgiev, Danilo Numeroso, Pietro Li\`o</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) aims to optimize classical algorithms. However, canonical implementations of NAR train neural networks to return only a single solution, even when there are multiple correct solutions to a problem, such as single-source shortest paths. For some applications, it is desirable to recover more than one correct solution. To that end, we give the first method for NAR with multiple solutions. We demonstrate our method on two classical algorithms: Bellman-Ford (BF) and Depth-First Search (DFS), favouring deeper insight into two algorithms over a broader survey of algorithms. This method involves generating appropriate training data as well as sampling and validating solutions from model output. Each step of our method, which can serve as a framework for neural algorithmic reasoning beyond the tasks presented in this paper, might be of independent interest to the field and our results represent the first attempt at this task in the NAR literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hikaru Umeda, Hideaki Iiduka</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strongly depends on setting the batch size and learning rate to minimize the empirical loss in training the deep neural network. In this paper, we present theoretical analyses of mini-batch SGD with four schedulers: (i) constant batch size and decaying learning rate scheduler, (ii) increasing batch size and decaying learning rate scheduler, (iii) increasing batch size and increasing learning rate scheduler, and (iv) increasing batch size and warm-up decaying learning rate scheduler. We show that mini-batch SGD using scheduler (i) does not always minimize the expectation of the full gradient norm of the empirical loss, whereas it does using any of schedulers (ii), (iii), and (iv). Furthermore, schedulers (iii) and (iv) accelerate mini-batch SGD. The paper also provides numerical results of supporting analyses showing that using scheduler (iii) or (iv) minimizes the full gradient norm of the empirical loss faster than using scheduler (i) or (ii).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph machine learning (GML) has been successfully applied across a wide range of tasks. Nonetheless, GML faces significant challenges in generalizing over out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which raises concerns about its wider applicability. Recent advancements have underscored the crucial role of causality-driven approaches in overcoming these generalization challenges. Distinct from traditional GML methods that primarily rely on statistical dependencies, causality-focused strategies delve into the underlying causal mechanisms of data generation and model prediction, thus significantly improving the generalization of GML across different environments. This paper offers a thorough review of recent progress in causality-involved GML generalization. We elucidate the fundamental concepts of employing causality to enhance graph model generalization and categorize the various approaches, providing detailed descriptions of their methodologies and the connections among them. Furthermore, we explore the incorporation of causality in other related important areas of trustworthy GML, such as explanation, fairness, and robustness. Concluding with a discussion on potential future research directions, this review seeks to articulate the continuing development and future potential of causality in enhancing the trustworthiness of graph machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuqi Wang, Shangtong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation, abbreviated as linear TD, is a classic and powerful prediction algorithm in reinforcement learning. While it is well understood that linear TD converges almost surely to a unique point, this convergence traditionally requires the assumption that the features used by the approximator are linearly independent. However, this linear independence assumption does not hold in many practical scenarios. This work is the first to establish the almost sure convergence of linear TD without requiring linearly independent features. In fact, we do not make any assumptions on the features. We prove that the approximated value function converges to a unique point and the weight iterates converge to a set. We also establish a notion of local stability of the weight iterates. Importantly, we do not need to introduce any other additional assumptions and do not need to make any modification to the linear TD algorithm. Key to our analysis is a novel characterization of bounded invariant sets of the mean ODE of linear TD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for health has the potential to significantly change and improve healthcare. However in most African countries, identifying culturally and contextually attuned approaches for deploying these solutions is not well understood. To bridge this gap, we conduct a qualitative study to investigate the best practices, fairness indicators, and potential biases to mitigate when deploying AI for health in African countries, as well as explore opportunities where artificial intelligence could make a positive impact in health. We used a mixed methods approach combining in-depth interviews (IDIs) and surveys. We conduct 1.5-2 hour long IDIs with 50 experts in health, policy, and AI across 17 countries, and through an inductive approach we conduct a qualitative thematic analysis on expert IDI responses. We administer a blinded 30-minute survey with case studies to 672 general population participants across 5 countries in Africa and analyze responses on quantitative scales, statistically comparing responses by country, age, gender, and level of familiarity with AI. We thematically summarize open-ended responses from surveys. Our results find generally positive attitudes, high levels of trust, accompanied by moderate levels of concern among general population participants for AI usage for health in Africa. This contrasts with expert responses, where major themes revolved around trust/mistrust, ethical concerns, and systemic barriers to integration, among others. This work presents the first-of-its-kind qualitative research study of the potential of AI for health in Africa from an algorithmic fairness angle, with perspectives from both experts and the general population. We hope that this work guides policymakers and drives home the need for further research and the inclusion of general population perspectives in decision-making around AI usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzi Yan, Xingzhou Lou, Jialian Li, Yiping Zhang, Jian Xie, Chao Yu, Yu Wang, Dong Yan, Yuan Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: A text encoder within Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP plays a crucial role in translating textual input into an embedding space shared with images, thereby facilitating the interpretative analysis of vision tasks through natural language. Despite the varying significance of different textual elements within a sentence depending on the context, efforts to account for variation of importance in constructing text embeddings have been lacking. We propose a framework of Semantic Token Reweighting to build Interpretable text embeddings (SToRI), which incorporates controllability as well. SToRI refines the text encoding process in CLIP by differentially weighting semantic elements based on contextual importance, enabling finer control over emphasis responsive to data-driven insights and user preferences. The efficacy of SToRI is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on few-shot image classification and image retrieval tailored to user preferences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Eliciting a high-dimensional probability distribution from an expert via noisy judgments is notoriously challenging, yet useful for many applications, such as prior elicitation and reward modeling. We introduce a method for eliciting the expert's belief density as a normalizing flow based solely on preferential questions such as comparing or ranking alternatives. This allows eliciting in principle arbitrarily flexible densities, but flow estimation is susceptible to the challenge of collapsing or diverging probability mass that makes it difficult in practice. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel functional prior for the flow, motivated by a decision-theoretic argument, and show empirically that the belief density can be inferred as the function-space maximum a posteriori estimate. We demonstrate our method by eliciting multivariate belief densities of simulated experts, including the prior belief of a general-purpose large language model over a real-world dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Min, Zeyu Qin, Nevin L. Zhang, Li Shen, Minhao Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as they allow attackers to manipulate model predictions with backdoor triggers. To address these security vulnerabilities, various backdoor purification methods have been proposed to purify compromised models. Typically, these purified models exhibit low Attack Success Rates (ASR), rendering them resistant to backdoored inputs. However, Does achieving a low ASR through current safety purification methods truly eliminate learned backdoor features from the pretraining phase? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question by thoroughly investigating the Post-Purification Robustness of current backdoor purification methods. We find that current safety purification methods are vulnerable to the rapid re-learning of backdoor behavior, even when further fine-tuning of purified models is performed using a very small number of poisoned samples. Based on this, we further propose the practical Query-based Reactivation Attack (QRA) which could effectively reactivate the backdoor by merely querying purified models. We find the failure to achieve satisfactory post-purification robustness stems from the insufficient deviation of purified models from the backdoored model along the backdoor-connected path. To improve the post-purification robustness, we propose a straightforward tuning defense, Path-Aware Minimization (PAM), which promotes deviation along backdoor-connected paths with extra model updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAM significantly improves post-purification robustness while maintaining a good clean accuracy and low ASR. Our work provides a new perspective on understanding the effectiveness of backdoor safety tuning and highlights the importance of faithfully assessing the model's safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Luo, Chen Chen, Shandong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt learning for pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP has demonstrated potent applicability across diverse downstream tasks. This lightweight approach has quickly gained traction from federated learning (FL) researchers who seek to efficiently adapt VLMs to heterogeneous scenarios. However, current federated prompt learning methods are habitually restricted to the traditional FL paradigm, where the participating clients are generally only allowed to download a single globally aggregated model from the server. While justifiable for training full-sized models under federated settings, in this work, we argue that this paradigm is ill-suited for lightweight prompts. By facilitating the clients to download multiple pre-aggregated prompts as fixed non-local experts, we propose Personalized Federated Mixture of Adaptive Prompts (pFedMoAP), a novel FL framework that personalizes the prompt learning process through the lens of Mixture of Experts (MoE). pFedMoAP implements a local attention-based gating network that learns to generate enhanced text features for better alignment with local image data on the client, benefiting from both local and downloaded non-local adaptive prompt experts. The non-local experts are sparsely selected from a server-maintained pool, fostering collaborative learning across clients. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments across 9 datasets under various heterogeneous federated settings. The results show that pFedMoAP consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives, underscoring its efficacy in personalizing prompt learning for CLIP within the federated learning paradigm.</p>

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a popular approach to achieve this alignment, but it faces challenges in computational efficiency and training stability.

However, DPO depends on a potentially suboptimal reference model, and SimPO's assumption of a fixed target reward margin may lead to suboptimal decisions in diverse data settings. In this work, we propose $\alpha$-DPO, an adaptive preference optimization algorithm designed to address these limitations by introducing a dynamic reward margin. Specifically, $\alpha$-DPO employs an adaptive preference distribution, balancing the policy model and the reference model to achieve personalized reward margins. We provide theoretical guarantees for $\alpha$-DPO, demonstrating its effectiveness as a surrogate optimization objective and its ability to balance alignment and diversity through KL divergence control. Empirical evaluations on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that $\alpha$-DPO consistently outperforms DPO and SimPO across various model settings, establishing it as a robust approach for fine-tuning LLMs. Our method achieves significant improvements in win rates, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for LLM alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rasoul Shafipour, David Harrison, Maxwell Horton, Jeffrey Marker, Houman Bedayat, Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Rastegari, Mahyar Najibi, Saman Naderiparizi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, but face significant challenges in widespread deployment due to their high runtime cost. In this paper, we introduce SeedLM, a novel post-training compression method that uses seeds of pseudo-random generators to encode and compress model weights. Specifically, for each block of weights, we find a seed that is fed into a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) during inference to efficiently generate a random matrix. This matrix is then linearly combined with compressed coefficients to reconstruct the weight block. SeedLM reduces memory access and leverages idle compute cycles during inference, effectively speeding up memory-bound tasks by trading compute for fewer memory accesses. Unlike state-of-the-art compression methods that rely on calibration data, our approach is data-free and generalizes well across diverse tasks. Our experiments with Llama 3 70B, which is particularly challenging to compress, show that SeedLM achieves significantly better zero-shot accuracy retention at 4- and 3-bit than state-of-the-art techniques, while maintaining performance comparable to FP16 baselines. Additionally, FPGA-based tests demonstrate that 4-bit SeedLM, as model size increases to 70B, approaches a 4x speed-up over an FP16 Llama 2/3 baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naveen Gupta, Medha Sawhney, Arka Daw, Youzuo Lin, Anuj Karpatne</p>
<p>Abstract: In subsurface imaging, learning the mapping from velocity maps to seismic waveforms (forward problem) and waveforms to velocity (inverse problem) is important for several applications. While traditional techniques for solving forward and inverse problems are computationally prohibitive, there is a growing interest in leveraging recent advances in deep learning to learn the mapping between velocity maps and seismic waveform images directly from data. Despite the variety of architectures explored in previous works, several open questions still remain unanswered such as the effect of latent space sizes, the importance of manifold learning, the complexity of translation models, and the value of jointly solving forward and inverse problems. We propose a unified framework to systematically characterize prior research in this area termed the Generalized Forward-Inverse (GFI) framework, building on the assumption of manifolds and latent space translations. We show that GFI encompasses previous works in deep learning for subsurface imaging, which can be viewed as specific instantiations of GFI. We also propose two new model architectures within the framework of GFI: Latent U-Net and Invertible X-Net, leveraging the power of U-Nets for domain translation and the ability of IU-Nets to simultaneously learn forward and inverse translations, respectively. We show that our proposed models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for forward and inverse problems on a wide range of synthetic datasets, and also investigate their zero-shot effectiveness on two real-world-like datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinpeng Wang, Xiaoying Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to train models that can effectively generalize to unseen domains. However, in the context of Federated Learning (FL), where clients collaboratively train a model without directly sharing their data, most existing DG algorithms are not directly applicable to the FL setting due to privacy constraints, as well as the limited data quantity and domain diversity at each client. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCCRL, a novel federated domain generalization method that significantly improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen domains without compromising privacy or incurring excessive computational and communication costs. Specifically, we adapt MixStyle to the federated setting to transfer domain-specific features while AugMix is employed to perturb domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we leverage supervised contrastive loss for representation alignment and utilize Jensen-Shannon divergence to ensure consistent predictions between original and augmented samples. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedCCRL achieves the state-of-the-art performances on the PACS, OfficeHome and miniDomainNet datasets across varying numbers of clients.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingze Wang, Ruoxi Yu, Weinan E, Lei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning capabilities, yet the theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms remain limited. A recent work (Elhage et al., 2021) identified a "rich" in-context mechanism known as induction head, contrasting with "lazy" $n$-gram models that overlook long-range dependencies. In this work, we provide both approximation and optimization analyses of how transformers implement induction heads. In the approximation analysis, we formalize both standard and generalized induction head mechanisms, and examine how transformers can efficiently implement them, with an emphasis on the distinct role of each transformer submodule. For the optimization analysis, we study the training dynamics on a synthetic mixed target, composed of a 4-gram and an in-context 2-gram component. This setting enables us to precisely characterize the entire training process and uncover an {\em abrupt transition} from lazy (4-gram) to rich (induction head) mechanisms as training progresses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolin Wang, Xuefeng Liu, Jianwei Niu, Wenkai Guo, Shaojie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm designed to protect user data privacy, which has been successfully implemented across various scenarios. In traditional federated learning, the entire parameter set of local models is updated and averaged in each training round. Although this full network update method maximizes knowledge acquisition and sharing for each model layer, it prevents the layers of the global model from cooperating effectively to complete the tasks of each client, a challenge we refer to as layer mismatch. This mismatch problem recurs after every parameter averaging, consequently slowing down model convergence and degrading overall performance. To address the layer mismatch issue, we introduce the FedPart method, which restricts model updates to either a single layer or a few layers during each communication round. Furthermore, to maintain the efficiency of knowledge acquisition and sharing, we develop several strategies to select trainable layers in each round, including sequential updating and multi-round cycle training. Through both theoretical analysis and experiments, our findings demonstrate that the FedPart method significantly surpasses conventional full network update strategies in terms of convergence speed and accuracy, while also reducing communication and computational overheads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David H. Brookes, Jakub Otwinowski, Sam Sinai</p>
<p>Abstract: Fitness functions map large combinatorial spaces of biological sequences to properties of interest. Inferring these multimodal functions from experimental data is a central task in modern protein engineering. Global epistasis models are an effective and physically-grounded class of models for estimating fitness functions from observed data. These models assume that a sparse latent function is transformed by a monotonic nonlinearity to emit measurable fitness. Here we demonstrate that minimizing supervised contrastive loss functions, such as the Bradley-Terry loss, is a simple and flexible technique for extracting the sparse latent function implied by global epistasis. We argue by way of a fitness-epistasis uncertainty principle that the nonlinearities in global epistasis models can produce observed fitness functions that do not admit sparse representations, and thus may be inefficient to learn from observations when using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss (a common practice). We show that contrastive losses are able to accurately estimate a ranking function from limited data even in regimes where MSE is ineffective and validate the practical utility of this insight by demonstrating that contrastive loss functions result in consistently improved performance on benchmark tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Meng, Bingxin Gu, Michael Fulham, Shaoli Song, Dagan Feng, Lei Bi, Jinman Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Survival prediction is a major concern for cancer management. Deep survival models based on deep learning have been widely adopted to perform end-to-end survival prediction from medical images. Recent deep survival models achieved promising performance by jointly performing tumor segmentation with survival prediction, where the models were guided to extract tumor-related information through Multi-Task Learning (MTL). However, these deep survival models have difficulties in exploring out-of-tumor prognostic information. In addition, existing deep survival models are unable to effectively leverage multi-modality images. Empirically-designed fusion strategies were commonly adopted to fuse multi-modality information via task-specific manually-designed networks, thus limiting the adaptability to different scenarios. In this study, we propose an Adaptive Multi-modality Segmentation-to-Survival model (AdaMSS) for survival prediction from PET/CT images. Instead of adopting MTL, we propose a novel Segmentation-to-Survival Learning (SSL) strategy, where our AdaMSS is trained for tumor segmentation and survival prediction sequentially in two stages. This strategy enables the AdaMSS to focus on tumor regions in the first stage and gradually expand its focus to include other prognosis-related regions in the second stage. We also propose a data-driven strategy to fuse multi-modality information, which realizes adaptive optimization of fusion strategies based on training data during training. With the SSL and data-driven fusion strategies, our AdaMSS is designed as an adaptive model that can self-adapt its focus regions and fusion strategy for different training stages. Extensive experiments with two large clinical datasets show that our AdaMSS outperforms state-of-the-art survival prediction methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of large language models for multilingual readability assessment. Existing evaluation resources lack domain and language diversity, limiting the ability for cross-domain and cross-lingual analyses. This paper introduces ReadMe++, a multilingual multi-domain dataset with human annotations of 9757 sentences in Arabic, English, French, Hindi, and Russian, collected from 112 different data sources. This benchmark will encourage research on developing robust multilingual readability assessment methods. Using ReadMe++, we benchmark multilingual and monolingual language models in the supervised, unsupervised, and few-shot prompting settings. The domain and language diversity in ReadMe++ enable us to test more effective few-shot prompting, and identify shortcomings in state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. Our experiments also reveal exciting results of superior domain generalization and enhanced cross-lingual transfer capabilities by models trained on ReadMe++. We will make our data publicly available and release a python package tool for multilingual sentence readability prediction using our trained models at: https://github.com/tareknaous/readme</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuangyu Ding, Jingyang Li, Kim-Chuan Toh</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic gradient methods for minimizing nonconvex composite objective functions typically rely on the Lipschitz smoothness of the differentiable part, but this assumption fails in many important problem classes like quadratic inverse problems and neural network training, leading to instability of the algorithms in both theory and practice. To address this, we propose a family of stochastic Bregman proximal gradient (SBPG) methods that only require smooth adaptivity. SBPG replaces the quadratic approximation in SGD with a Bregman proximity measure, offering a better approximation model that handles non-Lipschitz gradients in nonconvex objectives. We establish the convergence properties of vanilla SBPG and show it achieves optimal sample complexity in the nonconvex setting. Experimental results on quadratic inverse problems demonstrate SBPG's robustness in terms of stepsize selection and sensitivity to the initial point. Furthermore, we introduce a momentum-based variant, MSBPG, which enhances convergence by relaxing the mini-batch size requirement while preserving the optimal oracle complexity. We apply MSBPG to the training of deep neural networks, utilizing a polynomial kernel function to ensure smooth adaptivity of the loss function. Experimental results on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness and robustness of MSBPG in training neural networks. Given its negligible additional computational cost compared to SGD in large-scale optimization, MSBPG shows promise as a universal open-source optimizer for future applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florinel-Alin Croitoru, Vlad Hondru, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have recently attracted the interest of many researchers, and inverting the diffusion process can play an important role in better understanding the generative process and how to engineer prompts in order to obtain the desired images. To this end, we study the task of predicting the prompt embedding given an image generated by a generative diffusion model. We consider a series of white-box and black-box models (with and without access to the weights of the diffusion network) to deal with the proposed task. We propose a novel learning framework comprising a joint prompt regression and multi-label vocabulary classification objective that generates improved prompts. To further improve our method, we employ a curriculum learning procedure that promotes the learning of image-prompt pairs with lower labeling noise (i.e. that are better aligned). We conduct experiments on the DiffusionDB data set, predicting text prompts from images generated by Stable Diffusion. In addition, we make an interesting discovery: training a diffusion model on the prompt generation task can make the model generate images that are much better aligned with the input prompts, when the model is directly reused for text-to-image generation.

<p>Abstract: Finding errors in machine learning applications requires a thorough exploration of their behavior over data. Existing approaches used by practitioners are often ad-hoc and lack the abstractions needed to scale this process. We present TorchQL, a programming framework to evaluate and improve the correctness of machine learning applications. TorchQL allows users to write queries to specify and check integrity constraints over machine learning models and datasets. It seamlessly integrates relational algebra with functional programming to allow for highly expressive queries using only eight intuitive operators. We evaluate TorchQL on diverse use-cases including finding critical temporal inconsistencies in objects detected across video frames in autonomous driving, finding data imputation errors in time-series medical records, finding data labeling errors in real-world images, and evaluating biases and constraining outputs of language models. Our experiments show that TorchQL enables up to 13x faster query executions than baselines like Pandas and MongoDB, and up to 40% shorter queries than native Python. We also conduct a user study and find that TorchQL is natural enough for developers familiar with Python to specify complex integrity constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Co-designing autonomous robotic agents involves simultaneously optimizing the controller and physical design of the agent. Its inherent bi-level optimization formulation necessitates an outer loop design optimization driven by an inner loop control optimization. This can be challenging when the design space is large and each design evaluation involves a data-intensive reinforcement learning process for control optimization. To improve the sample efficiency of co-design, we propose a multi-fidelity-based exploration strategy in which we tie the controllers learned across the design spaces through a universal policy learner for warm-starting subsequent controller learning problems. Experiments performed on a wide range of agent design problems demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to baselines. Additionally, analysis of the optimized designs shows interesting design alterations, including design simplifications and non-intuitive alterations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we empirically reveal an invariance over images-images share a set of one-way wave equations with latent speeds. Each image is uniquely associated with a solution to these wave equations, allowing for its reconstruction with high fidelity from an initial condition. We demonstrate it using an intuitive encoder-decoder framework where each image is encoded into its corresponding initial condition (a single vector). Subsequently, the initial condition undergoes a specialized decoder, transforming the one-way wave equations into a first-order norm + linear autoregressive process. This process propagates the initial condition along the x and y directions, generating a high-resolution feature map (up to the image resolution), followed by a few convolutional layers to reconstruct image pixels. The revealed invariance, rooted in the shared wave equations, offers a fresh perspective for comprehending images, establishing a promising avenue for further exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaorong Wang, Clara Na, Emma Strubell, Sorelle Friedler, Sasha Luccioni</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the popularity of the `pre-train then fine-tune' paradigm in the NLP community, existing work quantifying energy costs and associated carbon emissions has largely focused on language model pre-training. Although a single pre-training run draws substantially more energy than fine-tuning, fine-tuning is performed more frequently by many more individual actors, and thus must be accounted for when considering the energy and carbon footprint of NLP. In order to better characterize the role of fine-tuning in the landscape of energy and carbon emissions in NLP, we perform a careful empirical study of the computational costs of fine-tuning across tasks, datasets, hardware infrastructure and measurement modalities. Our experimental results allow us to place fine-tuning energy and carbon costs into perspective with respect to pre-training and inference, and outline recommendations to NLP researchers and practitioners who wish to improve their fine-tuning energy efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaodan Du, Nicholas Kolkin, Greg Shakhnarovich, Anand Bhattad</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models excel at mimicking real scenes, suggesting they might inherently encode important intrinsic scene properties. In this paper, we aim to explore the following key questions: (1) What intrinsic knowledge do generative models like GANs, Autoregressive models, and Diffusion models encode? (2) Can we establish a general framework to recover intrinsic representations from these models, regardless of their architecture or model type? (3) How minimal can the required learnable parameters and labeled data be to successfully recover this knowledge? (4) Is there a direct link between the quality of a generative model and the accuracy of the recovered scene intrinsics?
  Our findings indicate that a small Low-Rank Adaptators (LoRA) can recover intrinsic images-depth, normals, albedo and shading-across different generators (Autoregressive, GANs and Diffusion) while using the same decoder head that generates the image. As LoRA is lightweight, we introduce very few learnable parameters (as few as 0.04% of Stable Diffusion model weights for a rank of 2), and we find that as few as 250 labeled images are enough to generate intrinsic images with these LoRA modules. Finally, we also show a positive correlation between the generative model's quality and the accuracy of the recovered intrinsics through control experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamel Alrashedy, Abdullah Aljasser, Pradyumna Tambwekar, Matthew Gombolay</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive proficiency in code generation. Unfortunately, these models share a weakness with their human counterparts: producing code that inadvertently has security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized attackers to access sensitive data or systems, which is unacceptable for safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Feedback-Driven Security Patching (FDSP), where LLMs automatically refine generated, vulnerable code. Our approach leverages automatic static code analysis to empower the LLM to generate and implement potential solutions to address vulnerabilities. We address the research communitys needs for safe code generation by introducing a large-scale dataset, PythonSecurityEval, covering the diversity of real-world applications, including databases, websites and operating systems. We empirically validate that FDSP outperforms prior work that uses self-feedback from LLMs by up to 17.6% through our procedure that injects targeted, external feedback.

<p>Abstract: Several approaches to graphically representing context-specific relations among jointly distributed categorical variables have been proposed, along with structure learning algorithms. While existing optimization-based methods have limited scalability due to the large number of context-specific models, the constraint-based methods are more prone to error than even constraint-based directed acyclic graph learning algorithms since more relations must be tested. We present an algorithm for learning context-specific models that scales to hundreds of variables. Scalable learning is achieved through a combination of an order-based Markov chain Monte-Carlo search and a novel, context-specific sparsity assumption that is analogous to those typically invoked for directed acyclic graphical models. Unlike previous Markov chain Monte-Carlo search methods, our Markov chain is guaranteed to have the true posterior of the variable orderings as the stationary distribution. To implement the method, we solve a first case of an open problem recently posed by Alon and Balogh. Future work solving increasingly general instances of this problem would allow our methods to learn increasingly dense models. The method is shown to perform well on synthetic data and real world examples, in terms of both accuracy and scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baihan Lin, Djallel Bouneffouf, Yulia Landa, Rachel Jespersen, Cheryl Corcoran, Guillermo Cecchi</p>
<p>Abstract: The therapeutic working alliance is a critical factor in predicting the success of psychotherapy treatment. Traditionally, working alliance assessment relies on questionnaires completed by both therapists and patients. In this paper, we present COMPASS, a novel framework to directly infer the therapeutic working alliance from the natural language used in psychotherapy sessions. Our approach utilizes advanced large language models (LLMs) to analyze transcripts of psychotherapy sessions and compare them with distributed representations of statements in the working alliance inventory. Analyzing a dataset of over 950 sessions covering diverse psychiatric conditions including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and suicidal tendencies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing fine-grained mapping of patient-therapist alignment trajectories and offering interpretability for clinical psychiatry and in identifying emerging patterns related to the condition being treated. By employing various deep learning-based topic modeling techniques in combination with prompting generative language models, we analyze the topical characteristics of different psychiatric conditions and their evolution at a turn-level resolution. This combined framework enhances the understanding of therapeutic interactions, enabling timely feedback for therapists regarding the quality of therapeutic relationships and providing interpretable insights to improve the effectiveness of psychotherapy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangming Huang, Yingya Li, Shoaib Jameel, Yunfei Long, Giorgos Papanastasiou</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has substantially enhanced natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare research. However, the increasing complexity of DL-based NLP necessitates transparent model interpretability, or at least explainability, for reliable decision-making. This work presents a thorough scoping review of explainable and interpretable DL in healthcare NLP. The term "eXplainable and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence" (XIAI) is introduced to distinguish XAI from IAI. Different models are further categorized based on their functionality (model-, input-, output-based) and scope (local, global). Our analysis shows that attention mechanisms are the most prevalent emerging IAI technique. The use of IAI is growing, distinguishing it from XAI. The major challenges identified are that most XIAI does not explore "global" modelling processes, the lack of best practices, and the lack of systematic evaluation and benchmarks. One important opportunity is to use attention mechanisms to enhance multi-modal XIAI for personalized medicine. Additionally, combining DL with causal logic holds promise. Our discussion encourages the integration of XIAI in Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain-specific smaller models. In conclusion, XIAI adoption in healthcare requires dedicated in-house expertise. Collaboration with domain experts, end-users, and policymakers can lead to ready-to-use XIAI methods across NLP and medical tasks. While challenges exist, XIAI techniques offer a valuable foundation for interpretable NLP algorithms in healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenru Duan, Guan-Horng Liu, Yuanqi Du, Tianrong Chen, Qiyuan Zhao, Haojun Jia, Carla P. Gomes, Evangelos A. Theodorou, Heather J. Kulik</p>
<p>Abstract: Transition states (TSs) are transient structures that are key in understanding reaction mechanisms and designing catalysts but challenging to be captured in experiments. Alternatively, many optimization algorithms have been developed to search for TSs computationally. Yet the cost of these algorithms driven by quantum chemistry methods (usually density functional theory) is still high, posing challenges for their applications in building large reaction networks for reaction exploration. Here we developed React-OT, an optimal transport approach for generating unique TS structures from reactants and products. React-OT generates highly accurate TS structures with a median structural root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.053{\AA} and median barrier height error of 1.06 kcal/mol requiring only 0.4 second per reaction. The RMSD and barrier height error is further improved by roughly 25\% through pretraining React-OT on a large reaction dataset obtained with a lower level of theory, GFN2-xTB. We envision that the remarkable accuracy and rapid inference of React-OT will be highly useful when integrated with the current high-throughput TS search workflow. This integration will facilitate the exploration of chemical reactions with unknown mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingqing Guo, Hui Yuan, Yukang Yang, Minshuo Chen, Mengdi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated empirical successes in various applications and can be adapted to task-specific needs via guidance. This paper studies a form of gradient guidance for adapting a pre-trained diffusion model towards optimizing user-specified objectives. We establish a mathematical framework for guided diffusion to systematically study its optimization theory and algorithmic design. Our theoretical analysis spots a strong link between guided diffusion models and optimization: gradient-guided diffusion models are essentially sampling solutions to a regularized optimization problem, where the regularization is imposed by the pre-training data. As for guidance design, directly bringing in the gradient of an external objective function as guidance would jeopardize the structure in generated samples. We investigate a modified form of gradient guidance based on a forward prediction loss, which leverages the information in pre-trained score functions and provably preserves the latent structure. We further consider an iteratively fine-tuned version of gradient-guided diffusion where guidance and score network are both updated with newly generated samples. This process mimics a first-order optimization iteration in expectation, for which we proved O(1/K) convergence rate to the global optimum when the objective function is concave. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yukang123/GGDMOptim.git.</p>

<p>Abstract: One strategy in response to pluralistic values in a user population is to personalize an AI system: if the AI can adapt to the specific values of each individual, then we can potentially avoid many of the challenges of pluralism. Unfortunately, this approach creates a significant ethical issue: if there is an external measure of success for the human-AI team, then the adaptive AI system may develop strategies (sometimes deceptive) to compensate for its human teammate. This phenomenon can be viewed as a form of social compensation, where the AI makes decisions based not on predefined goals but on its human partner's deficiencies in relation to the team's performance objectives. We provide a practical ethical analysis of the conditions in which such compensation may nonetheless be justifiable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isidro G\'omez-Vargas, J. Alberto V\'azquez</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to accelerate the Bayesian inference process, focusing specifically on the nested sampling algorithms. Bayesian inference plays a crucial role in cosmological parameter estimation, providing a robust framework for extracting theoretical insights from observational data. However, its computational demands can be substantial, primarily due to the need for numerous likelihood function evaluations. Our proposed method utilizes the power of deep learning, employing feedforward neural networks to approximate the likelihood function dynamically during the Bayesian inference process. Unlike traditional approaches, our method trains neural networks on-the-fly using the current set of live points as training data, without the need for pre-training. This flexibility enables adaptation to various theoretical models and datasets. We perform simple hyperparameter optimization using genetic algorithms to suggest initial neural network architectures for learning each likelihood function. Once sufficient accuracy is achieved, the neural network replaces the original likelihood function. The implementation integrates with nested sampling algorithms and has been thoroughly evaluated using both simple cosmological dark energy models and diverse observational datasets. Additionally, we explore the potential of genetic algorithms for generating initial live points within nested sampling inference, opening up new avenues for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of Bayesian inference methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Transformer models in replicating cross-language structural priming, a key indicator of abstract grammatical representations in human language processing. Focusing on Chinese-English priming, which involves two typologically distinct languages, we examine how these models handle the robust phenomenon of structural priming, where exposure to a particular sentence structure increases the likelihood of selecting a similar structure subsequently. Our findings indicate that transformers outperform RNNs in generating primed sentence structures, with accuracy rates that exceed 25.84\% to 33. 33\%. This challenges the conventional belief that human sentence processing primarily involves recurrent and immediate processing and suggests a role for cue-based retrieval mechanisms. This work contributes to our understanding of how computational models may reflect human cognitive processes across diverse language families.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meenatchi Sundaram Muthu Selva Annamalai, Emiliano De Cristofaro</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an auditing procedure for the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) algorithm in the black-box threat model that is substantially tighter than prior work. The main intuition is to craft worst-case initial model parameters, as DP-SGD's privacy analysis is agnostic to the choice of the initial model parameters. For models trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10 at theoretical $\varepsilon=10.0$, our auditing procedure yields empirical estimates of $\varepsilon_{emp} = 7.21$ and $6.95$, respectively, on a 1,000-record sample and $\varepsilon_{emp}= 6.48$ and $4.96$ on the full datasets. By contrast, previous audits were only (relatively) tight in stronger white-box models, where the adversary can access the model's inner parameters and insert arbitrary gradients. Overall, our auditing procedure can offer valuable insight into how the privacy analysis of DP-SGD could be improved and detect bugs and DP violations in real-world implementations.

<p>Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, have allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuits hold potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinliang Zheng, Jianxiong Li, Sijie Cheng, Yinan Zheng, Jiaming Li, Jihao Liu, Yu Liu, Jingjing Liu, Xianyuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction following is crucial in contemporary LLM. However, when extended to multimodal setting, it often suffers from misalignment between specific textual instruction and targeted local region of an image. To achieve more accurate and nuanced multimodal instruction following, we introduce Instruction-guided Visual Masking (IVM), a new versatile visual grounding model that is compatible with diverse multimodal models, such as LMM and robot model. By constructing visual masks for instruction-irrelevant regions, IVM-enhanced multimodal models can effectively focus on task-relevant image regions to better align with complex instructions. Specifically, we design a visual masking data generation pipeline and create an IVM-Mix-1M dataset with 1 million image-instruction pairs. We further introduce a new learning technique, Discriminator Weighted Supervised Learning (DWSL) for preferential IVM training that prioritizes high-quality data samples. Experimental results on generic multimodal tasks such as VQA and embodied robotic control demonstrate the versatility of IVM, which as a plug-and-play tool, significantly boosts the performance of diverse multimodal models, yielding new state-of-the-art results across challenging multimodal benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: An important challenge in machine translation (MT) is to generate high-quality and diverse translations. Prior work has shown that the estimated likelihood from the MT model correlates poorly with translation quality. In contrast, quality evaluation metrics (such as COMET or BLEURT) exhibit high correlations with human judgments, which has motivated their use as rerankers (such as quality-aware and minimum Bayes risk decoding). However, relying on a single translation with high estimated quality increases the chances of "gaming the metric''. In this paper, we address the problem of sampling a set of high-quality and diverse translations. We provide a simple and effective way to avoid over-reliance on noisy quality estimates by using them as the energy function of a Gibbs distribution. Instead of looking for a mode in the distribution, we generate multiple samples from high-density areas through the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a simple Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The results show that our proposed method leads to high-quality and diverse outputs across multiple language pairs (English$\leftrightarrow${German, Russian}) with two strong decoder-only LLMs (Alma-7b, Tower-7b).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuvendu K. Lahiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Verification-aware programming languages such as Dafny and F* provide means to formally specify and prove properties of a program. Although the problem of checking an implementation against a specification can be defined mechanically, there is no algorithmic way of ensuring the correctness of the {\it user-intent formalization for programs}, expressed as a formal specification. This is because intent or requirement is expressed {\it informally} in natural language and the specification is a formal artefact. Despite, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has made tremendous strides bridging the gap between informal intent and formal program implementations recently, driven in large parts by benchmarks and automated metrics for evaluation.
  Recent work has proposed a framework for evaluating the {\it user-intent formalization} problem for mainstream programming languages~\cite{endres-fse24}. However, such an approach does not readily extend to verification-aware languages that support rich specifications (using quantifiers and ghost variables) that cannot be evaluated through dynamic execution. Previous work also required generating program mutants using LLMs to create the benchmark. We advocate an alternate, perhaps simpler approach of {\it symbolically testing specifications} to provide an intuitive metric for evaluating the quality of specifications for verification-aware languages. We demonstrate that our automated metric agrees closely on a human-labeled dataset of Dafny specifications for the popular MBPP code-generation benchmark, yet demonstrates cases where the human labeling is not perfect. We also outline formal verification challenges that need to be addressed to apply the technique more widely. We believe our work provides a stepping stone to enable the establishment of a benchmark and research agenda for the problem of user-intent formalization for programs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The effective alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with precise instructions is essential for their application in diverse real-world scenarios. Current methods focus on enhancing the diversity and complexity of training and evaluation samples, yet they fall short in accurately assessing LLMs' ability to follow similar instruction variants. We introduce an effective data augmentation technique DeMoRecon that decomposes complex instructions into simpler sub-components, modifies these, and reconstructs them into new variants, thereby preserves the original instruction's context and complexity while introducing variability, which is critical for training and evaluating LLMs' instruction-following precision. Based on DeMoRecon, we developed the FGIV dataset which contains fine-grained instruction variants of 1,773 seed instructions to both fine-tune and evaluate LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs fine-tuned with FGIV will gain significant performance boost on both ours and commonly used instructions-following benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronny Luss, Erik Miehling, Amit Dhurandhar</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of black-box deep neural network classification models has sparked the need to explain their decisions. However, in the case of generative AI, such as large language models (LLMs), there is no class prediction to explain. Rather, one can ask why an LLM output a particular response to a given prompt. In this paper, we answer this question by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first contrastive explanation methods requiring simply black-box/query access. Our explanations suggest that an LLM outputs a reply to a given prompt because if the prompt was slightly modified, the LLM would have given a different response that is either less preferable or contradicts the original response. The key insight is that contrastive explanations simply require a scoring function that has meaning to the user and not necessarily a specific real valued quantity (viz. class label). We offer two algorithms for finding contrastive explanations: i) A myopic algorithm, which although effective in creating contrasts, requires many model calls and ii) A budgeted algorithm, our main algorithmic contribution, which intelligently creates contrasts adhering to a query budget, necessary for longer contexts. We show the efficacy of these methods on diverse natural language tasks such as open-text generation, automated red teaming, and explaining conversational degradation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Differentiable Search Index (DSI) utilizes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for efficient document retrieval without relying on external indexes. However, DSI needs full re-training to handle updates in dynamic corpora, causing significant computational inefficiencies. We introduce PromptDSI, a prompt-based rehearsal-free approach for instance-wise incremental learning document retrieval. PromptDSI attaches prompts to the frozen PLM's encoder of DSI, leveraging its powerful representation to efficiently index new corpora while maintaining a balance between stability and plasticity. We eliminate the initial forward pass of prompt-based continual learning methods that doubles training and inference time. Moreover, we propose a topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys. This strategy ensures diverse and effective prompt usage, addressing the challenge of parameter underutilization caused by the collapse of the query-key matching mechanism. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that BERT-based PromptDSI matches IncDSI in managing forgetting while improving new corpora performance by more than 4% Hits@10 on NQ320k and upto 3% MRR@10 on MS MARCO 300k.</p>

<p>Abstract: Persona assignment has become a common strategy for customizing LLM use to particular tasks and contexts. In this study, we explore how evaluation of different nations change when LLMs are assigned specific nationality personas. We assign 193 different nationality personas (e.g., an American person) to four LLMs and examine how the LLM evaluations (or ''perceptions'')of countries change. We find that all LLM-persona combinations tend to favor Western European nations, though nation-personas push LLM behaviors to focus more on and treat the nation-persona's own region more favorably. Eastern European, Latin American, and African nations are treated more negatively by different nationality personas. We additionally find that evaluations by nation-persona LLMs of other nations correlate with human survey responses but fail to match the values closely. Our study provides insight into how biases and stereotypes are realized within LLMs when adopting different national personas. In line with the ''Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights'', our findings underscore the critical need for developing mechanisms to ensure that LLM outputs promote fairness and avoid over-generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Shahriar Rahim Siddiqui, Arman Rahmim, Eldad Haber</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal experimental design is a well studied field in applied science and engineering. Techniques for estimating such a design are commonly used within the framework of parameter estimation. Nonetheless, in recent years parameter estimation techniques are changing rapidly with the introduction of deep learning techniques to replace traditional estimation methods. This in turn requires the adaptation of optimal experimental design that is associated with these new techniques. In this paper we investigate a new experimental design methodology that uses deep learning. We show that the training of a network as a Likelihood Free Estimator can be used to significantly simplify the design process and circumvent the need for the computationally expensive bi-level optimization problem that is inherent in optimal experimental design for non-linear systems. Furthermore, deep design improves the quality of the recovery process for parameter estimation problems. As proof of concept we apply our methodology to two different systems of Ordinary Differential Equations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hakaze Cho, Yoshihiro Sakai, Mariko Kato, Kenshiro Tanaka, Akira Ishii, Naoya Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) typically utilizes classification criteria from output probabilities of manually selected label tokens. However, we argue that such token-based classification criteria lead to suboptimal decision boundaries, despite delicate calibrations through translation and constrained rotation applied. To address this problem, we propose Hidden Calibration, which renounces token probabilities and uses the nearest centroid classifier on the LM's last hidden states. In detail, we assign the label of the nearest centroid previously estimated from a calibration set to the test sample as the predicted label. Our experiments on 6 models and 10 classification datasets indicate that Hidden Calibration consistently outperforms current token-based baselines by about 20%~50%, achieving a strong state-of-the-art in ICL. Our further analysis demonstrates that Hidden Calibration finds better classification criteria with less inter-class overlap, and LMs provide linearly separable intra-class clusters with the help of demonstrations, which supports Hidden Calibration and gives new insights into the principle of ICL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siran Liu, Petros Dellaportas, Michalis K. Titsias</p>
<p>Abstract: Assume that we would like to estimate the expected value of a function $F$ with respect to an intractable density $\pi$, which is specified up to some unknown normalising constant. We prove that if $\pi$ is close enough under KL divergence to another density $q$, an independent Metropolis sampler estimator that obtains samples from $\pi$ with proposal density $q$, enriched with a variance reduction computational strategy based on control variates, achieves smaller asymptotic variance than i.i.d.\ sampling from $\pi$. The control variates construction requires no extra computational effort but assumes that the expected value of $F$ under $q$ is analytically available. We illustrate this result by calculating the marginal likelihood in a linear regression model with prior-likelihood conflict and a non-conjugate prior. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive independent Metropolis algorithm that adapts the proposal density such that its KL divergence with the target is being reduced. We demonstrate its applicability in a Bayesian logistic and Gaussian process regression problems and we rigorously justify our asymptotic arguments under easily verifiable and essentially minimal conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaru Zou, Mengyu Zhou, Tao Li, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their usage in domain-specific tasks. Despite the success, fine-tuning continues to rely on repeated and lengthy prompts, which escalate computational expenses, require more resources, and lead to slower inference. In this paper, we present a novel approach, PromptIntern, which internalizes prompt knowledge during model fine-tuning to achieve efficient inference and save costs. Instead of compressing the prompts for a vanilla model, PromptIntern aims to embed the recurrent prompt directly into the model parameters. We design a fine-tuning pipeline that includes instruction template compression, few-shot example absorption, and a progressive internalization strategy, effectively diminishing the need for intricate prompts during inference. Comprehensive experiments on challenging NL2Code tasks demonstrate that our method reduces input tokens by more than 90%, accelerates inference by 4.2 times, and reduces monetary inference costs by 88.3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Lanzoni, Andrea Fantasia, Roberto Bergamaschini, Olivier Pierre-Louis, Francesco Montalenti</p>
<p>Abstract: A Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) is trained to reproduce the evolution of the spinodal decomposition process in three dimensions as described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. A specialized, physics-inspired architecture is proven to provide close accordance between the predicted evolutions and the ground truth ones obtained via conventional integration schemes. The method can accurately reproduce the evolution of microstructures not represented in the training set at a fraction of the computational costs. Extremely long-time extrapolation capabilities are achieved, up to reaching the theoretically expected equilibrium state of the system, consisting of a layered, phase-separated morphology, despite the training set containing only relatively-short, initial phases of the evolution. Quantitative accordance with the decay rate of the Free energy is also demonstrated up to the late coarsening stages, proving that this class of Machine Learning approaches can become a new and powerful tool for the long timescale and high throughput simulation of materials, while retaining thermodynamic consistency and high-accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) increasingly struggle to differentiate between top-performing models, underscoring the need for more challenging evaluation frameworks. We introduce MMLU-Pro+, an enhanced benchmark building upon MMLU-Pro to assess shortcut learning and higher-order reasoning in LLMs. By incorporating questions with multiple correct answers across diverse domains, MMLU-Pro+ tests LLMs' ability to engage in complex reasoning and resist simplistic problem-solving strategies. Our results show that MMLU-Pro+ maintains MMLU-Pro's difficulty while providing a more rigorous test of model discrimination, particularly in multi-correct answer scenarios. We introduce novel metrics like shortcut selection ratio and correct pair identification ratio, offering deeper insights into model behavior and anchoring bias. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art LLMs reveal significant performance gaps, highlighting variations in reasoning abilities and bias susceptibility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongweiyang Xu, Debottam Dutta, Yu-Lin Wei, Romit Roy Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Most music generation models directly generate a single music mixture. To allow for more flexible and controllable generation, the Multi-Source Diffusion Model (MSDM) has been proposed to model music as a mixture of multiple instrumental sources (e.g. piano, drums, bass, and guitar). Its goal is to use one single diffusion model to generate mutually-coherent music sources, that are then mixed to form the music. Despite its capabilities, MSDM is unable to generate music with rich melodies and often generates empty sounds. Its waveform diffusion approach also introduces significant Gaussian noise artifacts that compromise audio quality. In response, we introduce a Multi-Source Latent Diffusion Model (MSLDM) that employs Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode each instrumental source into a distinct latent representation. By training a VAE on all music sources, we efficiently capture each source's unique characteristics in a "source latent." The source latents are concatenated and our diffusion model learns this joint latent space. This approach significantly enhances the total and partial generation of music by leveraging the VAE's latent compression and noise-robustness. The compressed source latent also facilitates more efficient generation. Subjective listening tests and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) scores confirm that our model outperforms MSDM, showcasing its practical and enhanced applicability in music generation systems. We also emphasize that modeling sources is more effective than direct music mixture modeling. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/XZWY/MSLDM.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushal Kedia, Prithwish Dan, Angela Chao, Maximus Adrian Pace, Sanjiban Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Human demonstrations as prompts are a powerful way to program robots to do long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, translating these demonstrations into robot-executable actions presents significant challenges due to execution mismatches in movement styles and physical capabilities. Existing methods either depend on human-robot paired data, which is infeasible to scale, or rely heavily on frame-level visual similarities that often break down in practice. To address these challenges, we propose RHyME, a novel framework that automatically aligns human and robot task executions using optimal transport costs. Given long-horizon robot demonstrations, RHyME synthesizes semantically equivalent human videos by retrieving and composing short-horizon human clips. This approach facilitates effective policy training without the need for paired data. RHyME successfully imitates a range of cross-embodiment demonstrators, both in simulation and with a real human hand, achieving over 50\% increase in task success compared to previous methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexis Vieloszynski, Soumaya Cherkaoui, Jean-Fr\'ed\'eric Laprade, Oliver Nahman-L\'evesque, Abdallah Aaraba, Shengrui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum machine learning consists in taking advantage of quantum computations to generate classical data. A potential application of quantum machine learning is to harness the power of quantum computers for generating classical data, a process essential to a multitude of applications such as enriching training datasets, anomaly detection, and risk management in finance. Given the success of Generative Adversarial Networks in classical image generation, the development of its quantum versions has been actively conducted. However, existing implementations on quantum computers often face significant challenges, such as scalability and training convergence issues. To address these issues, we propose LatentQGAN, a novel quantum model that uses a hybrid quantum-classical GAN coupled with an autoencoder. Although it was initially designed for image generation, the LatentQGAN approach holds potential for broader application across various practical data generation tasks. Experimental outcomes on both classical simulators and noisy intermediate scale quantum computers have demonstrated significant performance enhancements over existing quantum methods, alongside a significant reduction in quantum resources overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heegyu Kim, Taeyang Jeon, Seunghwan Choi, Seungtaek Choi, Hyunsouk Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems have become crucial for translating natural language into SQL queries in various industries, enabling non-technical users to perform complex data operations. The need for accurate evaluation methods has increased as these systems have grown more sophisticated. However, the Execution Accuracy (EX), the most prevalent evaluation metric, still shows many false positives and negatives. Thus, this paper introduces FLEX (False-Less EXecution), a novel approach to evaluating text-to-SQL systems using large language models (LLMs) to emulate human expert-level evaluation of SQL queries. Our metric improves agreement with human experts (from 62 to 87.04 in Cohen's kappa) with comprehensive context and sophisticated criteria. Our extensive experiments yield several key insights: (1) Models' performance increases by over 2.6 points on average, substantially affecting rankings on Spider and BIRD benchmarks; (2) The underestimation of models in EX primarily stems from annotation quality issues; and (3) Model performance on particularly challenging questions tends to be overestimated. This work contributes to a more accurate and nuanced evaluation of text-to-SQL systems, potentially reshaping our understanding of state-of-the-art performance in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Li, Ti Zhou, Haoyu Wang, Man Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Periodic soft real-time systems have broad applications in many areas, such as IoT. Finding an optimal energy-efficient policy that is adaptable to underlying edge devices while meeting deadlines for tasks has always been challenging. This research studies generalized systems with multi-task, multi-deadline scenarios with reinforcement learning-based DVFS for energy saving. This work addresses the limitation of previous work that models a periodic system as a single task and single-deadline scenario, which is too simplified to cope with complex situations. The method encodes time series information in the Linux kernel into information that is easy to use for reinforcement learning, allowing the system to generate DVFS policies to adapt system patterns based on the general workload. For encoding, we present two different methods for comparison. Both methods use only one performance counter: system utilization and the kernel only needs minimal information from the userspace. Our method is implemented on Jetson Nano Board (2GB) and is tested with three fixed multitask workloads, which are three, five, and eight tasks in the workload, respectively. For randomness and generalization, we also designed a random workload generator to build different multitask workloads to test. Based on the test results, our method could save 3%-10% power compared to Linux built-in governors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xihao Piao, Zheng Chen, Yushun Dong, Yasuko Matsubara, Yasushi Sakurai</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent normalization-based methods have shown great success in tackling the distribution shift issue, facilitating non-stationary time series forecasting. Since these methods operate in the time domain, they may fail to fully capture the dynamic patterns that are more apparent in the frequency domain, leading to suboptimal results. This paper first theoretically analyzes how normalization methods affect frequency components. We prove that the current normalization methods that operate in the time domain uniformly scale non-zero frequencies, and thus, they struggle to determine components that contribute to more robust forecasting. Therefore, we propose FredNormer, which observes datasets from a frequency perspective and adaptively up-weights the key frequency components. To this end, FredNormer consists of two components: a statistical metric that normalizes the input samples based on their frequency stability and a learnable weighting layer that adjusts stability and introduces sample-specific variations. Notably, FredNormer is a plug-and-play module, which does not compromise the efficiency compared to existing normalization methods. Extensive experiments show that FredNormer improves the averaged MSE of backbone forecasting models by 33.3% and 55.3% on the ETTm2 dataset. Compared to the baseline normalization methods, FredNormer achieves 18 top-1 results and 6 top-2 results out of 28 settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nirmalya Thakur</p>
<p>Abstract: The work presented in this paper makes three scientific contributions with a specific focus on mining and analysis of COVID-19-related posts on Instagram. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 500,153 Instagram posts about COVID-19 published between January 2020 and September 2024. This dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/d46p-v480, contains Instagram posts in 161 different languages as well as 535,021 distinct hashtags. After the development of this dataset, multilingual sentiment analysis was performed, which involved classifying each post as positive, negative, or neutral. The results of sentiment analysis are presented as a separate attribute in this dataset. Second, it presents the results of performing sentiment analysis per year from 2020 to 2024. The findings revealed the trends in sentiment related to COVID-19 on Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic. For instance, between 2020 and 2024, the sentiment trends show a notable shift, with positive sentiment decreasing from 38.35% to 28.69%, while neutral sentiment rising from 44.19% to 58.34%. Finally, the paper also presents findings of language-specific sentiment analysis. This analysis highlighted similar and contrasting trends of sentiment across posts published in different languages on Instagram. For instance, out of all English posts, 49.68% were positive, 14.84% were negative, and 35.48% were neutral. In contrast, among Hindi posts, 4.40% were positive, 57.04% were negative, and 38.56% were neutral, reflecting distinct differences in the sentiment distribution between these two languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaorui Tan, Xi Yang, Qiufeng Wang, Anh Nguyen, Kaizhu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision models excel in image classification but struggle to generalize to unseen data, such as classifying images from unseen domains or discovering novel categories. In this paper, we explore the relationship between logical reasoning and deep learning generalization in visual classification. A logical regularization termed L-Reg is derived which bridges a logical analysis framework to image classification. Our work reveals that L-Reg reduces the complexity of the model in terms of the feature distribution and classifier weights. Specifically, we unveil the interpretability brought by L-Reg, as it enables the model to extract the salient features, such as faces to persons, for classification. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that L-Reg enhances generalization across various scenarios, including multi-domain generalization and generalized category discovery. In complex real-world scenarios where images span unknown classes and unseen domains, L-Reg consistently improves generalization, highlighting its practical efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> F{\i}rat \"Oncel, Matthias Bethge, Beyza Ermis, Mirco Ravanelli, Cem Subakan, \c{C}a\u{g}atay Y{\i}ld{\i}z</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last decade, the generalization and adaptation abilities of deep learning models were typically evaluated on fixed training and test distributions. Contrary to traditional deep learning, large language models (LLMs) are (i) even more overparameterized, (ii) trained on unlabeled text corpora curated from the Internet with minimal human intervention, and (iii) trained in an online fashion. These stark contrasts prevent researchers from transferring lessons learned on model generalization and adaptation in deep learning contexts to LLMs. To this end, our short paper introduces empirical observations that aim to shed light on further training of already pretrained language models. Specifically, we demonstrate that training a model on a text domain could degrade its perplexity on the test portion of the same domain. We observe with our subsequent analysis that the performance degradation is positively correlated with the similarity between the additional and the original pretraining dataset of the LLM. Our further token-level perplexity observations reveals that the perplexity degradation is due to a handful of tokens that are not informative about the domain. We hope these findings will guide us in determining when to adapt a model vs when to rely on its foundational capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enrico Ventura, Beatrice Achilli, Gianluigi Silvestri, Carlo Lucibello, Luca Ambrogioni</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the latent geometry of generative diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis. To this purpose, we analyze the spectrum of eigenvalues (and singular values) of the Jacobian of the score function, whose discontinuities (gaps) reveal the presence and dimensionality of distinct sub-manifolds. Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral distributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional assumptions and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra estimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three distinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a manifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution internal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes orthogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of the data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an elegant explanation on why generative diffusion models are not affected by the manifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the internal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time points during generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Deng, Kevin Bello, Pradeep Ravikumar, Bryon Aragam</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing approaches to differentiable structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rely on strong identifiability assumptions in order to guarantee that global minimizers of the acyclicity-constrained optimization problem identifies the true DAG. Moreover, it has been observed empirically that the optimizer may exploit undesirable artifacts in the loss function. We explain and remedy these issues by studying the behavior of differentiable acyclicity-constrained programs under general likelihoods with multiple global minimizers. By carefully regularizing the likelihood, it is possible to identify the sparsest model in the Markov equivalence class, even in the absence of an identifiable parametrization. We first study the Gaussian case in detail, showing how proper regularization of the likelihood defines a score that identifies the sparsest model. Assuming faithfulness, it also recovers the Markov equivalence class. These results are then generalized to general models and likelihoods, where the same claims hold. These theoretical results are validated empirically, showing how this can be done using standard gradient-based optimizers, thus paving the way for differentiable structure learning under general models and losses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humanitarian organizations can enhance their effectiveness by analyzing data to discover trends, gather aggregated insights, manage their security risks, support decision-making, and inform advocacy and funding proposals. However, data about violent incidents with direct impact and relevance for humanitarian aid operations is not readily available. An automatic data collection and NLP-backed classification framework aligned with humanitarian perspectives can help bridge this gap. In this paper, we present HumVI - a dataset comprising news articles in three languages (English, French, Arabic) containing instances of different types of violent incidents categorized by the humanitarian sector they impact, e.g., aid security, education, food security, health, and protection. Reliable labels were obtained for the dataset by partnering with a data-backed humanitarian organization, Insecurity Insight. We provide multiple benchmarks for the dataset, employing various deep learning architectures and techniques, including data augmentation and mask loss, to address different task-related challenges, e.g., domain expansion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaidong Zhang, Pengzhen Ren, Bingqian Lin, Junfan Lin, Shikui Ma, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language-guided robotic manipulation is a challenging task that requires an embodied agent to follow abstract user instructions to accomplish various complex manipulation tasks. Previous work trivially fitting the data without revealing the relation between instruction and low-level executable actions, these models are prone to memorizing the surficial pattern of the data instead of acquiring the transferable knowledge, and thus are fragile to dynamic environment changes. To address this issue, we propose a PrIrmitive-driVen waypOinT-aware world model for Robotic manipulation (PIVOT-R) that focuses solely on the prediction of task-relevant waypoints. Specifically, PIVOT-R consists of a Waypoint-aware World Model (WAWM) and a lightweight action prediction module. The former performs primitive action parsing and primitive-driven waypoint prediction, while the latter focuses on decoding low-level actions. Additionally, we also design an asynchronous hierarchical executor (AHE), which can use different execution frequencies for different modules of the model, thereby helping the model reduce computational redundancy and improve model execution efficiency. Our PIVOT-R outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) open-source models on the SeaWave benchmark, achieving an average relative improvement of 19.45% across four levels of instruction tasks. Moreover, compared to the synchronously executed PIVOT-R, the execution efficiency of PIVOT-R with AHE is increased by 28-fold, with only a 2.9% drop in performance. These results provide compelling evidence that our PIVOT-R can significantly improve both the performance and efficiency of robotic manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akrit Mudvari, Yuang Jiang, Leandros Tassiulas</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been a disruptive innovation in recent years, and they play a crucial role in our daily lives due to their ability to understand and generate human-like text. Their capabilities include natural language understanding, information retrieval and search, translation, chatbots, virtual assistance, and many more. However, it is well known that LLMs are massive in terms of the number of parameters. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in the underlying architecture of LLMs, Transformers, has quadratic complexity in terms of both computation and memory with respect to the input sequence length. For these reasons, LLM inference is resource-intensive, and thus, the throughput of LLM inference is limited, especially for the longer sequences. In this report, we design a collaborative inference architecture between a server and its clients to alleviate the throughput limit. In this design, we consider the available resources on both sides, i.e., the computation and communication costs. We develop a dynamic programming-based algorithm to optimally allocate computation between the server and the client device to increase the server throughput, while not violating the service level agreement (SLA). We show in the experiments that we are able to efficiently distribute the workload allowing for roughly 1/3 reduction in the server workload, while achieving 19 percent improvement over a greedy method. As a result, we are able to demonstrate that, in an environment with different types of LLM inference requests, the throughput of the server is improved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyue Li, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel on generation tasks, their decoder-only architecture often limits their potential as embedding models if no further representation finetuning is applied. Does this contradict their claim of generalists? To answer the question, we take a closer look at Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Our study shows that the expert routers in MoE LLMs can serve as an off-the-shelf embedding model with promising performance on a diverse class of embedding-focused tasks, without requiring any finetuning. Moreover, our extensive analysis shows that the MoE routing weights (RW) is complementary to the hidden state (HS) of LLMs, a widely-used embedding. Compared to HS, we find that RW is more robust to the choice of prompts and focuses on high-level semantics. Motivated by the analysis, we propose MoEE combining RW and HS, which achieves better performance than using either separately. Our exploration of their combination and prompting strategy shed several novel insights, e.g., a weighted sum of RW and HS similarities outperforms the similarity on their concatenation. Our experiments are conducted on 6 embedding tasks with 20 datasets from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). The results demonstrate the significant improvement brought by MoEE to LLM-based embedding without further finetuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Efimia Panagiotaki, Daniele De Martini, Lars Kunze, Petar Veli\v{c}kovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the intersection of neural networks and classical robotics algorithms through the Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) framework, allowing to train neural networks to effectively reason like classical robotics algorithms by learning to execute them. Algorithms are integral to robotics and safety-critical applications due to their predictable and consistent performance through logical and mathematical principles. In contrast, while neural networks are highly adaptable, handling complex, high-dimensional data and generalising across tasks, they often lack interpretability and transparency in their internal computations. We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based learning framework, NAR-*ICP, which learns the intermediate algorithmic steps of classical ICP-based pointcloud registration algorithms, and extend the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark with classical robotics perception algorithms. We evaluate our approach across diverse datasets, from real-world to synthetic, demonstrating its flexibility in handling complex and noisy inputs, along with its potential to be used as part of a larger learning system. Our results indicate that our method achieves superior performance across all benchmarks and datasets, consistently surpassing even the algorithms it has been trained on, further demonstrating its ability to generalise beyond the capabilities of traditional algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiping Lu, Daozhe Lin, Qiang Du</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we establish a novel connection between the metric entropy growth and the embeddability of function spaces into reproducing kernel Hilbert/Banach spaces. Metric entropy characterizes the information complexity of function spaces and has implications for their approximability and learnability. Classical results show that embedding a function space into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) implies a bound on its metric entropy growth. Surprisingly, we prove a \textbf{converse}: a bound on the metric entropy growth of a function space allows its embedding to a $L_p-$type Reproducing Kernel Banach Space (RKBS). This shows that the ${L}_p-$type RKBS provides a broad modeling framework for learnable function classes with controlled metric entropies. Our results shed new light on the power and limitations of kernel methods for learning complex function spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifei Xie, Changqiao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: GPT-4o, an all-encompassing model, represents a milestone in the development of large multi-modal language models. It can understand visual, auditory, and textual modalities, directly output audio, and support flexible duplex interaction. Models from the open-source community often achieve some functionalities of GPT-4o, such as visual understanding and voice chat. Nevertheless, training a unified model that incorporates all modalities is challenging due to the complexities of multi-modal data, intricate model architectures, and training processes. In this paper, we introduce Mini-Omni2, a visual-audio assistant capable of providing real-time, end-to-end voice responses to visoin and audio queries. By integrating pretrained visual and auditory encoders, Mini-Omni2 maintains performance in individual modalities. We propose a three-stage training process to align modalities, allowing the language model to handle multi-modal inputs and outputs after training on a limited dataset. For interaction, we introduce a command-based interruption mechanism, enabling more flexible interaction with users. To the best of our knowledge, Mini-Omni2 is one of the closest reproductions of GPT-4o, which have similar form of functionality, and we hope it can offer valuable insights for subsequent research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Gupta, Rishabh Rengarajan, Viren Bankapur, Vedansh Mannem, Lakshit Ahuja, Surya Vijay, Kevin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining LiDAR and Camera-view data has become a common approach for 3D Object Detection. However, previous approaches combine the two input streams at a point-level, throwing away semantic information derived from camera features. In this paper we propose Cross-View Center Point-Fusion, a state-of-the-art model to perform 3D object detection by combining camera and LiDAR-derived features in the BEV space to preserve semantic density from the camera stream while incorporating spacial data from the LiDAR stream. Our architecture utilizes aspects from previously established algorithms, Cross-View Transformers and CenterPoint, and runs their backbones in parallel, allowing efficient computation for real-time processing and application. In this paper we find that while an implicitly calculated depth-estimate may be sufficiently accurate in a 2D map-view representation, explicitly calculated geometric and spacial information is needed for precise bounding box prediction in the 3D world-view space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedram Akbarian, Huy Nguyen, Xing Han, Nhat Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are highly effective in scaling model capacity while preserving computational efficiency, with the gating network, or router, playing a central role by directing inputs to the appropriate experts. In this paper, we establish a novel connection between MoE frameworks and attention mechanisms, demonstrating how quadratic gating can serve as a more expressive and efficient alternative. Motivated by this insight, we explore the implementation of quadratic gating within MoE models, identifying a connection between the self-attention mechanism and the quadratic gating. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the quadratic softmax gating MoE framework, showing improved sample efficiency in expert and parameter estimation. Our analysis provides key insights into optimal designs for quadratic gating and expert functions, further elucidating the principles behind widely used attention mechanisms. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that the quadratic gating MoE outperforms the traditional linear gating MoE. Moreover, our theoretical insights have guided the development of a novel attention mechanism, which we validated through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate its favorable performance over conventional models across various tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11224">DeltaDock: A Unified Framework for Accurate, Efficient, and Physically Reliable Molecular Docking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxian Yan, Zaixi Zhang, Jintao Zhu, Kai Zhang, Jianfeng Pei, Qi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular docking, a technique for predicting ligand binding poses, is crucial in structure-based drug design for understanding protein-ligand interactions. Recent advancements in docking methods, particularly those leveraging geometric deep learning (GDL), have demonstrated significant efficiency and accuracy advantages over traditional sampling methods. Despite these advancements, current methods are often tailored for specific docking settings, and limitations such as the neglect of protein side-chain structures, difficulties in handling large binding pockets, and challenges in predicting physically valid structures exist. To accommodate various docking settings and achieve accurate, efficient, and physically reliable docking, we propose a novel two-stage docking framework, DeltaDock, consisting of pocket prediction and site-specific docking. We innovatively reframe the pocket prediction task as a pocket-ligand alignment problem rather than direct prediction in the first stage. Then we follow a bi-level coarse-to-fine iterative refinement process to perform site-specific docking. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DeltaDock. Notably, in the blind docking setting, DeltaDock achieves a 31\% relative improvement over the docking success rate compared with the previous state-of-the-art GDL model. With the consideration of physical validity, this improvement increases to about 300\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Liang, Xinyi Li, Jie Ren, Ang Li, Bo Fang, Jieyang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the training of these models is computationally intensive and susceptible to faults, particularly in the attention mechanism, which is a critical component of transformer-based LLMs. In this paper, we investigate the impact of faults on LLM training, focusing on INF, NaN, and near-INF values in the computation results with systematic fault injection experiments. We observe the propagation patterns of these errors, which can trigger non-trainable states in the model and disrupt training, forcing the procedure to load from checkpoints. To mitigate the impact of these faults, we propose ATTNChecker, the first Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) technique tailored for the attention mechanism in LLMs. ATTNChecker is designed based on fault propagation patterns of LLM and incorporates performance optimization to adapt to both system reliability and model vulnerability while providing lightweight protection for fast LLM training. Evaluations on four LLMs show that ATTNChecker on average incurs on average 7% overhead on training while detecting and correcting all extreme errors. Compared with the state-of-the-art checkpoint/restore approach, ATTNChecker reduces recovery overhead by up to 49x.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11769">Can Search-Based Testing with Pareto Optimization Effectively Cover Failure-Revealing Test Inputs?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lev Sorokin, Damir Safin, Shiva Nejati</p>
<p>Abstract: Search-based software testing (SBST) is a widely adopted technique for testing complex systems with large input spaces, such as Deep Learning-enabled (DL-enabled) systems. Many SBST techniques focus on Pareto-based optimization, where multiple objectives are optimized in parallel to reveal failures. However, it is important to ensure that identified failures are spread throughout the entire failure-inducing area of a search domain and not clustered in a sub-region. This ensures that identified failures are semantically diverse and reveal a wide range of underlying causes. In this paper, we present a theoretical argument explaining why testing based on Pareto optimization is inadequate for covering failure-inducing areas within a search domain. We support our argument with empirical results obtained by applying two widely used types of Pareto-based optimization techniques, namely NSGA-II (an evolutionary algorithm) and OMOPSO (a swarm-based Pareto-optimization algorithm), to two DL-enabled systems: an industrial Automated Valet Parking (AVP) system and a system for classifying handwritten digits. We measure the coverage of failure-revealing test inputs in the input space using a metric that we refer to as the Coverage Inverted Distance quality indicator. Our results show that NSGA-II-based search and OMOPSO are not more effective than a na\"ive random search baseline in covering test inputs that reveal failures. The replication package for this study is available in a GitHub repository.</p>
