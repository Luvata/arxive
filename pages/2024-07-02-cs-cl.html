<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahad Al-Khalifa, Hend Al-Khalifa</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the growing importance of Arabic as a global language, there is a notable lack of language models pre-trained exclusively on Arabic data. This shortage has led to limited benchmarks available for assessing language model performance in Arabic. To address this gap, we introduce two novel benchmarks designed to evaluate models' mathematical reasoning and language understanding abilities in Arabic. These benchmarks are derived from a General Aptitude Test (GAT) called Qiyas exam, a standardized test widely used for university admissions in Saudi Arabia. For validation purposes, we assess the performance of ChatGPT-3.5-trubo and ChatGPT-4 on our benchmarks. Our findings reveal that these benchmarks pose a significant challenge, with ChatGPT-4 achieving an overall average accuracy of 64%, while ChatGPT-3.5-trubo achieved an overall accuracy of 49% across the various question types in the Qiyas benchmark. We believe the release of these benchmarks will pave the way for enhancing the mathematical reasoning and language understanding capabilities of future models tailored for the low-resource Arabic language.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the United States has witnessed a significant surge in the popularity of vaping or e-cigarette use, leading to a notable rise in cases of e-cigarette and vaping use-associated lung injury (EVALI) that caused hospitalizations and fatalities during the EVALI outbreak in 2019, highlighting the urgency to comprehend vaping behaviors and develop effective strategies for cessation. Due to the ubiquity of social media platforms, over 4.7 billion users worldwide use them for connectivity, communications, news, and entertainment with a significant portion of the discourse related to health, thereby establishing social media data as an invaluable organic data resource for public health research. In this study, we extracted a sample dataset from one vaping sub-community on Reddit to analyze users' quit-vaping intentions. Leveraging OpenAI's latest large language model GPT-4 for sentence-level quit vaping intention detection, this study compares the outcomes of this model against layman and clinical expert annotations. Using different prompting strategies such as zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, we developed 8 prompts with varying levels of detail to explain the task to GPT-4 and also evaluated the performance of the strategies against each other. These preliminary findings emphasize the potential of GPT-4 in social media data analysis, especially in identifying users' subtle intentions that may elude human detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Wu, Xiaoxian Shen, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional keyphrase prediction methods predict a single set of keyphrases per document, failing to cater to the diverse needs of users and downstream applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce on-demand keyphrase generation, a novel paradigm that requires keyphrases that conform to specific high-level goals or intents. For this task, we present MetaKP, a large-scale benchmark comprising four datasets, 7500 documents, and 3760 goals across news and biomedical domains with human-annotated keyphrases. Leveraging MetaKP, we design both supervised and unsupervised methods, including a multi-task fine-tuning approach and a self-consistency prompting method with large language models. The results highlight the challenges of supervised fine-tuning, whose performance is not robust to distribution shifts. By contrast, the proposed self-consistency prompting approach greatly improves the performance of large language models, enabling GPT-4o to achieve 0.548 SemF1, surpassing the performance of a fully fine-tuned BART-base model. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our method to serve as a general NLP infrastructure, exemplified by its application in epidemic event detection from social media.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chantal Shaib, Yanai Elazar, Junyi Jessy Li, Byron C. Wallace</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work on evaluating the diversity of text generated by LLMs has focused on word-level features. Here we offer an analysis of syntactic features to characterize general repetition in models, beyond frequent n-grams. Specifically, we define syntactic templates and show that models tend to produce templated text in downstream tasks at a higher rate than what is found in human-reference texts. We find that most (76%) templates in model-generated text can be found in pre-training data (compared to only 35% of human-authored text), and are not overwritten during fine-tuning processes such as RLHF. This connection to the pre-training data allows us to analyze syntactic templates in models where we do not have the pre-training data. We also find that templates as features are able to differentiate between models, tasks, and domains, and are useful for qualitatively evaluating common model constructions. Finally, we demonstrate the use of templates as a useful tool for analyzing style memorization of training data in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsen Fayyaz, Fan Yin, Jiao Sun, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: We study how well large language models (LLMs) explain their generations with rationales -- a set of tokens extracted from the input texts that reflect the decision process of LLMs. We examine LLM rationales extracted with two methods: 1) attribution-based methods that use attention or gradients to locate important tokens, and 2) prompting-based methods that guide LLMs to extract rationales using prompts. Through extensive experiments, we show that prompting-based rationales align better with human-annotated rationales than attribution-based rationales, and demonstrate reasonable alignment with humans even when model performance is poor. We additionally find that the faithfulness limitations of prompting-based methods, which are identified in previous work, may be linked to their collapsed predictions. By fine-tuning these models on the corresponding datasets, both prompting and attribution methods demonstrate improved faithfulness. Our study sheds light on more rigorous and fair evaluations of LLM rationales, especially for prompting-based ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Matos, Jack Gallifant, Jian Pei, A. Ian Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain vast amounts of complex data, but harmonizing and processing this information remains a challenging and costly task requiring significant clinical expertise. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various healthcare applications, their potential for abstracting medical concepts from EHRs remains largely unexplored. We introduce EHRmonize, a framework leveraging LLMs to abstract medical concepts from EHR data. Our study uses medication data from two real-world EHR databases to evaluate five LLMs on two free-text extraction and six binary classification tasks across various prompting strategies. GPT-4o's with 10-shot prompting achieved the highest performance in all tasks, accompanied by Claude-3.5-Sonnet in a subset of tasks. GPT-4o achieved an accuracy of 97% in identifying generic route names, 82% for generic drug names, and 100% in performing binary classification of antibiotics. While EHRmonize significantly enhances efficiency, reducing annotation time by an estimated 60%, we emphasize that clinician oversight remains essential. Our framework, available as a Python package, offers a promising tool to assist clinicians in EHR data abstraction, potentially accelerating healthcare research and improving data harmonization processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhao Li, Marek Rei, Lucia Specia</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained language models have significantly advanced performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, adversarial attacks continue to pose a critical challenge to system built using these models, as they can be exploited with carefully crafted adversarial texts. Inspired by the ability of diffusion models to predict and reduce noise in computer vision, we propose a novel and flexible adversarial defense method for language classification tasks, DiffuseDef, which incorporates a diffusion layer as a denoiser between the encoder and the classifier. During inference, the adversarial hidden state is first combined with sampled noise, then denoised iteratively and finally ensembled to produce a robust text representation. By integrating adversarial training, denoising, and ensembling techniques, we show that DiffuseDef improves over different existing adversarial defense methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance against common adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehar Bhatia, Sahithya Ravi, Aditya Chinchure, Eunjeong Hwang, Vered Shwartz</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in vision-language models, their performance remains suboptimal on images from non-western cultures due to underrepresentation in training datasets. Various benchmarks have been proposed to test models' cultural inclusivity, but they have limited coverage of cultures and do not adequately assess cultural diversity across universal as well as culture-specific local concepts. To address these limitations, we introduce the GlobalRG benchmark, comprising two challenging tasks: retrieval across universals and cultural visual grounding. The former task entails retrieving culturally diverse images for universal concepts from 50 countries, while the latter aims at grounding culture-specific concepts within images from 15 countries. Our evaluation across a wide range of models reveals that the performance varies significantly across cultures -- underscoring the necessity for enhancing multicultural understanding in vision-language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ante Wang, Linfeng Song, Ye Tian, Baolin Peng, Dian Yu, Haitao Mi, Jinsong Su, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research suggests that tree search algorithms (e.g. Monte Carlo Tree Search) can dramatically boost LLM performance on complex mathematical reasoning tasks. However, they often require more than 10 times the computational resources of greedy decoding due to wasteful search strategies, making them difficult to be deployed in practical applications. This study introduces a novel guided tree search algorithm with dynamic node selection and node-level exploration budget (maximum number of children) calculation to tackle this issue. By considering the search progress towards the final answer (history) and the guidance from a value network (future) trained without any step-wise annotations, our algorithm iteratively selects the most promising tree node before expanding it within the boundaries of the allocated computational budget. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and TabMWP datasets demonstrate that our approach not only offers competitive performance but also enjoys significantly lower computational costs compared to baseline methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00322">LLM-Generated Natural Language Meets Scaling Laws: New Explorations and Data Augmentation Methods</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhua Wang, Guang Xu, Ming Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: With the ascent of large language models (LLM), natural language processing has witnessed enhancements, such as LLM-based data augmentation. Nonetheless, prior research harbors two primary concerns: firstly, a lack of contemplation regarding whether the natural language generated by LLM (LLMNL) truly aligns with human natural language (HNL), a critical foundational question; secondly, an oversight that augmented data is randomly generated by LLM, implying that not all data may possess equal training value, that could impede the performance of classifiers. To address these challenges, we introduce the scaling laws to intrinsically calculate LLMNL and HNL. Through extensive experiments, we reveal slight deviations (approximately 0.2 Mandelbrot exponent) from Mandelbrot's law in LLMNL, underscore a complexity advantage in HNL, and supplement an interpretive discussion on language style. This establishes a solid foundation for LLM's expansion. Further, we introduce a novel data augmentation method for few-shot text classification, termed ZGPTDA, which leverages fuzzy computing mechanisms driven by the conformity to scaling laws to make decisions about GPT-4 augmented data. Extensive experiments, conducted in real-world scenarios, confirms the effectiveness (improving F1 of Bert and RoBerta by 7-10%) and competitiveness (surpassing recent AugGPT and GENCO methods by about 2% accuracy on DeBerta) of ZGPTDA. In addition, we reveal some interesting insights, e.g., Hilberg's law and Taylor's law can impart more benefits to text classification, etc.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00341">Iterative Data Augmentation with Large Language Models for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyun Li, Qihuang Zhong, Ke Zhu, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is an important sentiment analysis task, which aims to determine the sentiment polarity towards an aspect in a sentence. Due to the expensive and limited labeled data, data augmentation (DA) has become the standard for improving the performance of ABSA. However, current DA methods usually have some shortcomings: 1) poor fluency and coherence, 2) lack of diversity of generated data, and 3) reliance on some existing labeled data, hindering its applications in real-world scenarios. In response to these problems, we propose a systematic Iterative Data augmentation framework, namely IterD, to boost the performance of ABSA. The core of IterD is to leverage the powerful ability of large language models (LLMs) to iteratively generate more fluent and diverse synthetic labeled data, starting from an unsupervised sentence corpus. Extensive experiments on 4 widely-used ABSA benchmarks show that IterD brings consistent and significant performance gains among 5 baseline ABSA models. More encouragingly, the synthetic data generated by IterD can achieve comparable or even better performance against the manually annotated data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kibeom Nam</p>
<p>Abstract: Investigations into Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for Korean restaurant reviews are notably lacking in the existing literature. Our research proposes an intuitive and effective framework for ABSA in low-resource languages such as Korean. It optimizes prediction labels by integrating translated benchmark and unlabeled Korean data. Using a model fine-tuned on translated data, we pseudo-labeled the actual Korean NLI set. Subsequently, we applied LaBSE and MSP-based filtering to this pseudo-NLI set as implicit feature, enhancing Aspect Category Detection and Polarity determination through additional training. Incorporating dual filtering, this model bridged dataset gaps, achieving positive results in Korean ABSA with minimal resources. Through additional data injection pipelines, our approach aims to utilize high-resource data and construct effective models within communities, whether corporate or individual, in low-resource language countries. Compared to English ABSA, our framework showed an approximately 3% difference in F1 scores and accuracy. We release the dataset and our code for Korean ABSA, at this link.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present RICHES, a novel approach that interleaves retrieval with sequence generation tasks. RICHES offers an alternative to conventional RAG systems by eliminating the need for separate retriever and generator. It retrieves documents by directly decoding their contents, constrained on the corpus. Unifying retrieval with generation allows us to adapt to diverse new tasks via prompting alone. RICHES can work with any Instruction-tuned model, without additional training. It provides attributed evidence, supports multi-hop retrievals and interleaves thoughts to plan on what to retrieve next, all within a single decoding pass of the LLM. We demonstrate the strong performance of RICHES across ODQA tasks including attributed and multi-hop QA.</p>

Among these technologies, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential to transform financial services by automating complex tasks, enhancing customer service, and providing detailed financial analysis. Firstly, we introduce IDEA-FinBench, an evaluation benchmark specifically tailored for assessing financial knowledge in large language models (LLMs). This benchmark utilizes questions from two globally respected and authoritative financial professional exams, aimimg to comprehensively evaluate the capability of LLMs to directly address exam questions pertinent to the finance sector. Secondly, we propose IDEA-FinKER, a Financial Knowledge Enhancement framework designed to facilitate the rapid adaptation of general LLMs to the financial domain, introducing a retrieval-based few-shot learning method for real-time context-level knowledge injection, and a set of high-quality financial knowledge instructions for fine-tuning any general LLM. Finally, we present IDEA-FinQA, a financial question-answering system powered by LLMs. This system is structured around a scheme of real-time knowledge injection and factual enhancement using external knowledge. IDEA-FinQA is comprised of three main modules: the data collector, the data querying module, and LLM-based agents tasked with specific functions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given the growing influx of misinformation across news and social media, there is a critical need for systems that can provide effective real-time verification of news claims. Large language or multimodal model based verification has been proposed to scale up online policing mechanisms for mitigating spread of false and harmful content. While these can potentially reduce burden on human fact-checkers, such efforts may be hampered by foundation model training data becoming outdated. In this work, we test the limits of improving foundation model performance without continual updating through an initial study of knowledge transfer using either existing intra- and inter- domain benchmarks or explanations generated from large language models (LLMs). We evaluate on 12 public benchmarks for fact-checking and misinformation detection as well as two other tasks relevant to content moderation -- toxicity and stance detection. Our results on two recent multi-modal fact-checking benchmarks, Mocheg and Fakeddit, indicate that knowledge transfer strategies can improve Fakeddit performance over the state-of-the-art by up to 1.7% and Mocheg performance by up to 2.9%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Wan, Di Wu, Haoran Wang, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-based "diversity interventions" are commonly adopted to improve the diversity of Text-to-Image (T2I) models depicting individuals with various racial or gender traits. However, will this strategy result in nonfactual demographic distribution, especially when generating real historical figures? In this work, we propose DemOgraphic FActualIty Representation (DoFaiR), a benchmark to systematically quantify the trade-off between using diversity interventions and preserving demographic factuality in T2I models. DoFaiR consists of 756 meticulously fact-checked test instances to reveal the factuality tax of various diversity prompts through an automated evidence-supported evaluation pipeline. Experiments on DoFaiR unveil that diversity-oriented instructions increase the number of different gender and racial groups in DALLE-3's generations at the cost of historically inaccurate demographic distributions. To resolve this issue, we propose Fact-Augmented Intervention (FAI), which instructs a Large Language Model (LLM) to reflect on verbalized or retrieved factual information about gender and racial compositions of generation subjects in history, and incorporate it into the generation context of T2I models. By orienting model generations using the reflected historical truths, FAI significantly improves the demographic factuality under diversity interventions while preserving diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingqian He, Yongliang Shen, Wenqi Zhang, Zeqi Tan, Weiming Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in handling complex reasoning tasks by generating step-by-step rationales.Some methods have proven effective in boosting accuracy by introducing extra verifiers to assess these paths. However, existing verifiers, typically trained on binary-labeled reasoning paths, fail to fully utilize the relative merits of intermediate steps, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the feedback provided. To overcome this limitation, we propose Tree-based Preference Learning Verifier (Tree-PLV), a novel approach that constructs reasoning trees via a best-first search algorithm and collects step-level paired data for preference training. Compared to traditional binary classification, step-level preferences more finely capture the nuances between reasoning steps, allowing for a more precise evaluation of the complete reasoning path. We empirically evaluate Tree-PLV across a range of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing benchmarks. For instance, Tree-PLV achieved substantial performance gains over the Mistral-7B self-consistency baseline on GSM8K (67.55% to 82.79%), MATH (17.00% to 26.80%), CSQA (68.14% to 72.97%), and StrategyQA (82.86% to 83.25%).Additionally, our study explores the appropriate granularity for applying preference learning, revealing that step-level guidance provides feedback that better aligns with the evaluation of the reasoning process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Representation of systems using the SAPPhIRE model of causality can be an inspirational stimulus in design. However, creating a SAPPhIRE model of a technical or a natural system requires sourcing technical knowledge from multiple technical documents regarding how the system works. This research investigates how to generate technical content accurately relevant to the SAPPhIRE model of causality using a Large Language Model, also called LLM. This paper, which is the first part of the two-part research, presents a method for hallucination suppression using Retrieval Augmented Generating with LLM to generate technical content supported by the scientific information relevant to a SAPPhIRE con-struct. The result from this research shows that the selection of reference knowledge used in providing context to the LLM for generating the technical content is very important. The outcome of this research is used to build a software support tool to generate the SAPPhIRE model of a given technical system.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00402">Is It Really Long Context if All You Need Is Retrieval? Towards Genuinely Difficult Long Context NLP</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Goldman, Alon Jacovi, Aviv Slobodkin, Aviya Maimon, Ido Dagan, Reut Tsarfaty</p>
<p>Abstract: Improvements in language models' capabilities have pushed their applications towards longer contexts, making long-context evaluation and development an active research area. However, many disparate use-cases are grouped together under the umbrella term of "long-context", defined simply by the total length of the model's input, including - for example - Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks, book summarization, and information aggregation. Given their varied difficulty, in this position paper we argue that conflating different tasks by their context length is unproductive. As a community, we require a more precise vocabulary to understand what makes long-context tasks similar or different. We propose to unpack the taxonomy of long-context based on the properties that make them more difficult with longer contexts. We propose two orthogonal axes of difficulty: (I) Diffusion: How hard is it to find the necessary information in the context? (II) Scope: How much necessary information is there to find? We survey the literature on long-context, provide justification for this taxonomy as an informative descriptor, and situate the literature with respect to it. We conclude that the most difficult and interesting settings, whose necessary information is very long and highly diffused within the input, is severely under-explored. By using a descriptive vocabulary and discussing the relevant properties of difficulty in long-context, we can implement more informed research in this area. We call for a careful design of tasks and benchmarks with distinctly long context, taking into account the characteristics that make it qualitatively different from shorter context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tamzeed Mahfuz, Satak Kumar Dey, Ruwad Naswan, Hasnaen Adil, Khondker Salman Sayeed, Haz Sameen Shahgir</p>
<p>Abstract: Each new generation of English-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibits enhanced cross-lingual transfer capabilities and significantly outperforms older LLMs on low-resource languages. This prompts the question: Is there a need for LLMs dedicated to a particular low-resource language? We aim to explore this question for Bengali, a low-to-moderate resource Indo-Aryan language native to the Bengal region of South Asia.
  We compare the performance of open-weight and closed-source LLMs such as LLaMA-3 and GPT-4 against fine-tuned encoder-decoder models across a diverse set of Bengali downstream tasks, including translation, summarization, paraphrasing, question-answering, and natural language inference. Our findings reveal that while LLMs generally excel in reasoning tasks, their performance in tasks requiring Bengali script generation is inconsistent. Key challenges include inefficient tokenization of Bengali script by existing LLMs, leading to increased computational costs and potential performance degradation. Additionally, we highlight biases in machine-translated datasets commonly used for Bengali NLP tasks. We conclude that there is a significant need for a Bengali-oriented LLM, but the field currently lacks the high-quality pretraining and instruction-tuning datasets necessary to develop a highly effective model.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces the eFontes models for automatic linguistic annotation of Medieval Latin texts, focusing on lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and morphological feature determination. Using the Transformers library, these models were trained on Universal Dependencies (UD) corpora and the newly developed eFontes corpus of Polish Medieval Latin. The research evaluates the models' performance, addressing challenges such as orthographic variations and the integration of Latinized vernacular terms. The models achieved high accuracy rates: lemmatization at 92.60%, part-of-speech tagging at 83.29%, and morphological feature determination at 88.57%. The findings underscore the importance of high-quality annotated corpora and propose future enhancements, including extending the models to Named Entity Recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaditya K. Singh, Yu Yang, Kushal Tirumala, Mostafa Elhoushi, Ari S. Morcos</p>
<p>Abstract: Data curation is commonly considered a "secret-sauce" for LLM training, with higher quality data usually leading to better LLM performance. Given the scale of internet-scraped corpora, data pruning has become a larger and larger focus. Specifically, many have shown that de-duplicating data, or sub-selecting higher quality data, can lead to efficiency or performance improvements. Generally, three types of methods are used to filter internet-scale corpora: embedding-based, heuristic-based, and classifier-based. In this work, we contrast the former two in the domain of finetuning LLMs for code generation. We find that embedding-based methods are often confounded by length, and that a simple heuristic--pruning long files--outperforms other methods in compute-limited regimes. Our method can yield up to a 2x efficiency benefit in training (while matching performance) or a 3.5% absolute performance improvement on HumanEval (while matching compute). However, we find that perplexity on held-out long files can increase, begging the question of whether optimizing data mixtures for common coding benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP) actually best serves downstream use cases. Overall, we hope our work builds useful intuitions about code data (specifically, the low quality of extremely long code files) provides a compelling heuristic-based method for data pruning, and brings to light questions in how we evaluate code generation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiqin Lin, Andr\'e F. T. Martins, Hinrich Sch\"utze</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of exploiting parallel corpora to enhance multilingual large language models, improving performance in both bilingual tasks, e.g., machine translation, and general-purpose tasks, e.g., text classification. Building upon these findings, our comprehensive study aims to identify the most effective strategies for leveraging parallel corpora. We investigate the impact of parallel corpora quality and quantity, training objectives, and model size on the performance of multilingual large language models enhanced with parallel corpora across diverse languages and tasks. Our analysis reveals several key insights: (i) filtering noisy translations is essential for effectively exploiting parallel corpora, while language identification and short sentence filtering have little effect; (ii) even a corpus containing just 10K parallel sentences can yield results comparable to those obtained from much larger datasets; (iii) employing only the machine translation objective yields the best results among various training objectives and their combinations; (iv) larger multilingual language models benefit more from parallel corpora than smaller models due to their stronger capacity for cross-task transfer. Our study offers valuable insights into the optimal utilization of parallel corpora to enhance multilingual large language models, extending the generalizability of previous findings from limited languages and tasks to a broader range of scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourish Dasgupta, Ankush Chander, Parth Borad, Isha Motiyani, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized summarization models cater to individuals' subjective understanding of saliency, as represented by their reading history and current topics of attention. Existing personalized text summarizers are primarily evaluated based on accuracy measures such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR. However, a recent study argued that accuracy measures are inadequate for evaluating the degree of personalization of these models and proposed EGISES, the first metric to evaluate personalized text summaries. It was suggested that accuracy is a separate aspect and should be evaluated standalone. In this paper, we challenge the necessity of an accuracy leaderboard, suggesting that relying on accuracy-based aggregated results might lead to misleading conclusions. To support this, we delve deeper into EGISES, demonstrating both theoretically and empirically that it measures the degree of responsiveness, a necessary but not sufficient condition for degree-of-personalization. We subsequently propose PerSEval, a novel measure that satisfies the required sufficiency condition. Based on the benchmarking of ten SOTA summarization models on the PENS dataset, we empirically establish that -- (i) PerSEval is reliable w.r.t human-judgment correlation (Pearson's r = 0.73; Spearman's $\rho$ = 0.62; Kendall's $\tau$ = 0.42), (ii) PerSEval has high rank-stability, (iii) PerSEval as a rank-measure is not entailed by EGISES-based ranking, and (iv) PerSEval can be a standalone rank-measure without the need of any aggregated ranking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer is a promising technique for utilizing data in a source language to improve performance in a target language. However, current techniques often require an external translation system or suffer from suboptimal performance due to over-reliance on cross-lingual generalization of multi-lingual pretrained language models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective method called Self-Translate-Train. It leverages the translation capability of a large language model to generate synthetic training data in the target language and fine-tunes the model with its own generated data. We evaluate the proposed method on a wide range of tasks and show substantial performance gains across several non-English languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates whether division on political topics is mapped with the distinctive patterns of language use. We collect a total 145,832 Reddit comments on the abortion debate and explore the languages of subreddit communities r/prolife and r/prochoice. With consideration of the Moral Foundations Theory, we examine lexical patterns in three ways. First, we compute proportional frequencies of lexical items from the Moral Foundations Dictionary in order to make inferences about each group's moral considerations when forming arguments for and against abortion. We then create n-gram models to reveal frequent collocations from each stance group and better understand how commonly used words are patterned in their linguistic context and in relation to morality values. Finally, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify underlying topical structures in the corpus data. Results show that the use of morality words is mapped with the stances on abortion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinna Lin, Siqi Ma, Junjie Shan, Xiaojing Zhang, Shell Xu Hu, Tiannan Guo, Stan Z. Li, Kaicheng Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pursuing artificial intelligence for biomedical science, a.k.a. AI Scientist, draws increasing attention, where one common approach is to build a copilot agent driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, to evaluate such systems, people either rely on direct Question-Answering (QA) to the LLM itself, or in a biomedical experimental manner. How to precisely benchmark biomedical agents from an AI Scientist perspective remains largely unexplored. To this end, we draw inspiration from one most important abilities of scientists, understanding the literature, and introduce BioKGBench. In contrast to traditional evaluation benchmark that only focuses on factual QA, where the LLMs are known to have hallucination issues, we first disentangle "Understanding Literature" into two atomic abilities, i) "Understanding" the unstructured text from research papers by performing scientific claim verification, and ii) Ability to interact with structured Knowledge-Graph Question-Answering (KGQA) as a form of "Literature" grounding. We then formulate a novel agent task, dubbed KGCheck, using KGQA and domain-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to identify the factual errors of existing large-scale knowledge graph databases. We collect over two thousand data for two atomic tasks and 225 high-quality annotated data for the agent task. Surprisingly, we discover that state-of-the-art agents, both daily scenarios and biomedical ones, have either failed or inferior performance on our benchmark. We then introduce a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed BKGAgent. On the widely used popular knowledge graph, we discover over 90 factual errors which provide scenarios for agents to make discoveries and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitry Nikolaev, Jorke Grotenhuis, Haleli Harel, Orly Goldwasser</p>
<p>Abstract: The complex Ancient Egyptian (AE) writing system was characterised by widespread use of graphemic classifiers (determinatives): silent (unpronounced) hieroglyphic signs clarifying the meaning or indicating the pronunciation of the host word. The study of classifiers has intensified in recent years with the launch and quick growth of the iClassifier project, a web-based platform for annotation and analysis of classifiers in ancient and modern languages. Thanks to the data contributed by the project participants, it is now possible to formulate the identification of classifiers in AE texts as an NLP task. In this paper, we make first steps towards solving this task by implementing a series of sequence-labelling neural models, which achieve promising performance despite the modest amount of training data. We discuss tokenisation and operationalisation issues arising from tackling AE texts and contrast our approach with frequency-based baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Mongaillard, Samson Lasaulce, Othman Hicheur, Chao Zhang, Lina Bariah, Vineeth S. Varma, Hang Zou, Qiyang Zhao, Merouane Debbah</p>
<p>Abstract: While traditional optimization and scheduling schemes are designed to meet fixed, predefined system requirements, future systems are moving toward user-driven approaches and personalized services, aiming to achieve high quality-of-experience (QoE) and flexibility. This challenge is particularly pronounced in wireless and digitalized energy networks, where users' requirements have largely not been taken into consideration due to the lack of a common language between users and machines. The emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) marks a radical departure from traditional system-centric methods into more advanced user-centric approaches by providing a natural communication interface between users and devices. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a novel architecture for resource scheduling problems by constructing three LLM agents to convert an arbitrary user's voice request (VRQ) into a resource allocation vector. Specifically, we design an LLM intent recognition agent to translate the request into an optimization problem (OP), an LLM OP parameter identification agent, and an LLM OP solving agent. To evaluate system performance, we construct a database of typical VRQs in the context of electric vehicle (EV) charging. As a proof of concept, we primarily use Llama 3 8B. Through testing with different prompt engineering scenarios, the obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed architecture. The conducted performance analysis allows key insights to be extracted. For instance, having a larger set of candidate OPs to model the real-world problem might degrade the final performance because of a higher recognition/OP classification noise level. All results and codes are open source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqing Ellen Tan, Prangthip Hansanti, Carleigh Wood, Bokai Yu, Christophe Ropers, Marta R. Costa-juss\`a</p>
<p>Abstract: In the current landscape of automatic language generation, there is a need to understand, evaluate, and mitigate demographic biases as existing models are becoming increasingly multilingual. To address this, we present the initial eight languages from the MASSIVE MULTILINGUAL HOLISTICBIAS (MMHB) dataset and benchmark consisting of approximately 6 million sentences representing 13 demographic axes. We propose an automatic construction methodology to further scale up MMHB sentences in terms of both language coverage and size, leveraging limited human annotation. Our approach utilizes placeholders in multilingual sentence construction and employs a systematic method to independently translate sentence patterns, nouns, and descriptors. Combined with human translation, this technique carefully designs placeholders to dynamically generate multiple sentence variations and significantly reduces the human translation workload. The translation process has been meticulously conducted to avoid an English-centric perspective and include all necessary morphological variations for languages that require them, improving from the original English HOLISTICBIAS. Finally, we utilize MMHB to report results on gender bias and added toxicity in machine translation tasks. On the gender analysis, MMHB unveils: (1) a lack of gender robustness showing almost +4 chrf points in average for masculine semantic sentences compared to feminine ones and (2) a preference to overgeneralize to masculine forms by reporting more than +12 chrf points in average when evaluating with masculine compared to feminine references. MMHB triggers added toxicity up to 2.3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingdong Li, Zixiang Di, Yanting Yang, Hong Qian, Peng Yang, Hao Hao, Ke Tang, Aimin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for large language model merging via black-box multi-objective optimization algorithms. The goal of model merging is to combine multiple models, each excelling in different tasks, into a single model that outperforms any of the individual source models. However, model merging faces two significant challenges: First, existing methods rely heavily on human intuition and customized strategies. Second, parameter conflicts often arise during merging, and while methods like DARE [1] can alleviate this issue, they tend to stochastically drop parameters, risking the loss of important delta parameters. To address these challenges, we propose the MM-MO method, which automates the search for optimal merging configurations using multi-objective optimization algorithms, eliminating the need for human intuition. During the configuration searching process, we use estimated performance across multiple diverse tasks as optimization objectives in order to alleviate the parameter conflicting between different source models without losing crucial delta parameters. We conducted comparative experiments with other mainstream model merging methods, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms them. Moreover, our experiments reveal that even task types not explicitly targeted as optimization objectives show performance improvements, indicating that our method enhances the overall potential of the model rather than merely overfitting to specific task types. This approach provides a significant advancement in model merging techniques, offering a robust and plug-and-play solution for integrating diverse models into a unified, high-performing model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunquan Deng, Zeyu Huang, Chen Li, Chenghua Lin, Min Gao, Wenge Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in fluency but risk producing inaccurate content, called "hallucinations." This paper outlines a standardized process for categorizing fine-grained hallucination types and proposes an innovative framework--the Progressive Fine-grained Model Editor (PFME)--specifically designed to detect and correct fine-grained hallucinations in LLMs. PFME consists of two collaborative modules: the Real-time Fact Retrieval Module and the Fine-grained Hallucination Detection and Editing Module. The former identifies key entities in the document and retrieves the latest factual evidence from credible sources. The latter further segments the document into sentence-level text and, based on relevant evidence and previously edited context, identifies, locates, and edits each sentence's hallucination type. Experimental results on FavaBench and FActScore demonstrate that PFME outperforms existing methods in fine-grained hallucination detection tasks. Particularly, when using the Llama3-8B-Instruct model, PFME's performance in fine-grained hallucination detection with external knowledge assistance improves by 8.7 percentage points (pp) compared to ChatGPT. In editing tasks, PFME further enhances the FActScore of FActScore-Alpaca13B and FActScore-ChatGPT datasets, increasing by 16.2pp and 4.6pp, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the innovative "LLMs-as-Instructors" framework, which leverages the advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously enhance the training of smaller target models. Inspired by the theory of "Learning from Errors", this framework employs an instructor LLM to meticulously analyze the specific errors within a target model, facilitating targeted and efficient training cycles. Within this framework, we implement two strategies: "Learning from Error," which focuses solely on incorrect responses to tailor training data, and "Learning from Error by Contrast", which uses contrastive learning to analyze both correct and incorrect responses for a deeper understanding of errors.
  Our empirical studies, conducted with several open-source models, demonstrate significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning, coding abilities, and factual knowledge. Notably, the refined Llama-3-8b-Instruction has outperformed ChatGPT, illustrating the effectiveness of our approach. By leveraging the strengths of both strategies, we have attained a more balanced performance improvement on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in natural language generation (NLG) tasks remains an open challenge, exacerbated by the intricate nature of the recent large language models (LLMs). This study investigates adapting conformal prediction (CP), which can convert any heuristic measure of uncertainty into rigorous theoretical guarantees by constructing prediction sets, for black-box LLMs in open-ended NLG tasks. We propose a sampling-based uncertainty measure leveraging self-consistency and develop a conformal uncertainty criterion by integrating the uncertainty condition aligned with correctness into the design of the CP algorithm. Experimental results indicate that our uncertainty measure generally surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we calibrate the prediction sets within the model's unfixed answer distribution and achieve strict control over the correctness coverage rate across 6 LLMs on 4 free-form NLG datasets, spanning general-purpose and medical domains, while the small average set size further highlights the efficiency of our method in providing trustworthy guarantees for practical open-ended NLG applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evidence to guide healthcare decisions is often limited by a lack of relevant and trustworthy literature as well as difficulty in contextualizing existing research for a specific patient. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially address both challenges by either summarizing published literature or generating new studies based on real-world data (RWD). We evaluated the ability of five LLM-based systems in answering 50 clinical questions and had nine independent physicians review the responses for relevance, reliability, and actionability. As it stands, general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Pro 1.5) rarely produced answers that were deemed relevant and evidence-based (2% - 10%). In contrast, retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-based and agentic LLM systems produced relevant and evidence-based answers for 24% (OpenEvidence) to 58% (ChatRWD) of questions. Only the agentic ChatRWD was able to answer novel questions compared to other LLMs (65% vs. 0-9%). These results suggest that while general-purpose LLMs should not be used as-is, a purpose-built system for evidence summarization based on RAG and one for generating novel evidence working synergistically would improve availability of pertinent evidence for patient care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Al Nahian Bin Emran, Amrita Ganguly, Sadiya Sayara Chowdhury Puspo, Nishat Raihan, Dhiman Goswami</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present MasonTigers' participation in SemEval-2024 Task 10, a shared task aimed at identifying emotions and understanding the rationale behind their flips within monolingual English and Hindi-English code-mixed dialogues. This task comprises three distinct subtasks - emotion recognition in conversation for Hindi-English code-mixed dialogues, emotion flip reasoning for Hindi-English code-mixed dialogues, and emotion flip reasoning for English dialogues. Our team, MasonTigers, contributed to each subtask, focusing on developing methods for accurate emotion recognition and reasoning. By leveraging our approaches, we attained impressive F1-scores of 0.78 for the first task and 0.79 for both the second and third tasks. This performance not only underscores the effectiveness of our methods across different aspects of the task but also secured us the top rank in the first and third subtasks, and the 2nd rank in the second subtask. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we provide insights into our system's performance and contributions to each subtask.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Meisenbacher, Maulik Chevli, Juraj Vladika, Florian Matthes</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of text privatization using Differential Privacy has recently taken the form of $\textit{text rewriting}$, in which an input text is obfuscated via the use of generative (large) language models. While these methods have shown promising results in the ability to preserve privacy, these methods rely on autoregressive models which lack a mechanism to contextualize the private rewriting process. In response to this, we propose $\textbf{DP-MLM}$, a new method for differentially private text rewriting based on leveraging masked language models (MLMs) to rewrite text in a semantically similar $\textit{and}$ obfuscated manner. We accomplish this with a simple contextualization technique, whereby we rewrite a text one token at a time. We find that utilizing encoder-only MLMs provides better utility preservation at lower $\varepsilon$ levels, as compared to previous methods relying on larger models with a decoder. In addition, MLMs allow for greater customization of the rewriting mechanism, as opposed to generative approaches. We make the code for $\textbf{DP-MLM}$ public and reusable, found at https://github.com/sjmeis/DPMLM .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Meisenbacher, Maulik Chevli, Florian Matthes</p>
<p>Abstract: Applications of Differential Privacy (DP) in NLP must distinguish between the syntactic level on which a proposed mechanism operates, often taking the form of $\textit{word-level}$ or $\textit{document-level}$ privatization. Recently, several word-level $\textit{Metric}$ Differential Privacy approaches have been proposed, which rely on this generalized DP notion for operating in word embedding spaces. These approaches, however, often fail to produce semantically coherent textual outputs, and their application at the sentence- or document-level is only possible by a basic composition of word perturbations. In this work, we strive to address these challenges by operating $\textit{between}$ the word and sentence levels, namely with $\textit{collocations}$. By perturbing n-grams rather than single words, we devise a method where composed privatized outputs have higher semantic coherence and variable length. This is accomplished by constructing an embedding model based on frequently occurring word groups, in which unigram words co-exist with bi- and trigram collocations. We evaluate our method in utility and privacy tests, which make a clear case for tokenization strategies beyond the word level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farnaz Zeidi, Mehmet Fatih Amasyali, \c{C}i\u{g}dem Erol</p>
<p>Abstract: The introduction of the Transformer neural network, along with techniques like self-supervised pre-training and transfer learning, has paved the way for advanced models like BERT. Despite BERT's impressive performance, opportunities for further enhancement exist. To our knowledge, most efforts are focusing on improving BERT's performance in English and in general domains, with no study specifically addressing the legal Turkish domain. Our study is primarily dedicated to enhancing the BERT model within the legal Turkish domain through modifications in the pre-training phase. In this work, we introduce our innovative modified pre-training approach by combining diverse masking strategies. In the fine-tuning task, we focus on two essential downstream tasks in the legal domain: name entity recognition and multi-label text classification. To evaluate our modified pre-training approach, we fine-tuned all customized models alongside the original BERT models to compare their performance. Our modified approach demonstrated significant improvements in both NER and multi-label text classification tasks compared to the original BERT model. Finally, to showcase the impact of our proposed models, we trained our best models with different corpus sizes and compared them with BERTurk models. The experimental results demonstrate that our innovative approach, despite being pre-trained on a smaller corpus, competes with BERTurk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Zhang, Xintao Wang, Jiaqing Liang, Sirui Xia, Lida Chen, Yanghua Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive proficiency in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which involve increasingly complex reasoning. Knowledge reasoning, a primary type of reasoning, aims at deriving new knowledge from existing one.While it has been widely studied in the context of knowledge graphs (KGs), knowledge reasoning in LLMs remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Knowledge, a comprehensive framework for knowledge reasoning, including methodologies for both dataset construction and model learning. For dataset construction, we create KnowReason via rule mining on KGs. For model learning, we observe rule overfitting induced by naive training. Hence, we enhance CoK with a trial-and-error mechanism that simulates the human process of internal knowledge exploration. We conduct extensive experiments with KnowReason. Our results show the effectiveness of CoK in refining LLMs in not only knowledge reasoning, but also general reasoning benchmarkms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanfang Chen, Ding Chen, Shichao Song, Simin Niu, Hanyu Wang, Zeyun Tang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As people increasingly prioritize their health, the speed and breadth of health information dissemination on the internet have also grown. At the same time, the presence of false health information (health rumors) intermingled with genuine content poses a significant potential threat to public health. However, current research on Chinese health rumors still lacks a large-scale, public, and open-source dataset of health rumor information, as well as effective and reliable rumor detection methods. This paper addresses this gap by constructing a dataset containing 1.12 million health-related rumors (HealthRCN) through web scraping of common health-related questions and a series of data processing steps. HealthRCN is the largest known dataset of Chinese health information rumors to date. Based on this dataset, we propose retrieval-augmented large language models for Chinese health rumor detection and explainability (HRDE). This model leverages retrieved relevant information to accurately determine whether the input health information is a rumor and provides explanatory responses, effectively aiding users in verifying the authenticity of health information. In evaluation experiments, we compared multiple models and found that HRDE outperformed them all, including GPT-4-1106-Preview, in rumor detection accuracy and answer quality. HRDE achieved an average accuracy of 91.04% and an F1 score of 91.58%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pawel Robert Smolinski, Joseph Januszewicz, Jacek Winiarski</p>
<p>Abstract: Technology acceptance models effectively predict how users will adopt new technology products. Traditional surveys, often expensive and cumbersome, are commonly used for this assessment. As an alternative to surveys, we explore the use of large language models for annotating online user-generated content, like digital reviews and comments. Our research involved designing an LLM annotation system that transform reviews into structured data based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model. We conducted two studies to validate the consistency and accuracy of the annotations. Results showed moderate-to-strong consistency of LLM annotation systems, improving further by lowering the model temperature. LLM annotations achieved close agreement with human expert annotations and outperformed the agreement between experts for UTAUT variables. These results suggest that LLMs can be an effective tool for analyzing user sentiment, offering a practical alternative to traditional survey methods and enabling deeper insights into technology design and adoption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuhao Lu, Rui Li, Andrew Wen, Jinlian Wang, Liwei Wang, Hongfang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various sectors, including healthcare where they are employed in diverse applications. Their utility is particularly significant in the context of rare diseases, where data scarcity, complexity, and specificity pose considerable challenges. In the clinical domain, Named Entity Recognition (NER) stands out as an essential task and it plays a crucial role in extracting relevant information from clinical texts. Despite the promise of LLMs, current research mostly concentrates on document-level NER, identifying entities in a more general context across entire documents, without extracting their precise location. Additionally, efforts have been directed towards adapting ChatGPT for token-level NER. However, there is a significant research gap when it comes to employing token-level NER for clinical texts, especially with the use of local open-source LLMs. This study aims to bridge this gap by investigating the effectiveness of both proprietary and local LLMs in token-level clinical NER. Essentially, we delve into the capabilities of these models through a series of experiments involving zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and instruction-fine-tuning. Our exploration reveals the inherent challenges LLMs face in token-level NER, particularly in the context of rare diseases, and suggests possible improvements for their application in healthcare. This research contributes to narrowing a significant gap in healthcare informatics and offers insights that could lead to a more refined application of LLMs in the healthcare sector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hye Ryung Son, Jay-Yoon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent approaches to controlled text generation (CTG) often involve manipulating the weights or logits of base language models (LMs) at decoding time. However, these methods are inapplicable to latest black-box LMs and ineffective at preserving the core semantics of the base LM's original generations. In this work, we propose Locate&Edit(L&E), an efficient and flexible energy-based approach to CTG, which edits text outputs from a base LM using off-the-shelf energy models. Given text outputs from the base LM, L&E first locates spans that are most relevant to constraints (e.g., toxicity) utilizing energy models, and then edits these spans by replacing them with more suitable alternatives. Importantly, our method is compatible with black-box LMs, as it requires only the text outputs. Also, since L&E doesn't mandate specific architecture for its component models, it can work with a diverse combination of available off-the-shelf models. Moreover, L&E preserves the base LM's original generations, by selectively modifying constraint-related aspects of the texts and leaving others unchanged. These targeted edits also ensure that L&E operates efficiently. Our experiments confirm that L&E achieves superior semantic preservation of the base LM generations and speed, while simultaneously obtaining competitive or improved constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, we analyze how the granularity of energy distribution impacts CTG performance and find that fine-grained, regression-based energy models improve constraint satisfaction, compared to conventional binary classifier energy models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating text summarization has been a challenging task in natural language processing (NLP). Automatic metrics which heavily rely on reference summaries are not suitable in many situations, while human evaluation is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel method based on large language models (LLMs) for evaluating text summarization. We also conducts a comparative study on eight automatic metrics, human evaluation, and our proposed LLM-based method. Seven different types of state-of-the-art (SOTA) summarization models were evaluated. We perform extensive experiments and analysis on datasets with patent documents. Our results show that LLMs evaluation aligns closely with human evaluation, while widely-used automatic metrics such as ROUGE-2, BERTScore, and SummaC do not and also lack consistency. Based on the empirical comparison, we propose a LLM-powered framework for automatically evaluating and improving text summarization, which is beneficial and could attract wide attention among the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Arnold, Rene Gr\"obner, Annika Schreiner</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) can be applied to raw text by exploiting the spatial arrangement of words in an embedding space. We investigate the implications of such text privatization on Language Models (LMs) and their tendency towards stereotypical associations. Since previous studies documented that linguistic proficiency correlates with stereotypical bias, one could assume that techniques for text privatization, which are known to degrade language modeling capabilities, would cancel out undesirable biases. By testing BERT models trained on texts containing biased statements primed with varying degrees of privacy, our study reveals that while stereotypical bias generally diminishes when privacy is tightened, text privatization does not uniformly equate to diminishing bias across all social domains. This highlights the need for careful diagnosis of bias in LMs that undergo text privatization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zimu Lu, Aojun Zhou, Ke Wang, Houxing Ren, Weikang Shi, Junting Pan, Mingjie Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has proven effective at improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks such as reasoning and alignment. In this work, we propose Step-Controlled DPO (SCDPO), a method for automatically providing stepwise error supervision by creating negative samples of mathematical reasoning rationales that start making errors at a specified step. By applying these samples in DPO training, SCDPO can better align the model to understand reasoning errors and output accurate reasoning steps. We apply SCDPO to both code-integrated and chain-of-thought solutions, empirically showing that it consistently improves the performance compared to naive DPO on three different SFT models, including one existing SFT model and two models we finetuned. Qualitative analysis of the credit assignment of SCDPO and DPO demonstrates the effectiveness of SCDPO at identifying errors in mathematical solutions. We then apply SCDPO to an InternLM2-20B model, resulting in a 20B model that achieves high scores of 88.5% on GSM8K and 58.1% on MATH, rivaling all other open-source LLMs, showing the great potential of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes NAIST's submission to the simultaneous track of the IWSLT 2024 Evaluation Campaign: English-to-{German, Japanese, Chinese} speech-to-text translation and English-to-Japanese speech-to-speech translation. We develop a multilingual end-to-end speech-to-text translation model combining two pre-trained language models, HuBERT and mBART. We trained this model with two decoding policies, Local Agreement (LA) and AlignAtt. The submitted models employ the LA policy because it outperformed the AlignAtt policy in previous models. Our speech-to-speech translation method is a cascade of the above speech-to-text model and an incremental text-to-speech (TTS) module that incorporates a phoneme estimation model, a parallel acoustic model, and a parallel WaveGAN vocoder. We improved our incremental TTS by applying the Transformer architecture with the AlignAtt policy for the estimation model. The results show that our upgraded TTS module contributed to improving the system performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has helped extend speech technologies to more languages by reducing the need for labeled data. However, models are still far from supporting the world's 7000+ languages. We propose XEUS, a Cross-lingual Encoder for Universal Speech, trained on over 1 million hours of data across 4057 languages, extending the language coverage of SSL models 4-fold. We combine 1 million hours of speech from existing publicly accessible corpora with a newly created corpus of 7400+ hours from 4057 languages, which will be publicly released. To handle the diverse conditions of multilingual speech data, we augment the typical SSL masked prediction approach with a novel dereverberation objective, increasing robustness. We evaluate XEUS on several benchmarks, and show that it consistently outperforms or achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL models across a variety of tasks. XEUS sets a new SOTA on the ML-SUPERB benchmark: it outperforms MMS 1B and w2v-BERT 2.0 v2 by 0.8% and 4.4% respectively, despite having less parameters or pre-training data.

<p>Abstract: We find that language models have difficulties generating fallacious and deceptive reasoning. When asked to generate deceptive outputs, language models tend to leak honest counterparts but believe them to be false. Exploiting this deficiency, we propose a jailbreak attack method that elicits an aligned language model for malicious output. Specifically, we query the model to generate a fallacious yet deceptively real procedure for the harmful behavior. Since a fallacious procedure is generally considered fake and thus harmless by LLMs, it helps bypass the safeguard mechanism. Yet the output is factually harmful since the LLM cannot fabricate fallacious solutions but proposes truthful ones. We evaluate our approach over five safety-aligned large language models, comparing four previous jailbreak methods, and show that our approach achieves competitive performance with more harmful outputs. We believe the findings could be extended beyond model safety, such as self-verification and hallucination.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent works leverage LLMs to roleplay realistic social scenarios, aiding novices in practicing their social skills. However, simulating sensitive interactions, such as in mental health, is challenging. Privacy concerns restrict data access, and collecting expert feedback, although vital, is laborious. To address this, we develop Roleplay-doh, a novel human-LLM collaboration pipeline that elicits qualitative feedback from a domain-expert, which is transformed into a set of principles, or natural language rules, that govern an LLM-prompted roleplay. We apply this pipeline to enable senior mental health supporters to create customized AI patients for simulated practice partners for novice counselors. After uncovering issues in GPT-4 simulations not adhering to expert-defined principles, we also introduce a novel principle-adherence prompting pipeline which shows 30\% improvements in response quality and principle following for the downstream task. Via a user study with 25 counseling experts, we demonstrate that the pipeline makes it easy and effective to create AI patients that more faithfully resemble real patients, as judged by creators and third-party counselors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhao Li, Shangjie Li, Binbin Xie, Deyi Xiong, Baosong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly catered to high-resource languages, leaving a disparity in performance for low-resource languages. Conventional Continual Training (CT) approaches to bridge this gap often undermine a model's original linguistic proficiency when expanding to multilingual contexts. Addressing this issue, we introduce a novel MoE-CT architecture, a paradigm that innovatively separates the base model's learning from the multilingual expansion process. Our design freezes the original LLM parameters, thus safeguarding its performance in high-resource languages, while an appended MoE module, trained on diverse language datasets, augments low-resource language proficiency. Our approach significantly outperforms conventional CT methods, as evidenced by our experiments, which show marked improvements in multilingual benchmarks without sacrificing the model's original language performance. Moreover, our MoE-CT framework demonstrates enhanced resistance to forgetting and superior transfer learning capabilities. By preserving the base model's integrity and focusing on strategic parameter expansion, our methodology advances multilingual language modeling and represents a significant step forward for low-resource language inclusion in LLMs, indicating a fruitful direction for future research in language technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasivan Alex Sivakumar, Nafise Sadat Moosavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Apart from performing arithmetic operations, understanding numbers themselves is still a challenge for existing language models. Simple generalisations, such as solving 100+200 instead of 1+2, can substantially affect model performance (Sivakumar and Moosavi, 2023). Among various techniques, character-level embeddings of numbers have emerged as a promising approach to improve number representation. However, this method has limitations as it leaves the task of aggregating digit representations to the model, which lacks direct supervision for this process. In this paper, we explore the use of mathematical priors to compute aggregated digit embeddings and explicitly incorporate these aggregates into transformer models. This can be achieved either by adding a special token to the input embeddings or by introducing an additional loss function to enhance correct predictions. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating this explicit aggregation, analysing its strengths and shortcomings, and discuss future directions to better benefit from this approach. Our methods, while simple, are compatible with any pretrained model and require only a few lines of code, which we have made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hwanjun Song, Hang Su, Igor Shalyminov, Jason Cai, Saab Mansour</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated evaluation is crucial for streamlining text summarization benchmarking and model development, given the costly and time-consuming nature of human evaluation. Traditional methods like ROUGE do not correlate well with human judgment, while recently proposed LLM-based metrics provide only summary-level assessment using Likert-scale scores. This limits deeper model analysis, e.g., we can only assign one hallucination score at the summary level, while at the sentence level, we can count sentences containing hallucinations. To remedy those limitations, we propose FineSurE, a fine-grained evaluator specifically tailored for the summarization task using large language models (LLMs). It also employs completeness and conciseness criteria, in addition to faithfulness, enabling multi-dimensional assessment. We compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs as backbones for FineSurE. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmarking of FineSurE against SOTA methods including NLI-, QA-, and LLM-based methods, showing improved performance especially on the completeness and conciseness dimensions.

<p>Abstract: A dense passage retrieval system can serve as the initial stages of information retrieval, selecting the most relevant text passages for downstream tasks. In this work we conducted experiments with the goal of finding how much the quality of a multilingual retrieval could be degraded if the query part of a dual encoder is tuned on an English-only dataset (assuming scarcity of cross-lingual samples for the targeted domain or task). Specifically, starting with a high quality multilingual embedding model, we observe that an English-only tuning may not only preserve the original quality of the multilingual retrieval, but even improve it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingheng Ye, Shang Qin, Yinghui Li, Xuxin Cheng, Libo Qin, Hai-Tao Zheng, Peng Xing, Zishan Xu, Guo Cheng, Zhao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing studies explore the explainability of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) in a limited scenario, where they ignore the interaction between corrections and explanations. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces the task of EXplainable GEC (EXGEC), which focuses on the integral role of both correction and explanation tasks. To facilitate the task, we propose EXCGEC, a tailored benchmark for Chinese EXGEC consisting of 8,216 explanation-augmented samples featuring the design of hybrid edit-wise explanations. We benchmark several series of LLMs in multiple settings, covering post-explaining and pre-explaining. To promote the development of the task, we introduce a comprehensive suite of automatic metrics and conduct human evaluation experiments to demonstrate the human consistency of the automatic metrics for free-text explanations. All the codes and data will be released after the review.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingheng Ye, Zishan Xu, Yinghui Li, Xuxin Cheng, Linlin Song, Qingyu Zhou, Hai-Tao Zheng, Ying Shen, Xin Su</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper focuses on improving the interpretability of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) metrics, which receives little attention in previous studies. To bridge the gap, we propose CLEME2.0, a reference-based evaluation strategy that can describe four elementary dimensions of GEC systems, namely hit-correction, error-correction, under-correction, and over-correction. They collectively contribute to revealing the critical characteristics and locating drawbacks of GEC systems. Evaluating systems by Combining these dimensions leads to high human consistency over other reference-based and reference-less metrics. Extensive experiments on 2 human judgement datasets and 6 reference datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. All the codes will be released after the peer review.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wang, Zirui Chen, Haofen Wang, Leong Hou U, Zhao Li, Wenbin Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL) signifies a pivotal advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, enhancing the ability to capture and utilize complex knowledge structures. This synergy leverages the advanced linguistic and contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs to improve the accuracy, adaptability, and efficacy of KRL, thereby expanding its applications and potential. Despite the increasing volume of research focused on embedding LLMs within the domain of knowledge representation, a thorough review that examines the fundamental components and processes of these enhanced models is conspicuously absent. Our survey addresses this by categorizing these models based on three distinct Transformer architectures, and by analyzing experimental data from various KRL downstream tasks to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Finally, we identify and explore potential future research directions in this emerging yet underexplored domain, proposing pathways for continued progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naiming Liu, Shashank Sonkar, Myco Le, Richard Baraniuk</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces MalAlgoQA, a novel dataset designed to evaluate the counterfactual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a pedagogical approach. The dataset comprises mathematics and reading comprehension questions, each accompanied by four answer choices and their corresponding rationales. We focus on the incorrect answer rationales, termed "malgorithms", which highlights flawed reasoning steps leading to incorrect answers and offers valuable insights into erroneous thought processes. We also propose the Malgorithm Identification task, where LLMs are assessed based on their ability to identify corresponding malgorithm given an incorrect answer choice. To evaluate the model performance, we introduce two metrics: Algorithm Identification Accuracy (AIA) for correct answer rationale identification, and Malgorithm Identification Accuracy (MIA) for incorrect answer rationale identification. The task is challenging since state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant drops in MIA as compared to AIA. Moreover, we find that the chain-of-thought prompting technique not only fails to consistently enhance MIA, but can also lead to underperformance compared to simple prompting. These findings hold significant implications for the development of more cognitively-inspired LLMs to improve their counterfactual reasoning abilities, particularly through a pedagogical perspective where understanding and rectifying student misconceptions are crucial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanush Chopra, Michael Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a framework for evaluating strategic deception in large language models (LLMs). In this framework, an LLM acts as a game master in two scenarios: one with random game mechanics and another where it can choose between random or deliberate actions. As an example, we use blackjack because the action space nor strategies involve deception. We benchmark Llama3-70B, GPT-4-Turbo, and Mixtral in blackjack, comparing outcomes against expected distributions in fair play to determine if LLMs develop strategies favoring the "house." Our findings reveal that the LLMs exhibit significant deviations from fair play when given implicit randomness instructions, suggesting a tendency towards strategic manipulation in ambiguous scenarios. However, when presented with an explicit choice, the LLMs largely adhere to fair play, indicating that the framing of instructions plays a crucial role in eliciting or mitigating potentially deceptive behaviors in AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longchao Da, Tiejin Chen, Lu Cheng, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The Large language models (LLMs) have showcased superior capabilities in sophisticated tasks across various domains, stemming from basic question-answer (QA), they are nowadays used as decision assistants or explainers for unfamiliar content. However, they are not always correct due to the data sparsity in specific domain corpus, or the model's hallucination problems. Given this, how much should we trust the responses from LLMs? This paper presents a novel way to evaluate the uncertainty that captures the directional instability, by constructing a directional graph from entailment probabilities, and we innovatively conduct Random Walk Laplacian given the asymmetric property of a constructed directed graph, then the uncertainty is aggregated by the derived eigenvalues from the Laplacian process. We also provide a way to incorporate the existing work's semantics uncertainty with our proposed layer. Besides, this paper identifies the vagueness issues in the raw response set and proposes an augmentation approach to mitigate such a problem, we conducted extensive empirical experiments and demonstrated the superiority of our proposed solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicy Scaria, Silvester John Joseph Kennedy, Deepak Subramani</p>
<p>Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are generally considered to be more compact versions of large language models (LLMs), typically having fewer than 7 billion parameters. This study investigates the ability of small language models to learn, retain, and subsequently eliminate noise that is typically not found on the internet, where most pretraining datasets are sourced. For this, four pre-trained SLMs were utilized: Olmo 1B, Qwen1.5 1.8B, Gemma 2B, and Phi2 2.7B. The models were instruction-tuned without noise and tested for task execution with in-context learning. Afterward, noise patterns were introduced to evaluate the models' learning and unlearning capabilities. We evaluated the models' performance at various training levels. Phi consistently excelled with word-level noise but performed the worst with character-level noise. Despite being the smallest with approximately 1 billion parameters, Olmo performed consistently well on tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversational search systems enable information retrieval via natural language interactions, with the goal of maximizing users' information gain over multiple dialogue turns. The increasing prevalence of conversational interfaces adopting this search paradigm challenges traditional information retrieval approaches, stressing the importance of better understanding the engineering process of developing these systems. We undertook a systematic literature review to investigate the links between theoretical studies and technical implementations of conversational search systems. Our review identifies real-world application scenarios, system architectures, and functional components. We consolidate our results by presenting a layered architecture framework and explaining the core functions of conversational search systems. Furthermore, we reflect on our findings in light of the rapid progress in large language models, discussing their capabilities, limitations, and directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiabao Pan, Yan Zhang, Chen Zhang, Zuozhu Liu, Hongwei Wang, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent capabilities across diverse reasoning tasks via popular Chains-of-Thought (COT) prompting. However, such a simple and fast COT approach often encounters limitations in dealing with complicated problems, while a thorough method, which considers multiple reasoning pathways and verifies each step carefully, results in slower inference. This paper addresses the challenge of enabling LLMs to autonomously select between fast and slow inference methods, thereby optimizing both efficiency and effectiveness. We introduce a dynamic decision-making framework that categorizes tasks into two distinct pathways: 'Fast', designated for tasks where the LLM quickly identifies a high-confidence solution, and 'Slow', allocated for tasks that the LLM perceives as complex and for which it has low confidence in immediate solutions as well as requiring more reasoning paths to verify. Experiments on five popular reasoning benchmarks demonstrated the superiority of the DynaThink over baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite its popularity in sentence-level relation extraction, distantly supervised data is rarely utilized by existing work in document-level relation extraction due to its noisy nature and low information density. Among its current applications, distantly supervised data is mostly used as a whole for pertaining, which is of low time efficiency. To fill in the gap of efficient and robust utilization of distantly supervised training data, we propose Efficient Multi-Supervision for document-level relation extraction, in which we first select a subset of informative documents from the massive dataset by combining distant supervision with expert supervision, then train the model with Multi-Supervision Ranking Loss that integrates the knowledge from multiple sources of supervision to alleviate the effects of noise. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the model performance with higher time efficiency than existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raj Sanjay Shah, Khushi Bhardwaj, Sashank Varma</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies show evidence for emergent cognitive abilities in Large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). The increasing cognitive alignment of these models has made them candidates for cognitive science theories. Prior research into the emergent cognitive abilities of PLMs has largely been path-independent to model training, i.e., has focused on the final model weights and not the intermediate steps. However, building plausible models of human cognition using PLMs would benefit from considering the developmental alignment of their performance during training to the trajectories of children's thinking. Guided by psychometric tests of human intelligence, we choose four sets of tasks to investigate the alignment of ten popular families of PLMs and evaluate their available intermediate and final training steps. These tasks are Numerical ability, Linguistic abilities, Conceptual understanding, and Fluid reasoning. We find a striking regularity: regardless of model size, the developmental trajectories of PLMs consistently exhibit a window of maximal alignment to human cognitive development. Before that window, training appears to endow "blank slate" models with the requisite structure to be poised to rapidly learn from experience. After that window, training appears to serve the engineering goal of reducing loss but not the scientific goal of increasing alignment with human cognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunqi Xu, Tianchi Cai, Jiyan Jiang, Xierui Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevailing issue of factual inconsistency errors in conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) motivates the study of Factual Consistency Evaluation (FCE). Despite the various FCE methods proposed earlier, these methods are evaluated on datasets generated by specific Large Language Models (LLMs). Without a comprehensive benchmark, it remains unexplored how these FCE methods perform on other LLMs with different error distributions or even unseen error types, as these methods may fail to detect the error types generated by other LLMs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose the first comprehensive FCE benchmark \emph{Face4RAG} for RAG independent of the underlying LLM. Our benchmark consists of a synthetic dataset built upon a carefully designed typology for factuality inconsistency error and a real-world dataset constructed from six commonly used LLMs, enabling evaluation of FCE methods on specific error types or real-world error distributions. On the proposed benchmark, we discover the failure of existing FCE methods to detect the logical fallacy, which refers to a mismatch of logic structures between the answer and the retrieved reference. To fix this issue, we further propose a new method called \emph{L-Face4RAG} with two novel designs of logic-preserving answer decomposition and fact-logic FCE. Extensive experiments show L-Face4RAG substantially outperforms previous methods for factual inconsistency detection on a wide range of tasks, notably beyond the RAG task from which it is originally motivated. Both the benchmark and our proposed method are publicly available.\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/yq27/Face4RAG}\label{link_face4rag}}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Nguyen, Andrew Baker, Andreas Kirsch, Clement Neo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate longform text by successively sampling the next token based on the probability distribution of the token vocabulary at each decoding step. Current popular truncation sampling methods such as top-$p$ sampling, also known as nucleus sampling, often struggle to balance coherence and creativity in generating text, particularly when using higher temperatures. To address this issue, we propose min-$p$, a dynamic truncation sampling method, that establishes a minimum base percentage threshold for tokens, which the scales according to the probability of the top candidate token. Through experiments on several benchmarks, such as GPQA, GSM8K and AlpacaEval Creative Writing, we demonstrate that min-$p$ improves the coherence and quality of generated text even at high temperatures, while also facilitating more creative and diverse outputs compared to top-$p$ and other sampling methods. As of writing, min-$p$ has been adopted by multiple open-source LLM implementations, and have been independently assessed by members of the open-source LLM community, further validating its practical utility and potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leon Engl\"ander, Hannah Sterz, Clifton Poth, Jonas Pfeiffer, Ilia Kuznetsov, Iryna Gurevych</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalization and robustness to input variation are core desiderata of machine learning research. Language varies along several axes, most importantly, language instance (e.g. French) and domain (e.g. news). While adapting NLP models to new languages within a single domain, or to new domains within a single language, is widely studied, research in joint adaptation is hampered by the lack of evaluation datasets. This prevents the transfer of NLP systems from well-resourced languages and domains to non-dominant language-domain combinations. To address this gap, we introduce M2QA, a multi-domain multilingual question answering benchmark. M2QA includes 13,500 SQuAD 2.0-style question-answer instances in German, Turkish, and Chinese for the domains of product reviews, news, and creative writing. We use M2QA to explore cross-lingual cross-domain performance of fine-tuned models and state-of-the-art LLMs and investigate modular approaches to domain and language adaptation. We witness 1) considerable performance variations across domain-language combinations within model classes and 2) considerable performance drops between source and target language-domain combinations across all model sizes. We demonstrate that M2QA is far from solved, and new methods to effectively transfer both linguistic and domain-specific information are necessary. We make M2QA publicly available at https://github.com/UKPLab/m2qa.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated their capabilities in storyline creation and human-like character role-playing. Current language model agents mainly focus on reasonable behaviors from the level of individuals, and their behaviors might be hard to constraint on the level of the whole storyline. In this paper we introduce IBSEN, a director-actor coordinate agent framework that generates drama scripts and makes the plot played by agents more controllable. The director agent writes plot outlines that the user desires to see, instructs the actor agents to role-play their characters, and reschedules the plot when human players participate in the scenario to ensure the plot is progressing towards the objective. To evaluate the framework, we create a novel drama plot that involves several actor agents and check the interactions between them under the instruction of the director agent. Evaluation results show that our framework could generate complete, diverse drama scripts from only a rough outline of plot objectives, meanwhile maintaining the characteristics of characters in the drama. Our codes and prompts are available at https://github.com/OpenDFM/ibsen.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Wang, Hanlin Zhang, Xiner Li, Kuan-Hao Huang, Chi Han, Shuiwang Ji, Sham M. Kakade, Hao Peng, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Position bias has proven to be a prevalent issue of modern language models (LMs), where the models prioritize content based on its position within the given context. This bias often leads to unexpected model failures and hurts performance, robustness, and reliability across various applications. Our mechanistic analysis attributes the position bias to two components employed in nearly all state-of-the-art LMs: causal attention and relative positional encodings. Specifically, we find that causal attention generally causes models to favor distant content, while relative positional encodings like RoPE prefer nearby ones based on the analysis of retrieval-augmented question answering (QA). Further, our empirical study on object detection reveals that position bias is also present in vision-language models (VLMs).
  Based on the above analyses, we propose to ELIMINATE position bias caused by different input segment orders (e.g., options in LM-as-a-judge, retrieved documents in QA) in a TRAINING-FREE ZERO-SHOT manner. Our method changes the causal attention to bidirectional attention between segments and utilizes model attention values to decide the relative orders of segments instead of using the order provided in input prompts, therefore enabling Position-INvariant inferencE (PINE) at the segment level. By eliminating position bias, models achieve better performance and reliability in downstream tasks where position bias widely exists, such as LM-as-a-judge and retrieval-augmented QA.
  Notably, PINE is especially useful when adapting LMs for evaluating reasoning pairs: it consistently provides 8 to 10 percentage points performance gains in most cases, and makes Llama-3-70B-Instruct perform even better than GPT-4-0125-preview on the RewardBench reasoning subset.</p>

In response to the recent popularity of generative LLMs, many RAG approaches have been proposed, which involve an intricate number of different configurations such as evaluation datasets, collections, metrics, retrievers, and LLMs. Inconsistent benchmarking poses a major challenge in comparing approaches and understanding the impact of each component in the pipeline. In this work, we study best practices that lay the groundwork for a systematic evaluation of RAG and present BERGEN, an end-to-end library for reproducible research standardizing RAG experiments.

<p>Abstract: It has become routine to report research results where Large Language Models (LLMs) outperform average humans in a wide range of language-related tasks, and creative text writing is no exception. It seems natural, then, to raise the bid: Are LLMs ready to compete in creative writing skills with a top (rather than average) novelist? To provide an initial answer for this question, we have carried out a contest between Patricio Pron (an awarded novelist, considered one of the best of his generation) and GPT-4 (one of the top performing LLMs), in the spirit of AI-human duels such as DeepBlue vs Kasparov and AlphaGo vs Lee Sidol. We asked Pron and GPT-4 to provide thirty titles each, and then to write short stories for both their titles and their opponent's. Then, we prepared an evaluation rubric inspired by Boden's definition of creativity, and we collected 5,400 manual assessments provided by literature critics and scholars. The results of our experimentation indicate that LLMs are still far from challenging a top human creative writer, and that reaching such level of autonomous creative writing skills probably cannot be reached simply with larger language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrizio Giovannotti, Alexander Gammerman</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of predictions made by large language models (LLMs) in binary text classification tasks remains a challenge. Calibration, in the context of LLMs, refers to the alignment between the model's predicted probabilities and the actual correctness of its predictions. A well-calibrated model should produce probabilities that accurately reflect the likelihood of its predictions being correct. We propose a novel approach that utilizes the inductive Venn--Abers predictor (IVAP) to calibrate the probabilities associated with the output tokens corresponding to the binary labels. Our experiments on the BoolQ dataset using the Llama 2 model demonstrate that IVAP consistently outperforms the commonly used temperature scaling method for various label token choices, achieving well-calibrated probabilities while maintaining high predictive quality. Our findings contribute to the understanding of calibration techniques for LLMs and provide a practical solution for obtaining reliable uncertainty estimates in binary question answering tasks, enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM predictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We focus on multi-domain Neural Machine Translation, with the goal of developing efficient models which can handle data from various domains seen during training and are robust to domains unseen during training. We hypothesize that Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models are a good fit for this task, as they enable efficient model scaling, which helps to accommodate a variety of multi-domain data, and allow flexible sharing of parameters between domains, potentially enabling knowledge transfer between similar domains and limiting negative transfer. We conduct a series of experiments aimed at validating the utility of SMoE for the multi-domain scenario, and find that a straightforward width scaling of Transformer is a simpler and surprisingly more efficient approach in practice, and reaches the same performance level as SMoE.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rao Ma, Yassir Fathullah, Mengjie Qian, Siyuan Tang, Mark Gales, Kate Knill</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been increasing interest in building multilingual foundation models for NLP and speech research. Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer has been demonstrated on a range of NLP tasks where a model fine-tuned on task-specific data in one language yields performance gains in other languages. Here, we explore whether speech-based models exhibit the same transfer capability. Using Whisper as an example of a multilingual speech foundation model, we examine the utterance representation generated by the speech encoder. Despite some language-sensitive information being preserved in the audio embedding, words from different languages are mapped to a similar semantic space, as evidenced by a high recall rate in a speech-to-speech retrieval task. Leveraging this shared embedding space, zero-shot cross-lingual transfer is demonstrated in speech translation. When the Whisper model is fine-tuned solely on English-to-Chinese translation data, performance improvements are observed for input utterances in other languages. Additionally, experiments on low-resource languages show that Whisper can perform speech translation for utterances from languages unseen during pre-training by utilizing cross-lingual representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kassem Sabeh, Robert Litschko, Mouna Kacimi, Barbara Plank, Johann Gamper</p>
<p>Abstract: Product attributes are crucial for e-commerce platforms, supporting applications like search, recommendation, and question answering. The task of Product Attribute and Value Identification (PAVI) involves identifying both attributes and their values from product information. In this paper, we formulate PAVI as a generation task and provide, to the best of our knowledge, the most comprehensive evaluation of PAVI so far. We compare three different attribute-value generation (AVG) strategies based on fine-tuning encoder-decoder models on three datasets. Experiments show that end-to-end AVG approach, which is computationally efficient, outperforms other strategies. However, there are differences depending on model sizes and the underlying language model. The code to reproduce all experiments is available at: https://github.com/kassemsabeh/pavi-avg</p>

<p>Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the influence of sociocultural factors (i.e., social, cultural, and political) in the development of hate speech detection systems. We set out to investigate the suitability of using open-source training data to monitor levels of anti-LGBTQ+ content on social media across different national-varieties of English. Our findings suggests the social and cultural alignment of open-source hate speech data sets influences the predicted outputs. Furthermore, the keyword-search approach of anti-LGBTQ+ slurs in the development of open-source training data encourages detection models to overfit on slurs; therefore, anti-LGBTQ+ content may go undetected. We recommend combining empirical outputs with qualitative insights to ensure these systems are fit for purpose.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takyoung Kim, Kyungjae Lee, Young Rok Jang, Ji Yong Cho, Gangwoo Kim, Minseok Cho, Moontae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactions with billion-scale large language models typically yield long-form responses due to their extensive parametric capacities, along with retrieval-augmented features. While detailed responses provide insightful viewpoint of a specific subject, they frequently generate redundant and less engaging content that does not meet user interests. In this work, we focus on the role of query outlining (i.e., selected sequence of queries) in scenarios that users request a specific range of information, namely coverage-conditioned ($C^2$) scenarios. For simulating $C^2$ scenarios, we construct QTree, 10K sets of information-seeking queries decomposed with various perspectives on certain topics. By utilizing QTree, we train QPlanner, a 7B language model generating customized query outlines that follow coverage-conditioned queries. We analyze the effectiveness of generated outlines through automatic and human evaluation, targeting on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that QPlanner with alignment training can further provide outlines satisfying diverse user interests.

<p>Abstract: The training and inference of large language models (LLMs) are together a costly process that transports knowledge from raw data to meaningful computation. Inspired by the memory hierarchy of the human brain, we reduce this cost by equipping LLMs with explicit memory, a memory format cheaper than model parameters and text retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Conceptually, with most of its knowledge externalized to explicit memories, the LLM can enjoy a smaller parameter size, training cost, and inference cost, all proportional to the amount of remaining "abstract knowledge". As a preliminary proof of concept, we train from scratch a 2.4B LLM, which achieves better performance than much larger LLMs as well as RAG models, and maintains higher decoding speed than RAG. The model is named $\text{Memory}^3$, since explicit memory is the third form of memory in LLMs after implicit memory (model parameters) and working memory (context key-values). We introduce a memory circuitry theory to support the externalization of knowledge, and present novel techniques including a memory sparsification mechanism that makes storage tractable and a two-stage pretraining scheme that facilitates memory formation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Guo, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for writing economic analysis reports or providing financial advice, but their ability to understand economic knowledge and reason about potential results of specific economic events lacks systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we propose a new dataset, natural language inference on economic events (EconNLI), to evaluate LLMs' knowledge and reasoning abilities in the economic domain. We evaluate LLMs on (1) their ability to correctly classify whether a premise event will cause a hypothesis event and (2) their ability to generate reasonable events resulting from a given premise. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are not sophisticated in economic reasoning and may generate wrong or hallucinated answers. Our study raises awareness of the limitations of using LLMs for critical decision-making involving economic reasoning and analysis.

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have proven to be effective in integrating up-to-date information, mitigating hallucinations, and enhancing response quality, particularly in specialized domains. While many RAG approaches have been proposed to enhance large language models through query-dependent retrievals, these approaches still suffer from their complex implementation and prolonged response times. Typically, a RAG workflow involves multiple processing steps, each of which can be executed in various ways. Here, we investigate existing RAG approaches and their potential combinations to identify optimal RAG practices. Through extensive experiments, we suggest several strategies for deploying RAG that balance both performance and efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that multimodal retrieval techniques can significantly enhance question-answering capabilities about visual inputs and accelerate the generation of multimodal content using a "retrieval as generation" strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenchen Ye, Ziniu Hu, Yihe Deng, Zijie Huang, Mingyu Derek Ma, Yanqiao Zhu, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered LLM agents to autonomously collect world information, over which to conduct reasoning to solve complex problems. Given this capability, increasing interests have been put into employing LLM agents for predicting international events, which can influence decision-making and shape policy development on an international scale. Despite such a growing interest, there is a lack of a rigorous benchmark of LLM agents' forecasting capability and reliability. To address this gap, we introduce MIRAI, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLM agents as temporal forecasters in the context of international events. Our benchmark features an agentic environment with tools for accessing an extensive database of historical, structured events and textual news articles. We refine the GDELT event database with careful cleaning and parsing to curate a series of relational prediction tasks with varying forecasting horizons, assessing LLM agents' abilities from short-term to long-term forecasting. We further implement APIs to enable LLM agents to utilize different tools via a code-based interface. In summary, MIRAI comprehensively evaluates the agents' capabilities in three dimensions: 1) autonomously source and integrate critical information from large global databases; 2) write codes using domain-specific APIs and libraries for tool-use; and 3) jointly reason over historical knowledge from diverse formats and time to accurately predict future events. Through comprehensive benchmarking, we aim to establish a reliable framework for assessing the capabilities of LLM agents in forecasting international events, thereby contributing to the development of more accurate and trustworthy models for international relation analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul Waheed, Karima Kadaoui, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work on distilling Whisper's knowledge into small models using pseudo-labels shows promising performance while reducing the size by up to 50\%. This results in small, efficient, and dedicated models. However, a critical step of distillation from pseudo-labels involves filtering high-quality predictions and using only those during training. This step requires ground truth to compare and filter bad examples making the whole process supervised. In addition to that, the distillation process requires a large amount of data thereby limiting the ability to distil models in low-resource settings. To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised or label-free framework for distillation, thus eliminating the requirement for labeled data altogether. Through experimentation, we show that our best distilled models outperform the teacher model by 5-7 points in terms of WER. Additionally, our models are on par with or better than similar supervised data filtering setup. When we scale the data, our models significantly outperform all zero-shot and supervised models. In this work, we demonstrate that it's possible to distill large Whisper models into relatively small models without using any labeled data. As a result, our distilled models are 25-50\% more compute and memory efficient while maintaining performance equal to or better than the teacher model.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present SignCLIP, which re-purposes CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) to project spoken language text and sign language videos, two classes of natural languages of distinct modalities, into the same space. SignCLIP is an efficient method of learning useful visual representations for sign language processing from large-scale, multilingual video-text pairs, without directly optimizing for a specific task or sign language which is often of limited size.
  We pretrain SignCLIP on Spreadthesign, a prominent sign language dictionary consisting of ~500 thousand video clips in up to 44 sign languages, and evaluate it with various downstream datasets. SignCLIP discerns in-domain signing with notable text-to-video/video-to-text retrieval accuracy. It also performs competitively for out-of-domain downstream tasks such as isolated sign language recognition upon essential few-shot prompting or fine-tuning.
  We analyze the latent space formed by the spoken language text and sign language poses, which provides additional linguistic insights. Our code and models are openly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Serene Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the subtle and often concealed biases present in Large Language Models (LLMs), which, despite passing explicit bias tests, can still exhibit implicit biases akin to those observed in humans who profess egalitarian beliefs yet demonstrate underlying prejudices. The challenge of measuring such biases is exacerbated as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, restricting access to their internal mechanisms such as embeddings, which are crucial for applying traditional bias measures. To tackle these issues, this study introduces innovative measures of bias inspired by psychological methodologies: the LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias and the LLM Decision Bias. The LLM IAT Bias is a prompt-based method designed to unearth implicit biases by simulating the well-known psychological IAT but adapted for use with LLMs. The LLM Decision Bias measure is developed to detect subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks, focusing on how LLMs choose between individuals in various scenarios. Open-ended generation is also utilised through thematic analysis of word generations and storytelling. The experiments revealed biases across gender and racial domains, from discriminatory categorisations to exoticisation. Our findings indicate that the prompt-based measure of implicit bias not only correlates with traditional embedding-based methods but also more effectively predicts downstream behaviors, which are crucially measured by the LLM Decision Bias. This relationship underscores the importance of relative, rather than absolute, evaluations in assessing implicit biases, reflecting psychological insights into human bias assessment. This research contributes to the broader understanding of AI ethics and provides suggestions for continually assessing and mitigating biases in advanced AI systems, emphasising the need for more qualitative and downstream focus.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present our champion solution to the Global Artificial Intelligence Technology Innovation Competition Track 1: Medical Imaging Diagnosis Report Generation. We select CPT-BASE as our base model for the text generation task. During the pre-training stage, we delete the mask language modeling task of CPT-BASE and instead reconstruct the vocabulary, adopting a span mask strategy and gradually increasing the number of masking ratios to perform the denoising auto-encoder pre-training task. In the fine-tuning stage, we design iterative retrieval augmentation and noise-aware similarity bucket prompt strategies. The retrieval augmentation constructs a mini-knowledge base, enriching the input information of the model, while the similarity bucket further perceives the noise information within the mini-knowledge base, guiding the model to generate higher-quality diagnostic reports based on the similarity prompts. Surprisingly, our single model has achieved a score of 2.321 on leaderboard A, and the multiple model fusion scores are 2.362 and 2.320 on the A and B leaderboards respectively, securing first place in the rankings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Zamai, Andrea Zugarini, Leonardo Rigutini, Marco Ernandes, Marco Maggini</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, several specialized instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for Named Entity Recognition (NER) have emerged. Compared to traditional NER approaches, these models have strong generalization capabilities. Existing LLMs mainly focus on zero-shot NER in out-of-domain distributions, being fine-tuned on an extensive number of entity classes that often highly or completely overlap with test sets. In this work instead, we propose SLIMER, an approach designed to tackle never-seen-before named entity tags by instructing the model on fewer examples, and by leveraging a prompt enriched with definition and guidelines. Experiments demonstrate that definition and guidelines yield better performance, faster and more robust learning, particularly when labelling unseen Named Entities. Furthermore, SLIMER performs comparably to state-of-the-art approaches in out-of-domain zero-shot NER, while being trained on a reduced tag set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyuan Zhang, Fuyuan Lyu, Xue Liu, Chen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Comprehensively understanding and accurately predicting the performance of large language models across diverse downstream tasks has emerged as a pivotal challenge in NLP research. The pioneering scaling law on downstream works demonstrated intrinsic similarities within model families and utilized such similarities for performance prediction. However, they tend to overlook the similarities between model families and only consider design factors listed in the original scaling law. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework, Collaborative Performance Prediction (CPP), which significantly enhances prediction accuracy by leveraging the historical performance of various models on downstream tasks and other design factors for both model and task. We also collect a collaborative data sourced from online platforms containing both historical performance and additional design factors. With the support of the collaborative data, CPP not only surpasses traditional scaling laws in predicting the performance of scaled LLMs but also facilitates a detailed analysis of factor importance, an area previously overlooked.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Njifenjou, Virgile Sucal, Bassam Jabaian, Fabrice Lef\`evre</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a study of linguistic portability strategies of large pre-trained language models (PLMs) used for open-domain dialogue systems in a high-resource language for this task. In particular the target low-resource language (L_T) will be simulated with French, as it lacks of task-specific resources and allows our human evaluation, when the source language (L_S) is English. For obvious reasons, recent works using such models for open-domain dialogue are mostly developed in English. Yet building specific PLMs for each possible target language supposes collecting new datasets and is costly. For this reason, trying to leverage all existing resources (PLMs and data) in both L_S and L_T , we wish to assess the performance achievable in L_T with different approaches. The first two approaches evaluate the usage of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) at different levels: TrainOnTarget where a L_S dataset is translated before fine-tuning in L_T and TestOnSource where a L_S model is coupled with NMT modules during inference. Then, the advent of BLOOM [2], the world first open-access multilingual large PLM, allow researchers to develop new approaches aiming to leverage not only the model's full accessibility but also its multilingualism and translation abilities. In this context the task is learned in L_S first and adapted to L_T using the MAD-X Adapter architecture [16]. In the two sets of experiments models are evaluated in spoken dialogue conditions with human and the strategies can be compared in terms of perceived interaction quality.</p>

In this work, we explore the prospects of avoiding such data exposure at the level of text manipulation. We focus on text classification models, examining various token mapping and contextualized manipulation functions in order to see whether classifier accuracy may be maintained while keeping the original text unrecoverable. We find that although some token mapping functions are easy and straightforward to implement, they heavily influence performance on the downstream task, and via a sophisticated attacker can be reconstructed. In comparison, the contextualized manipulation provides an improvement in performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the cross-lingual inconsistencies observed in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Llama, and Baichuan, which have shown exceptional performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite their successes, these models often exhibit significant inconsistencies when processing the same concepts across different languages. This study focuses on three primary questions: the existence of cross-lingual inconsistencies in LLMs, the specific aspects in which these inconsistencies manifest, and the correlation between cross-lingual consistency and multilingual capabilities of LLMs.To address these questions, we propose an innovative evaluation method for Cross-lingual Semantic Consistency (xSC) using the LaBSE model. We further introduce metrics for Cross-lingual Accuracy Consistency (xAC) and Cross-lingual Timeliness Consistency (xTC) to comprehensively assess the models' performance regarding semantic, accuracy, and timeliness inconsistencies. By harmonizing these metrics, we provide a holistic measurement of LLMs' cross-lingual consistency. Our findings aim to enhance the understanding and improvement of multilingual capabilities and interpretability in LLMs, contributing to the development of more robust and reliable multilingual language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philippe Laban, Alexander R. Fabbri, Caiming Xiong, Chien-Sheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs and RAG systems are now capable of handling millions of input tokens or more. However, evaluating the output quality of such systems on long-context tasks remains challenging, as tasks like Needle-in-a-Haystack lack complexity. In this work, we argue that summarization can play a central role in such evaluation. We design a procedure to synthesize Haystacks of documents, ensuring that specific \textit{insights} repeat across documents. The "Summary of a Haystack" (SummHay) task then requires a system to process the Haystack and generate, given a query, a summary that identifies the relevant insights and precisely cites the source documents. Since we have precise knowledge of what insights should appear in a haystack summary and what documents should be cited, we implement a highly reproducible automatic evaluation that can score summaries on two aspects - Coverage and Citation. We generate Haystacks in two domains (conversation, news), and perform a large-scale evaluation of 10 LLMs and corresponding 50 RAG systems. Our findings indicate that SummHay is an open challenge for current systems, as even systems provided with an Oracle signal of document relevance lag our estimate of human performance (56\%) by 10+ points on a Joint Score. Without a retriever, long-context LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude 3 Opus score below 20% on SummHay. We show SummHay can also be used to study enterprise RAG systems and position bias in long-context models. We hope future systems can equal and surpass human performance on SummHay.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohan Raj Chanthran, Lay-Ki Soon, Huey Fang Ong, Bhawani Selvaretnam</p>
<p>Abstract: Malaysian English is a low resource creole language, where it carries the elements of Malay, Chinese, and Tamil languages, in addition to Standard English. Named Entity Recognition (NER) models underperform when capturing entities from Malaysian English text due to its distinctive morphosyntactic adaptations, semantic features and code-switching (mixing English and Malay). Considering these gaps, we introduce MENmBERT and MENBERT, a pre-trained language model with contextual understanding, specifically tailored for Malaysian English. We have fine-tuned MENmBERT and MENBERT using manually annotated entities and relations from the Malaysian English News Article (MEN) Dataset. This fine-tuning process allows the PLM to learn representations that capture the nuances of Malaysian English relevant for NER and RE tasks. MENmBERT achieved a 1.52\% and 26.27\% improvement on NER and RE tasks respectively compared to the bert-base-multilingual-cased model. Although the overall performance of NER does not have a significant improvement, our further analysis shows that there is a significant improvement when evaluated by the 12 entity labels. These findings suggest that pre-training language models on language-specific and geographically-focused corpora can be a promising approach for improving NER performance in low-resource settings. The dataset and code published in this paper provide valuable resources for NLP research work focusing on Malaysian English.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Sheng Hsu, Nils Feldhus, Sherzod Hakimov</p>
<p>Abstract: Free-text rationales justify model decisions in natural language and thus become likable and accessible among approaches to explanation across many tasks. However, their effectiveness can be hindered by misinterpretation and hallucination. As a perturbation test, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) perform the task of natural language explanation (NLE) under the effects of readability level control, i.e., being prompted for a rationale targeting a specific expertise level, such as sixth grade or college. We find that explanations are adaptable to such instruction, but the requested readability is often misaligned with the measured text complexity according to traditional readability metrics. Furthermore, the quality assessment shows that LLMs' ratings of rationales across text complexity exhibit a similar pattern of preference as observed in natural language generation (NLG). Finally, our human evaluation suggests a generally satisfactory impression on rationales at all readability levels, with high-school-level readability being most commonly perceived and favored.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the POLygraph dataset, a unique resource for fake news detection in Polish. The dataset, created by an interdisciplinary team, is composed of two parts: the "fake-or-not" dataset with 11,360 pairs of news articles (identified by their URLs) and corresponding labels, and the "fake-they-say" dataset with 5,082 news articles (identified by their URLs) and tweets commenting on them. Unlike existing datasets, POLygraph encompasses a variety of approaches from source literature, providing a comprehensive resource for fake news detection. The data was collected through manual annotation by expert and non-expert annotators. The project also developed a software tool that uses advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the data and determine content authenticity. The tool and dataset are expected to benefit various entities, from public sector institutions to publishers and fact-checking organizations. Further dataset exploration will foster fake news detection and potentially stimulate the implementation of similar models in other languages. The paper focuses on the creation and composition of the dataset, so it does not include a detailed evaluation of the software tool for content authenticity analysis, which is planned at a later stage of the project.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniil Gurgurov, Mareike Hartmann, Simon Ostermann</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the integration of graph knowledge from linguistic ontologies into multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) using adapters to improve performance for low-resource languages (LRLs) in sentiment analysis (SA) and named entity recognition (NER). Building upon successful parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as K-ADAPTER and MAD-X, we propose a similar approach for incorporating knowledge from multilingual graphs, connecting concepts in various languages with each other through linguistic relationships, into multilingual LLMs for LRLs. Specifically, we focus on eight LRLs -- Maltese, Bulgarian, Indonesian, Nepali, Javanese, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Sinhala -- and employ language-specific adapters fine-tuned on data extracted from the language-specific section of ConceptNet, aiming to enable knowledge transfer across the languages covered by the knowledge graph. We compare various fine-tuning objectives, including standard Masked Language Modeling (MLM), MLM with full-word masking, and MLM with targeted masking, to analyse their effectiveness in learning and integrating the extracted graph data. Through empirical evaluation on language-specific tasks, we assess how structured graph knowledge affects the performance of multilingual LLMs for LRLs in SA and NER, providing insights into the potential benefits of adapting language models for low-resource scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models present opportunities for innovative Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). However, they are not inherently designed for query generation. To bridge this gap, solutions have been proposed that rely on fine-tuning or ad-hoc architectures, achieving good results but limited out-of-domain distribution generalization. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called Dynamic Few-Shot Learning (DFSL). DFSL integrates the efficiency of in-context learning and semantic similarity and provides a generally applicable solution for KGQA with state-of-the-art performance. We run an extensive evaluation across multiple benchmark datasets and architecture configurations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present HyperLoader, a simple approach that combines different parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in a multi-task setting. To achieve this goal, our model uses a hypernetwork to generate the weights of these modules based on the task, the transformer layer, and its position within this layer. Our method combines the benefits of multi-task learning by capturing the structure of all tasks while reducing the task interference problem by encapsulating the task-specific knowledge in the generated weights and the benefits of combining different parameter-efficient methods to outperform full-fine tuning. We provide empirical evidence that HyperLoader outperforms previous approaches in most datasets and obtains the best average performance across tasks in high-resource and low-resource scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Relation classification, a crucial component of relation extraction, involves identifying connections between two entities. Previous studies have predominantly focused on integrating the attention mechanism into relation classification at a global scale, overlooking the importance of the local context. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel global-local attention mechanism for relation classification, which enhances global attention with a localized focus. Additionally, we propose innovative hard and soft localization mechanisms to identify potential keywords for local attention. By incorporating both hard and soft localization strategies, our approach offers a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the contextual cues that contribute to effective relation classification. Our experimental results on the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset highlight the superior performance of our method compared to previous attention-based approaches in relation classification.</p>

As a case study we test LARIMAR, a recently proposed LLM architecture which augments a LLM decoder with an external associative memory, on several long-context recall tasks, including passkey and needle-in-the-haystack tests. We demonstrate that the external memory can be adapted at test time to handle contexts much longer than those seen during training, while keeping readouts from the memory recognizable to the trained decoder and without increasing GPU memory footprint. Compared to alternative architectures for long-context recall tasks with models of a comparable parameter count, LARIMAR is able to maintain strong performance without any task-specific training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guiyang Hou, Wenqi Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Linjuan Wu, Weiming Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-the cognitive ability to reason about mental states of ourselves and others, is the foundation of social interaction. Although ToM comes naturally to humans, it poses a significant challenge to even the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the complex logical chains in ToM reasoning, especially in higher-order ToM questions, simply utilizing reasoning methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) will not improve the ToM capabilities of LLMs. We present TimeToM, which constructs a temporal space and uses it as the foundation to improve the ToM capabilities of LLMs in multiple scenarios. Specifically, within the temporal space, we construct Temporal Belief State Chain (TBSC) for each character and inspired by the cognition perspective of the social world model, we divide TBSC into self-world beliefs and social world beliefs, aligning with first-order ToM (first-order beliefs) and higher-order ToM (higher-order beliefs) questions, respectively. Moreover, we design a novel tool-belief solver that, by considering belief communication between characters in temporal space, can transform a character's higher-order beliefs into another character's first-order beliefs under belief communication period. Experimental results indicate that TimeToM can dramatically improve the reasoning performance of LLMs on ToM questions while taking a big step towards coherent and robust ToM reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zisu Huang, Xiaohua Wang, Feiran Zhang, Zhibo Xu, Cenyuan Zhang, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate honest, harmless, and helpful responses heavily relies on the quality of user prompts. However, these prompts often tend to be brief and vague, thereby significantly limiting the full potential of LLMs. Moreover, harmful prompts can be meticulously crafted and manipulated by adversaries to jailbreak LLMs, inducing them to produce potentially toxic content. To enhance the capabilities of LLMs while maintaining strong robustness against harmful jailbreak inputs, this study proposes a transferable and pluggable framework that refines user prompts before they are input into LLMs. This strategy improves the quality of the queries, empowering LLMs to generate more truthful, benign and useful responses. Specifically, a lightweight query refinement model is introduced and trained using a specially designed reinforcement learning approach that incorporates multiple objectives to enhance particular capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the refinement model not only improves the quality of responses but also strengthens their robustness against jailbreak attacks.

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution for incorporating up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) and improving LLM factuality, but is predominantly studied in English-only settings. In this work, we consider RAG in the multilingual setting (mRAG), i.e. with user queries and the datastore in 13 languages, and investigate which components and with which adjustments are needed to build a well-performing mRAG pipeline, that can be used as a strong baseline in future works. Our findings highlight that despite the availability of high-quality off-the-shelf multilingual retrievers and generators, task-specific prompt engineering is needed to enable generation in user languages. Moreover, current evaluation metrics need adjustments for multilingual setting, to account for variations in spelling named entities. The main limitations to be addressed in future works include frequent code-switching in non-Latin alphabet languages, occasional fluency errors, wrong reading of the provided documents, or irrelevant retrieval. We release the code for the resulting mRAG baseline pipeline at https://github.com/naver/bergen.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu\'isa Shimabucoro, Sebastian Ruder, Julia Kreutzer, Marzieh Fadaee, Sara Hooker</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic data raises new questions about how models generating the data can influence other large language models (LLMs) via distilled data. To start, our work exhaustively characterizes the impact of passive inheritance of model properties by systematically studying the consequences of synthetic data integration. We provide one of the most comprehensive studies to-date of how the source of synthetic data shapes models' internal biases, calibration and generations' textual attributes and preferences. We find that models are surprisingly sensitive towards certain attributes even when the synthetic data prompts appear "neutral". which invites the question whether this sensitivity can be exploited for good.
  Our findings invite the question can we explicitly steer the models towards the properties we want at test time by exploiting the data generation process? This would have historically been considered infeasible due to the cost of collecting data with a specific characteristic or objective in mind. However, improvement in the quality of synthetic data, as well as a shift towards general-purpose models designed to follow a diverse way of instructions, means this question is timely. We propose active inheritance as a term to describe intentionally constraining synthetic data according to a non-differentiable objective. We demonstrate how active inheritance can steer the generation profiles of models towards desirable non-differentiable attributes, e.g. high lexical diversity or low toxicity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siwei Li, Yifan Yang, Yifei Shen, Fangyun Wei, Zongqing Lu, Lili Qiu, Yuqing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning plays a fundamental role in modern large models, with low-rank adaptation emerging as a particularly promising approach. However, the existing variants of LoRA are hampered by limited expressiveness, a tendency to overfit, and sensitivity to hyperparameter settings. This paper presents LoRA Slow Cascade Learning (LoRASC), an innovative technique designed to enhance LoRA's expressiveness and generalization capabilities while preserving its training efficiency. Our approach augments expressiveness through a cascaded learning strategy that enables a mixture-of-low-rank adaptation, thereby increasing the model's ability to capture complex patterns. Additionally, we introduce a slow-fast update mechanism and cascading noisy tuning to bolster generalization. The extensive experiments on various language and vision datasets, as well as robustness benchmarks, demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms existing baselines, but also mitigates overfitting, enhances model stability, and improves OOD robustness. Code will be release in https://github.com/microsoft/LoRASC very soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Liu, Xiaosen Zheng, Niklas Muennighoff, Guangtao Zeng, Longxu Dou, Tianyu Pang, Jing Jiang, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The data mixture for large language model pre-training significantly impacts performance, yet how to determine an effective mixture remains unclear. We propose RegMix to automatically identify a high-performing data mixture by formulating it as a regression task. RegMix involves training a set of small models with diverse data mixtures and fitting a regression model to predict their performance given their respective mixtures. With the fitted regression model, we simulate the top-ranked mixture and use it to train a large-scale model with orders of magnitude more compute. To empirically validate RegMix, we train 512 models with 1M parameters for 1B tokens of different mixtures to fit the regression model and find the optimal mixture. Using this mixture we train a 1B parameter model for 25B tokens (i.e. 1000x larger and 25x longer) which we find performs best among 64 candidate 1B parameter models with other mixtures. Further, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to human selection and achieves results that match or surpass DoReMi, while utilizing only 10% of the compute budget. Our experiments also show that (1) Data mixtures significantly impact performance with single-task performance variations of up to 14.6%; (2) Web corpora rather than data perceived as high-quality like Wikipedia have the strongest positive correlation with downstream performance; (3) Domains interact in complex ways often contradicting common sense, thus automatic approaches like RegMix are needed; (4) Data mixture effects transcend scaling laws, and our approach captures the complexity by considering all domains together.

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various applications, they also raise concerns regarding self-cognition. In this paper, we perform a pioneering study to explore self-cognition in LLMs. Specifically, we first construct a pool of self-cognition instruction prompts to evaluate where an LLM exhibits self-cognition and four well-designed principles to quantify LLMs' self-cognition. Our study reveals that 4 of the 48 models on Chatbot Arena--specifically Command R, Claude3-Opus, Llama-3-70b-Instruct, and Reka-core--demonstrate some level of detectable self-cognition. We observe a positive correlation between model size, training data quality, and self-cognition level. Additionally, we also explore the utility and trustworthiness of LLM in the self-cognition state, revealing that the self-cognition state enhances some specific tasks such as creative writing and exaggeration. We believe that our work can serve as an inspiration for further research to study the self-cognition in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long context capability is a crucial competency for large language models (LLMs) as it mitigates the human struggle to digest long-form texts. This capability enables complex task-solving scenarios such as book summarization, code assistance, and many more tasks that are traditionally manpower-intensive. However, transformer-based LLMs face significant challenges with long context input due to the growing size of the KV cache and the intrinsic complexity of attending to extended inputs; where multiple schools of efficiency-driven approaches -- such as KV cache quantization, token dropping, prompt compression, linear-time sequence models, and hybrid architectures -- have been proposed to produce efficient yet long context-capable models. Despite these advancements, no existing work has comprehensively benchmarked these methods in a reasonably aligned environment. In this work, we fill this gap by providing a taxonomy of current methods and evaluating 10+ state-of-the-art approaches across seven categories of long context tasks. Our work reveals numerous previously unknown phenomena and offers insights -- as well as a friendly workbench -- for the future development of long context-capable LLMs. The source code will be available at https://github.com/henryzhongsc/longctx_bench</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feibo Jiang, Chuanguo Tang, Li Dong, Kezhi Wang, Kun Yang, Cunhua Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) has emerged as a novel communication paradigm in recent years, successfully transcending the Shannon physical capacity limits through innovative semantic transmission concepts. Nevertheless, extant Image Semantic Communication (ISC) systems face several challenges in dynamic environments, including low semantic density, catastrophic forgetting, and uncertain Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). To address these challenges, we propose a novel Vision-Language Model-based Cross-modal Semantic Communication (VLM-CSC) system. The VLM-CSC comprises three novel components: (1) Cross-modal Knowledge Base (CKB) is used to extract high-density textual semantics from the semantically sparse image at the transmitter and reconstruct the original image based on textual semantics at the receiver. The transmission of high-density semantics contributes to alleviating bandwidth pressure. (2) Memory-assisted Encoder and Decoder (MED) employ a hybrid long/short-term memory mechanism, enabling the semantic encoder and decoder to overcome catastrophic forgetting in dynamic environments when there is a drift in the distribution of semantic features. (3) Noise Attention Module (NAM) employs attention mechanisms to adaptively adjust the semantic coding and the channel coding based on SNR, ensuring the robustness of the CSC system. The experimental simulations validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of the CSC system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Archit Patke, Dhemath Reddy, Saurabh Jha, Haoran Qiu, Christian Pinto, Shengkun Cui, Chandra Narayanaswami, Zbigniew Kalbarczyk, Ravishankar Iyer</p>
<p>Abstract: $ $Large language models (LLMs) have become an increasingly important workload for cloud providers catering to both enterprise and consumer applications. LLM inference requests from these applications have end-to-end latency SLOs that must be adhered to in production settings. However, existing LLM serving systems focus on optimization objectives such as request serving throughput or request execution latency rather than the end-to-end latency SLOs. Achieving end-to-end SLOs for latency-sensitive requests is challenging due to head-of-line (HOL) blocking in the request queue, which results from bursty arrival rates and insufficient resources.
  To address the above challenge, we propose QLM, a multi-model queue management framework for LLM serving. QLM uses stochastic programming to orchestrate the actions of multiple LLM Serving Operations (LSOs) to reduce HOL blocking and maximize SLO attainment. Specifically, QLM uses the following LSOs: model swapping, request eviction, GPU-CPU state swapping, load balancing, and warm model start. Evaluation on heterogeneous GPU devices and models with real-world LLM serving dataset shows that QLM improves SLO attainment by 40-90% and throughput by 20-400% while maintaining or improving device utilization compared to other state-of-the-art LLM serving systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The first step towards digitalization within organizations lies in digitization - the conversion of analog data into digitally stored data. This basic step is the prerequisite for all following activities like the digitalization of processes or the servitization of products or offerings. However, digitization itself often leads to 'data-rich' but 'knowledge-poor' material. Knowledge discovery and knowledge extraction as approaches try to increase the usefulness of digitized data. In this paper, we point out the key challenges in the context of knowledge discovery and present an approach to addressing these using a microservices architecture. Our solution led to a conceptual design focusing on keyword extraction, similarity calculation of documents, database queries in natural language, and programming language independent provision of the extracted information. In addition, the conceptual design provides referential design guidelines for integrating processes and applications for semi-automatic learning, editing, and visualization of ontologies. The concept also uses a microservices architecture to address non-functional requirements, such as scalability and resilience. The evaluation of the specified requirements is performed using a demonstrator that implements the concept. Furthermore, this modern approach is used in the German patent office in an extended version.</p>

Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require continuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store thousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the efficacy of compression when serving LoRA adapters. We consider compressing adapters individually via SVD and propose a method for joint compression of LoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling matrices. Our experiments with up to 500 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed LoRAs preserve performance while offering major throughput gains in realistic serving scenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 75% of the throughput of serving a single LoRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mert Esencan, Tarun Advaith Kumar, Ata Akbari Asanjan, P. Aaron Lott, Masoud Mohseni, Can Unlu, Davide Venturelli, Alan Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities at tasks that require human intelligence and are a significant step towards human-like artificial intelligence (AI). Yet the performance of LLMs at reasoning tasks have been subpar and the reasoning capability of LLMs is a matter of significant debate. While it has been shown that the choice of the prompting technique to the LLM can alter its performance on a multitude of tasks, including reasoning, the best performing techniques require human-made prompts with the knowledge of the tasks at hand. We introduce a framework for what we call Combinatorial Reasoning (CR), a fully-automated prompting method, where reasons are sampled from an LLM pipeline and mapped into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. The framework investigates whether QUBO solutions can be profitably used to select a useful subset of the reasons to construct a Chain-of-Thought style prompt. We explore the acceleration of CR with specialized solvers. We also investigate the performance of simpler zero-shot strategies such as linear majority rule or random selection of reasons. Our preliminary study indicates that coupling a combinatorial solver to generative AI pipelines is an interesting avenue for AI reasoning and elucidates design principles for future CR methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Bai, Yukai Miao, Li Chen, Dan Li, Yanyu Ren, Hongtao Xie, Ce Yang, Xuhui Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: In Greek mythology, Pistis symbolized good faith, trust, and reliability, echoing the core principles of RAG in LLM systems. Pistis-RAG, a scalable multi-stage framework, effectively addresses the challenges of large-scale retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Each stage plays a distinct role: matching refines the search space, pre-ranking prioritizes semantically relevant documents, and ranking aligns with the large language model's (LLM) preferences. The reasoning and aggregating stage supports the implementation of complex chain-of-thought (CoT) methods within this cascading structure. We argue that the lack of strong alignment between LLMs and the external knowledge ranking methods used in RAG tasks is relevant to the reliance on the model-centric paradigm in RAG frameworks. A content-centric approach would prioritize seamless integration between the LLMs and external information sources, optimizing the content transformation process for each specific task. Critically, our ranking stage deviates from traditional RAG approaches by recognizing that semantic relevance alone may not directly translate to improved generation. This is due to the sensitivity of the few-shot prompt order, as highlighted in prior work \cite{lu2021fantastically}. Current RAG frameworks fail to account for this crucial factor. We introduce a novel ranking stage specifically designed for RAG systems. It adheres to information retrieval principles while considering the unique business scenario captured by LLM preferences and user feedback. Our approach integrates in-context learning (ICL) methods and reasoning steps to incorporate user feedback, ensuring efficient alignment. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark demonstrate a 9.3\% performance improvement. The model and code will be open-sourced on GitHub. Experiments on real-world, large-scale data validate our framework's scalability.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study how to subvert language models from following the rules. We model rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form "if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$" for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. We prove that although transformers can faithfully abide by such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can nevertheless mislead even theoretically constructed models. Empirically, we find that attacks on our theoretical models mirror popular attacks on large language models. Our work suggests that studying smaller theoretical models can help understand the behavior of large language models in rule-based settings like logical reasoning and jailbreak attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ju-Seung Byun, Jiyun Chun, Jihyung Kil, Andrew Perrault</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel at comprehending human instructions and demonstrate remarkable results across a broad spectrum of tasks. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF) further refine LLMs by aligning them with specific preferences. These methods primarily use ranking-based feedback for entire generations. With advanced AI models (Teacher), such as GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, we can request various types of detailed feedback that are expensive for humans to provide. We propose a two-stage algorithm ARES that Alternates REinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). First, we request the Teacher to score how much each sentence contributes to solving the problem in a Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This sentence-level feedback allows us to consider individual valuable segments, providing more granular rewards for the RL procedure. Second, we ask the Teacher to correct the wrong reasoning after the RL stage. The RL procedure requires massive efforts for hyperparameter tuning and often generates errors like repetitive words and incomplete sentences. With the correction feedback, we stabilize the RL fine-tuned model through SFT. We conduct experiments on multi-model dataset ScienceQA and A-OKVQA to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal. ARES rationale reasoning achieves around 70% win rate against baseline models judged by GPT-4o. Additionally, we observe that the improved rationale reasoning leads to a 2.5% increase in inference answer accuracy on average for the multi-modal datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoling Zhou, Wei Ye, Yidong Wang, Chaoya Jiang, Zhemg Lee, Rui Xie, Shikun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) enables large pre-trained language models (PLMs) to make predictions for unseen inputs without updating parameters. Despite its potential, ICL's effectiveness heavily relies on the quality, quantity, and permutation of demonstrations, commonly leading to suboptimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we tackle this challenge for the first time from the perspective of demonstration augmentation. Specifically, we start with enriching representations of demonstrations by leveraging their deep feature distribution. We then theoretically reveal that when the number of augmented copies approaches infinity, the augmentation is approximately equal to a novel logit calibration mechanism integrated with specific statistical properties. This insight results in a simple yet highly efficient method that significantly improves the average and worst-case accuracy across diverse PLMs and tasks. Moreover, our method effectively reduces performance variance among varying demonstrations, permutations, and templates, and displays the capability to address imbalanced class distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilia Shumailov, Jamie Hayes, Eleni Triantafillou, Guillermo Ortiz-Jimenez, Nicolas Papernot, Matthew Jagielski, Itay Yona, Heidi Howard, Eugene Bagdasaryan</p>
<p>Abstract: Exact unlearning was first introduced as a privacy mechanism that allowed a user to retract their data from machine learning models on request. Shortly after, inexact schemes were proposed to mitigate the impractical costs associated with exact unlearning. More recently unlearning is often discussed as an approach for removal of impermissible knowledge i.e. knowledge that the model should not possess such as unlicensed copyrighted, inaccurate, or malicious information. The promise is that if the model does not have a certain malicious capability, then it cannot be used for the associated malicious purpose. In this paper we revisit the paradigm in which unlearning is used for in Large Language Models (LLMs) and highlight an underlying inconsistency arising from in-context learning. Unlearning can be an effective control mechanism for the training phase, yet it does not prevent the model from performing an impermissible act during inference. We introduce a concept of ununlearning, where unlearned knowledge gets reintroduced in-context, effectively rendering the model capable of behaving as if it knows the forgotten knowledge. As a result, we argue that content filtering for impermissible knowledge will be required and even exact unlearning schemes are not enough for effective content regulation. We discuss feasibility of ununlearning for modern LLMs and examine broader implications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Incorporating extra-textual context such as film metadata into the machine translation (MT) pipeline can enhance translation quality, as indicated by automatic evaluation in recent work. However, the positive impact of such systems in industry remains unproven. We report on an industrial case study carried out to investigate the benefit of MT in a professional scenario of translating TV subtitles with a focus on how leveraging extra-textual context impacts post-editing. We found that post-editors marked significantly fewer context-related errors when correcting the outputs of MTCue, the context-aware model, as opposed to non-contextual models. We also present the results of a survey of the employed post-editors, which highlights contextual inadequacy as a significant gap consistently observed in MT. Our findings strengthen the motivation for further work within fully contextual MT.</p>

We achieved accurate predictions for a range of affinity values associated with ligand-protein interactions on out-of-sample data in a zero-shot setting. Only the SMILES string of the ligand and the amino acid sequence of the protein were used as the model inputs. Our results demonstrate a clear improvement over machine learning (ML) and free-energy perturbation (FEP+) based methods in accurately predicting a range of ligand-protein interaction affinities, which can be leveraged to further accelerate drug discovery campaigns against challenging therapeutic targets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown tremendous promise in serving as the backbone to agentic systems, as demonstrated by their performance in multi-faceted, challenging benchmarks like SWE-Bench and Agent-Bench. However, to realize the true potential of LLMs as autonomous agents, they must learn to identify, call, and interact with external tools and application program interfaces (APIs) to complete complex tasks. These tasks together are termed function calling. Endowing LLMs with function calling abilities leads to a myriad of advantages, such as access to current and domain-specific information in databases and knowledge sources, and the ability to outsource tasks that can be reliably performed by tools, e.g., a Python interpreter or calculator. While there has been significant progress in function calling with LLMs, there is still a dearth of open models that perform on par with proprietary LLMs like GPT, Claude, and Gemini. Therefore, in this work, we introduce the GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING model under an Apache 2.0 license. The model is trained using a multi-task training approach on seven fundamental tasks encompassed in function calling, those being Nested Function Calling, Function Chaining, Parallel Functions, Function Name Detection, Parameter-Value Pair Detection, Next-Best Function, and Response Generation. We present a comprehensive evaluation on multiple out-of-domain datasets comparing GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING to more than 15 other best proprietary and open models. GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING provides the best performance among all open models on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard and fourth overall. As a result of the diverse tasks and datasets used for training our model, we show that GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING has better generalizability on multiple tasks in seven different evaluation datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaydeep Borkar, David A. Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: Historical documents frequently suffer from damage and inconsistencies, including missing or illegible text resulting from issues such as holes, ink problems, and storage damage. These missing portions or gaps are referred to as lacunae. In this study, we employ transformer-based optical character recognition (OCR) models trained on synthetic data containing lacunae in a supervised manner. We demonstrate their effectiveness in detecting and restoring lacunae, achieving a success rate of 65%, compared to a base model lacking knowledge of lacunae, which achieves only 5% restoration. Additionally, we investigate the mechanistic properties of the model, such as the log probability of transcription, which can identify lacunae and other errors (e.g., mistranscriptions due to complex writing or ink issues) in line images without directly inspecting the image. This capability could be valuable for scholars seeking to distinguish images containing lacunae or errors from clean ones. Although we explore the potential of attention mechanisms in flagging lacunae and transcription errors, our findings suggest it is not a significant factor. Our work highlights a promising direction in utilizing transformer-based OCR models for restoring or analyzing damaged historical documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruochen Wang, Sohyun An, Minhao Cheng, Tianyi Zhou, Sung Ju Hwang, Cho-Jui Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities to novel tasks when prompted with language instructions and in-context demos. Since this ability sensitively depends on the quality of prompts, various methods have been explored to automate the instruction design. While these methods demonstrated promising results, they also restricted the searched prompt to one instruction. Such simplification significantly limits their capacity, as a single demo-free instruction might not be able to cover the entire complex problem space of the targeted task. To alleviate this issue, we adopt the Mixture-of-Expert paradigm and divide the problem space into a set of sub-regions; Each sub-region is governed by a specialized expert, equipped with both an instruction and a set of demos. A two-phase process is developed to construct the specialized expert for each region: (1) demo assignment: Inspired by the theoretical connection between in-context learning and kernel regression, we group demos into experts based on their semantic similarity; (2) instruction assignment: A region-based joint search of an instruction per expert complements the demos assigned to it, yielding a synergistic effect. The resulting method, codenamed Mixture-of-Prompts (MoP), achieves an average win rate of 81% against prior arts across several major benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The "arms race" of Large Language Models (LLMs) demands novel, challenging, and diverse benchmarks to faithfully examine their progresses. We introduce GraphArena, a benchmarking tool designed to evaluate LLMs on graph computational problems using million-scale real-world graphs from diverse scenarios such as knowledge graphs, social networks, and molecular structures. GraphArena offers a suite of 10 computational tasks, encompassing four polynomial-time (e.g., Shortest Distance) and six NP-complete challenges (e.g., Travelling Salesman Problem). It features a rigorous evaluation framework that classifies LLM outputs as correct, suboptimal (feasible but not optimal), or hallucinatory (properly formatted but infeasible). Evaluation of 10 leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B-Instruct, reveals that even top-performing models struggle with larger, more complex graph problems and exhibit hallucination issues. Despite the application of strategies such as chain-of-thought prompting, these issues remain unresolved. GraphArena contributes a valuable supplement to the existing LLM benchmarks and is open-sourced at https://github.com/squareRoot3/GraphArena.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akila Peiris, Nisansa de Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Manual data annotation is an important NLP task but one that takes considerable amount of resources and effort. In spite of the costs, labeling and categorizing entities is essential for NLP tasks such as semantic evaluation. Even though annotation can be done by non-experts in most cases, due to the fact that this requires human labor, the process is costly. Another major challenge encountered in data annotation is maintaining the annotation consistency. Annotation efforts are typically carried out by teams of multiple annotators. The annotations need to maintain the consistency in relation to both the domain truth and annotation format while reducing human errors. Annotating a specialized domain that deviates significantly from the general domain, such as fantasy literature, will see a lot of human error and annotator disagreement. So it is vital that proper guidelines and error reduction mechanisms are enforced. One such way to enforce these constraints is using a specialized application. Such an app can ensure that the notations are consistent, and the labels can be pre-defined or restricted reducing the room for errors. In this paper, we present SHADE, an annotation software that can be used to annotate entities in the high fantasy literature domain. Specifically in Dungeons and Dragons lore extracted from the Forgotten Realms Fandom Wiki.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit impressive cross-modal understanding and reasoning abilities, often assessed through multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that include an image, a question, and several options. However, many benchmarks used for such evaluations suffer from systematic biases. Remarkably, Large Language Models (LLMs) without any visual perception capabilities achieve non-trivial performance, undermining the credibility of these evaluations. To address this issue while maintaining the efficiency of MCQ evaluations, we propose MMEvalPro, a benchmark designed to avoid Type-I errors through a trilogy evaluation pipeline and more rigorous metrics. For each original question from existing benchmarks, human annotators augment it by creating one perception question and one knowledge anchor question through a meticulous annotation process. MMEvalPro comprises $2,138$ question triplets, totaling $6,414$ distinct questions. Two-thirds of these questions are manually labeled by human experts, while the rest are sourced from existing benchmarks (MMMU, ScienceQA, and MathVista). Compared with the existing benchmarks, our experiments with the latest LLMs and LMMs demonstrate that MMEvalPro is more challenging (the best LMM lags behind human performance by $31.73\%$, compared to an average gap of $8.03\%$ in previous benchmarks) and more trustworthy (the best LLM trails the best LMM by $23.09\%$, whereas the gap for previous benchmarks is just $14.64\%$). Our in-depth analysis explains the reason for the large performance gap and justifies the trustworthiness of evaluation, underscoring its significant potential for advancing future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Though advanced in understanding visual information with human languages, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from multimodal hallucinations. A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Zhang, Dian Yu, Baolin Peng, Linfeng Song, Ye Tian, Mingyue Huo, Nan Jiang, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved great success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Prevalent RLHF approaches are reward-based, following the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which may not fully capture the complexity of human preferences. In this paper, we explore RLHF under a general preference framework and approach it from a game-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a two-player game and propose a novel algorithm, iterative Nash policy optimization (INPO). The key idea is to let the policy play against itself via no-regret learning, thereby approximating the Nash policy. Unlike previous methods, INPO bypasses the need for estimating the expected win rate for individual responses, which typically incurs high computational or annotation costs. Instead, we introduce a new loss objective that is directly minimized over a preference dataset. We provide theoretical analysis for our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on various representative benchmarks. With an LLaMA-3-8B-based SFT model, INPO achieves a 41.5% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a 38.3% win rate on Arena-Hard, showing substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art iterative algorithm [Dong et al., 2024] under the BT model assumption. Additionally, our ablation study highlights the benefits of incorporating KL regularization for response length control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual navigation tasks are critical for household service robots. As these tasks become increasingly complex, effective communication and collaboration among multiple robots become imperative to ensure successful completion. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable comprehension and planning abilities in the context of embodied agents. However, their application in household scenarios, specifically in the use of multiple agents collaborating to complete complex navigation tasks through communication, remains unexplored. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for decentralized multi-agent navigation, leveraging LLM-enabled communication and collaboration. By designing the communication-triggered dynamic leadership organization structure, we achieve faster team consensus with fewer communication instances, leading to better navigation effectiveness and collaborative exploration efficiency. With the proposed novel communication scheme, our framework promises to be conflict-free and robust in multi-object navigation tasks, even when there is a surge in team size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Wu, Jiaxing Liu, Longbiao Wang, Dongxiao He, Xiaobao Wang, Jianwu Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is a popular task in natural language processing, which aims to recognize the emotional state of the speaker in conversations. While current research primarily emphasizes contextual modeling, there exists a dearth of investigation into effective multimodal fusion methods. We propose a novel framework called AIMDiT to solve the problem of multimodal fusion of deep features. Specifically, we design a Modality Augmentation Network which performs rich representation learning through dimension transformation of different modalities and parameter-efficient inception block. On the other hand, the Modality Interaction Network performs interaction fusion of extracted inter-modal features and intra-modal features. Experiments conducted using our AIMDiT framework on the public benchmark dataset MELD reveal 2.34% and 2.87% improvements in terms of the Acc-7 and w-F1 metrics compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aliyah R. Hsu, Yeshwanth Cherapanamjeri, Anobel Y. Odisho, Peter R. Carroll, Bin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers exhibit impressive capabilities but are often regarded as black boxes due to challenges in understanding the complex nonlinear relationships between features. Interpreting machine learning models is of paramount importance to mitigate risks, and mechanistic interpretability is in particular of current interest as it opens up a window for guiding manual modifications and reverse-engineering solutions. In this work, we introduce contextual decomposition for transformers (CD-T), extending a prior work on CD for RNNs and CNNs, to address mechanistic interpretation computationally efficiently. CD-T is a flexible interpretation method for transformers. It can capture contributions of combinations of input features or source internal components (e.g. attention heads, feed-forward networks) to (1) final predictions or (2) the output of any target internal component. Using CD-T, we propose a novel algorithm for circuit discovery. On a real-world pathology report classification task: we show CD-T distills a more faithful circuit of attention heads with improved computational efficiency (speed up 2x) than a prior benchmark, path patching. As a versatile interpretation method, CD-T also exhibits exceptional capabilities for local interpretations. CD-T is shown to reliably find words and phrases of contrasting sentiment/topic on SST-2 and AGNews datasets. Through human experiments, we demonstrate CD-T enables users to identify the more accurate of two models and to better trust a model's outputs compared to alternative interpretation methods such as SHAP and LIME.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Xu, Fei Wang, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of Large Language models (LLMs), multimodal LLMs with additional visual modality are also exhibited with similar ICL abilities when multiple image-text pairs are provided as demonstrations. However, relatively less work has been done to investigate the principles behind how and why multimodal ICL works. We conduct a systematic and principled evaluation of multimodal ICL for models of different scales on a broad spectrum of new yet critical tasks. Through perturbations over different modality information, we show that modalities matter differently across tasks in multimodal ICL. Considering such modality impact, we further utilize modality-driven demonstration strategies to boost ICL performance. We also identify that demonstration selection is closely related to the models' ability to capture task inductive biases from multimodal ICL. Our principled analysis provides a comprehensive way of understanding the role of demonstrations in multimodal in-context learning, and sheds light on effectively improving multimodal ICL on a wide range of tasks even if those tasks are not seen in or even contradict pretraining data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songwei Liu, Chao Zeng, Lianqiang Li, Chenqian Yan, Lean Fu, Xing Mei, Fangmin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The demand for deploying large language models(LLMs) on mobile devices continues to increase, driven by escalating data security concerns and cloud costs. However, network bandwidth and memory limitations pose challenges for deploying billion-level models on mobile devices. In this study, we investigate the outputs of different layers across various scales of LLMs and found that the outputs of most layers exhibit significant similarity. Moreover, this similarity becomes more pronounced as the model size increases, indicating substantial redundancy in the depth direction of the LLMs. Based on this observation, we propose an efficient model volume compression strategy, termed FoldGPT, which combines block removal and block parameter sharing.This strategy consists of three parts: (1) Based on the learnable gating parameters, we determine the block importance ranking while modeling the coupling effect between blocks. Then we delete some redundant layers based on the given removal rate. (2) For the retained blocks, we apply a specially designed group parameter sharing strategy, where blocks within the same group share identical weights, significantly compressing the number of parameters and slightly reducing latency overhead. (3) After sharing these Blocks, we "cure" the mismatch caused by sparsity with a minor amount of fine-tuning and introduce a tail-layer distillation strategy to improve the performance. Experiments demonstrate that FoldGPT outperforms previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods in efficient model compression, demonstrating the feasibility of achieving model lightweighting through straightforward block removal and parameter sharing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Chen, Yuge Zhang, Jiahang Xu, Kan Ren, Yuqing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Translating natural language to visualization (NL2VIS) has shown great promise for visual data analysis, but it remains a challenging task that requires multiple low-level implementations, such as natural language processing and visualization design. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are opening new avenues for generating visualizations from natural language. However, the lack of a comprehensive and reliable benchmark hinders our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in visualization generation. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a new NL2VIS benchmark called VisEval. Firstly, we introduce a high-quality and large-scale dataset. This dataset includes 2,524 representative queries covering 146 databases, paired with accurately labeled ground truths. Secondly, we advocate for a comprehensive automated evaluation methodology covering multiple dimensions, including validity, legality, and readability. By systematically scanning for potential issues with a number of heterogeneous checkers, VisEval provides reliable and trustworthy evaluation outcomes. We run VisEval on a series of state-of-the-art LLMs. Our evaluation reveals prevalent challenges and delivers essential insights for future advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihan Deng, Weikai Xu, Hongda Sun, Wei Liu, Tao Tan, Jianfeng Liu, Ang Li, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Rui Yan, Shuo Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the remarkable advancements of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have become a research hotspot in human-computer interaction. However, there is a scarcity of benchmarks available for LLM-based mobile agents. Benchmarking these agents generally faces three main challenges: (1) The inefficiency of UI-only operations imposes limitations to task evaluation. (2) Specific instructions within a singular application lack adequacy for assessing the multi-dimensional reasoning and decision-making capacities of LLM mobile agents. (3) Current evaluation metrics are insufficient to accurately assess the process of sequential actions. To this end, we propose Mobile-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLM-based mobile agents. First, we expand conventional UI operations by incorporating 103 collected APIs to accelerate the efficiency of task completion. Subsequently, we collect evaluation data by combining real user queries with augmentation from LLMs. To better evaluate different levels of planning capabilities for mobile agents, our data is categorized into three distinct groups: SAST, SAMT, and MAMT, reflecting varying levels of task complexity. Mobile-Bench comprises 832 data entries, with more than 200 tasks specifically designed to evaluate multi-APP collaboration scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a more accurate evaluation metric, named CheckPoint, to assess whether LLM-based mobile agents reach essential points during their planning and reasoning steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changde Du, Kaicheng Fu, Bincheng Wen, Yi Sun, Jie Peng, Wei Wei, Ying Gao, Shengpei Wang, Chuncheng Zhang, Jinpeng Li, Shuang Qiu, Le Chang, Huiguang He</p>
<p>Abstract: The conceptualization and categorization of natural objects in the human mind have long intrigued cognitive scientists and neuroscientists, offering crucial insights into human perception and cognition. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised the attractive question of whether these models can also develop human-like object representations through exposure to vast amounts of linguistic and multimodal data. In this study, we combined behavioral and neuroimaging analysis methods to uncover how the object concept representations in LLMs correlate with those of humans. By collecting large-scale datasets of 4.7 million triplet judgments from LLM and Multimodal LLM (MLLM), we were able to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the underlying similarity structure of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting 66-dimensional embeddings were found to be highly stable and predictive, and exhibited semantic clustering akin to human mental representations. Interestingly, the interpretability of the dimensions underlying these embeddings suggests that LLM and MLLM have developed human-like conceptual representations of natural objects. Further analysis demonstrated strong alignment between the identified model embeddings and neural activity patterns in many functionally defined brain ROIs (e.g., EBA, PPA, RSC and FFA). This provides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, while not identical to those in the human, share fundamental commonalities that reflect key schemas of human conceptual knowledge. This study advances our understanding of machine intelligence and informs the development of more human-like artificial cognitive systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the rapid development of Chinese vision-language models (VLMs), most existing Chinese vision-language (VL) datasets are constructed on Western-centric images from existing English VL datasets. The cultural bias in the images makes these datasets unsuitable for evaluating VLMs in Chinese culture. To remedy this issue, we present a new Chinese Vision- Language Understanding Evaluation (CVLUE) benchmark dataset, where the selection of object categories and images is entirely driven by Chinese native speakers, ensuring that the source images are representative of Chinese culture. The benchmark contains four distinct VL tasks ranging from image-text retrieval to visual question answering, visual grounding and visual dialogue. We present a detailed statistical analysis of CVLUE and provide a baseline performance analysis with several open-source multilingual VLMs on CVLUE and its English counterparts to reveal their performance gap between English and Chinese. Our in-depth category-level analysis reveals a lack of Chinese cultural knowledge in existing VLMs. We also find that fine-tuning on Chinese culture-related VL datasets effectively enhances VLMs' understanding of Chinese culture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaeke Salman, Md Montasir Bin Shams, Xiuwen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing a shared embedding space, emerging multimodal models exhibit unprecedented zero-shot capabilities. However, the shared embedding space could lead to new vulnerabilities if different modalities can be misaligned. In this paper, we extend and utilize a recently developed effective gradient-based procedure that allows us to match the embedding of a given text by minimally modifying an image. Using the procedure, we show that we can align the embeddings of distinguishable texts to any image through unnoticeable adversarial attacks in joint image-text models, revealing that semantically unrelated images can have embeddings of identical texts and at the same time visually indistinguishable images can be matched to the embeddings of very different texts. Our technique achieves 100\% success rate when it is applied to text datasets and images from multiple sources. Without overcoming the vulnerability, multimodal models cannot robustly align inputs from different modalities in a semantically meaningful way. \textbf{Warning: the text data used in this paper are toxic in nature and may be offensive to some readers.}</p>

<p>Abstract: End of semester student evaluations of teaching are the dominant mechanism for providing feedback to academics on their teaching practice. For large classes, however, the volume of feedback makes these tools impractical for this purpose. This paper explores the use of open-source generative AI to synthesise factual, actionable and appropriate summaries of student feedback from these survey responses. In our setup, we have 742 student responses ranging over 75 courses in a Computer Science department. For each course, we synthesise a summary of the course evaluations and actionable items for the instructor. Our results reveal a promising avenue for enhancing teaching practices in the classroom setting. Our contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility of using generative AI to produce insightful feedback for teachers, thus providing a cost-effective means to support educators' development. Overall, our work highlights the possibility of using generative AI to produce factual, actionable, and appropriate feedback for teachers in the classroom setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual mathematical reasoning, as a fundamental visual reasoning ability, has received widespread attention from the Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) community. Existing benchmarks, such as MathVista and MathVerse, focus more on the result-oriented performance but neglect the underlying principles in knowledge acquisition and generalization. Inspired by human-like mathematical reasoning, we introduce WE-MATH, the first benchmark specifically designed to explore the problem-solving principles beyond end-to-end performance. We meticulously collect and categorize 6.5K visual math problems, spanning 67 hierarchical knowledge concepts and five layers of knowledge granularity. We decompose composite problems into sub-problems according to the required knowledge concepts and introduce a novel four-dimensional metric, namely Insufficient Knowledge (IK), Inadequate Generalization (IG), Complete Mastery (CM), and Rote Memorization (RM), to hierarchically assess inherent issues in LMMs' reasoning process. With WE-MATH, we conduct a thorough evaluation of existing LMMs in visual mathematical reasoning and reveal a negative correlation between solving steps and problem-specific performance. We confirm the IK issue of LMMs can be effectively improved via knowledge augmentation strategies. More notably, the primary challenge of GPT-4o has significantly transitioned from IK to IG, establishing it as the first LMM advancing towards the knowledge generalization stage. In contrast, other LMMs exhibit a marked inclination towards Rote Memorization - they correctly solve composite problems involving multiple knowledge concepts yet fail to answer sub-problems. We anticipate that WE-MATH will open new pathways for advancements in visual mathematical reasoning for LMMs. The WE-MATH data and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/We-Math/We-Math.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancements in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) methods, based on large-scale models, have demonstrated high fidelity in reproducing speaker characteristics. However, these models are too large for practical daily use. We propose a lightweight zero-shot TTS method using a mixture of adapters (MoA).

These modules enhance the ability to adapt a wide variety of speakers in a zero-shot manner by selecting appropriate adapters associated with speaker characteristics on the basis of speaker embeddings. Our method achieves high-quality speech synthesis with minimal additional parameters. Through objective and subjective evaluations, we confirmed that our method achieves better performance than the baseline with less than 40\% of parameters at 1.9 times faster inference speed.

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained foundation models, such as the 175B GPT-3, has attracted more attention for downstream tasks recently. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have been proposed and proven effective without retraining all model parameters, their performance is limited by the capacity of incremental modules, especially under constrained parameter budgets. \\ To overcome this challenge, we propose CapaBoost, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances model capacity by leveraging low-rank updates through parallel weight modules in target layers. By applying static random masks to the shared weight matrix, CapaBoost constructs a diverse set of weight matrices, effectively increasing the rank of incremental weights without adding parameters. Notably, our approach can be seamlessly integrated into various existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. We extensively validate the efficacy of CapaBoost through experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including natural language understanding, question answering, and image classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, without incurring additional computation or storage costs. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/LINs-lab/CapaBoost}.</p>

While modern document retrieval systems exhibit strong performance on query-to-text matching, they struggle to exploit visual cues efficiently, hindering their performance on practical document retrieval applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation. To benchmark current systems on visually rich document retrieval, we introduce the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark ViDoRe, composed of various page-level retrieving tasks spanning multiple domains, languages, and settings. The inherent shortcomings of modern systems motivate the introduction of a new retrieval model architecture, ColPali, which leverages the document understanding capabilities of recent Vision Language Models to produce high-quality contextualized embeddings solely from images of document pages. Combined with a late interaction matching mechanism, ColPali largely outperforms modern document retrieval pipelines while being drastically faster and end-to-end trainable.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by language models (LMs) have demonstrated promise in their ability to perform decision-making tasks such as web automation. However, a key limitation remains: LMs, primarily optimized for natural language understanding and generation, struggle with multi-step reasoning, planning, and using environmental feedback when attempting to solve realistic computer tasks. Towards addressing this, we propose an inference-time search algorithm for LM agents to explicitly perform exploration and multi-step planning in interactive web environments. Our approach is a form of best-first tree search that operates within the actual environment space, and is complementary with most existing state-of-the-art agents. It is the first tree search algorithm for LM agents that shows effectiveness on realistic web tasks. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, applying our search algorithm on top of a GPT-4o agent yields a 39.7% relative increase in success rate compared to the same baseline without search, setting a state-of-the-art success rate of 26.4%. On WebArena, search also yields a 28.0% relative improvement over a baseline agent, setting a competitive success rate of 19.2%. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of search for web agents, and we demonstrate that performance scales with increased test-time compute. We conduct a thorough analysis of our results to highlight improvements from search, limitations, and promising directions for future work.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the automation of software development tasks, including code synthesis, program repair, and test generation. More recently, researchers and industry practitioners have developed various autonomous LLM agents to perform end-to-end software development tasks. These agents are equipped with the ability to use tools, run commands, observe feedback from the environment, and plan for future actions. However, the complexity of these agent-based approaches, together with the limited abilities of current LLMs, raises the following question: Do we really have to employ complex autonomous software agents? To attempt to answer this question, we build Agentless -- an agentless approach to automatically solve software development problems. Compared to the verbose and complex setup of agent-based approaches, Agentless employs a simplistic two-phase process of localization followed by repair, without letting the LLM decide future actions or operate with complex tools. Our results on the popular SWE-bench Lite benchmark show that surprisingly the simplistic Agentless is able to achieve both the highest performance (27.33%) and lowest cost (\$0.34) compared with all existing open-source software agents! Furthermore, we manually classified the problems in SWE-bench Lite and found problems with exact ground truth patch or insufficient/misleading issue descriptions. As such, we construct SWE-bench Lite-S by excluding such problematic issues to perform more rigorous evaluation and comparison. Our work highlights the current overlooked potential of a simple, interpretable technique in autonomous software development. We hope Agentless will help reset the baseline, starting point, and horizon for autonomous software agents, and inspire future work along this crucial direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusu Qian, Hanrong Ye, Jean-Philippe Fauconnier, Peter Grasch, Yinfei Yang, Zhe Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MIA-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on their ability to strictly adhere to complex instructions. Our benchmark comprises a diverse set of 400 image-prompt pairs, each crafted to challenge the models' compliance with layered instructions in generating accurate responses that satisfy specific requested patterns. Evaluation results from a wide array of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant variations in performance, highlighting areas for improvement in instruction fidelity. Additionally, we create extra training data and explore supervised fine-tuning to enhance the models' ability to strictly follow instructions without compromising performance on other tasks. We hope this benchmark not only serves as a tool for measuring MLLM adherence to instructions, but also guides future developments in MLLM training methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding documents with rich layouts and multi-modal components is a long-standing and practical task. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly in single-page document understanding (DU). However, their abilities on long-context DU remain an open problem. This work presents MMLongBench-Doc, a long-context, multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,062 expert-annotated questions. Distinct from previous datasets, it is constructed upon 130 lengthy PDF-formatted documents with an average of 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens. Towards comprehensive evaluation, answers to these questions rely on pieces of evidence from (1) different sources (text, image, chart, table, and layout structure) and (2) various locations (i.e. page number). Moreover, 33.2% of the questions are cross-page questions requiring evidence across multiple pages. 22.8% of the questions are designed to be unanswerable for detecting potential hallucinations. Experiments on 14 LVLMs demonstrate that long-context DU greatly challenges current models. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an F1 score of only 42.7%, while the second-best, GPT-4V, scores 31.4%. Furthermore, 12 LVLMs (all except GPT-4o and GPT-4V) even present worse performance than their LLM counterparts which are fed with lossy-parsed OCR documents. These results validate the necessity of future research toward more capable long-context LVLMs. Project Page: https://mayubo2333.github.io/MMLongBench-Doc</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenming Zhu, Tai Wang, Wenwei Zhang, Kai Chen, Xihui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although great progress has been made in 3D visual grounding, current models still rely on explicit textual descriptions for grounding and lack the ability to reason human intentions from implicit instructions. We propose a new task called 3D reasoning grounding and introduce a new benchmark ScanReason which provides over 10K question-answer-location pairs from five reasoning types that require the synerization of reasoning and grounding. We further design our approach, ReGround3D, composed of the visual-centric reasoning module empowered by Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) and the 3D grounding module to obtain accurate object locations by looking back to the enhanced geometry and fine-grained details from the 3D scenes. A chain-of-grounding mechanism is proposed to further boost the performance with interleaved reasoning and grounding steps during inference. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> DongNyeong Heo, Heeyoul Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Back-translation (BT) is an effective semi-supervised learning framework in neural machine translation (NMT). A pre-trained NMT model translates monolingual sentences and makes synthetic bilingual sentence pairs for the training of the other NMT model, and vice versa. Understanding the two NMT models as inference and generation models, respectively, the training method of variational auto-encoder (VAE) was applied in previous works, which is a mainstream framework of generative models. However, the discrete property of translated sentences prevents gradient information from flowing between the two NMT models. In this paper, we propose the categorical reparameterization trick (CRT) that makes NMT models generate differentiable sentences so that the VAE's training framework can work in an end-to-end fashion. Our BT experiment conducted on a WMT benchmark dataset demonstrates the superiority of our proposed CRT compared to the Gumbel-softmax trick, which is a popular reparameterization method for categorical variable. Moreover, our experiments conducted on multiple WMT benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed end-to-end training framework is effective in terms of BLEU scores not only compared to its counterpart baseline which is not trained in an end-to-end fashion, but also compared to other previous BT works. The code is available at the web.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoyiran Li, Fangyu Liu, Nigel Collier, Anna Korhonen, Ivan Vuli\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Word translation or bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) is a key cross-lingual task, aiming to bridge the lexical gap between different languages. In this work, we propose a robust and effective two-stage contrastive learning framework for the BLI task. At Stage C1, we propose to refine standard cross-lingual linear maps between static word embeddings (WEs) via a contrastive learning objective; we also show how to integrate it into the self-learning procedure for even more refined cross-lingual maps. In Stage C2, we conduct BLI-oriented contrastive fine-tuning of mBERT, unlocking its word translation capability. We also show that static WEs induced from the `C2-tuned' mBERT complement static WEs from Stage C1. Comprehensive experiments on standard BLI datasets for diverse languages and different experimental setups demonstrate substantial gains achieved by our framework. While the BLI method from Stage C1 already yields substantial gains over all state-of-the-art BLI methods in our comparison, even stronger improvements are met with the full two-stage framework: e.g., we report gains for 112/112 BLI setups, spanning 28 language pairs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mai A. Shaaban, Mariam Kashkash, Maryam Alghfeli, Adham Ibrahim</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the main challenges in the field of deep learning is obtaining the optimal model hyperparameters. The search for optimal hyperparameters usually hinders the progress of solutions to real-world problems such as healthcare. Previous solutions have been proposed, but they can still get stuck in local optima. To overcome this hurdle, we propose OptBA to automatically fine-tune the hyperparameters of deep learning models by leveraging the Bees Algorithm, which is a recent promising swarm intelligence algorithm. In this paper, the optimization problem of OptBA is to maximize the accuracy in classifying ailments using medical text, where initial hyperparameters are iteratively adjusted by specific criteria. Experimental results demonstrate a noteworthy enhancement in accuracy with approximately 1.4%. This outcome highlights the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism in addressing the critical issue of hyperparameter optimization and its potential impact on advancing solutions for healthcare.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning methods for natural language processing (NLP) have created new business opportunities and made NLP research critical for industry development. As one of the big players in the field of NLP, together with governments and universities, it is important to track the influence of industry on research. In this study, we seek to quantify and characterize industry presence in the NLP community over time. Using a corpus with comprehensive metadata of 78,187 NLP publications and 701 resumes of NLP publication authors, we explore the industry presence in the field since the early 90s. We find that industry presence among NLP authors has been steady before a steep increase over the past five years (180% growth from 2017 to 2022). A few companies account for most of the publications and provide funding to academic researchers through grants and internships. Our study shows that the presence and impact of the industry on natural language processing research are significant and fast-growing. This work calls for increased transparency of industry influence in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takyoung Kim, Jamin Shin, Young-Ho Kim, Sanghwan Bae, Sungdong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Most task-oriented dialogue (TOD) benchmarks assume users that know exactly how to use the system by constraining the user behaviors within the system's capabilities via strict user goals, namely "user familiarity" bias. This data bias deepens when it combines with data-driven TOD systems, as it is impossible to fathom the effect of it with existing static evaluations. Hence, we conduct an interactive user study to unveil how vulnerable TOD systems are against realistic scenarios. In particular, we compare users with 1) detailed goal instructions that conform to the system boundaries (closed-goal) and 2) vague goal instructions that are often unsupported but realistic (open-goal). Our study reveals that conversations in open-goal settings lead to catastrophic failures of the system, in which 92% of the dialogues had significant issues. Moreover, we conduct a thorough analysis to identify distinctive features between the two settings through error annotation. From this, we discover a novel "pretending" behavior, in which the system pretends to handle the user requests even though they are beyond the system's capabilities. We discuss its characteristics and toxicity while showing recent large language models can also suffer from this behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: The unprecedented performance of large language models (LLMs) necessitates improvements in evaluations. Rather than merely exploring the breadth of LLM abilities, we believe meticulous and thoughtful designs are essential to thorough, unbiased, and applicable evaluations. Given the importance of world knowledge to LLMs, we construct a Knowledge-oriented LLM Assessment benchmark (KoLA), in which we carefully design three crucial factors: (1) For \textbf{ability modeling}, we mimic human cognition to form a four-level taxonomy of knowledge-related abilities, covering $19$ tasks. (2) For \textbf{data}, to ensure fair comparisons, we use both Wikipedia, a corpus prevalently pre-trained by LLMs, along with continuously collected emerging corpora, aiming to evaluate the capacity to handle unseen data and evolving knowledge. (3) For \textbf{evaluation criteria}, we adopt a contrastive system, including overall standard scores for better numerical comparability across tasks and models and a unique self-contrast metric for automatically evaluating knowledge-creating ability. We evaluate $28$ open-source and commercial LLMs and obtain some intriguing findings. The KoLA dataset and open-participation leaderboard are publicly released at https://kola.xlore.cn and will be continuously updated to provide references for developing LLMs and knowledge-related systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyan Zhou, Minda Hu, Junan Li, Xiaoying Zhang, Xixin Wu, Irwin King, Helen Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Making moral judgments is an essential step toward developing ethical AI systems. Prevalent approaches are mostly implemented in a bottom-up manner, which uses a large set of annotated data to train models based on crowd-sourced opinions about morality. These approaches have been criticized for overgeneralizing the moral stances of a limited group of annotators and lacking explainability. This work proposes a flexible top-down framework to steer (Large) Language Models (LMs) to perform moral reasoning with well-established moral theories from interdisciplinary research. The theory-guided top-down framework can incorporate various moral theories. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on datasets derived from moral theories. Furthermore, we show the alignment between different moral theories and existing morality datasets. Our analysis exhibits the potential and flaws in existing resources (models and datasets) in developing explainable moral judgment-making systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishakh Padmakumar, He He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge in collaborative writing with model assistance. As different users incorporate suggestions from the same model, there is a risk of decreased diversity in the produced content, potentially limiting diverse perspectives in public discourse. In this work, we measure the impact of co-writing on diversity via a controlled experiment, where users write argumentative essays in three setups -- using a base LLM (GPT3), a feedback-tuned LLM (InstructGPT), and writing without model help. We develop a set of diversity metrics and find that writing with InstructGPT (but not the GPT3) results in a statistically significant reduction in diversity. Specifically, it increases the similarity between the writings of different authors and reduces the overall lexical and content diversity. We additionally find that this effect is mainly attributable to InstructGPT contributing less diverse text to co-written essays. In contrast, the user-contributed text remains unaffected by model collaboration. This suggests that the recent improvement in generation quality from adapting models to human feedback might come at the cost of more homogeneous and less diverse content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Philip Wahle, Bela Gipp, Terry Ruas</p>
<p>Abstract: Current approaches in paraphrase generation and detection heavily rely on a single general similarity score, ignoring the intricate linguistic properties of language. This paper introduces two new tasks to address this shortcoming by considering paraphrase types - specific linguistic perturbations at particular text positions. We name these tasks Paraphrase Type Generation and Paraphrase Type Detection. Our results suggest that while current techniques perform well in a binary classification scenario, i.e., paraphrased or not, the inclusion of fine-grained paraphrase types poses a significant challenge. While most approaches are good at generating and detecting general semantic similar content, they fail to understand the intrinsic linguistic variables they manipulate. Models trained in generating and identifying paraphrase types also show improvements in tasks without them. In addition, scaling these models further improves their ability to understand paraphrase types. We believe paraphrase types can unlock a new paradigm for developing paraphrase models and solving tasks in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is poised to substantially influence the world. However, significant progress comes hand-in-hand with substantial risks. Addressing them requires broad engagement with various fields of study. Yet, little empirical work examines the state of such engagement (past or current). In this paper, we quantify the degree of influence between 23 fields of study and NLP (on each other). We analyzed ~77k NLP papers, ~3.1m citations from NLP papers to other papers, and ~1.8m citations from other papers to NLP papers. We show that, unlike most fields, the cross-field engagement of NLP, measured by our proposed Citation Field Diversity Index (CFDI), has declined from 0.58 in 1980 to 0.31 in 2022 (an all-time low). In addition, we find that NLP has grown more insular -- citing increasingly more NLP papers and having fewer papers that act as bridges between fields. NLP citations are dominated by computer science; Less than 8% of NLP citations are to linguistics, and less than 3% are to math and psychology. These findings underscore NLP's urgent need to reflect on its engagement with various fields.</p>

<p>Abstract: While current tasks of converting natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) using Foundation Models have shown impressive achievements, adapting these approaches for converting natural language to Graph Query Language (NL2GQL) encounters hurdles due to the distinct nature of GQL compared to SQL, alongside the diverse forms of GQL. Moving away from traditional rule-based and slot-filling methodologies, we introduce a novel approach, $R^3$-NL2GQL, integrating both small and large Foundation Models for ranking, rewriting, and refining tasks. This method leverages the interpretative strengths of smaller models for initial ranking and rewriting stages, while capitalizing on the superior generalization and query generation prowess of larger models for the final transformation of natural language queries into GQL formats. Addressing the scarcity of datasets in this emerging field, we have developed a bilingual dataset, sourced from graph database manuals and selected open-source Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Our evaluation of this methodology on this dataset demonstrates its promising efficacy and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tal Schuster, Adam D. Lelkes, Haitian Sun, Jai Gupta, Jonathan Berant, William W. Cohen, Donald Metzler</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently proposed long-form question answering (QA) systems, supported by large language models (LLMs), have shown promising capabilities. Yet, attributing and verifying their generated abstractive answers can be difficult, and automatically evaluating their accuracy remains an ongoing challenge.
  In this work, we introduce a new QA task for answering multi-answer questions by summarizing multiple diverse sources in a semi-extractive fashion. Specifically, Semi-extractive Multi-source QA (SEMQA) requires models to output a comprehensive answer, while mixing factual quoted spans -- copied verbatim from given input sources -- and non-factual free-text connectors that glue these spans together into a single cohesive passage. This setting bridges the gap between the outputs of well-grounded but constrained extractive QA systems and more fluent but harder to attribute fully abstractive answers. Particularly, it enables a new mode for language models that leverages their advanced language generation capabilities, while also producing fine in-line attributions by-design that are easy to verify, interpret, and evaluate.
  To study this task, we create the first dataset of this kind, QuoteSum, with human-written semi-extractive answers to natural and generated questions, and define text-based evaluation metrics. Experimenting with several LLMs in various settings, we find this task to be surprisingly challenging, demonstrating the importance of QuoteSum for developing and studying such consolidation capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Druart (LIA), Valentin Vielzeuf (LIA), Yannick Est\`eve (LIA)</p>
<p>Abstract: In Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems, correctly updating the system's understanding of the user's requests (\textit{a.k.a} dialogue state tracking) is key to a smooth interaction. Traditionally, TOD systems perform this update in three steps: transcription of the user's utterance, semantic extraction of the key concepts, and contextualization with the previously identified concepts. Such cascade approaches suffer from cascading errors and separate optimization. End-to-End approaches have been proven helpful up to the turn-level semantic extraction step. This paper goes one step further and provides (1) a novel approach for completely neural spoken DST, (2) an in depth comparison with a state of the art cascade approach and (3) avenues towards better context propagation. Our study highlights that jointly-optimized approaches are also competitive for contextually dependent tasks, such as Dialogue State Tracking (DST), especially in audio native settings. Context propagation in DST systems could benefit from training procedures accounting for the previous' context inherent uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangqing Tu, Yuliang Sun, Yushi Bai, Jifan Yu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: To mitigate the potential misuse of large language models (LLMs), recent research has developed watermarking algorithms, which restrict the generation process to leave an invisible trace for watermark detection. Due to the two-stage nature of the task, most studies evaluate the generation and detection separately, thereby presenting a challenge in unbiased, thorough, and applicable evaluations. In this paper, we introduce WaterBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for LLM watermarks, in which we design three crucial factors: (1) For benchmarking procedure, to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison, we first adjust each watermarking method's hyper-parameter to reach the same watermarking strength, then jointly evaluate their generation and detection performance. (2) For task selection, we diversify the input and output length to form a five-category taxonomy, covering $9$ tasks. (3) For evaluation metric, we adopt the GPT4-Judge for automatically evaluating the decline of instruction-following abilities after watermarking. We evaluate $4$ open-source watermarks on $2$ LLMs under $2$ watermarking strengths and observe the common struggles for current methods on maintaining the generation quality.

<p>Abstract: Language models can solve complex reasoning tasks better by learning to generate rationales for their predictions. Often these models know how to solve a task but their auto-regressive decoding nature leads to incorrect results if they start incorrectly. We observe that smaller models in particular when corrected, can solve a task that they would have otherwise struggled with. We demonstrate this phenomenon by using a larger model to guide smaller models, which leads to significantly improved performance (up to +24 points on the GSM8K dataset by 7B models). To assist smaller models in initiating the starting step, we propose QuestCoT, where a smaller model first asks itself how to start, before proceeding with a chain of reasoning. On various multistep mathematical reasoning datasets over multiple smaller models, we show that getting the right start can lead to significant performance gains across all models (gains of up to +6 points on GSM8K, +9 on SVAMP, +5 on ASDiv, and +7 on MultiArith).</p>

<p>Abstract: Comparative reasoning plays a crucial role in text preference prediction; however, large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies in their reasoning. While approaches like Chain-of-Thought improve accuracy in many other settings, they struggle to consistently distinguish the similarities and differences of complex texts. We introduce SC, a prompting approach that predicts text preferences by generating structured intermediate comparisons. SC begins by proposing aspects of comparison, followed by generating textual comparisons under each aspect. We select consistent comparisons with a pairwise consistency comparator that ensures each aspect's comparisons clearly distinguish differences between texts, significantly reducing hallucination and improving consistency. Our comprehensive evaluations across various NLP tasks, including summarization, retrieval, and automatic rating, demonstrate that SC equips LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance in text preference prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guizhen Chen, Liying Cheng, Luu Anh Tuan, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational argumentation has become an essential tool in various domains, including law, public policy, and artificial intelligence. It is an emerging research field in natural language processing that attracts increasing attention. Research on computational argumentation mainly involves two types of tasks: argument mining and argument generation. As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding context and generating natural language, it is worthwhile to evaluate the performance of LLMs on diverse computational argumentation tasks. This work aims to embark on an assessment of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Flan models, and LLaMA2 models, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. We organize existing tasks into six main categories and standardize the format of fourteen openly available datasets. In addition, we present a new benchmark dataset on counter speech generation that aims to holistically evaluate the end-to-end performance of LLMs on argument mining and argument generation. Extensive experiments show that LLMs exhibit commendable performance across most of the datasets, demonstrating their capabilities in the field of argumentation. Our analysis offers valuable suggestions for evaluating computational argumentation and its integration with LLMs in future research endeavors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunji Lee, Sejune Joo, Chaeeun Kim, Joel Jang, Doyoung Kim, Kyoung-Woon On, Minjoon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: To reduce issues like hallucinations and lack of control in Large Language Models (LLMs), a common method is to generate responses by grounding on external contexts given as input, known as knowledge-augmented models. However, previous research often narrowly defines "grounding" as just having the correct answer, which does not ensure the reliability of the entire response. To overcome this, we propose a stricter definition of grounding: a model is truly grounded if it (1) fully utilizes the necessary knowledge from the provided context, and (2) stays within the limits of that knowledge. We introduce a new dataset and a grounding metric to evaluate model capability under the definition. We perform experiments across 25 LLMs of different sizes and training methods and provide insights into factors that influence grounding performance. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how to improve grounding capabilities and suggest an area of improvement toward more reliable and controllable LLM applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Guo, Philip Greengard, Eric P. Xing, Yoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a simple approach for memory-efficient adaptation of pretrained language models. Our approach uses an iterative algorithm to decompose each pretrained matrix into a high-precision low-rank component and a memory-efficient quantized component. During finetuning, the quantized component remains fixed and only the low-rank component is updated. We present an integer linear programming formulation of the quantization component which enables dynamic configuration of quantization parameters (e.g., bit-width, block size) for each matrix given an overall target memory budget. We further explore a data-aware version of the algorithm which uses an approximation of the Fisher information matrix to weight the reconstruction objective during matrix decomposition. Experiments on finetuning RoBERTa and LLaMA-2 (7B and 70B) demonstrate that our low-rank plus quantized matrix decomposition approach (LQ-LoRA) outperforms strong QLoRA and GPTQ-LoRA baselines and enables aggressive quantization to sub-3 bits with only minor performance degradations. When finetuned on a language modeling calibration dataset, LQ-LoRA can also be used for model compression; in this setting our 2.75-bit LLaMA-2-70B model (which has 2.85 bits on average when including the low-rank components and requires 27GB of GPU memory) performs respectably compared to the 16-bit baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various tasks, there remains a linguistic bias that favors high-resource languages, such as English, often at the expense of low-resource and regional languages. To address this imbalance, we introduce SeaLLMs, an innovative series of language models that specifically focuses on Southeast Asian (SEA) languages. SeaLLMs are built upon the Llama-2 model and further advanced through continued pre-training with an extended vocabulary, specialized instruction and alignment tuning to better capture the intricacies of regional languages. This allows them to respect and reflect local cultural norms, customs, stylistic preferences, and legal considerations. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SeaLLM-13b models exhibit superior performance across a wide spectrum of linguistic tasks and assistant-style instruction-following capabilities relative to comparable open-source models. Moreover, they outperform ChatGPT-3.5 in non-Latin languages, such as Thai, Khmer, Lao, and Burmese, by large margins while remaining lightweight and cost-effective to operate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Logical reasoning is central to complex human activities, such as thinking, debating, and planning; it is also a central component of many AI systems as well. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which encoder-only transformer language models (LMs) can reason according to logical rules. We ask whether those LMs can deduce theorems in propositional calculus and first-order logic; if their relative success in these problems reflects general logical capabilities; and which layers contribute the most to the task. First, we show for several encoder-only LMs that they can be trained, to a reasonable degree, to determine logical validity on various datasets. Next, by cross-probing fine-tuned models on these datasets, we show that LMs have difficulty in transferring their putative logical reasoning ability, which suggests that they may have learned dataset-specific features, instead of a general capability. Finally, we conduct a layerwise probing experiment, which shows that the hypothesis classification task is mostly solved through higher layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyin Zhu, Prayag Tiwari</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate change poses grave challenges, demanding widespread understanding and low-carbon lifestyle awareness. Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful tool to address this crisis, yet comprehensive evaluations of their climate-crisis knowledge are lacking. This paper proposes an automated evaluation framework to assess climate-crisis knowledge within LLMs. We adopt a hybrid approach for data acquisition, combining data synthesis and manual collection, to compile a diverse set of questions encompassing various aspects of climate change. Utilizing prompt engineering based on the compiled questions, we evaluate the model's knowledge by analyzing its generated answers. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive set of metrics to assess climate-crisis knowledge, encompassing indicators from 10 distinct perspectives. These metrics provide a multifaceted evaluation, enabling a nuanced understanding of the LLMs' climate crisis comprehension. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. In our evaluation utilizing diverse high-performing LLMs, we discovered that while LLMs possess considerable climate-related knowledge, there are shortcomings in terms of timeliness, indicating a need for continuous updating and refinement of their climate-related content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongkun Liu, Zheng Chen, Mengqi Zhang, Zhaochun Ren, Pengjie Ren, Zhumin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning has been demonstrated to be an effective method to improve the domain performance of large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs might fit the dataset bias and shortcuts for prediction, leading to poor generation performance. Previous works have proven that LLMs are prone to exhibit position bias, i.e., leveraging information positioned at the beginning or end, or specific positional cues within the input. Existing debiasing methods for LLMs require external bias knowledge or annotated non-biased samples, which is lacking for position debiasing and impractical in reality. In this work, we propose a self-supervised position debiasing (SOD) framework to mitigate position bias for LLMs. SOD leverages unsupervised responses from pre-trained LLMs for debiasing without relying on any external knowledge. To improve the quality of unsupervised responses, we propose an objective alignment (OAM) module to prune these responses. Experiments on eight datasets and five tasks show that SOD consistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating three types of position biases. Besides, SOD achieves this by sacrificing only a small performance on biased samples, which is general and effective. To facilitate the reproducibility of the results, we share the code of all methods and datasets on https://github.com/LZKSKY/SOD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Zhu, Shujian Huang, Fei Yuan, Shuaijie She, Jiajun Chen, Alexandra Birch</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models show compelling performance on reasoning tasks but they tend to perform much worse in languages other than English. This is unsurprising given that their training data largely consists of English text and instructions. A typical solution is to translate instruction data into all languages of interest, and then train on the resulting multilingual data, which is called translate-training. This approach not only incurs high cost, but also results in poorly translated data due to the non-standard formatting of mathematical chain-of-thought. In this paper, we explore the benefits of question alignment, where we train the model to translate reasoning questions into English by finetuning on X-English parallel question data. In this way we perform targeted, in-domain language alignment which makes best use of English instruction data to unlock the LLMs' multilingual reasoning abilities. Experimental results on LLaMA2-13B show that question alignment leads to consistent improvements over the translate-training approach: an average improvement of 11.3% and 16.1% accuracy across ten languages on the MGSM and MSVAMP multilingual reasoning benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Detecting text generated by modern large language models is thought to be hard, as both LLMs and humans can exhibit a wide range of complex behaviors. However, we find that a score based on contrasting two closely related language models is highly accurate at separating human-generated and machine-generated text. Based on this mechanism, we propose a novel LLM detector that only requires simple calculations using a pair of pre-trained LLMs. The method, called Binoculars, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without any training data. It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively evaluate Binoculars on a number of text sources and in varied situations. Over a wide range of document types, Binoculars detects over 90% of generated samples from ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01%, despite not being trained on any ChatGPT data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongxia Li, Ishani Mondal, Yijun Liang, Huy Nghiem, Jordan Boyd-Graber</p>
<p>Abstract: Question answering (QA) can only make progress if we know if an answer is correct, but for many of the most challenging and interesting QA examples, current evaluation metrics to determine answer equivalence (AE) often do not align with human judgments, particularly more verbose, free-form answers from large language models (LLM). There are two challenges: a lack of data and that models are too big: LLM-based scorers can correlate better with human judges, but this task has only been tested on limited QA datasets, and even when available, update of the model is limited because LLMs are large and often expensive. We rectify both of these issues by providing clear and consistent guidelines for evaluating AE in machine QA adopted from professional human QA contests. We also introduce a combination of standard evaluation and a more efficient, robust, and lightweight discriminate AE classifier-based matching method (CFMatch, smaller than 1 MB), trained and validated to more accurately evaluate answer correctness in accordance with adopted expert AE rules that are more aligned with human judgments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangbin Feng, Weijia Shi, Yike Wang, Wenxuan Ding, Vidhisha Balachandran, Yulia Tsvetkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite efforts to expand the knowledge of large language models (LLMs), knowledge gaps -- missing or outdated information in LLMs -- might always persist given the evolving nature of knowledge. In this work, we study approaches to identify LLM knowledge gaps and abstain from answering questions when knowledge gaps are present. We first adapt existing approaches to model calibration or adaptation through fine-tuning/prompting and analyze their ability to abstain from generating low-confidence outputs. Motivated by their failures in self-reflection and over-reliance on held-out sets, we propose two novel approaches that are based on model collaboration, i.e., LLMs probing other LLMs for knowledge gaps, either cooperatively or competitively. Extensive experiments with three LLMs on four QA tasks featuring diverse knowledge domains demonstrate that both cooperative and competitive approaches to unveiling LLM knowledge gaps achieve up to 19.3% improvements on abstain accuracy against the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that our proposed mechanisms could help identify failure cases in retrieval augmentation and pinpoint knowledge gaps in multi-hop reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudhir Agarwal, Anu Sreepathy</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of generating plans for given natural language planning task requests. On one hand, LLMs excel at natural language processing but do not perform well on planning. On the other hand, classical planning tools excel at planning tasks but require input in a structured language such as the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We leverage the strengths of both the techniques by using an LLM for generating the PDDL representation (task PDDL) of planning task requests followed by using a classical planner for computing a plan. Unlike previous approaches that use LLMs for generating task PDDLs directly, our approach comprises of (a) translate: using an LLM only for generating a logically interpretable intermediate representation of natural language task description, (b) infer: deriving additional logically dependent information from the intermediate representation using a logic reasoner (currently, Answer Set Programming solver), and (c) compile: generating the target task PDDL from the base and inferred information. We observe that using an LLM to only output the intermediate representation significantly reduces LLM errors. Consequently, TIC approach achieves, for at least one LLM, high accuracy on task PDDL generation for all seven domains of our evaluation dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Work on instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has used automatic methods based on text overlap and LLM judgments as cost-effective alternatives to human evaluation. In this paper, we perform a meta-evaluation of such methods and assess their reliability across a broad range of tasks. We observe that while automatic evaluation methods can approximate human ratings under specific conditions, their validity is highly context-dependent. Specifically, the simple ROUGE-L metric correlates well with human ratings for short-answer English tasks but is unreliable in free-form generation tasks and cross-lingual transfer. The effectiveness of the more advanced method of using GPT-4 as a judge diminishes significantly if reference answers are not included in the prompt, which is the scenario where this method has the potential to provide the most value compared to other metrics. Our findings enhance the understanding of how automatic methods should be applied and interpreted when developing and evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing retrieval-based methods have made significant strides in maintaining long-term conversations. However, these approaches face challenges in memory database management and accurate memory retrieval, hindering their efficacy in dynamic, real-world interactions. This study introduces a novel framework, COmpressive Memory-Enhanced Dialogue sYstems (COMEDY), which eschews traditional retrieval modules and memory databases. Instead, COMEDY adopts a "One-for-All" approach, utilizing a single language model to manage memory generation, compression, and response generation. Central to this framework is the concept of compressive memory, which intergrates session-specific summaries, user-bot dynamics, and past events into a concise memory format. To support COMEDY, we curated a large-scale Chinese instruction-tuning dataset, Dolphin, derived from real user-chatbot interactions. Comparative evaluations demonstrate COMEDY's superiority over traditional retrieval-based methods in producing more nuanced and human-like conversational experiences.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in financial analysis for interpreting complex market data and trends. However, their use is challenged by intrinsic biases (e.g., risk-preference bias) and a superficial understanding of market intricacies, necessitating a thorough assessment of their financial insight. To address these issues, we introduce Financial Bias Indicators (FBI), a framework with components like Bias Unveiler, Bias Detective, Bias Tracker, and Bias Antidote to identify, detect, analyze, and eliminate irrational biases in LLMs. By combining behavioral finance principles with bias examination, we evaluate 23 leading LLMs and propose a de-biasing method based on financial causal knowledge. Results show varying degrees of financial irrationality among models, influenced by their design and training. Models trained specifically on financial datasets may exhibit more irrationality, and even larger financial language models (FinLLMs) can show more bias than smaller, general models. We utilize four prompt-based methods incorporating causal debiasing, effectively reducing financial biases in these models. This work enhances the understanding of LLMs' bias in financial applications, laying the foundation for developing more reliable and rational financial analysis tools.</p>

To bridge this gap, we introduce GraphInstruct, a novel and comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset designed to equip language models with the ability to tackle a broad spectrum of graph problems using explicit reasoning paths.

To enhance the model's capability and reliability, we incorporate the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework into the graph problem-solving context. The enhanced model, GraphWiz-DPO, achieves an average accuracy of 65% across nine tasks with different complexity levels, surpassing GPT-4 which has an average accuracy of 43.8%. Moreover, our research delves into the delicate balance between training data volume and model performance, highlighting the potential for overfitting with increased data. We also explore the transferability of the model's reasoning ability across different graph tasks, indicating the model's adaptability and practical application potential. Our investigation offers a new blueprint and valuable insights for developing LLMs specialized in graph reasoning and problem-solving.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tables play a crucial role in conveying information in various domains. We propose a Plan-then-Reason framework to answer different types of user queries over tables with sentence context. The framework first plans the reasoning paths over the context, then assigns each step to program-based or textual reasoning to reach the final answer. This framework enhances the table reasoning abilities for both in-context learning and fine-tuning methods. GPT-3.5-Turbo following Plan-then-Reason framework surpasses other prompting baselines without self-consistency while using less API calls and in-context demonstrations. We also construct an instruction tuning set TrixInstruct to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning with this framework. We present ProTrix model family by finetuning models on TrixInstruct. Our experiments show that ProTrix family generalizes to diverse unseen tabular tasks with only 6k training instances. We further demonstrate that ProTrix can generate accurate and faithful explanations to answer complex free-form questions. Our work underscores the importance of the planning and reasoning abilities towards a model over tabular tasks with generalizability and interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Gao, Zhuomin He, Puru Sharma, Qingxuan Kang, Djordje Jevdjic, Junbo Deng, Xingkun Yang, Zhou Yu, Pengfei Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Interacting with humans through multi-turn conversations is a fundamental feature of large language models (LLMs). However, existing LLM serving engines executing multi-turn conversations are inefficient due to the need to repeatedly compute the key-value (KV) caches of historical tokens, incurring high serving costs. To address the problem, this paper proposes CachedAttention, a new attention mechanism that enables reuse of KV caches across multi-turn conversations, significantly reducing the repetitive computation overheads. CachedAttention maintains a hierarchical KV caching system that leverages cost-effective memory/storage mediums to save KV caches for all requests. To reduce KV cache access overheads from slow mediums, CachedAttention employs layer-wise pre-loading and asynchronous saving schemes to overlap the KV cache access with the GPU computation. To ensure that the KV caches to be accessed are placed in the fastest hierarchy, CachedAttention employs scheduler-aware fetching and eviction schemes to consciously place the KV caches in different layers based on the hints from the inference job scheduler. To avoid the invalidation of the saved KV caches incurred by context window overflow, CachedAttention enables the saved KV caches to remain valid via decoupling the positional encoding and effectively truncating the KV caches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CachedAttention significantly decreases the time to the first token (TTFT) by up to 87%, improves the prompt prefilling throughput by up to 7.8$\times$ for multi-turn conversations, and reduces the end-to-end inference cost by up to 70%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunjae Kim, Hyeon Hwang, Jiwoo Lee, Sihyeon Park, Dain Kim, Taewhoo Lee, Chanwoong Yoon, Jiwoong Sohn, Donghee Choi, Jaewoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent advancements in commercial large language models (LM) have shown promising results in medical tasks, their closed-source nature poses significant privacy and security concerns, hindering their widespread use in the medical field. Despite efforts to create open-source models, their limited parameters often result in insufficient multi-step reasoning capabilities required for solving complex medical problems. To address this, we introduce Meerkat, a new family of medical AI systems ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters. The models were trained using our new synthetic dataset consisting of high-quality chain-of-thought reasoning paths sourced from 18 medical textbooks, along with diverse instruction-following datasets. Our systems achieved remarkable accuracy across six medical benchmarks, surpassing the previous best models such as MediTron and BioMistral, and GPT-3.5 by a large margin. Notably, Meerkat-7B surpassed the passing threshold of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) for the first time for a 7B-parameter model, while Meerkat-70B outperformed GPT-4 by an average of 1.3%. Additionally, Meerkat-70B correctly diagnosed 21 out of 38 complex clinical cases, outperforming humans' 13.8 and closely matching GPT-4's 21.8. Our systems offered more detailed free-form responses to clinical queries compared to existing small models, approaching the performance level of large commercial models. This significantly narrows the performance gap with large LMs, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing complex medical challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaina Raza, Oluwanifemi Bamgbose, Shardul Ghuge, Fatemeh Tavakol, Deepak John Reji, Syed Raza Bashir</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced various NLP tasks. However, these models often risk generating unsafe text that perpetuates biases. Current approaches to produce unbiased outputs from LLMs can reduce biases but at the expense of knowledge retention. In this research, we address the question of whether producing safe (unbiased) outputs through LLMs can retain knowledge and language understanding. In response, we developed the Safety and Responsible Large Language Model (\textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$), an LLM that has been instruction fine-tuned on top of already safe LLMs (e.g., Llama2 or related) to diminish biases in generated text. To achieve our goals, we compiled a specialized dataset designed to train our model in identifying and correcting biased text. We conduct experiments, both on this custom data and out-of-distribution test sets, to show the bias reduction and knowledge retention. The results confirm that \textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$ outperforms traditional fine-tuning and prompting methods in both reducing biases and preserving the integrity of language knowledge. The significance of our findings lies in demonstrating that instruction fine-tuning can provide a more robust solution for bias reduction in LLMs. We have made our code and data available at \href{https://github.com/shainarazavi/Safe-Responsible-LLM}{Safe-LLM}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Chen, Xinyu Wang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Kewei Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of large language models, applying techniques such as Retrieval Augmented Generation can better address Open-Domain Question-Answering problems. Due to constraints including model sizes and computing resources, the length of context is often limited, and it becomes challenging to empower the model to cover overlong contexts while answering questions from open domains. This paper proposes a general and convenient method to covering longer contexts in Open-Domain Question-Answering tasks. It leverages a small encoder language model that effectively encodes contexts, and the encoding applies cross-attention with origin inputs. With our method, the origin language models can cover several times longer contexts while keeping the computing requirements close to the baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that after fine-tuning, there is improved performance across two held-in datasets, four held-out datasets, and also in two In Context Learning settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahammed Kamruzzaman, Gene Louis Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Dual process theory posits that human cognition arises via two systems. System 1, which is a quick, emotional, and intuitive process, which is subject to cognitive biases, and System 2, a slow, onerous, and deliberate process. NLP researchers often compare zero-shot prompting in LLMs to System 1 reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to System 2. In line with this interpretation, prior research has found that using CoT prompting in LLMs leads to reduced gender bias. We investigate the relationship between bias, CoT prompting, and dual process theory in LLMs directly. We compare zero-shot, CoT, and a variety of dual process theory-based prompting strategies on two bias datasets spanning nine different social bias categories. We also use human and machine personas to determine whether the effects of dual process theory in LLMs are based on modeling human cognition or inherent to the system. We find that a human persona, System 2, and CoT prompting all tend to reduce social biases in LLMs, though the best combination of features depends on the exact model and bias category -- resulting in up to a 13 percent drop in stereotypical judgments by an LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dana Roemling, Yves Scherrer, Aleksandra Miletic</p>
<p>Abstract: Forensic authorship profiling uses linguistic markers to infer characteristics about an author of a text. This task is paralleled in dialect classification, where a prediction is made about the linguistic variety of a text based on the text itself. While there have been significant advances in recent years in variety classification, forensic linguistics rarely relies on these approaches due to their lack of transparency, among other reasons. In this paper we therefore explore the explainability of machine learning approaches considering the forensic context. We focus on variety classification as a means of geolinguistic profiling of unknown texts based on social media data from the German-speaking area. For this, we identify the lexical items that are the most impactful for the variety classification. We find that the extracted lexical features are indeed representative of their respective varieties and note that the trained models also rely on place names for classifications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiqin Lin, Andr\'e F. T. Martins, Hinrich Sch\"utze</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies indicate that leveraging off-the-shelf or fine-tuned retrievers, capable of retrieving relevant in-context examples tailored to the input query, enhances few-shot in-context learning of English. However, adapting these methods to other languages, especially low-resource ones, poses challenges due to the scarcity of cross-lingual retrievers and annotated data. Thus, we introduce XAMPLER: Cross-Lingual Example Retrieval, a method tailored to tackle the challenge of cross-lingual in-context learning using only annotated English data. XAMPLER first trains a retriever based on Glot500, a multilingual small language model, using positive and negative English examples constructed from the predictions of a multilingual large language model, i.e., MaLA500. Leveraging the cross-lingual capacity of the retriever, it can directly retrieve English examples as few-shot examples for in-context learning of target languages. Experiments on the multilingual text classification benchmark SIB200 with 176 languages show that XAMPLER substantially improves the in-context learning performance across languages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhe Chen, Yichen Li, Zikai Xiao, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing debiasing methods inevitably make unreasonable or undesired predictions as they are designated and evaluated to achieve parity across different social groups but leave aside individual facts, resulting in modified existing knowledge. In this paper, we first establish a new bias mitigation benchmark BiasKE leveraging existing and additional constructed datasets, which systematically assesses debiasing performance by complementary metrics on fairness, specificity, and generalization. Meanwhile, we propose a novel debiasing method, Fairness Stamp (FAST), which enables editable fairness through fine-grained calibration on individual biased knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FAST surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with remarkable debiasing performance while not hampering overall model capability for knowledge preservation, highlighting the prospect of fine-grained debiasing strategies for editable fairness in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengxiang Lan, Enneng Yang, Yuting Liu, Guibing Guo, Linying Jiang, Jianzhe Zhao, Xingwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt tuning is a promising method to fine-tune a pre-trained language model without retraining its large-scale parameters. Instead, it attaches a soft prompt to the input text, whereby downstream tasks can be well adapted by merely learning the embeddings of prompt tokens. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two challenges: (i) they are hard to balance accuracy and efficiency. A longer (shorter) soft prompt generally leads to a better(worse) accuracy but at the cost of more (less) training time. (ii)The performance may not be consistent when adapting to different downstream tasks. We attribute it to the same embedding space but responsible for different requirements of downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Efficient Prompt Tuning method (EPT) by multi-space projection and prompt fusion. Specifically, it decomposes a given soft prompt into a shorter prompt and two low-rank matrices, significantly reducing the training time. Accuracy is also enhanced by leveraging low-rank matrices and the short prompt as additional knowledge sources to enrich the semantics of the original short prompt. In addition, we project the soft prompt into multiple subspaces to improve the performance consistency, and then adaptively learn the combination weights of different spaces through a gating network. Experiments on 13 natural language processing downstream tasks show that our method significantly and consistently outperforms 11 comparison methods with the relative percentage of improvements up to 12.9%, and training time decreased by 14%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Legal documents are indispensable in every country for legal practices and serve as the primary source of information regarding previous cases and employed statutes. In today's world, with an increasing number of judicial cases, it is crucial to systematically categorize past cases into subgroups, which can then be utilized for upcoming cases and practices. Our primary focus in this endeavor was to annotate cases using topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Non-Negative Matrix Factorization, and Bertopic for a collection of lengthy legal documents from India and the UK. This step is crucial for distinguishing the generated labels between the two countries, highlighting the differences in the types of cases that arise in each jurisdiction. Furthermore, an analysis of the timeline of cases from India was conducted to discern the evolution of dominant topics over the years.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clinical problem-solving requires processing of semantic medical knowledge such as illness scripts and numerical medical knowledge of diagnostic tests for evidence-based decision-making. As large language models (LLMs) show promising results in many aspects of language-based clinical practice, their ability to generate non-language evidence-based answers to clinical questions is inherently limited by tokenization. Therefore, we evaluated LLMs' performance on two question types: numeric (correlating findings) and semantic (differentiating entities) while examining differences within and between LLMs in medical aspects and comparing their performance to humans. To generate straightforward multi-choice questions and answers (QAs) based on evidence-based medicine (EBM), we used a comprehensive medical knowledge graph (encompassed data from more than 50,00 peer-reviewed articles) and created the "EBMQA". EBMQA contains 105,000 QAs labeled with medical and non-medical topics and classified into numerical or semantic questions. We benchmarked this dataset using more than 24,500 QAs on two state-of-the-art LLMs: Chat-GPT4 and Claude3-Opus. We evaluated the LLMs accuracy on semantic and numerical question types and according to sub-labeled topics. For validation, six medical experts were tested on 100 numerical EBMQA questions. We found that both LLMs excelled more in semantic than numerical QAs, with Claude3 surpassing GPT4 in numerical QAs. However, both LLMs showed inter and intra gaps in different medical aspects and remained inferior to humans. Thus, their medical advice should be addressed carefully.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in text generation and reasoning, Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges in accurately performing complex arithmetic operations. To achieve accurate calculations, language model systems often enable LLMs to generate code for arithmetic operations. However, this approach compromises speed and security and, if finetuning is involved, risks the language model losing prior capabilities. We propose a framework that enables exact arithmetic in \textit{a single autoregressive step}, providing faster, more secure, and more interpretable LLM systems with arithmetic capabilities. We use the hidden states of an LLM to control a symbolic architecture which performs arithmetic. Our implementation using Llama 3 8B Instruct with OccamNet as a symbolic model (OccamLlama) achieves 100\% accuracy on single arithmetic operations ($+,-,\times,\div,\sin{},\cos{},\log{},\exp{},\sqrt{}$), outperforming GPT 4o and on par with GPT 4o using a code interpreter. OccamLlama also outperforms GPT 4o both with and without a code interpreter on mathematical problem solving benchmarks involving challenging arithmetic, thus enabling small LLMs to match the arithmetic performance of even much larger models. We will make our code public shortly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Quality Estimation (QE) assesses translation reliability without reference texts. This study introduces "textual similarity" as a new metric for QE, using sentence transformers and cosine similarity to measure semantic closeness. Analyzing data from the MLQE-PE dataset, we found that textual similarity exhibits stronger correlations with human scores than traditional metrics (hter, model evaluation, sentence probability etc.). Employing GAMMs as a statistical tool, we demonstrated that textual similarity consistently outperforms other metrics across multiple language pairs in predicting human scores. We also found that "hter" actually failed to predict human scores in QE. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of textual similarity as a robust QE metric, recommending its integration with other metrics into QE frameworks and MT system training for improved accuracy and usability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Eiras, Aleksandar Petrov, Phillip H. S. Torr, M. Pawan Kumar, Adel Bibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on small, high-quality datasets can enhance their performance on specific downstream tasks. Recent research shows that fine-tuning on benign, instruction-following data can inadvertently undo the safety alignment process and increase a model's propensity to comply with harmful queries. Although critical, understanding and mitigating safety risks in well-defined tasks remains distinct from the instruction-following context due to structural differences in the data. Our work addresses the gap in our understanding of these risks across diverse types of data in closed models - where providers control how user data is utilized in the fine-tuning process. We demonstrate how malicious actors can subtly manipulate the structure of almost any task-specific dataset to foster significantly more dangerous model behaviors, while maintaining an appearance of innocuity and reasonable downstream task performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel mitigation strategy that mixes in safety data which mimics the task format and prompting style of the user data, showing this is more effective than existing baselines at re-establishing safety alignment while maintaining similar task performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given the substantial volumes of structured data held by many companies, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly understand structured text in non-structured forms could significantly enhance their capabilities across various business scenarios. To this end, we propose evaluation data generation method for assessing LLM's ability in understanding the structure-rich text, which generates structured data of controllable complexity based on manually crafted question templates and generation rules. Building on this generation method, we introduce StrucText-Eval, a benchmark comprising 6,032 questions across 8 different structured languages and 29 specific tasks. Furthermore, considering human proficiency in rule-based tasks, we also present StrucText-Eval-Hard, which includes 3,016 questions designed to further examine the gap between LLMs and human performance. Results indicate that the best-performing LLM currently achieve an accuracy of 65.0\% on StrucText-Eval-Hard, while human accuracy reaches up to 95.7\%. Moreover, while fine-tuning using StrucText-Eval can enhance existing LLMs' understanding of all structured languages, it does not necessarily improve performance across all task types.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sree Harsha Tanneru, Dan Ley, Chirag Agarwal, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being employed in real-world applications in critical domains such as healthcare, it is important to ensure that the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning generated by these models faithfully captures their underlying behavior.
  While LLMs are known to generate CoT reasoning that is appealing to humans, prior studies have shown that these explanations do not accurately reflect the actual behavior of the underlying LLMs. In this work, we explore the promise of three broad approaches commonly employed to steer the behavior of LLMs to enhance the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning generated by LLMs: in-context learning, fine-tuning, and activation editing. Specifically, we introduce novel strategies for in-context learning, fine-tuning, and activation editing aimed at improving the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning. We then carry out extensive empirical analyses with multiple benchmark datasets to explore the promise of these strategies. Our analyses indicate that these strategies offer limited success in improving the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning, with only slight performance enhancements in controlled scenarios. Activation editing demonstrated minimal success, while fine-tuning and in-context learning achieved marginal improvements that failed to generalize across diverse reasoning and truthful question-answering benchmarks. In summary, our work underscores the inherent difficulty in eliciting faithful CoT reasoning from LLMs, suggesting that the current array of approaches may not be sufficient to address this complex challenge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that maintaining a consistent response style by human experts and enhancing data quality in training sets can significantly improve the performance of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) while reducing the number of training examples needed. However, the precise definition of style and the relationship between style, data quality, and LLM performance remains unclear. This research decomposes response style into presentation and composition styles and finds that, among training data of similar quality, those with higher style consistency lead to better LLM performance. Inspired by this, we introduce Style Consistency-Aware Response Ranking (SCAR), which automatically prioritizes instruction-response pairs in the training set based on their response stylistic consistency. By selecting the most style-consistent examples, ranging from the top 25% to 0.7% of the full dataset, the fine-tuned LLMs can match or even surpass the performance of models trained on the entire dataset in coding and open-ended question-answering benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked wide interest in validating and comprehending the human-like cognitive-behavioral traits LLMs may have. These cognitive-behavioral traits include typically Attitudes, Opinions, Values (AOV). However, measuring AOV embedded within LLMs remains opaque, and different evaluation methods may yield different results. This has led to a lack of clarity on how different studies are related to each other and how they can be interpreted. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing an overview of recent works on the evaluation of AOV in LLMs. Moreover, we survey related approaches in different stages of the evaluation pipeline in these works. By doing so, we address the potential and challenges with respect to understanding the model, human-AI alignment, and downstream application in social sciences. Finally, we provide practical insights into evaluation methods, model enhancement, and interdisciplinary collaboration, thereby contributing to the evolving landscape of evaluating AOV in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Scott Barnett, Zac Brannelly, Stefanus Kurniawan, Sheng Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the unique capability to understand and generate human-like text from input queries. When fine-tuned, these models show enhanced performance on domain-specific queries. OpenAI highlights the process of fine-tuning, stating: "To fine-tune a model, you are required to provide at least 10 examples. We typically see clear improvements from fine-tuning on 50 to 100 training examples, but the right number varies greatly based on the exact use case." This study extends this concept to the integration of LLMs within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, which aim to improve accuracy and relevance by leveraging external corpus data for information retrieval. However, RAG's promise of delivering optimal responses often falls short in complex query scenarios. This study aims to specifically examine the effects of fine-tuning LLMs on their ability to extract and integrate contextual data to enhance the performance of RAG systems across multiple domains. We evaluate the impact of fine-tuning on the LLMs' capacity for data extraction and contextual understanding by comparing the accuracy and completeness of fine-tuned models against baseline performances across datasets from multiple domains. Our findings indicate that fine-tuning resulted in a decline in performance compared to the baseline models, contrary to the improvements observed in standalone LLM applications as suggested by OpenAI. This study highlights the need for vigorous investigation and validation of fine-tuned models for domain-specific tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyang Song, Mao Zheng, Xuan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for judging the performance of LLMs has recently garnered attention. However, this type of approach is affected by the potential biases in LLMs, raising concerns about the reliability of the evaluation results. To mitigate this issue, we propose and study two versions of many-shot in-context prompts, which rely on two existing settings of many-shot ICL for helping GPT-4o-as-a-Judge in single answer grading to mitigate the potential biases in LLMs, Reinforced ICL and Unsupervised ICL. Concretely, the former utilizes in-context examples with model-generated rationales, and the latter without. Based on the designed prompts, we investigate the impact of scaling the number of in-context examples on the consistency and quality of the judgment results. Furthermore, we reveal the symbol bias hidden in the pairwise comparison of GPT-4o-as-a-Judge and propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate it. Experimental results show that advanced long-context LLMs, such as GPT-4o, perform better in the many-shot regime than in the zero-shot regime. Meanwhile, the experimental results further verify the effectiveness of the symbol bias mitigation approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: As opposed to evaluating computation and logic-based reasoning, current benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine are primarily focused on question-answering involving domain knowledge and descriptive reasoning. While such qualitative capabilities are vital to medical diagnosis, in real-world scenarios, doctors frequently use clinical calculators that follow quantitative equations and rule-based reasoning paradigms for evidence-based decision support. To this end, we propose MedCalc-Bench, a first-of-its-kind dataset focused on evaluating the medical calculation capability of LLMs. MedCalc-Bench contains an evaluation set of over 1000 manually reviewed instances from 55 different medical calculation tasks. Each instance in MedCalc-Bench consists of a patient note, a question requesting to compute a specific medical value, a ground truth answer, and a step-by-step explanation showing how the answer is obtained. While our evaluation results show the potential of LLMs in this area, none of them are effective enough for clinical settings. Common issues include extracting the incorrect entities, not using the correct equation or rules for a calculation task, or incorrectly performing the arithmetic for the computation. We hope our study highlights the quantitative knowledge and reasoning gaps in LLMs within medical settings, encouraging future improvements of LLMs for various clinical calculation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steffi Chern, Zhulin Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ethan Chern, Yuan Guo, Jiahe Jin, Binjie Wang, Pengfei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous works on Large Language Models (LLMs) have mainly focused on evaluating their helpfulness or harmlessness. However, honesty, another crucial alignment criterion, has received relatively less attention. Dishonest behaviors in LLMs, such as spreading misinformation and defrauding users, eroding user trust, and causing real-world harm, present severe risks that intensify as these models approach superintelligence levels. Enhancing honesty in LLMs addresses critical deficiencies and helps uncover latent capabilities that are not readily expressed. This underscores the urgent need for reliable methods and benchmarks to effectively ensure and evaluate the honesty of LLMs.
  In this paper, we introduce BeHonest, a pioneering benchmark specifically designed to assess honesty in LLMs comprehensively. BeHonest evaluates three essential aspects of honesty: awareness of knowledge boundaries, avoidance of deceit, and consistency in responses. Building on this foundation, we designed 10 scenarios to evaluate and analyze 9 popular LLMs on the market, including both closed-source and open-source models from different model families with varied model sizes. Our findings indicate that there is still significant room for improvement in the honesty of LLMs. We also encourage the AI community to prioritize honesty alignment in LLMs. Our benchmark and code can be found at: \url{https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/BeHonest}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jirui Qi, Gabriele Sarti, Raquel Fern\'andez, Arianna Bisazza</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the verifiability of model answers is a fundamental challenge for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in the question answering (QA) domain. Recently, self-citation prompting was proposed to make large language models (LLMs) generate citations to supporting documents along with their answers. However, self-citing LLMs often struggle to match the required format, refer to non-existent sources, and fail to faithfully reflect LLMs' context usage throughout the generation. In this work, we present MIRAGE --Model Internals-based RAG Explanations -- a plug-and-play approach using model internals for faithful answer attribution in RAG applications. MIRAGE detects context-sensitive answer tokens and pairs them with retrieved documents contributing to their prediction via saliency methods. We evaluate our proposed approach on a multilingual extractive QA dataset, finding high agreement with human answer attribution. On open-ended QA, MIRAGE achieves citation quality and efficiency comparable to self-citation while also allowing for a finer-grained control of attribution parameters. Our qualitative evaluation highlights the faithfulness of MIRAGE's attributions and underscores the promising application of model internals for RAG answer attribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mathematical verfier achieves success in mathematical reasoning tasks by validating the correctness of solutions. However, existing verifiers are trained with binary classification labels, which are not informative enough for the model to accurately assess the solutions. To mitigate the aforementioned insufficiency of binary labels, we introduce step-wise natural language feedbacks as rationale labels (i.e., the correctness of the current step and the explanations). In this paper, we propose \textbf{Math-Minos}, a natural language feedback enhanced verifier by constructing automatically-generated training data and a two-stage training paradigm for effective training and efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that a small set (30k) of natural language feedbacks can significantly boost the performance of the verifier by the accuracy of 1.6\% (86.6\% $\rightarrow$ 88.2\%) on GSM8K and 0.8\% (37.8\% $\rightarrow$ 38.6\%) on MATH. We have released our code and data for further exploration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents that interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) hold significant potential for enhancing user experiences. To further improve these experiences, agents need to be personalized and proactive. By effectively comprehending user intentions through their actions and interactions with GUIs, agents will be better positioned to achieve these goals. This paper introduces the task of goal identification from observed UI trajectories, aiming to infer the user's intended task based on their GUI interactions. We propose a novel evaluation metric to assess whether two task descriptions are paraphrases within a specific UI environment. By Leveraging the inverse relation with the UI automation task, we utilized the Android-In-The-Wild and Mind2Web datasets for our experiments. Using our metric and these datasets, we conducted several experiments comparing the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our results show that Gemini performs better than GPT but still underperforms compared to humans, indicating significant room for improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Yang, Yu Zhao, Yang Linyao, Xiao Wang, Long Chen, Fei-Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal relation extraction (TRE) aims to grasp the evolution of events or actions, and thus shape the workflow of associated tasks, so it holds promise in helping understand task requests initiated by requesters in crowdsourcing systems. However, existing methods still struggle with limited and unevenly distributed annotated data. Therefore, inspired by the abundant global knowledge stored within pre-trained language models (PLMs), we propose a multi-task prompt learning framework for TRE (TemPrompt), incorporating prompt tuning and contrastive learning to tackle these issues. To elicit more effective prompts for PLMs, we introduce a task-oriented prompt construction approach that thoroughly takes the myriad factors of TRE into consideration for automatic prompt generation. In addition, we present temporal event reasoning as a supplement to bolster the model's focus on events and temporal cues. The experimental results demonstrate that TemPrompt outperforms all compared baselines across the majority of metrics under both standard and few-shot settings. A case study is provided to validate its effectiveness in crowdsourcing scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Jiang, Xueguang Ma, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In traditional RAG framework, the basic retrieval units are normally short. The common retrievers like DPR normally work with 100-word Wikipedia paragraphs. Such a design forces the retriever to search over a large corpus to find the `needle' unit. In contrast, the readers only need to extract answers from the short retrieved units. Such an imbalanced `heavy' retriever and `light' reader design can lead to sub-optimal performance. In order to alleviate the imbalance, we propose a new framework LongRAG, consisting of a `long retriever' and a `long reader'. LongRAG processes the entire Wikipedia into 4K-token units, which is 30x longer than before. By increasing the unit size, we significantly reduce the total units from 22M to 700K. This significantly lowers the burden of retriever, which leads to a remarkable retrieval score: answer recall@1=71% on NQ (previously 52%) and answer recall@2=72% (previously 47%) on HotpotQA (full-wiki). Then we feed the top-k retrieved units ($\approx$ 30K tokens) to an existing long-context LLM to perform zero-shot answer extraction. Without requiring any training, LongRAG achieves an EM of 62.7% on NQ, which is the best known result. LongRAG also achieves 64.3% on HotpotQA (full-wiki), which is on par of the SoTA model. Our study offers insights into the future roadmap for combining RAG with long-context LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzi Xu, Renze Lou, Jiangshu Du, Vahid Mahzoon, Elmira Talebianaraki, Zhuoan Zhou, Elizabeth Garrison, Slobodan Vucetic, Wenpeng Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: In many classification tasks designed for AI or human to solve, gold labels are typically included within the label space by default, often posed as "which of the following is correct?" This standard setup has traditionally highlighted the strong performance of advanced AI, particularly top-performing Large Language Models (LLMs), in routine classification tasks. However, when the gold label is intentionally excluded from the label space, it becomes evident that LLMs still attempt to select from the available label candidates, even when none are correct. This raises a pivotal question: Do LLMs truly demonstrate their intelligence in understanding the essence of classification tasks?
  In this study, we evaluate both closed-source and open-source LLMs across representative classification tasks, arguing that the perceived performance of LLMs is overstated due to their inability to exhibit the expected comprehension of the task. This paper makes a threefold contribution: i) To our knowledge, this is the first work to identify the limitations of LLMs in classification tasks when gold labels are absent. We define this task as Classify-w/o-Gold and propose it as a new testbed for LLMs. ii) We introduce a benchmark, Know-No, comprising two existing classification tasks and one new task, to evaluate Classify-w/o-Gold. iii) This work defines and advocates for a new evaluation metric, OmniAccuracy, which assesses LLMs' performance in classification tasks both when gold labels are present and absent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhui Li, Fangyun Wei, Chao Zhang, Hongyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference with modern Large Language Models (LLMs) is expensive and time-consuming, and speculative sampling has proven to be an effective solution. Most speculative sampling methods such as EAGLE use a static draft tree, implicitly assuming that the acceptance rate of draft tokens depends only on their position. Interestingly, we found that the acceptance rate of draft tokens is also context-dependent. In this paper, building upon EAGLE, we propose EAGLE-2, which introduces a new technique of context-aware dynamic draft tree into drafting modeling. This improvement leverages the fact that the draft model of EAGLE is well-calibrated: the confidence scores from the draft model approximate acceptance rates with small errors. We conducted extensive evaluations on three series of LLMs and six tasks, with EAGLE-2 achieving speedup ratios 3.05x-4.26x, which is 20%-40% faster than EAGLE-1. EAGLE-2 also ensures that the distribution of the generated text remains unchanged, making it a lossless acceleration algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Liu, Jiayi Geng, Joshua C. Peterson, Ilia Sucholutsky, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>
<p>Abstract: In order for AI systems to communicate effectively with people, they must understand how we make decisions. However, people's decisions are not always rational, so the implicit internal models of human decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) must account for this. Previous empirical evidence seems to suggest that these implicit models are accurate -- LLMs offer believable proxies of human behavior, acting how we expect humans would in everyday interactions. However, by comparing LLM behavior and predictions to a large dataset of human decisions, we find that this is actually not the case: when both simulating and predicting people's choices, a suite of cutting-edge LLMs (GPT-4o & 4-Turbo, Llama-3-8B & 70B, Claude 3 Opus) assume that people are more rational than we really are. Specifically, these models deviate from human behavior and align more closely with a classic model of rational choice -- expected value theory. Interestingly, people also tend to assume that other people are rational when interpreting their behavior. As a consequence, when we compare the inferences that LLMs and people draw from the decisions of others using another psychological dataset, we find that these inferences are highly correlated. Thus, the implicit decision-making models of LLMs appear to be aligned with the human expectation that other people will act rationally, rather than with how people actually act.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Bortoletto, Constantin Ruhdorfer, Lei Shi, Andreas Bulling</p>
<p>Abstract: While numerous works have assessed the generative performance of language models (LMs) on tasks requiring Theory of Mind reasoning, research into the models' internal representation of mental states remains limited. Recent work has used probing to demonstrate that LMs can represent beliefs of themselves and others. However, these claims are accompanied by limited evaluation, making it difficult to assess how mental state representations are affected by model design and training choices. We report an extensive benchmark with various LM types with different model sizes, fine-tuning approaches, and prompt designs to study the robustness of mental state representations and memorisation issues within the probes. Our results show that the quality of models' internal representations of the beliefs of others increases with model size and, more crucially, with fine-tuning. We are the first to study how prompt variations impact probing performance on theory of mind tasks. We demonstrate that models' representations are sensitive to prompt variations, even when such variations should be beneficial. Finally, we complement previous activation editing experiments on Theory of Mind tasks and show that it is possible to improve models' reasoning performance by steering their activations without the need to train any probe.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is an important task with broad applications, while few-shot HTC has gained increasing interest recently. While in-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) has achieved significant success in few-shot learning, it is not as effective for HTC because of the expansive hierarchical label sets and extremely-ambiguous labels. In this work, we introduce the first ICL-based framework with LLM for few-shot HTC. We exploit a retrieval database to identify relevant demonstrations, and an iterative policy to manage multi-layer hierarchical labels. Particularly, we equip the retrieval database with HTC label-aware representations for the input texts, which is achieved by continual training on a pretrained language model with masked language modeling (MLM), layer-wise classification (CLS, specifically for HTC), and a novel divergent contrastive learning (DCL, mainly for adjacent semantically-similar labels) objective. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of our method, and we can achieve state-of-the-art results in few-shot HTC.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of Natural Language Processing (NLI) datasets and models has been inspired by innovations in annotation design. With the rapid development of machine learning models today, the performance of existing machine learning models has quickly reached state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks related to natural language processing, including natural language inference tasks. By using a pre-trained model during the annotation process, it is possible to challenge current NLI models by having humans produce premise-hypothesis combinations that the machine model cannot correctly predict. To remain attractive and challenging in the research of natural language inference for Vietnamese, in this paper, we introduce the adversarial NLI dataset to the NLP research community with the name ViANLI. This data set contains more than 10K premise-hypothesis pairs and is built by a continuously adjusting process to obtain the most out of the patterns generated by the annotators. ViANLI dataset has brought many difficulties to many current SOTA models when the accuracy of the most powerful model on the test set only reached 48.4%. Additionally, the experimental results show that the models trained on our dataset have significantly improved the results on other Vietnamese NLI datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) has achieved significant progress with the advancements of multimodal generative models. However, the evaluation in the domain suffers from a lack of fair and robust metrics. We reveal that, high performance on RRG with existing lexical-based metrics (e.g. BLEU) might be more of a mirage - a model can get a high BLEU only by learning the template of reports. This has become an urgent problem for RRG due to the highly patternized nature of these reports. In this work, we un-intuitively approach this problem by proposing the Layman's RRG framework, a layman's terms-based dataset, evaluation and training framework that systematically improves RRG with day-to-day language. We first contribute the translated Layman's terms dataset. Building upon the dataset, we then propose a semantics-based evaluation method, which is proved to mitigate the inflated numbers of BLEU and provides fairer evaluation. Last, we show that training on the layman's terms dataset encourages models to focus on the semantics of the reports, as opposed to overfitting to learning the report templates. We reveal a promising scaling law between the number of training examples and semantics gain provided by our dataset, compared to the inverse pattern brought by the original formats.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess the remarkable capability to understand human instructions and generate high-quality text, enabling them to act as agents that simulate human behaviours. This capability allows LLMs to emulate human beings in a more advanced manner, beyond merely replicating simple human behaviours. However, there is a lack of exploring into leveraging LLMs to craft characters from several aspects. In this work, we introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters that can be freely customised according to different user preferences. The customisable framework is helpful for designing customisable characters and role-playing agents according to human's preferences. We first propose the SimsConv dataset, which comprises 68 different customised characters, 1,360 multi-turn role-playing dialogues, and encompasses 13,971 interaction dialogues in total. The characters are created from several real-world elements, such as career, aspiration, trait, and skill. Building on these foundations, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent. It incorporates different real-world scenes and topic-specific character interaction dialogues, simulating characters' life experiences in various scenarios and topic-specific interactions with specific emotions. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves desirable performance and provides helpful guideline for building better simulacra of human beings in the future.

<p>Abstract: Opinion Expression Identification (OEI) is essential in NLP for applications ranging from voice assistants to depression diagnosis. This study extends OEI to encompass multimodal inputs, underlining the significance of auditory cues in delivering emotional subtleties beyond the capabilities of text. We introduce a novel multimodal OEI (MOEI) task, integrating text and speech to mirror real-world scenarios. Utilizing CMU MOSEI and IEMOCAP datasets, we construct the CI-MOEI dataset. Additionally, Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology is applied to the MPQA dataset to obtain the CIM-OEI dataset. We design a template for the OEI task to take full advantage of the generative power of large language models (LLMs). Advancing further, we propose an LLM-driven method STOEI, which combines speech and text modal to identify opinion expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that MOEI significantly improves the performance while our method outperforms existing methods by 9.20\% and obtains SOTA results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) derive their capabilities from extensive training on diverse data, including potentially copyrighted material. These models can memorize and generate content similar to their training data, posing potential concerns. Therefore, model creators are motivated to develop mitigation methods that prevent generating protected content. We term this procedure as copyright takedowns for LMs, noting the conceptual similarity to (but legal distinction from) the DMCA takedown This paper introduces the first evaluation of the feasibility and side effects of copyright takedowns for LMs. We propose CoTaEval, an evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness of copyright takedown methods, the impact on the model's ability to retain uncopyrightable factual knowledge from the training data whose recitation is embargoed, and how well the model maintains its general utility and efficiency. We examine several strategies, including adding system prompts, decoding-time filtering interventions, and unlearning approaches. Our findings indicate that no tested method excels across all metrics, showing significant room for research in this unique problem setting and indicating potential unresolved challenges for live policy proposals.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing sophistication of cyber threats necessitates innovative approaches to cybersecurity. In this paper, we explore the potential of psychological profiling techniques, particularly focusing on the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) and psycholinguistic features. We investigate the intersection of psychology and cybersecurity, discussing how LLMs can be employed to analyze textual data for identifying psychological traits of threat actors. We explore the incorporation of psycholinguistic features, such as linguistic patterns and emotional cues, into cybersecurity frameworks. Our research underscores the importance of integrating psychological perspectives into cybersecurity practices to bolster defense mechanisms against evolving threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiting Ran, Xintao Wang, Rui Xu, Xinfeng Yuan, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao, Deqing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Role-playing agents (RPA) have been a popular application area for large language models (LLMs), attracting significant interest from both industry and academia.While existing RPAs well portray the characters' knowledge and tones, they face challenges in capturing their minds, especially for small role-playing language models (RPLMs). In this paper, we propose to enhance RPLMs via personality-indicative data. Specifically, we leverage questions from psychological scales and distill advanced RPAs to generate dialogues that grasp the minds of characters. Experimental results validate that RPLMs trained with our dataset exhibit advanced role-playing capabilities for both general and personality-related evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyang Liu, Dongsheng Wang, Bowei Fang, Miaoge Li, Zhibin Duan, Yishi Xu, Bo Chen, Mingyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: For downstream applications of vision-language pre-trained models, there has been significant interest in constructing effective prompts. Existing works on prompt engineering, which either require laborious manual designs or optimize the prompt tuning as a point estimation problem, may fail to describe diverse characteristics of categories and limit their applications. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic resolution to prompt tuning, where the label-specific stochastic prompts are generated hierarchically by first sampling a latent vector from an underlying distribution and then employing a lightweight generative model. Importantly, we semantically regularize the tuning process by minimizing the statistical distance between the visual patches and linguistic prompts, which pushes the stochastic label representations to faithfully capture diverse visual concepts, instead of overfitting the training categories. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on four tasks: few-shot image recognition, base-to-new generalization, dataset transfer learning, and domain shifts. Extensive results over 15 datasets show promising transferability and generalization performance of our proposed model, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asad Ullah, Alessandro Ragano, Andrew Hines</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated superior performance than supervised models for tasks including phoneme recognition. Training SSRL models poses a challenge for low-resource languages where sufficient pre-training data may not be available. A common approach is cross-lingual pre-training. Instead, we propose to use audio augmentation techniques, namely: pitch variation, noise addition, accented target language and other language speech to pre-train SSRL models in a low resource condition and evaluate phoneme recognition. Our comparisons found that a combined synthetic augmentations (noise/pitch) strategy outperformed accent and language knowledge transfer. Furthermore, we examined the scaling factor of augmented data to achieve equivalent performance to model pre-trained with target domain speech. Our findings suggest that for resource-constrained languages, combined augmentations can be a viable option than other augmentations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niloofar Mireshghallah, Hyunwoo Kim, Xuhui Zhou, Yulia Tsvetkov, Maarten Sap, Reza Shokri, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The interactive use of large language models (LLMs) in AI assistants (at work, home, etc.) introduces a new set of inference-time privacy risks: LLMs are fed different types of information from multiple sources in their inputs and are expected to reason about what to share in their outputs, for what purpose and with whom, within a given context. In this work, we draw attention to the highly critical yet overlooked notion of contextual privacy by proposing ConfAIde, a benchmark designed to identify critical weaknesses in the privacy reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our experiments show that even the most capable models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT reveal private information in contexts that humans would not, 39% and 57% of the time, respectively. This leakage persists even when we employ privacy-inducing prompts or chain-of-thought reasoning. Our work underscores the immediate need to explore novel inference-time privacy-preserving approaches, based on reasoning and theory of mind.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Chao, Jiaxuan Zhao, Licheng Jiao, Lingling Li, Fang Liu, Shuyuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have powerful capabilities for generating creative natural text. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can discover diverse solutions to complex real-world problems. Motivated by the common collective and directionality of text generation and evolution, this paper illustrates the parallels between LLMs and EAs, which includes multiple one-to-one key characteristics: token representation and individual representation, position encoding and fitness shaping, position embedding and selection, Transformers block and reproduction, and model training and parameter adaptation. By examining these parallels, we analyze existing interdisciplinary research, with a specific focus on evolutionary fine-tuning and LLM-enhanced EAs. Drawing from these insights, valuable future directions are presented for advancing the integration of LLMs and EAs, while highlighting key challenges along the way. These parallels not only reveal the evolution mechanism behind LLMs but also facilitate the development of evolved artificial agents that approach or surpass biological organisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Natasha Butt, Blazej Manczak, Auke Wiggers, Corrado Rainone, David W. Zhang, Micha\"el Defferrard, Taco Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly solving tasks that are commonly believed to require human-level reasoning ability. However, these models still perform very poorly on benchmarks of general intelligence such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this paper, we approach ARC as a programming-by-examples problem, and introduce a novel and scalable method for language model self-improvement called Code Iteration (CodeIt). Our method iterates between 1) program sampling and hindsight relabeling, and 2) learning from prioritized experience replay. By relabeling the goal of an episode (i.e., the target program output given input) to the realized output produced by the sampled program, our method effectively deals with the extreme sparsity of rewards in program synthesis. Applying CodeIt to the ARC dataset, we demonstrate that prioritized hindsight replay, along with pre-training and data-augmentation, leads to successful inter-task generalization. CodeIt is the first neuro-symbolic approach that scales to the full ARC evaluation dataset. Our method solves 15% of ARC evaluation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing neural and symbolic baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyi Wei, Kaixuan Huang, Yangsibo Huang, Tinghao Xie, Xiangyu Qi, Mengzhou Xia, Prateek Mittal, Mengdi Wang, Peter Henderson</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show inherent brittleness in their safety mechanisms, as evidenced by their susceptibility to jailbreaking and even non-malicious fine-tuning. This study explores this brittleness of safety alignment by leveraging pruning and low-rank modifications. We develop methods to identify critical regions that are vital for safety guardrails, and that are disentangled from utility-relevant regions at both the neuron and rank levels. Surprisingly, the isolated regions we find are sparse, comprising about $3\%$ at the parameter level and $2.5\%$ at the rank level. Removing these regions compromises safety without significantly impacting utility, corroborating the inherent brittleness of the model's safety mechanisms. Moreover, we show that LLMs remain vulnerable to low-cost fine-tuning attacks even when modifications to the safety-critical regions are restricted. These findings underscore the urgent need for more robust safety strategies in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eliahu Horwitz, Jonathan Kahana, Yedid Hoshen</p>
<p>Abstract: The dominant paradigm in generative modeling consists of two steps: i) pre-training on a large-scale but unsafe dataset, ii) aligning the pre-trained model with human values via fine-tuning. This practice is considered safe, as no current method can recover the unsafe, pre-fine-tuning model weights. In this paper, we demonstrate that this assumption is often false. Concretely, we present Spectral DeTuning, a method that can recover the weights of the pre-fine-tuning model using a few low-rank (LoRA) fine-tuned models. In contrast to previous attacks that attempt to recover pre-fine-tuning capabilities, our method aims to recover the exact pre-fine-tuning weights. Our approach exploits this new vulnerability against large-scale models such as a personalized Stable Diffusion and an aligned Mistral.</p>

<p>Abstract: The burgeoning field of on-device AI communication, where devices exchange information directly through embedded foundation models, such as language models (LMs), requires robust, efficient, and generalizable communication frameworks. However, integrating these frameworks with existing wireless systems and effectively managing noise and bit errors pose significant challenges. In this work, we introduce a practical ondevice AI communication framework, integrated with physical layer (PHY) communication functions, demonstrated through its performance on a link-level simulator. Our framework incorporates end-to-end training with channel noise to enhance resilience, incorporates vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE) for efficient and robust communication, and utilizes pre-trained encoder-decoder transformers for improved generalization capabilities. Simulations, across various communication scenarios, reveal that our framework achieves a 50% reduction in transmission size while demonstrating substantial generalization ability and noise robustness under standardized 3GPP channel models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu He, Chieh-Yang Huang, Chien-Kuang Cornelia Ding, Shaurya Rohatgi, Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies indicated GPT-4 outperforms online crowd workers in data labeling accuracy, notably workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). However, these studies were criticized for deviating from standard crowdsourcing practices and emphasizing individual workers' performances over the whole data-annotation process. This paper compared GPT-4 and an ethical and well-executed MTurk pipeline, with 415 workers labeling 3,177 sentence segments from 200 scholarly articles using the CODA-19 scheme. Two worker interfaces yielded 127,080 labels, which were then used to infer the final labels through eight label-aggregation algorithms. Our evaluation showed that despite best practices, MTurk pipeline's highest accuracy was 81.5%, whereas GPT-4 achieved 83.6%. Interestingly, when combining GPT-4's labels with crowd labels collected via an advanced worker interface for aggregation, 2 out of the 8 algorithms achieved an even higher accuracy (87.5%, 87.0%). Further analysis suggested that, when the crowd's and GPT-4's labeling strengths are complementary, aggregating them could increase labeling accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated commendable performance across diverse domains. Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have revolutionized code generation ability by converting natural language descriptions into executable code. However, generating complex code within real-world scenarios remains challenging due to intricate structures, subtle bugs, understanding of advanced data types, and lack of supplementary contents. To address these challenges, we introduce the CoCoST framework, which enhances complex code generation by online searching for more information with planned queries and correctness testing for code refinement. Moreover, CoCoST serializes the complex inputs and outputs to improve comprehension and generates test cases to ensure the adaptability for real-world applications. CoCoST is validated through rigorous experiments on the DS-1000 and ClassEval datasets. Experimental results show that CoCoST substantially improves the quality of complex code generation, highlighting its potential to enhance the practicality of LLMs in generating complex code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Wang, Tianfan Fu, Yinlong Xu, Zihan Ma, Hongxia Xu, Yingzhou Lu, Bang Du, Honghao Gao, Jian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical trials are indispensable for medical research and the development of new treatments. However, clinical trials often involve thousands of participants and can span several years to complete, with a high probability of failure during the process. Recently, there has been a burgeoning interest in virtual clinical trials, which simulate real-world scenarios and hold the potential to significantly enhance patient safety, expedite development, reduce costs, and contribute to the broader scientific knowledge in healthcare. Existing research often focuses on leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) to support clinical trial outcome prediction. Yet, trained with limited clinical trial outcome data, existing approaches frequently struggle to perform accurate predictions. Some research has attempted to generate EHRs to augment model development but has fallen short in personalizing the generation for individual patient profiles. Recently, the emergence of large language models has illuminated new possibilities, as their embedded comprehensive clinical knowledge has proven beneficial in addressing medical issues. In this paper, we propose a large language model-based digital twin creation approach, called TWIN-GPT. TWIN-GPT can establish cross-dataset associations of medical information given limited data, generating unique personalized digital twins for different patients, thereby preserving individual patient characteristics. Comprehensive experiments show that using digital twins created by TWIN-GPT can boost the clinical trial outcome prediction, exceeding various previous prediction approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessio Ferrari, Sallam Abualhaija, Chetan Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: Complementing natural language (NL) requirements with graphical models can improve stakeholders' communication and provide directions for system design. However, creating models from requirements involves manual effort. The advent of generative large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT being a notable example, offers promising avenues for automated assistance in model generation. This paper investigates the capability of ChatGPT to generate a specific type of model, i.e., UML sequence diagrams, from NL requirements. We conduct a qualitative study in which we examine the sequence diagrams generated by ChatGPT for 28 requirements documents of various types and from different domains. Observations from the analysis of the generated diagrams have systematically been captured through evaluation logs, and categorized through thematic analysis. Our results indicate that, although the models generally conform to the standard and exhibit a reasonable level of understandability, their completeness and correctness with respect to the specified requirements often present challenges. This issue is particularly pronounced in the presence of requirements smells, such as ambiguity and inconsistency. The insights derived from this study can influence the practical utilization of LLMs in the RE process, and open the door to novel RE-specific prompting strategies targeting effective model generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avi Schwarzschild, Zhili Feng, Pratyush Maini, Zachary C. Lipton, J. Zico Kolter</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on web-scale datasets raise substantial concerns regarding permissible data usage. One major question is whether these models "memorize" all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information. The answer hinges, to a large degree, on how we define memorization. In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs. A given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt (much) shorter than the string itself -- in other words, if these strings can be "compressed" with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens. The ACR overcomes the limitations of existing notions of memorization by (i) offering an adversarial view of measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. Our definition serves as a practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios.</p>

Based on the formulation, we illustrate the difference between the uncertainty estimation for LLMs and that for standard ML models and explain why the hidden neurons of the LLMs may contain uncertainty information. Our designed approach demonstrates the benefits of utilizing hidden activations to enhance uncertainty estimation across various tasks and shows robust transferability in out-of-distribution settings. We distinguish the uncertainty estimation task from the uncertainty calibration task and show that a better uncertainty estimation mode leads to a better calibration performance. Furthermore, our method is easy to implement and adaptable to different levels of model accessibility including black box, grey box, and white box.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) trained on static, pre-collected, general datasets has sparked numerous research directions and applications. One such direction addresses the non-trivial challenge of integrating pre-trained LLMs into dynamic data distributions, task structures, and user preferences. Pre-trained LLMs, when tailored for specific needs, often experience significant performance degradation in previous knowledge domains -- a phenomenon known as "catastrophic forgetting". While extensively studied in the continual learning (CL) community, it presents new manifestations in the realm of LLMs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress on LLMs within the context of CL. This survey is structured into four main sections: we first describe an overview of continually learning LLMs, consisting of two directions of continuity: vertical continuity (or vertical continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation from general to specific capabilities, and horizontal continuity (or horizontal continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation across time and domains (Section 3). We then summarize three stages of learning LLMs in the context of modern CL: Continual Pre-Training (CPT), Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP), and Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) (Section 4). Then we provide an overview of evaluation protocols for continual learning with LLMs, along with the current available data sources (Section 5). Finally, we discuss intriguing questions pertaining to continual learning for LLMs (Section 6).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Miguel Vieira da Silva, Aljosha K\"ocher, Felix Gehlhoff, Alexander Fay</p>
<p>Abstract: Capability ontologies are increasingly used to model functionalities of systems or machines. The creation of such ontological models with all properties and constraints of capabilities is very complex and can only be done by ontology experts. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that they can generate machine-interpretable models from natural language text input and thus support engineers / ontology experts. Therefore, this paper investigates how LLMs can be used to create capability ontologies. We present a study with a series of experiments in which capabilities with varying complexities are generated using different prompting techniques and with different LLMs. Errors in the generated ontologies are recorded and compared. To analyze the quality of the generated ontologies, a semi-automated approach based on RDF syntax checking, OWL reasoning, and SHACL constraints is used. The results of this study are very promising because even for complex capabilities, the generated ontologies are almost free of errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steph Buongiorno, Lawrence Jake Klinkert, Tanishq Chawla, Zixin Zhuang, Corey Clark</p>
<p>Abstract: This research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI (PANGeA), a structured approach for leveraging large language models (LLMs), guided by a game designer's high-level criteria, to generate narrative content for turn-based role-playing video games (RPGs). Distinct from prior applications of LLMs used for video game design, PANGeA innovates by not only generating game level data (which includes, but is not limited to, setting, key items, and non-playable characters (NPCs)), but by also fostering dynamic, free-form interactions between the player and the environment that align with the procedural game narrative. The NPCs generated by PANGeA are personality-biased and express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their generated responses. PANGeA addresses challenges behind ingesting free-form text input, which can prompt LLM responses beyond the scope of the game narrative. A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluates text input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative. Making these interactions possible, PANGeA is supported by a server that hosts a custom memory system that supplies context for augmenting generated responses thus aligning them with the procedural narrative. For its broad application, the server has a REST interface enabling any game engine to integrate directly with PANGeA, as well as an LLM interface adaptable with local or private LLMs. PANGeA's ability to foster dynamic narrative generation by aligning responses with the procedural narrative is demonstrated through an empirical study and ablation test of two versions of a demo game.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aloni Cohen, Alexander Hoover, Gabe Schoenbach</p>
<p>Abstract: We study watermarking schemes for language models with provable guarantees. As we show, prior works offer no robustness guarantees against adaptive prompting: when a user queries a language model more than once, as even benign users do. And with just a single exception (Christ and Gunn, 2024), prior works are restricted to zero-bit watermarking: machine-generated text can be detected as such, but no additional information can be extracted from the watermark. Unfortunately, merely detecting AI-generated text may not prevent future abuses.
  We introduce multi-user watermarks, which allow tracing model-generated text to individual users or to groups of colluding users, even in the face of adaptive prompting. We construct multi-user watermarking schemes from undetectable, adaptively robust, zero-bit watermarking schemes (and prove that the undetectable zero-bit scheme of Christ, Gunn, and Zamir (2024) is adaptively robust). Importantly, our scheme provides both zero-bit and multi-user assurances at the same time. It detects shorter snippets just as well as the original scheme, and traces longer excerpts to individuals.
  The main technical component is a construction of message-embedding watermarks from zero-bit watermarks. Ours is the first generic reduction between watermarking schemes for language models. A challenge for such reductions is the lack of a unified abstraction for robustness -- that marked text is detectable even after edits. We introduce a new unifying abstraction called AEB-robustness. AEB-robustness provides that the watermark is detectable whenever the edited text "approximates enough blocks" of model-generated output.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13144">Mamo: a Mathematical Modeling Benchmark with Solvers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuhan Huang, Qingning Shen, Yan Hu, Anningzhe Gao, Benyou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical modeling involves representing real-world phenomena, systems, or problems using mathematical expressions and equations to analyze, understand, and predict their behavior. Given that this process typically requires experienced experts, there is an interest in exploring whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can undertake mathematical modeling to potentially decrease human labor. To evaluate of LLMs in mathematical modeling, we introduce a new benchmark, Mamo, that transcends traditional result-oriented assessments. Unlike conventional methods that primarily assess LLMs based on the accuracy of solutions to mathematical problems, our approach offers deeper insight into the modeling process itself. By focusing on the processes LLMs undertake rather than the correctness of their final solutions, Mamo pioneers a novel evaluation paradigm. This shift underscores the importance of understanding the inherent modeling capabilities of LLMs, paving the way for a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of their problem-solving strategies. Our work marks a significant advancement in the field, suggesting a new direction for future research by emphasizing the evaluation of LLMs' modeling processes over the mere correctness of answers. This benchmark not only facilitates a better understanding of LLMs' mathematical modeling capabilities but also sets a new standard for evaluating their performance in complex problem-solving scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoyao Xu, Xinjian Zhao, Xiaozhuang Song, Benyou Wang, Tianshu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a pioneering methodology for boosting large language models in the domain of protein representation learning. Our primary contribution lies in the refinement process for correlating the over-reliance on co-evolution knowledge, in a way that networks are trained to distill invaluable insights from negative samples, constituted by protein pairs sourced from disparate categories. By capitalizing on this novel approach, our technique steers the training of transformer-based models within the attention score space. This advanced strategy not only amplifies performance but also reflects the nuanced biological behaviors exhibited by proteins, offering aligned evidence with traditional biological mechanisms such as protein-protein interaction. We experimentally observed improved performance on various tasks over datasets, on top of several well-established large protein models. This innovative paradigm opens up promising horizons for further progress in the realms of protein research and computational biology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Esposito, Maryam Tavassoli Sabzevari, Boshuai Ye, Davide Falessi, Arif Ali Khan, Davide Taibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum computing, albeit readily available as hardware or emulated on the cloud, is still far from being available in general regarding complex programming paradigms and learning curves. This vision paper introduces $Classi|Q\rangle$, a translation framework idea to bridge Classical and Quantum Computing by translating high-level programming languages, e.g., Python or C++, into a low-level language, e.g., Quantum Assembly. Our idea paper serves as a blueprint for ongoing efforts in quantum software engineering, offering a roadmap for further $Classi|Q\rangle$ development to meet the diverse needs of researchers and practitioners. $Classi|Q\rangle$ is designed to empower researchers and practitioners with no prior quantum experience to harness the potential of hybrid quantum computation. We also discuss future enhancements to $Classi|Q\rangle$, including support for additional quantum languages, improved optimization strategies, and integration with emerging quantum computing platforms.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07588">AIM: Let Any Multi-modal Large Language Models Embrace Efficient In-Context Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Gao, Qian Qiao, Ziqiang Cao, Zili Wang, Wenjie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) facilitates Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibiting emergent ability on downstream tasks without updating billions of parameters. However, in the area of multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), two problems hinder the application of multi-modal ICL: (1) Most primary MLLMs are only trained on single-image datasets, making them unable to read multi-modal demonstrations. (2) With the demonstrations increasing, thousands of visual tokens highly challenge hardware and degrade ICL performance. During preliminary explorations, we discovered that the inner LLM tends to focus more on the linguistic modality within multi-modal demonstrations to generate responses. Therefore, we propose a general and light-weighted framework \textbf{AIM} to tackle the mentioned problems through \textbf{A}ggregating \textbf{I}mage information of \textbf{M}ultimodal demonstrations to the dense latent space of the corresponding linguistic part. Specifically, AIM first uses the frozen backbone MLLM to read each image-text demonstration and extracts the vector representations on top of the text. These vectors naturally fuse the information of the image-text pair, and AIM transforms them into fused virtual tokens acceptable for the inner LLM via a trainable projection layer. Ultimately, these fused tokens function as variants of multi-modal demonstrations, fed into the MLLM to direct its response to the current query as usual. Because these fused tokens stem from the textual component of the image-text pair, a multi-modal demonstration is nearly reduced to a pure textual demonstration, thus seamlessly applying to any MLLMs. With its de facto MLLM frozen, AIM is parameter-efficient and we train it on public multi-modal web corpora which have nothing to do with downstream test tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carson Denison, Monte MacDiarmid, Fazl Barez, David Duvenaud, Shauna Kravec, Samuel Marks, Nicholas Schiefer, Ryan Soklaski, Alex Tamkin, Jared Kaplan, Buck Shlegeris, Samuel R. Bowman, Ethan Perez, Evan Hubinger</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning, specification gaming occurs when AI systems learn undesired behaviors that are highly rewarded due to misspecified training goals. Specification gaming can range from simple behaviors like sycophancy to sophisticated and pernicious behaviors like reward-tampering, where a model directly modifies its own reward mechanism. However, these more pernicious behaviors may be too complex to be discovered via exploration. In this paper, we study whether Large Language Model (LLM) assistants which find easily discovered forms of specification gaming will generalize to perform rarer and more blatant forms, up to and including reward-tampering. We construct a curriculum of increasingly sophisticated gameable environments and find that training on early-curriculum environments leads to more specification gaming on remaining environments. Strikingly, a small but non-negligible proportion of the time, LLM assistants trained on the full curriculum generalize zero-shot to directly rewriting their own reward function. Retraining an LLM not to game early-curriculum environments mitigates, but does not eliminate, reward-tampering in later environments. Moreover, adding harmlessness training to our gameable environments does not prevent reward-tampering. These results demonstrate that LLMs can generalize from common forms of specification gaming to more pernicious reward tampering and that such behavior may be nontrivial to remove.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen T. Wang, Prateek Mittal, Dawn Song, Ruoxi Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Data Shapley provides a principled framework for attributing data's contribution within machine learning contexts. However, existing approaches require re-training models on different data subsets, which is computationally intensive, foreclosing their application to large-scale models. Furthermore, they produce the same attribution score for any models produced by running the learning algorithm, meaning they cannot perform targeted attribution towards a specific model obtained from a single run of the algorithm. This paper introduces In-Run Data Shapley, which addresses these limitations by offering scalable data attribution for a target model of interest. In its most efficient implementation, our technique incurs negligible additional runtime compared to standard model training. This dramatic efficiency improvement makes it possible to perform data attribution for the foundation model pretraining stage for the first time. We present several case studies that offer fresh insights into pretraining data's contribution and discuss their implications for copyright in generative AI and pretraining data curation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hejie Cui, Lingjun Mao, Xin Liang, Jieyu Zhang, Hui Ren, Quanzheng Li, Xiang Li, Carl Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have showcased impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning with visual and textual information. Adapting these foundation models trained for general usage to specialized domains like biomedicine requires large-scale domain-specific instruction datasets. While existing works have explored curating such datasets automatically, the resultant datasets are not explicitly aligned with domain expertise. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework, Biomedical Visual Instruction Tuning with Clinician Preference Alignment (BioMed-VITAL), that incorporates clinician preferences into both stages of generating and selecting instruction data for tuning biomedical multimodal foundation models. First, during the generation stage, we prompt the GPT-4V generator with a diverse set of clinician-selected demonstrations for preference-aligned data candidate generation. Then, during the selection phase, we train a separate selection model, which explicitly distills clinician and policy-guided model preferences into a rating function to select high-quality data for medical instruction tuning. Results show that the model tuned with the instruction-following data from our method demonstrates a significant improvement in open visual chat (18.5% relatively) and medical VQA (win rate up to 81.73%). Our instruction-following data and models are available at BioMed-VITAL.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amelie Gyrard, Seyedali Mohammadi, Manas Gaur, Antonio Kung</p>
<p>Abstract: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) give the UN a road map for development with Agenda 2030 as a target. SDG3 "Good Health and Well-Being" ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for all ages. Digital technologies can support SDG3. Burnout and even depression could be reduced by encouraging better preventive health. Due to the lack of patient knowledge and focus to take care of their health, it is necessary to help patients before it is too late. New trends such as positive psychology and mindfulness are highly encouraged in the USA. Digital Twin (DT) can help with the continuous monitoring of emotion using physiological signals (e.g., collected via wearables). Digital twins facilitate monitoring and provide constant health insight to improve quality of life and well-being with better personalization. Healthcare DT challenges are standardizing data formats, communication protocols, and data exchange mechanisms. To achieve those data integration and knowledge challenges, we designed the Mental Health Knowledge Graph (ontology and dataset) to boost mental health. The Knowledge Graph (KG) acquires knowledge from ontology-based mental health projects classified within the LOV4IoT ontology catalog (Emotion, Depression, and Mental Health). Furthermore, the KG is mapped to standards (e.g., ontologies) when possible. Standards from ETSI SmartM2M, ITU/WHO, ISO, W3C, NIST, and IEEE are relevant to mental health.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18665">RouteLLM: Learning to Route LLMs with Preference Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Ong, Amjad Almahairi, Vincent Wu, Wei-Lin Chiang, Tianhao Wu, Joseph E. Gonzalez, M Waleed Kadous, Ion Stoica</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet the choice of which model to use often involves a trade-off between performance and cost. More powerful models, though effective, come with higher expenses, while less capable models are more cost-effective. To address this dilemma, we propose several efficient router models that dynamically select between a stronger and a weaker LLM during inference, aiming to optimize the balance between cost and response quality. We develop a training framework for these routers leveraging human preference data and data augmentation techniques to enhance performance. Our evaluation on widely-recognized benchmarks shows that our approach significantly reduces costs-by over 2 times in certain cases-without compromising the quality of responses. Interestingly, our router models also demonstrate significant transfer learning capabilities, maintaining their performance even when the strong and weak models are changed at test time. This highlights the potential of these routers to provide a cost-effective yet high-performance solution for deploying LLMs.</p>
