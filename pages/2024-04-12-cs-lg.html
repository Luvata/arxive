<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Chen (LIG), Julien Cumin (LIG), Fano Ramparany (LIG), Dominique Vaufreydaz (LIG)</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents two models to address the problem of multi-person activity recognition using ambient sensors in a home. The first model, Seq2Res, uses a sequence generation approach to separate sensor events from different residents. The second model, BiGRU+Q2L, uses a Query2Label multi-label classifier to predict multiple activities simultaneously. Performances of these models are compared to a state-of-the-art model in different experimental scenarios, using a state-of-the-art dataset of two residents in a home instrumented with ambient sensors. These results lead to a discussion on the advantages and drawbacks of resident separation and multi-label classification for multi-person activity recognition.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07266">Sequential Decision Making with Expert Demonstrations under Unobserved Heterogeneity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vahid Balazadeh, Keertana Chidambaram, Viet Nguyen, Rahul G. Krishnan, Vasilis Syrgkanis</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of online sequential decision-making given auxiliary demonstrations from experts who made their decisions based on unobserved contextual information. These demonstrations can be viewed as solving related but slightly different tasks than what the learner faces. This setting arises in many application domains, such as self-driving cars, healthcare, and finance, where expert demonstrations are made using contextual information, which is not recorded in the data available to the learning agent. We model the problem as a zero-shot meta-reinforcement learning setting with an unknown task distribution and a Bayesian regret minimization objective, where the unobserved tasks are encoded as parameters with an unknown prior. We propose the Experts-as-Priors algorithm (ExPerior), a non-parametric empirical Bayes approach that utilizes the principle of maximum entropy to establish an informative prior over the learner's decision-making problem. This prior enables the application of any Bayesian approach for online decision-making, such as posterior sampling. We demonstrate that our strategy surpasses existing behaviour cloning and online algorithms for multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning, showcasing the utility of our approach in leveraging expert demonstrations across different decision-making setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shrey Gupta, Yongbee Park, Jianzhao Bi, Suyash Gupta, Andreas Z\"ufle, Avani Wildani, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Air pollution, especially particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5), is a pressing concern for public health and is difficult to estimate in developing countries (data-poor regions) due to a lack of ground sensors. Transfer learning models can be leveraged to solve this problem, as they use alternate data sources to gain knowledge (i.e., data from data-rich regions). However, current transfer learning methodologies do not account for dependencies between the source and the target domains. We recognize this transfer problem as spatial transfer learning and propose a new feature named Latent Dependency Factor (LDF) that captures spatial and semantic dependencies of both domains and is subsequently added to the datasets. We generate LDF using a novel two-stage autoencoder model that learns from clusters of similar source and target domain data. Our experiments show that transfer models using LDF have a $19.34\%$ improvement over the best-performing baselines. We additionally support our experiments with qualitative results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Hodel</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents code to procedurally generate examples for the ARC training tasks. For each of the 400 tasks, an example generator following the transformation logic of the original examples was created. In effect, the assumed underlying distribution of examples for any given task was reverse engineered by implementing a means to sample from it. An attempt was made to cover an as large as reasonable space of possible examples for each task. That is, whenever the original examples of a given task may be limited in their diversity e.g. by having the dimensions of the grids, the set of symbols or number of objects constant or within tight bounds, even though the transformation does not require it, such constraints were lifted. Having access to not just a few examples per task, as the case for ARC, but instead very many, should enable a wide range of experiments that may be important stepping stones towards making leaps on the benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Platnick, Sourena Khanzadeh, Alireza Sadeghian, Richard Anthony Valenzano</p>
<p>Abstract: Microplastic particle ingestion or inhalation by humans is a problem of growing concern. Unfortunately, current research methods that use machine learning to understand their potential harms are obstructed by a lack of available data. Deep learning techniques in particular are challenged by such domains where only small or imbalanced data sets are available. Overcoming this challenge often involves oversampling underrepresented classes or augmenting the existing data to improve model performance. This paper proposes GANsemble: a two-module framework connecting data augmentation with conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to generate class-conditioned synthetic data. First, the data chooser module automates augmentation strategy selection by searching for the best data augmentation strategy. Next, the cGAN module uses this strategy to train a cGAN for generating enhanced synthetic data. We experiment with the GANsemble framework on a small and imbalanced microplastics data set. A Microplastic-cGAN (MPcGAN) algorithm is introduced, and baselines for synthetic microplastics (SYMP) data are established in terms of Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Scores (IS). We also provide a synthetic microplastics filter (SYMP-Filter) algorithm to increase the quality of generated SYMP. Additionally, we show the best amount of oversampling with augmentation to fix class imbalance in small microplastics data sets. To our knowledge, this study is the first application of generative AI to synthetically create microplastics data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyas Chaudhari, Srinivasa Pranav, Jos\'e M. F. Moura</p>
<p>Abstract: Directly parameterizing and learning gradients of functions has widespread significance, with specific applications in optimization, generative modeling, and optimal transport. This paper introduces gradient networks (GradNets): novel neural network architectures that parameterize gradients of various function classes. GradNets exhibit specialized architectural constraints that ensure correspondence to gradient functions. We provide a comprehensive GradNet design framework that includes methods for transforming GradNets into monotone gradient networks (mGradNets), which are guaranteed to represent gradients of convex functions. We establish the approximation capabilities of the proposed GradNet and mGradNet. Our results demonstrate that these networks universally approximate the gradients of (convex) functions. Furthermore, these networks can be customized to correspond to specific spaces of (monotone) gradient functions, including gradients of transformed sums of (convex) ridge functions. Our analysis leads to two distinct GradNet architectures, GradNet-C and GradNet-M, and we describe the corresponding monotone versions, mGradNet-C and mGradNet-M. Our empirical results show that these architectures offer efficient parameterizations and outperform popular methods in gradient field learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahil Garg, Anderson Schneider, Anant Raj, Kashif Rasul, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Sneihil Gopal, Amit Dhurandhar, Guillermo Cecchi, Irina Rish</p>
<p>Abstract: Building on the remarkable achievements in generative sampling of natural images, we propose an innovative challenge, potentially overly ambitious, which involves generating samples of entire multivariate time series that resemble images. However, the statistical challenge lies in the small sample size, sometimes consisting of a few hundred subjects. This issue is especially problematic for deep generative models that follow the conventional approach of generating samples from a canonical distribution and then decoding or denoising them to match the true data distribution. In contrast, our method is grounded in information theory and aims to implicitly characterize the distribution of images, particularly the (global and local) dependency structure between pixels. We achieve this by empirically estimating its KL-divergence in the dual form with respect to the respective marginal distribution. This enables us to perform generative sampling directly in the optimized 1-D dual divergence space. Specifically, in the dual space, training samples representing the data distribution are embedded in the form of various clusters between two end points. In theory, any sample embedded between those two end points is in-distribution w.r.t. the data distribution. Our key idea for generating novel samples of images is to interpolate between the clusters via a walk as per gradients of the dual function w.r.t. the data dimensions. In addition to the data efficiency gained from direct sampling, we propose an algorithm that offers a significant reduction in sample complexity for estimating the divergence of the data distribution with respect to the marginal distribution. We provide strong theoretical guarantees along with an extensive empirical evaluation using many real-world datasets from diverse domains, establishing the superiority of our approach w.r.t. state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07395">Global versus Local: Evaluating AlexNet Architectures for Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vikas Dwivedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the destructive impacts of tropical cyclones, it is critical to have a reliable system for cyclone intensity detection. Various techniques are available for this purpose, each with differing levels of accuracy. In this paper, we introduce two ensemble-based models based on AlexNet architecture to estimate tropical cyclone intensity using visible satellite images. The first model, trained on the entire dataset, is called the global AlexNet model. The second model is a distributed version of AlexNet in which multiple AlexNets are trained separately on subsets of the training data categorized according to the Saffir-Simpson wind speed scale prescribed by the meterologists. We evaluated the performance of both models against a deep learning benchmark model called \textit{Deepti} using a publicly available cyclone image dataset. Results indicate that both the global model (with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.03 knots) and the distributed model (with a RMSE of 9.3 knots) outperform the benchmark model (with a RMSE of 13.62 knots). We provide a thorough discussion of our solution approach, including an explanantion of the AlexNet's performance using gradient class activation maps (grad-CAM). Our proposed solution strategy allows future experimentation with various deep learning models in both single and multi-channel settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Alipour-Vaezi, Kwok-Leung Tsui</p>
<p>Abstract: Portfolio management is one of the unresponded problems of the Motion Pictures Industry (MPI). To design an optimal portfolio for an MPI distributor, it is essential to predict the box office of each project. Moreover, for an accurate box office prediction, it is critical to consider the effect of the celebrities involved in each MPI project, which was impossible with any precedent expert-based method. Additionally, the asymmetric characteristic of MPI data decreases the performance of any predictive algorithm. In this paper, firstly, the fame score of the celebrities is determined using a large language model. Then, to tackle the asymmetric character of MPI's data, projects are classified. Furthermore, the box office prediction takes place for each class of projects. Finally, using a hybrid multi-attribute decision-making technique, the preferability of each project for the distributor is calculated, and benefiting from a bi-objective optimization model, the optimal portfolio is designed.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07446">Graph Attention Network for Lane-Wise and Topology-Invariant Intersection Traffic Simulation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nooshin Yousefzadeh, Rahul Sengupta, Yashaswi Karnati, Anand Rangarajan, Sanjay Ranka</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic congestion has significant economic, environmental, and social ramifications. Intersection traffic flow dynamics are influenced by numerous factors. While microscopic traffic simulators are valuable tools, they are computationally intensive and challenging to calibrate. Moreover, existing machine-learning approaches struggle to provide lane-specific waveforms or adapt to intersection topology and traffic patterns. In this study, we propose two efficient and accurate "Digital Twin" models for intersections, leveraging Graph Attention Neural Networks (GAT). These attentional graph auto-encoder digital twins capture temporal, spatial, and contextual aspects of traffic within intersections, incorporating various influential factors such as high-resolution loop detector waveforms, signal state records, driving behaviors, and turning-movement counts. Trained on diverse counterfactual scenarios across multiple intersections, our models generalize well, enabling the estimation of detailed traffic waveforms for any intersection approach and exit lanes. Multi-scale error metrics demonstrate that our models perform comparably to microsimulations. The primary application of our study lies in traffic signal optimization, a pivotal area in transportation systems research. These lightweight digital twins can seamlessly integrate into corridor and network signal timing optimization frameworks. Furthermore, our study's applications extend to lane reconfiguration, driving behavior analysis, and facilitating informed decisions regarding intersection safety and efficiency enhancements. A promising avenue for future research involves extending this approach to urban freeway corridors and integrating it with measures of effectiveness metrics.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07454">Representation Learning of Tangled Key-Value Sequence Data for Early Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Duan, Junzhou Zhao, Shuo Zhang, Jing Tao, Pinghui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Key-value sequence data has become ubiquitous and naturally appears in a variety of real-world applications, ranging from the user-product purchasing sequences in e-commerce, to network packet sequences forwarded by routers in networking. Classifying these key-value sequences is important in many scenarios such as user profiling and malicious applications identification. In many time-sensitive scenarios, besides the requirement of classifying a key-value sequence accurately, it is also desired to classify a key-value sequence early, in order to respond fast. However, these two goals are conflicting in nature, and it is challenging to achieve them simultaneously. In this work, we formulate a novel tangled key-value sequence early classification problem, where a tangled key-value sequence is a mixture of several concurrent key-value sequences with different keys. The goal is to classify each individual key-value sequence sharing a same key both accurately and early. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, i.e., Key-Value sequence Early Co-classification (KVEC), which leverages both inner- and inter-correlations of items in a tangled key-value sequence through key correlation and value correlation to learn a better sequence representation. Meanwhile, a time-aware halting policy decides when to stop the ongoing key-value sequence and classify it based on current sequence representation. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines significantly. KVEC improves the prediction accuracy by up to $4.7 - 17.5\%$ under the same prediction earliness condition, and improves the harmonic mean of accuracy and earliness by up to $3.7 - 14.0\%$.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07465">Leveraging Domain-Unlabeled Data in Offline Reinforcement Learning across Two Domains</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Soichiro Nishimori, Xin-Qiang Cai, Johannes Ackermann, Masashi Sugiyama</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an offline reinforcement learning (RL) problem where datasets are collected from two domains. In this scenario, having datasets with domain labels facilitates efficient policy training. However, in practice, the task of assigning domain labels can be resource-intensive or infeasible at a large scale, leading to a prevalence of domain-unlabeled data. To formalize this challenge, we introduce a novel offline RL problem setting named Positive-Unlabeled Offline RL (PUORL), which incorporates domain-unlabeled data. To address PUORL, we develop an offline RL algorithm utilizing positive-unlabeled learning to predict the domain labels of domain-unlabeled data, enabling the integration of this data into policy training. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our method in accurately identifying domains and learning policies that outperform baselines in the PUORL setting, highlighting its capability to leverage domain-unlabeled data effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of tasks by encoding features combined with topology to create effective representations. However, the fundamental problem of understanding and analyzing how graph topology influences the performance of learning models on downstream tasks has not yet been well understood. In this paper, we propose a metric, TopoInf, which characterizes the influence of graph topology by measuring the level of compatibility between the topological information of graph data and downstream task objectives. We provide analysis based on the decoupled GNNs on the contextual stochastic block model to demonstrate the effectiveness of the metric. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TopoInf is an effective metric for measuring topological influence on corresponding tasks and can be further leveraged to enhance graph learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rub\'en Ruiz-Torrubiano</p>
<p>Abstract: Providing explanations about how machine learning algorithms work and/or make particular predictions is one of the main tools that can be used to improve their trusworthiness, fairness and robustness. Among the most intuitive type of explanations are counterfactuals, which are examples that differ from a given point only in the prediction target and some set of features, presenting which features need to be changed in the original example to flip the prediction for that example. However, such counterfactuals can have many different features than the original example, making their interpretation difficult. In this paper, we propose to explicitly add a cardinality constraint to counterfactual generation limiting how many features can be different from the original example, thus providing more interpretable and easily understantable counterfactuals.</p>

To adapt this method to RL settings, we address several issues, including unknown f* in the Polyak step-size. Additionally, we showcase the performance of the Polyak step-size in RL through experiments, demonstrating faster convergence and the attainment of more stable policies.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Bayesian model compression in federated learning (FL) to construct sparse models that can achieve both communication and computation efficiencies. We propose a decentralized Turbo variational Bayesian inference (D-Turbo-VBI) FL framework where we firstly propose a hierarchical sparse prior to promote a clustered sparse structure in the weight matrix. Then, by carefully integrating message passing and VBI with a decentralized turbo framework, we propose the D-Turbo-VBI algorithm which can (i) reduce both upstream and downstream communication overhead during federated training, and (ii) reduce the computational complexity during local inference. Additionally, we establish the convergence property for thr proposed D-Turbo-VBI algorithm. Simulation results show the significant gain of our proposed algorithm over the baselines in reducing communication overhead during federated training and computational complexity of final model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankit K. Bhagat, Dipika Jha, Raju Halder, Rajendra N. Paramanik, Chandra M. Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents IITP-VDLand, a comprehensive dataset of Decentraland parcels sourced from diverse platforms. Unlike existing datasets which have limited attributes and records, IITP-VDLand offers a rich array of attributes, encompassing parcel characteristics, trading history, past activities, transactions, and social media interactions. Alongside, we introduce a key attribute in the dataset, namely Rarity score, which measures the uniqueness of each parcel within the virtual world. Addressing the significant challenge posed by the dispersed nature of this data across various sources, we employ a systematic approach, utilizing both available APIs and custom scripts, to gather it. Subsequently, we meticulously curate and organize the information into four distinct segments: (1) Characteristics Data-Fragment, (2) OpenSea Trading History Data-Fragment, (3) Ethereum Activity Transactions Data-Fragment, and (4) Social Media Data-Fragment. We envisage that this dataset would serve as a robust resource for training machine- and deep-learning models specifically designed to address real-world challenges within the domain of Decentraland parcels. The performance benchmarking of more than 20 state-of-the-art price prediction models on our dataset yields promising results, achieving a maximum R2 score of 0.8251 and an accuracy of 74.23% in case of Extra Trees Regressor and Classifier. The key findings reveal that the ensemble models performs better than both deep learning and linear models for our dataset. We observe a significant impact of coordinates, geographical proximity, rarity score, and few other economic indicators on the prediction of parcel prices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan Qiao, Yu-Xiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning (multi-agent RL) with differential privacy (DP) constraints. This is well-motivated by various real-world applications involving sensitive data, where it is critical to protect users' private information. We first extend the definitions of Joint DP (JDP) and Local DP (LDP) to two-player zero-sum episodic Markov Games, where both definitions ensure trajectory-wise privacy protection. Then we design a provably efficient algorithm based on optimistic Nash value iteration and privatization of Bernstein-type bonuses. The algorithm is able to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements when instantiated with appropriate privacy mechanisms. Furthermore, for both notions of DP, our regret bound generalizes the best known result under the single-agent RL case, while our regret could also reduce to the best known result for multi-agent RL without privacy constraints. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first line of results towards understanding trajectory-wise privacy protection in multi-agent RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lidang Jiang, Changyan Hu, Sibei Ji, Hang Zhao, Junxiong Chen, Ge He</p>
<p>Abstract: In optimizing performance and extending the lifespan of lithium batteries, accurate state prediction is pivotal. Traditional regression and classification methods have achieved some success in battery state prediction. However, the efficacy of these data-driven approaches heavily relies on the availability and quality of public datasets. Additionally, generating electrochemical data predominantly through battery experiments is a lengthy and costly process, making it challenging to acquire high-quality electrochemical data. This difficulty, coupled with data incompleteness, significantly impacts prediction accuracy. Addressing these challenges, this study introduces the End of Life (EOL) and Equivalent Cycle Life (ECL) as conditions for generative AI models. By integrating an embedding layer into the CVAE model, we developed the Refined Conditional Variational Autoencoder (RCVAE). Through preprocessing data into a quasi-video format, our study achieves an integrated synthesis of electrochemical data, including voltage, current, temperature, and charging capacity, which is then processed by the RCVAE model. Coupled with customized training and inference algorithms, this model can generate specific electrochemical data for EOL and ECL under supervised conditions. This method provides users with a comprehensive electrochemical dataset, pioneering a new research domain for the artificial synthesis of lithium battery data. Furthermore, based on the detailed synthetic data, various battery state indicators can be calculated, offering new perspectives and possibilities for lithium battery performance prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, Apivich Hemachandra, See-Kiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which incorporate PDEs as soft constraints, train with a composite loss function that contains multiple training point types: different types of collocation points chosen during training to enforce each PDE and initial/boundary conditions, and experimental points which are usually costly to obtain via experiments or simulations. Training PINNs using this loss function is challenging as it typically requires selecting large numbers of points of different types, each with different training dynamics. Unlike past works that focused on the selection of either collocation or experimental points, this work introduces PINN Adaptive ColLocation and Experimental points selection (PINNACLE), the first algorithm that jointly optimizes the selection of all training point types, while automatically adjusting the proportion of collocation point types as training progresses. PINNACLE uses information on the interaction among training point types, which had not been considered before, based on an analysis of PINN training dynamics via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). We theoretically show that the criterion used by PINNACLE is related to the PINN generalization error, and empirically demonstrate that PINNACLE is able to outperform existing point selection methods for forward, inverse, and transfer learning problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Li, Martin Trapp, Marcus Klasson, Arno Solin</p>
<p>Abstract: Deployment of deep neural networks in real-world settings typically requires adaptation to new tasks with few examples. Few-shot classification (FSC) provides a solution to this problem by leveraging pre-trained backbones for fast adaptation to new classes. Surprisingly, most efforts have only focused on developing architectures for easing the adaptation to the target domain without considering the importance of backbone training for good generalisation. We show that flatness-aware backbone training with vanilla fine-tuning results in a simpler yet competitive baseline compared to the state-of-the-art. Our results indicate that for in- and cross-domain FSC, backbone training is crucial to achieving good generalisation across different adaptation methods. We advocate more care should be taken when training these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Mari, Andr\'e F. R. Guarda, Nuno M. M. Rodrigues, Simone Milani, Fernando Pereira</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread usage of point clouds (PC) for immersive visual applications has resulted in the use of very heterogeneous receiving conditions and devices, notably in terms of network, hardware, and display capabilities. In this scenario, quality scalability, i.e., the ability to reconstruct a signal at different qualities by progressively decoding a single bitstream, is a major requirement that has yet to be conveniently addressed, notably in most learning-based PC coding solutions. This paper proposes a quality scalability scheme, named Scalable Quality Hyperprior (SQH), adaptable to learning-based static point cloud geometry codecs, which uses a Quality-conditioned Latents Probability Estimator (QuLPE) to decode a high-quality version of a PC learning-based representation, based on an available lower quality base layer. SQH is integrated in the future JPEG PC coding standard, allowing to create a layered bitstream that can be used to progressively decode the PC geometry with increasing quality and fidelity. Experimental results show that SQH offers the quality scalability feature with very limited or no compression performance penalty at all when compared with the corresponding non-scalable solution, thus preserving the significant compression gains over other state-of-the-art PC codecs.</p>

<p>Abstract: A method for learning Hamiltonian dynamics from a limited and noisy dataset is proposed. The method learns a Hamiltonian vector field on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of inherently Hamiltonian vector fields, and in particular, odd Hamiltonian vector fields. This is done with a symplectic kernel, and it is shown how the kernel can be modified to an odd symplectic kernel to impose the odd symmetry. A random feature approximation is developed for the proposed kernel to reduce the problem size. This includes random feature approximations for odd kernels. The performance of the method is validated in simulations for three Hamiltonian systems. It is demonstrated that the use of an odd symplectic kernel improves prediction accuracy, and that the learned vector fields are Hamiltonian and exhibit the imposed odd symmetry characteristics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is crucial for evaluating adaptability in learning solutions to retain knowledge. Our research addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where models lose proficiency in previously learned tasks as they acquire new ones. While numerous solutions have been proposed, existing experimental setups often rely on idealized class-incremental learning scenarios. We introduce Realistic Continual Learning (RealCL), a novel CL paradigm where class distributions across tasks are random, departing from structured setups.
  We also present CLARE (Continual Learning Approach with pRE-trained models for RealCL scenarios), a pre-trained model-based solution designed to integrate new knowledge while preserving past learning. Our contributions include pioneering RealCL as a generalization of traditional CL setups, proposing CLARE as an adaptable approach for RealCL tasks, and conducting extensive experiments demonstrating its effectiveness across various RealCL scenarios. Notably, CLARE outperforms existing models on RealCL benchmarks, highlighting its versatility and robustness in unpredictable learning environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minshuo Chen, Song Mei, Jianqing Fan, Mengdi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models, a powerful and universal generative AI technology, have achieved tremendous success in computer vision, audio, reinforcement learning, and computational biology. In these applications, diffusion models provide flexible high-dimensional data modeling, and act as a sampler for generating new samples under active guidance towards task-desired properties. Despite the significant empirical success, theory of diffusion models is very limited, potentially slowing down principled methodological innovations for further harnessing and improving diffusion models. In this paper, we review emerging applications of diffusion models, understanding their sample generation under various controls. Next, we overview the existing theories of diffusion models, covering their statistical properties and sampling capabilities. We adopt a progressive routine, beginning with unconditional diffusion models and connecting to conditional counterparts. Further, we review a new avenue in high-dimensional structured optimization through conditional diffusion models, where searching for solutions is reformulated as a conditional sampling problem and solved by diffusion models. Lastly, we discuss future directions about diffusion models. The purpose of this paper is to provide a well-rounded theoretical exposure for stimulating forward-looking theories and methods of diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Namasivayam Kalithasan, Sachit Sachdeva, Himanshu Gaurav Singh, Divyanshu Aggarwal, Gurarmaan Singh Panjeta, Vishal Bindal, Arnav Tuli, Rohan Paul, Parag Singla</p>
<p>Abstract: Our goal is to build embodied agents that can learn inductively generalizable spatial concepts in a continual manner, e.g, constructing a tower of a given height. Existing work suffers from certain limitations (a) (Liang et al., 2023) and their multi-modal extensions, rely heavily on prior knowledge and are not grounded in the demonstrations (b) (Liu et al., 2023) lack the ability to generalize due to their purely neural approach. A key challenge is to achieve a fine balance between symbolic representations which have the capability to generalize, and neural representations that are physically grounded. In response, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach by expressing inductive concepts as symbolic compositions over grounded neural concepts. Our key insight is to decompose the concept learning problem into the following steps 1) Sketch: Getting a programmatic representation for the given instruction 2) Plan: Perform Model-Based RL over the sequence of grounded neural action concepts to learn a grounded plan 3) Generalize: Abstract out a generic (lifted) Python program to facilitate generalizability. Continual learning is achieved by interspersing learning of grounded neural concepts with higher level symbolic constructs. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of its ability to learn novel concepts and generalize inductively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Practical applications of artificial intelligence increasingly often have to deal with the streaming properties of real data, which, considering the time factor, are subject to phenomena such as periodicity and more or less chaotic degeneration - resulting directly in the concept drifts. The modern concept drift detectors almost always assume immediate access to labels, which due to their cost, limited availability and possible delay has been shown to be unrealistic. This work proposes an unsupervised Parallel Activations Drift Detector, utilizing the outputs of an untrained neural network, presenting its key design elements, intuitions about processing properties, and a pool of computer experiments demonstrating its competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07815">Post-Hoc Reversal: Are We Selecting Models Prematurely?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishabh Ranjan, Saurabh Garg, Mrigank Raman, Carlos Guestrin, Zachary Chase Lipton</p>
<p>Abstract: Trained models are often composed with post-hoc transforms such as temperature scaling (TS), ensembling and stochastic weight averaging (SWA) to improve performance, robustness, uncertainty estimation, etc. However, such transforms are typically applied only after the base models have already been finalized by standard means. In this paper, we challenge this practice with an extensive empirical study. In particular, we demonstrate a phenomenon that we call post-hoc reversal, where performance trends are reversed after applying these post-hoc transforms. This phenomenon is especially prominent in high-noise settings. For example, while base models overfit badly early in training, both conventional ensembling and SWA favor base models trained for more epochs. Post-hoc reversal can also suppress the appearance of double descent and mitigate mismatches between test loss and test error seen in base models. Based on our findings, we propose post-hoc selection, a simple technique whereby post-hoc metrics inform model development decisions such as early stopping, checkpointing, and broader hyperparameter choices. Our experimental analyses span real-world vision, language, tabular and graph datasets from domains like satellite imaging, language modeling, census prediction and social network analysis. On an LLM instruction tuning dataset, post-hoc selection results in > 1.5x MMLU improvement compared to naive selection. Code is available at https://github.com/rishabh-ranjan/post-hoc-reversal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lanpei Li, Elia Piccoli, Andrea Cossu, Davide Bacciu, Vincenzo Lomonaco</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) focuses on maximizing the predictive performance of a model across a non-stationary stream of data. Unfortunately, CL models tend to forget previous knowledge, thus often underperforming when compared with an offline model trained jointly on the entire data stream. Given that any CL model will eventually make mistakes, it is of crucial importance to build calibrated CL models: models that can reliably tell their confidence when making a prediction. Model calibration is an active research topic in machine learning, yet to be properly investigated in CL. We provide the first empirical study of the behavior of calibration approaches in CL, showing that CL strategies do not inherently learn calibrated models. To mitigate this issue, we design a continual calibration approach that improves the performance of post-processing calibration methods over a wide range of different benchmarks and CL strategies. CL does not necessarily need perfect predictive models, but rather it can benefit from reliable predictive models. We believe our study on continual calibration represents a first step towards this direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuseppe Canonaco, Leo Ardon, Alberto Pozanco, Daniel Borrajo</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of Potential Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) has shown great promise in the ongoing research effort to tackle sample inefficiency in Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, the choice of the potential function is critical for this technique to be effective. Additionally, RL techniques are usually constrained to use a finite horizon for computational limitations. This introduces a bias when using PBRS, thus adding an additional layer of complexity. In this paper, we leverage abstractions to automatically produce a "good" potential function. We analyse the bias induced by finite horizons in the context of PBRS producing novel insights. Finally, to asses sample efficiency and performance impact, we evaluate our approach on four environments including a goal-oriented navigation task and three Arcade Learning Environments (ALE) games demonstrating that we can reach the same level of performance as CNN-based solutions with a simple fully-connected network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Przemys{\l}aw Wrona, Maciej Grzenda, Marcin Luckner</p>
<p>Abstract: Public transport systems are expected to reduce pollution and contribute to sustainable development. However, disruptions in public transport such as delays may negatively affect mobility choices. To quantify delays, aggregated data from vehicle locations systems are frequently used. However, delays observed at individual stops are caused inter alia by fluctuations in running times and propagation of delays occurring in other locations. Hence, in this work, we propose both the method detecting significant delays and reference architecture, relying on stream processing engines, in which the method is implemented. The method can complement the calculation of delays defined as deviation from schedules. This provides both online rather than batch identification of significant and repetitive delays, and resilience to the limited quality of location data. The method we propose can be used with different change detectors, such as ADWIN, applied to location data stream shuffled to individual edges of a transport graph. It can detect in an online manner at which edges statistically significant delays are observed and at which edges delays arise and are reduced. Detections can be used to model mobility choices and quantify the impact of repetitive rather than random disruptions on feasible trips with multimodal trip modelling engines. The evaluation performed with the public transport data of over 2000 vehicles confirms the merits of the method and reveals that a limited-size subgraph of a transport system graph causes statistically significant delays</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SangWoo Park, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
<p>Abstract: An important tool grid operators use to safeguard against failures, whether naturally occurring or malicious, involves detecting anomalies in the power system SCADA data. In this paper, we aim to solve a real-time anomaly detection problem. Given time-series measurement values coming from a fixed set of sensors on the grid, can we identify anomalies in the network topology or measurement data? Existing methods, primarily optimization-based, mostly use only a single snapshot of the measurement values and do not scale well with the network size. Recent data-driven ML techniques have shown promise by using a combination of current and historical data for anomaly detection but generally do not consider physical attributes like the impact of topology or load/generation changes on sensor measurements and thus cannot accommodate regular context-variability in the historical data. To address this gap, we propose a novel context-aware anomaly detection algorithm, GridCAL, that considers the effect of regular topology and load/generation changes. This algorithm converts the real-time power flow measurements to context-agnostic values, which allows us to analyze measurement coming from different grid contexts in an aggregate fashion, enabling us to derive a unified statistical model that becomes the basis of anomaly detection. Through numerical simulations on networks up to 2383 nodes, we show that our approach is accurate, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, and is computationally efficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in real-world dynamic systems, predicting future changes using historical data from diverse locations. Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data, yet their accuracy fails to show sustained improvement. Besides, these methods also overlook node heterogeneity, hindering customized prediction modules from handling diverse regional nodes effectively. In this paper, our goal is not to propose a new model but to present a novel low-rank adaptation framework as an off-the-shelf plugin for existing spatial-temporal prediction models, termed ST-LoRA, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we first tailor a node adaptive low-rank layer comprising multiple trainable low-rank matrices. Additionally, we devise a multi-layer residual fusion stacking module, injecting the low-rank adapters into predictor modules of various models. Across six real-world traffic datasets and six different types of spatio-temporal prediction models, our approach minimally increases the parameters and training time of the original models by less than 4%, still achieving consistent and sustained performance enhancement.</p>

Predominantly, Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs) and Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely employed in this domain. While LSTMs are applicable in both rainfall-runoff and time series settings, CNN-LSTMs have primarily been utilized in rainfall-runoff scenarios. In this study, we extend the application of CNN-LSTMs to time series settings, leveraging lagged streamflow data in conjunction with precipitation and temperature data to predict streamflow. Our results show a substantial improvement in predictive performance in 21 out of 32 HUC8 basins in Nebraska, showcasing noteworthy increases in the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) values.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07946">Towards Faster Training of Diffusion Models: An Inspiration of A Consistency Phenomenon</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianshuo Xu, Peng Mi, Ruilin Wang, Yingcong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are a powerful generative framework that have attracted significant attention in recent years. However, the high computational cost of training DMs limits their practical applications. In this paper, we start with a consistency phenomenon of DMs: we observe that DMs with different initializations or even different architectures can produce very similar outputs given the same noise inputs, which is rare in other generative models. We attribute this phenomenon to two factors: (1) the learning difficulty of DMs is lower when the noise-prediction diffusion model approaches the upper bound of the timestep (the input becomes pure noise), where the structural information of the output is usually generated; and (2) the loss landscape of DMs is highly smooth, which implies that the model tends to converge to similar local minima and exhibit similar behavior patterns. This finding not only reveals the stability of DMs, but also inspires us to devise two strategies to accelerate the training of DMs. First, we propose a curriculum learning based timestep schedule, which leverages the noise rate as an explicit indicator of the learning difficulty and gradually reduces the training frequency of easier timesteps, thus improving the training efficiency. Second, we propose a momentum decay strategy, which reduces the momentum coefficient during the optimization process, as the large momentum may hinder the convergence speed and cause oscillations due to the smoothness of the loss landscape. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies on various models and show that they can significantly reduce the training time and improve the quality of the generated images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naichen Shi, Salar Fattahi, Raed Al Kontar</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of common and unique feature extraction from noisy data. When we have N observation matrices from N different and associated sources corrupted by sparse and potentially gross noise, can we recover the common and unique components from these noisy observations? This is a challenging task as the number of parameters to estimate is approximately thrice the number of observations. Despite the difficulty, we propose an intuitive alternating minimization algorithm called triple component matrix factorization (TCMF) to recover the three components exactly. TCMF is distinguished from existing works in literature thanks to two salient features. First, TCMF is a principled method to separate the three components given noisy observations provably. Second, the bulk of the computation in TCMF can be distributed. On the technical side, we formulate the problem as a constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem. Despite the intricate nature of the problem, we provide a Taylor series characterization of its solution by solving the corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Using this characterization, we can show that the alternating minimization algorithm makes significant progress at each iteration and converges into the ground truth at a linear rate. Numerical experiments in video segmentation and anomaly detection highlight the superior feature extraction abilities of TCMF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lujie Yang, Hongkai Dai, Zhouxing Shi, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Russ Tedrake, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressive empirical performance in a wide range of tasks in robotics and control. However, formal (Lyapunov) stability guarantees over the region-of-attraction (ROA) for NN controllers with nonlinear dynamical systems are challenging to obtain, and most existing approaches rely on expensive solvers such as sums-of-squares (SOS), mixed-integer programming (MIP), or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). In this paper, we demonstrate a new framework for learning NN controllers together with Lyapunov certificates using fast empirical falsification and strategic regularizations. We propose a novel formulation that defines a larger verifiable region-of-attraction (ROA) than shown in the literature, and refines the conventional restrictive constraints on Lyapunov derivatives to focus only on certifiable ROAs. The Lyapunov condition is rigorously verified post-hoc using branch-and-bound with scalable linear bound propagation-based NN verification techniques. The approach is efficient and flexible, and the full training and verification procedure is accelerated on GPUs without relying on expensive solvers for SOS, MIP, nor SMT. The flexibility and efficiency of our framework allow us to demonstrate Lyapunov-stable output feedback control with synthesized NN-based controllers and NN-based observers with formal stability guarantees, for the first time in literature.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mian Qin, Junhao Ding, Shuo Qu, Xu Song, Charlie C. L. Wang, Wei-Hsin Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a widely used metal additive manufacturing technology. However, the accumulation of internal residual stress during printing can cause significant distortion and potential failure. Although various scan patterns have been studied to reduce possible accumulated stress, such as zigzag scanning vectors with changing directions or a chessboard-based scan pattern with divided small islands, most conventional scan patterns cannot significantly reduce residual stress. The proposed adaptive toolpath generation (ATG) algorithms, aiming to minimize the thermal gradients, may result in extremely accumulated temperature fields in some cases. To address these issues, we developed a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based toolpath generation framework, with the goal of achieving uniformly distributed heat and avoiding extremely thermal accumulation regions during the LPBF process. We first developed an overall pipeline for the DRL-based toolpath generation framework, which includes uniformly sampling, agent moving and environment observation, action selection, moving constraints, rewards calculation, and the training process. To accelerate the training process, we simplified the data-intensive numerical model by considering the turning angles on the toolpath. We designed the action spaces with three options, including the minimum temperature value, the smoothest path, and the second smoothest path. The reward function was designed to minimize energy density to ensure the temperature field remains relatively stable. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based toolpath generation framework, we performed numerical simulations of polygon shape printing domains. In addition, four groups of thin plate samples with different scan patterns were compared using the LPBF process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwoong Im, Nayoung Kwon, Taewoo Park, Jiheon Woo, Jaeho Lee, Yongjune Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a communication-efficient collaborative inference framework in the domain of edge inference, focusing on the efficient use of vision transformer (ViTs) models. The partitioning strategy of conventional collaborative inference fails to reduce communication cost because of the inherent architecture of ViTs maintaining consistent layer dimensions across the entire transformer encoder. Therefore, instead of employing the partitioning strategy, our framework utilizes a lightweight ViT model on the edge device, with the server deploying a complicated ViT model. To enhance communication efficiency and achieve the classification accuracy of the server model, we propose two strategies: 1) attention-aware patch selection and 2) entropy-aware image transmission. Attention-aware patch selection leverages the attention scores generated by the edge device's transformer encoder to identify and select the image patches critical for classification. This strategy enables the edge device to transmit only the essential patches to the server, significantly improving communication efficiency. Entropy-aware image transmission uses min-entropy as a metric to accurately determine whether to depend on the lightweight model on the edge device or to request the inference from the server model. In our framework, the lightweight ViT model on the edge device acts as a semantic encoder, efficiently identifying and selecting the crucial image information required for the classification task. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed collaborative inference framework can reduce communication overhead by 68% with only a minimal loss in accuracy compared to the server model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaowei Wei, Zhengwei Wu, Xin Li, Qintong Wu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Lihong Gu, Jinjie Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential recommendation methods play a pivotal role in modern recommendation systems. A key challenge lies in accurately modeling user preferences in the face of data sparsity. To tackle this challenge, recent methods leverage contrastive learning (CL) to derive self-supervision signals by maximizing the mutual information of two augmented views of the original user behavior sequence. Despite their effectiveness, CL-based methods encounter a limitation in fully exploiting self-supervision signals for users with limited behavior data, as users with extensive behaviors naturally offer more information. To address this problem, we introduce a novel learning paradigm, named Online Self-Supervised Self-distillation for Sequential Recommendation ($S^4$Rec), effectively bridging the gap between self-supervised learning and self-distillation methods. Specifically, we employ online clustering to proficiently group users by their distinct latent intents. Additionally, an adversarial learning strategy is utilized to ensure that the clustering procedure is not affected by the behavior length factor. Subsequently, we employ self-distillation to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from users with extensive behaviors (teachers) to users with limited behaviors (students). Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method\footnote{Code is available at https://github.com/xjaw/S4Rec</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spurthi Setty, Katherine Jijo, Eden Chung, Natan Vidra</p>
<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate responses relies heavily on the quality of input provided, particularly when employing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. RAG enhances LLMs by sourcing the most relevant text chunk(s) to base queries upon. Despite the significant advancements in LLMs' response quality in recent years, users may still encounter inaccuracies or irrelevant answers; these issues often stem from suboptimal text chunk retrieval by RAG rather than the inherent capabilities of LLMs. To augment the efficacy of LLMs, it is crucial to refine the RAG process. This paper explores the existing constraints of RAG pipelines and introduces methodologies for enhancing text retrieval. It delves into strategies such as sophisticated chunking techniques, query expansion, the incorporation of metadata annotations, the application of re-ranking algorithms, and the fine-tuning of embedding algorithms. Implementing these approaches can substantially improve the retrieval quality, thereby elevating the overall performance and reliability of LLMs in processing and responding to queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngbin Lee, Yejin Kim, Yongjae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In complex financial markets, recommender systems can play a crucial role in empowering individuals to make informed decisions. Existing studies predominantly focus on price prediction, but even the most sophisticated models cannot accurately predict stock prices. Also, many studies show that most individual investors do not follow established investment theories because they have their own preferences. Hence, the tricky point in stock recommendation is that recommendations should give good investment performance but also should not ignore individual preferences. To develop effective stock recommender systems, it is essential to consider three key aspects: 1) individual preferences, 2) portfolio diversification, and 3) temporal aspect of both stock features and individual preferences. In response, we develop the portfolio temporal graph network recommender PfoTGNRec, which can handle time-varying collaborative signals and incorporates diversification-enhancing contrastive learning. As a result, our model demonstrated superior performance compared to various baselines, including cutting-edge dynamic embedding models and existing stock recommendation models, in a sense that our model exhibited good investment performance while maintaining competitive in capturing individual preferences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco de Arriba-P\'erez, Silvia Garc\'ia-M\'endez, Jos\'e A. Regueiro-Janeiro, Francisco J. Gonz\'alez-Casta\~no</p>
<p>Abstract: Micro-blogging sources such as the Twitter social network provide valuable real-time data for market prediction models. Investors' opinions in this network follow the fluctuations of the stock markets and often include educated speculations on market opportunities that may have impact on the actions of other investors. In view of this, we propose a novel system to detect positive predictions in tweets, a type of financial emotions which we term "opportunities" that are akin to "anticipation" in Plutchik's theory. Specifically, we seek a high detection precision to present a financial operator a substantial amount of such tweets while differentiating them from the rest of financial emotions in our system. We achieve it with a three-layer stacked Machine Learning classification system with sophisticated features that result from applying Natural Language Processing techniques to extract valuable linguistic information. Experimental results on a dataset that has been manually annotated with financial emotion and ticker occurrence tags demonstrate that our system yields satisfactory and competitive performance in financial opportunity detection, with precision values up to 83%. This promising outcome endorses the usability of our system to support investors' decision making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anoop Kumar, Suresh Dodda, Navin Kamuni, Rajeev Kumar Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines the effects of macroeconomic policies on financial markets using a novel approach that combines Machine Learning (ML) techniques and causal inference. It focuses on the effect of interest rate changes made by the US Federal Reserve System (FRS) on the returns of fixed income and equity funds between January 1986 and December 2021. The analysis makes a distinction between actively and passively managed funds, hypothesizing that the latter are less susceptible to changes in interest rates. The study contrasts gradient boosting and linear regression models using the Double Machine Learning (DML) framework, which supports a variety of statistical learning techniques. Results indicate that gradient boosting is a useful tool for predicting fund returns; for example, a 1% increase in interest rates causes an actively managed fund's return to decrease by -11.97%. This understanding of the relationship between interest rates and fund performance provides opportunities for additional research and insightful, data-driven advice for fund managers and investors</p>

<p>Abstract: The Fearless Steps APOLLO Community Resource provides unparalleled opportunities to explore the potential of multi-speaker team communications from NASA Apollo missions. This study focuses on discovering the characteristics that make Apollo recordings more or less intelligible to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) methods. We extract, for each audio recording, interpretable metadata on recordings (signal-to-noise ratio, spectral flatness, presence of pauses, sentence duration), transcript (number of words spoken, speaking rate), or known a priori (speaker). We identify subgroups of audio recordings based on combinations of these metadata and compute each subgroup's performance (e.g., Word Error Rate) and the difference in performance (''divergence'') w.r.t the overall population. We then apply the Whisper model in different sizes, trained on English-only or multilingual datasets, in zero-shot or after fine-tuning. We conduct several analyses to (i) automatically identify and describe the most problematic subgroups for a given model, (ii) examine the impact of fine-tuning w.r.t. zero-shot at the subgroup level, (iii) understand the effect of model size on subgroup performance, and (iv) analyze if multilingual models are more sensitive than monolingual to subgroup performance disparities. The insights enhance our understanding of subgroup-specific performance variations, paving the way for advancements in optimizing ASR systems for Earth-to-space communications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, the dominance of deep learning has prevailed across various domains of artificial intelligence, including natural language processing, computer vision, and biomedical signal processing. While there have been remarkable improvements in model accuracy, deploying these models on lightweight devices, such as mobile phones and microcontrollers, is constrained by limited resources. In this survey, we provide comprehensive design guidance tailored for these devices, detailing the meticulous design of lightweight models, compression methods, and hardware acceleration strategies. The principal goal of this work is to explore methods and concepts for getting around hardware constraints without compromising the model's accuracy. Additionally, we explore two notable paths for lightweight deep learning in the future: deployment techniques for TinyML and Large Language Models. Although these paths undoubtedly have potential, they also present significant challenges, encouraging research into unexplored areas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsin-Yuan Huang, John Preskill, Mehdi Soleimanifar</p>
<p>Abstract: Certifying that an n-qubit state synthesized in the lab is close to the target state is a fundamental task in quantum information science. However, existing rigorous protocols either require deep quantum circuits or exponentially many single-qubit measurements. In this work, we prove that almost all n-qubit target states, including those with exponential circuit complexity, can be certified from only O(n^2) single-qubit measurements. This result is established by a new technique that relates certification to the mixing time of a random walk. Our protocol has applications for benchmarking quantum systems, for optimizing quantum circuits to generate a desired target state, and for learning and verifying neural networks, tensor networks, and various other representations of quantum states using only single-qubit measurements. We show that such verified representations can be used to efficiently predict highly non-local properties that would otherwise require an exponential number of measurements. We demonstrate these applications in numerical experiments with up to 120 qubits, and observe advantage over existing methods such as cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB).</p>

<p>Abstract: M&A activities are pivotal for market consolidation, enabling firms to augment market power through strategic complementarities. Existing research often overlooks the peer effect, the mutual influence of M&A behaviors among firms, and fails to capture complex interdependencies within industry networks. Common approaches suffer from reliance on ad-hoc feature engineering, data truncation leading to significant information loss, reduced predictive accuracy, and challenges in real-world application. Additionally, the rarity of M&A events necessitates data rebalancing in conventional models, introducing bias and undermining prediction reliability. We propose an innovative M&A predictive model utilizing the Temporal Dynamic Industry Network (TDIN), leveraging temporal point processes and deep learning to adeptly capture industry-wide M&A dynamics. This model facilitates accurate, detailed deal-level predictions without arbitrary data manipulation or rebalancing, demonstrated through superior evaluation results from M&A cases between January 1997 and December 2020. Our approach marks a significant improvement over traditional models by providing detailed insights into M&A activities and strategic recommendations for specific firms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Media streaming is the dominant application over wireless edge (access) networks. The increasing softwarization of such networks has led to efforts at intelligent control, wherein application-specific actions may be dynamically taken to enhance the user experience. The goal of this work is to develop and demonstrate learning-based policies for optimal decision making to determine which clients to dynamically prioritize in a video streaming setting. We formulate the policy design question as a constrained Markov decision problem (CMDP), and observe that by using a Lagrangian relaxation we can decompose it into single-client problems. Further, the optimal policy takes a threshold form in the video buffer length, which enables us to design an efficient constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithm to learn it. Specifically, we show that a natural policy gradient (NPG) based algorithm that is derived using the structure of our problem converges to the globally optimal policy. We then develop a simulation environment for training, and a real-world intelligent controller attached to a WiFi access point for evaluation. We empirically show that the structured learning approach enables fast learning. Furthermore, such a structured policy can be easily deployed due to low computational complexity, leading to policy execution taking only about 15$\mu$s. Using YouTube streaming experiments in a resource constrained scenario, we demonstrate that the CRL approach can increase QoE by over 30%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Konz, Yuwen Chen, Hanxue Gu, Haoyu Dong, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern medical image translation methods use generative models for tasks such as the conversion of CT images to MRI. Evaluating these methods typically relies on some chosen downstream task in the target domain, such as segmentation. On the other hand, task-agnostic metrics are attractive, such as the network feature-based perceptual metrics (e.g., FID) that are common to image translation in general computer vision. In this paper, we investigate evaluation metrics for medical image translation on two medical image translation tasks (GE breast MRI to Siemens breast MRI and lumbar spine MRI to CT), tested on various state-of-the-art translation methods. We show that perceptual metrics do not generally correlate with segmentation metrics due to them extending poorly to the anatomical constraints of this sub-field, with FID being especially inconsistent. However, we find that the lesser-used pixel-level SWD metric may be useful for subtle intra-modality translation. Our results demonstrate the need for further research into helpful metrics for medical image translation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum Computing in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era has shown promising applications in machine learning, optimization, and cryptography. Despite the progress, challenges persist due to system noise, errors, and decoherence that complicate the simulation of quantum systems. The depolarization channel is a standard tool for simulating a quantum system's noise. However, modeling such noise for practical applications is computationally expensive when we have limited hardware resources, as is the case in the NISQ era. We propose a modified representation for a single-qubit depolarization channel with two Kraus operators based only on X and Z Pauli matrices. Our approach reduces the computational complexity from six to four matrix multiplications per execution of a channel. Experiments on a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) model on the Iris dataset across various circuit depths and depolarization rates validate that our approach maintains the model's accuracy while improving efficiency. This simplified noise model enables more scalable simulations of quantum circuits under depolarization, advancing capabilities in the NISQ era.</p>

To assess the efficiency of our approach, we collect a dataset containing household activities generated in the VirtualHome environment, accompanied by human gaze data of viewing videos. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a 7\% improvement in accuracy for 18-class intention recognition.

We employed an eye-tracking dataset gathered from videos generated by the VirtualHome simulator, with a primary focus on activity recognition.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, a method is presented to synthesize neural network controllers such that the feedback system of plant and controller is dissipative, certifying performance requirements such as L2 gain bounds. The class of plants considered is that of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems interconnected with an uncertainty, including nonlinearities treated as an uncertainty for convenience of analysis. The uncertainty of the plant and the nonlinearities of the neural network are both described using integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). First, a dissipativity condition is derived for uncertain LTI systems. Second, this condition is used to construct a linear matrix inequality (LMI) which can be used to synthesize neural network controllers. Finally, this convex condition is used in a projection-based training method to synthesize neural network controllers with dissipativity guarantees. Numerical examples on an inverted pendulum and a flexible rod on a cart are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based synthesis of fat suppressed (FS) MRIs from non-FS proton density sequences has the potential to accelerate acquisition of knee MRIs. However, GANs trained on single-site data have poor generalizability to external data. We show that federated learning can improve multi-center generalizability of GANs for synthesizing FS MRIs, while facilitating privacy-preserving multi-institutional collaborations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourajit Saha, Tejas Gokhale</p>
<p>Abstract: Downsampling operators break the shift invariance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and this affects the robustness of features learned by CNNs when dealing with even small pixel-level shift. Through a large-scale correlation analysis framework, we study shift invariance of CNNs by inspecting existing downsampling operators in terms of their maximum-sampling bias (MSB), and find that MSB is negatively correlated with shift invariance. Based on this crucial insight, we propose a learnable pooling operator called Translation Invariant Polyphase Sampling (TIPS) and two regularizations on the intermediate feature maps of TIPS to reduce MSB and learn translation-invariant representations. TIPS can be integrated into any CNN and can be trained end-to-end with marginal computational overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that TIPS results in consistent performance gains in terms of accuracy, shift consistency, and shift fidelity on multiple benchmarks for image classification and semantic segmentation compared to previous methods and also leads to improvements in adversarial and distributional robustness. TIPS results in the lowest MSB compared to all previous methods, thus explaining our strong empirical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongzhou Mu, Yijie Guo, Jie Xu, Ankit Goyal, Hao Su, Dieter Fox, Animesh Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Encouraged by the remarkable achievements of language and vision foundation models, developing generalist robotic agents through imitation learning, using large demonstration datasets, has become a prominent area of interest in robot learning. The efficacy of imitation learning is heavily reliant on the quantity and quality of the demonstration datasets. In this study, we aim to scale up demonstrations in a data-efficient way to facilitate the learning of generalist robotic agents. We introduce AdaDemo (Adaptive Online Demonstration Expansion), a general framework designed to improve multi-task policy learning by actively and continually expanding the demonstration dataset. AdaDemo strategically collects new demonstrations to address the identified weakness in the existing policy, ensuring data efficiency is maximized. Through a comprehensive evaluation on a total of 22 tasks across two robotic manipulation benchmarks (RLBench and Adroit), we demonstrate AdaDemo's capability to progressively improve policy performance by guiding the generation of high-quality demonstration datasets in a data-efficient manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Shao, Haiqi Gao, Yipeng Chen, Yujie liu, Junren Wen, Haidong He, Yuchuan Shao, Yueguang Zhang, Weidong Shen, Chenying Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical Diffraction Neural Networks (DNNs), a subset of Optical Neural Networks (ONNs), show promise in mirroring the prowess of electronic networks. This study introduces the Hybrid Diffraction Neural Network (HDNN), a novel architecture that incorporates matrix multiplication into DNNs, synergizing the benefits of conventional ONNs with those of DNNs to surmount the modulation limitations inherent in optical diffraction neural networks. Utilizing a singular phase modulation layer and an amplitude modulation layer, the trained neural network demonstrated remarkable accuracies of 96.39% and 89% in digit recognition tasks in simulation and experiment, respectively. Additionally, we develop the Binning Design (BD) method, which effectively mitigates the constraints imposed by sampling intervals on diffraction units, substantially streamlining experimental procedures. Furthermore, we propose an on-chip HDNN that not only employs a beam-splitting phase modulation layer for enhanced integration level but also significantly relaxes device fabrication requirements, replacing metasurfaces with relief surfaces designed by 1-bit quantization. Besides, we conceptualized an all-optical HDNN-assisted lesion detection network, achieving detection outcomes that were 100% aligned with simulation predictions. This work not only advances the performance of DNNs but also streamlines the path towards industrial optical neural network production.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupeng Cao, Zhi Chen, Qingyun Pei, Fabrizio Dimino, Lorenzo Ausiello, Prashant Kumar, K. P. Subbalakshmi, Papa Momar Ndiaye</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly large language models (LLMs), in finance has garnered increasing academic attention. Despite progress, existing studies predominantly focus on tasks like financial text summarization, question-answering (Q$\&$A), and stock movement prediction (binary classification), with a notable gap in the application of LLMs for financial risk prediction. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce \textbf{RiskLabs}, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze and predict financial risks. RiskLabs uniquely combines different types of financial data, including textual and vocal information from Earnings Conference Calls (ECCs), market-related time series data, and contextual news data surrounding ECC release dates. Our approach involves a multi-stage process: initially extracting and analyzing ECC data using LLMs, followed by gathering and processing time-series data before the ECC dates to model and understand risk over different timeframes. Using multimodal fusion techniques, RiskLabs amalgamates these varied data features for comprehensive multi-task financial risk prediction. Empirical experiment results demonstrate RiskLab's effectiveness in forecasting both volatility and variance in financial markets. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrate how different data sources contribute to financial risk assessment and discuss the critical role of LLMs in this context. Our findings not only contribute to the AI in finance application but also open new avenues for applying LLMs in financial risk assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songkai Sun, Qingshan She, Yuliang Ma, Rihui Li, Yingchun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, the performance of existing U-shaped neural network architectures was enhanced for medical image segmentation by adding Transformer. Although Transformer architectures are powerful at extracting global information, its ability to capture local information is limited due to its high complexity. To address this challenge, we proposed a new lightweight U-shaped cascade fusion network (LUCF-Net) for medical image segmentation. It utilized an asymmetrical structural design and incorporated both local and global modules to enhance its capacity for local and global modeling. Additionally, a multi-layer cascade fusion decoding network was designed to further bolster the network's information fusion capabilities. Validation results achieved on multi-organ datasets in CT format, cardiac segmentation datasets in MRI format, and dermatology datasets in image format demonstrated that the proposed model outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in handling local-global information, achieving an improvement of 1.54% in Dice coefficient and 2.6 mm in Hausdorff distance on multi-organ segmentation. Furthermore, as a network that combines Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer architectures, it achieves competitive segmentation performance with only 6.93 million parameters and 6.6 gigabytes of floating point operations, without the need of pre-training. In summary, the proposed method demonstrated enhanced performance while retaining a simpler model design compared to other Transformer-based segmentation networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evan Shieh, Faye-Marie Vassel, Cassidy Sugimoto, Thema Monroe-White</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid deployment of generative language models (LMs) has raised concerns about social biases affecting the well-being of diverse consumers. The extant literature on generative LMs has primarily examined bias via explicit identity prompting. However, prior research on bias in earlier language-based technology platforms, including search engines, has shown that discrimination can occur even when identity terms are not specified explicitly. Studies of bias in LM responses to open-ended prompts (where identity classifications are left unspecified) are lacking and have not yet been grounded in end-consumer harms. Here, we advance studies of generative LM bias by considering a broader set of natural use cases via open-ended prompting. In this "laissez-faire" setting, we find that synthetically generated texts from five of the most pervasive LMs (ChatGPT3.5, ChatGPT4, Claude2.0, Llama2, and PaLM2) perpetuate harms of omission, subordination, and stereotyping for minoritized individuals with intersectional race, gender, and/or sexual orientation identities (AI/AN, Asian, Black, Latine, MENA, NH/PI, Female, Non-binary, Queer). We find widespread evidence of bias to an extent that such individuals are hundreds to thousands of times more likely to encounter LM-generated outputs that portray their identities in a subordinated manner compared to representative or empowering portrayals. We also document a prevalence of stereotypes (e.g. perpetual foreigner) in LM-generated outputs that are known to trigger psychological harms that disproportionately affect minoritized individuals. These include stereotype threat, which leads to impaired cognitive performance and increased negative self-perception. Our findings highlight the urgent need to protect consumers from discriminatory harms caused by language models and invest in critical AI education programs tailored towards empowering diverse consumers.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Sequence Salience, a visual tool for interactive prompt debugging with input salience methods. Sequence Salience builds on widely used salience methods for text classification and single-token prediction, and extends this to a system tailored for debugging complex LLM prompts. Our system is well-suited for long texts, and expands on previous work by 1) providing controllable aggregation of token-level salience to the word, sentence, or paragraph level, making salience over long inputs tractable; and 2) supporting rapid iteration where practitioners can act on salience results, refine prompts, and run salience on the new output. We include case studies showing how Sequence Salience can help practitioners work with several complex prompting strategies, including few-shot, chain-of-thought, and constitutional principles. Sequence Salience is built on the Learning Interpretability Tool, an open-source platform for ML model visualizations, and code, notebooks, and tutorials are available at http://goo.gle/sequence-salience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyung-il Ahn, Santiago Olivar, Hershel Mehta, Young Chol Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Supply chain networks in enterprises are typically composed of complex topological graphs involving various types of nodes and edges, accommodating numerous products with considerable demand and supply variability. However, as supply chain networks expand in size and complexity, traditional supply chain planning methods (e.g., those found in heuristic rule-based and operations research-based systems) tend to become locally optimal or lack computational scalability, resulting in substantial imbalances between supply and demand across nodes in the network. This paper introduces a novel Generative AI technique, which we call Generative Probabilistic Planning (GPP). GPP generates dynamic supply action plans that are globally optimized across all network nodes over the time horizon for changing objectives like maximizing profits or service levels, factoring in time-varying probabilistic demand, lead time, and production conditions. GPP leverages attention-based graph neural networks (GNN), offline deep reinforcement learning (Offline RL), and policy simulations to train generative policy models and create optimal plans through probabilistic simulations, effectively accounting for various uncertainties. Our experiments using historical data from a global consumer goods company with complex supply chain networks demonstrate that GPP accomplishes objective-adaptable, probabilistically resilient, and dynamic planning for supply chain networks, leading to significant improvements in performance and profitability for enterprises. Our work plays a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of AI adoption within the supply chain domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyung-il Ahn, Young Chol Song, Santiago Olivar, Hershel Mehta, Naveen Tewari</p>
<p>Abstract: Successful supply chain optimization must mitigate imbalances between supply and demand over time. While accurate demand prediction is essential for supply planning, it alone does not suffice. The key to successful supply planning for optimal and viable execution lies in maximizing predictability for both demand and supply throughout an execution horizon. Therefore, enhancing the accuracy of supply predictions is imperative to create an attainable supply plan that matches demand without overstocking or understocking. However, in complex supply chain networks with numerous nodes and edges, accurate supply predictions are challenging due to dynamic node interactions, cascading supply delays, resource availability, production and logistic capabilities. Consequently, supply executions often deviate from their initial plans. To address this, we present the Graph-based Supply Prediction (GSP) probabilistic model. Our attention-based graph neural network (GNN) model predicts supplies, inventory, and imbalances using graph-structured historical data, demand forecasting, and original supply plan inputs. The experiments, conducted using historical data from a global consumer goods company's large-scale supply chain, demonstrate that GSP significantly improves supply and inventory prediction accuracy, potentially offering supply plan corrections to optimize executions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel Hallgarten, Julian Zapata, Martin Stoll, Katrin Renz, Andreas Zell</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world autonomous driving systems must make safe decisions in the face of rare and diverse traffic scenarios. Current state-of-the-art planners are mostly evaluated on real-world datasets like nuScenes (open-loop) or nuPlan (closed-loop). In particular, nuPlan seems to be an expressive evaluation method since it is based on real-world data and closed-loop, yet it mostly covers basic driving scenarios. This makes it difficult to judge a planner's capabilities to generalize to rarely-seen situations. Therefore, we propose a novel closed-loop benchmark interPlan containing several edge cases and challenging driving scenarios. We assess existing state-of-the-art planners on our benchmark and show that neither rule-based nor learning-based planners can safely navigate the interPlan scenarios.
  A recently evolving direction is the usage of foundation models like large language models (LLM) to handle generalization. We evaluate an LLM-only planner and introduce a novel hybrid planner that combines an LLM-based behavior planner with a rule-based motion planner that achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Linhart, Gabriel Victorino Cardoso, Alexandre Gramfort, Sylvain Le Corff, Pedro L. C. Rodrigues</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining which parameters of a non-linear model could best describe a set of experimental data is a fundamental problem in science and it has gained much traction lately with the rise of complex large-scale simulators (a.k.a. black-box simulators). The likelihood of such models is typically intractable, which is why classical MCMC methods can not be used. Simulation-based inference (SBI) stands out in this context by only requiring a dataset of simulations to train deep generative models capable of approximating the posterior distribution that relates input parameters to a given observation. In this work, we consider a tall data extension in which multiple observations are available and one wishes to leverage their shared information to better infer the parameters of the model. The method we propose is built upon recent developments from the flourishing score-based diffusion literature and allows us to estimate the tall data posterior distribution simply using information from the score network trained on individual observations. We compare our method to recently proposed competing approaches on various numerical experiments and demonstrate its superiority in terms of numerical stability and computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olatunji Mumini Omisore, Toluwanimi Akinyemi, Anh Nguyen, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although robot-assisted cardiovascular catheterization is commonly performed for intervention of cardiovascular diseases, more studies are needed to support the procedure with automated tool segmentation. This can aid surgeons on tool tracking and visualization during intervention. Learning-based segmentation has recently offered state-of-the-art segmentation performances however, generating ground-truth signals for fully-supervised methods is labor-intensive and time consuming for the interventionists. In this study, a weakly-supervised learning method with multi-lateral pseudo labeling is proposed for tool segmentation in cardiac angiograms. The method includes a modified U-Net model with one encoder and multiple lateral-branched decoders that produce pseudo labels as supervision signals under different perturbation. The pseudo labels are self-generated through a mixed loss function and shared consistency in the decoders. We trained the model end-to-end with weakly-annotated data obtained during robotic cardiac catheterization. Experiments with the proposed model shows weakly annotated data has closer performance to when fully annotated data is used. Compared to three existing weakly-supervised methods, our approach yielded higher segmentation performance across three different cardiac angiogram data. With ablation study, we showed consistent performance under different parameters. Thus, we offer a less expensive method for real-time tool segmentation and tracking during robot-assisted cardiac catheterization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vineet Kumar, Suresh Sundaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Writer identification due to its widespread application in various fields has gained popularity over the years. In scenarios where optimum handwriting samples are available, whether they be in the form of a single line, a sentence, or an entire page, writer identification algorithms have demonstrated noteworthy levels of accuracy. However, in scenarios where only a limited number of handwritten samples are available, particularly in the form of word images, there is a significant scope for improvement.
  In this paper, we propose a writer identification system based on an attention-driven Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is trained utilizing image segments, known as fragments, extracted from word images, employing a pyramid-based strategy. This methodology enables the system to capture a comprehensive representation of the data, encompassing both fine-grained details and coarse features across various levels of abstraction. These extracted fragments serve as the training data for the convolutional network, enabling it to learn a more robust representation compared to traditional convolution-based networks trained on word images. Additionally, the paper explores the integration of an attention mechanism to enhance the representational power of the learned features. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on three benchmark databases, demonstrating its proficiency in writer identification tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited access to handwriting data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on language technology for the development of medical applications is currently a hot topic in Natural Language Understanding and Generation. Thus, a number of large language models (LLMs) have recently been adapted to the medical domain, so that they can be used as a tool for mediating in human-AI interaction. While these LLMs display competitive performance on automated medical texts benchmarks, they have been pre-trained and evaluated with a focus on a single language (English mostly). This is particularly true of text-to-text models, which typically require large amounts of domain-specific pre-training data, often not easily accessible for many languages. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by compiling, to the best of our knowledge, the largest multilingual corpus for the medical domain in four languages, namely English, French, Italian and Spanish. This new corpus has been used to train Medical mT5, the first open-source text-to-text multilingual model for the medical domain. Additionally, we present two new evaluation benchmarks for all four languages with the aim of facilitating multilingual research in this domain. A comprehensive evaluation shows that Medical mT5 outperforms both encoders and similarly sized text-to-text models for the Spanish, French, and Italian benchmarks, while being competitive with current state-of-the-art LLMs in English.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hajo Holzmann, Bernhard Klar</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that established performance metrics in binary classification, such as the F-score, the Jaccard similarity coefficient or Matthews' correlation coefficient (MCC), are not robust to class imbalance in the sense that if the proportion of the minority class tends to $0$, the true positive rate (TPR) of the Bayes classifier under these metrics tends to $0$ as well. Thus, in imbalanced classification problems, these metrics favour classifiers which ignore the minority class. To alleviate this issue we introduce robust modifications of the F-score and the MCC for which, even in strongly imbalanced settings, the TPR is bounded away from $0$. We numerically illustrate the behaviour of the various performance metrics in simulations as well as on a credit default data set. We also discuss connections to the ROC and precision-recall curves and give recommendations on how to combine their usage with performance metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Cheng, Jonathan F\"urst, Tobias Jacobs, Celia Garrido-Hidalgo</p>
<p>Abstract: The creation of high-quality ontologies is crucial for data integration and knowledge-based reasoning, specifically in the context of the rising data economy. However, automatic ontology matchers are often bound to the heuristics they are based on, leaving many matches unidentified. Interactive ontology matching systems involving human experts have been introduced, but they do not solve the fundamental issue of flexibly finding additional matches outside the scope of the implemented heuristics, even though this is highly demanded in industrial settings. Active machine learning methods appear to be a promising path towards a flexible interactive ontology matcher. However, off-the-shelf active learning mechanisms suffer from low query efficiency due to extreme class imbalance, resulting in a last-mile problem where high human effort is required to identify the remaining matches.
  To address the last-mile problem, this work introduces DualLoop, an active learning method tailored to ontology matching. DualLoop offers three main contributions: (1) an ensemble of tunable heuristic matchers, (2) a short-term learner with a novel query strategy adapted to highly imbalanced data, and (3) long-term learners to explore potential matches by creating and tuning new heuristics. We evaluated DualLoop on three datasets of varying sizes and domains. Compared to existing active learning methods, we consistently achieved better F1 scores and recall, reducing the expected query cost spent on finding 90% of all matches by over 50%. Compared to traditional interactive ontology matchers, we are able to find additional, last-mile matches. Finally, we detail the successful deployment of our approach within an actual product and report its operational performance results within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry sector, showcasing its practical value and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Mayan languages comprise a language family with an ancient history, millions of speakers, and immense cultural value, that, nevertheless, remains severely underrepresented in terms of resources and global exposure. In this paper we develop, curate, and publicly release a set of corpora in several Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala and Southern Mexico, which we call MayanV. The datasets are parallel with Spanish, the dominant language of the region, and are taken from official native sources focused on representing informal, day-to-day, and non-domain-specific language. As such, and according to our dialectometric analysis, they differ in register from most other available resources. Additionally, we present neural machine translation models, trained on as many resources and Mayan languages as possible, and evaluated exclusively on our datasets. We observe lexical divergences between the dialects of Spanish in our resources and the more widespread written standard of Spanish, and that resources other than the ones we present do not seem to improve translation performance, indicating that many such resources may not accurately capture common, real-life language usage.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiming Chen, Wenjin Hou, Salman Khan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) recognizes the unseen classes by conducting visual-semantic interactions to transfer semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones, supported by semantic information (e.g., attributes). However, existing ZSL methods simply extract visual features using a pre-trained network backbone (i.e., CNN or ViT), which fail to learn matched visual-semantic correspondences for representing semantic-related visual features as lacking of the guidance of semantic information, resulting in undesirable visual-semantic interactions. To tackle this issue, we propose a progressive semantic-guided vision transformer for zero-shot learning (dubbed ZSLViT). ZSLViT mainly considers two properties in the whole network: i) discover the semantic-related visual representations explicitly, and ii) discard the semantic-unrelated visual information. Specifically, we first introduce semantic-embedded token learning to improve the visual-semantic correspondences via semantic enhancement and discover the semantic-related visual tokens explicitly with semantic-guided token attention. Then, we fuse low semantic-visual correspondence visual tokens to discard the semantic-unrelated visual information for visual enhancement. These two operations are integrated into various encoders to progressively learn semantic-related visual representations for accurate visual-semantic interactions in ZSL. The extensive experiments show that our ZSLViT achieves significant performance gains on three popular benchmark datasets, i.e., CUB, SUN, and AWA2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuomas Kynk\"a\"anniemi, Miika Aittala, Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, Timo Aila, Jaakko Lehtinen</p>
<p>Abstract: Guidance is a crucial technique for extracting the best performance out of image-generating diffusion models. Traditionally, a constant guidance weight has been applied throughout the sampling chain of an image. We show that guidance is clearly harmful toward the beginning of the chain (high noise levels), largely unnecessary toward the end (low noise levels), and only beneficial in the middle. We thus restrict it to a specific range of noise levels, improving both the inference speed and result quality. This limited guidance interval improves the record FID in ImageNet-512 significantly, from 1.81 to 1.40. We show that it is quantitatively and qualitatively beneficial across different sampler parameters, network architectures, and datasets, including the large-scale setting of Stable Diffusion XL. We thus suggest exposing the guidance interval as a hyperparameter in all diffusion models that use guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Painter, Mohamed Baioumy, Nick Hawes, Bruno Lacerda</p>
<p>Abstract: Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods, such as Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees (UCT), are instrumental to automated planning techniques. However, UCT can be slow to explore an optimal action when it initially appears inferior to other actions. Maximum ENtropy Tree-Search (MENTS) incorporates the maximum entropy principle into an MCTS approach, utilising Boltzmann policies to sample actions, naturally encouraging more exploration. In this paper, we highlight a major limitation of MENTS: optimal actions for the maximum entropy objective do not necessarily correspond to optimal actions for the original objective. We introduce two algorithms, Boltzmann Tree Search (BTS) and Decaying ENtropy Tree-Search (DENTS), that address these limitations and preserve the benefits of Boltzmann policies, such as allowing actions to be sampled faster by using the Alias method. Our empirical analysis shows that our algorithms show consistent high performance across several benchmark domains, including the game of Go.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinheon Baek, Sujay Kumar Jauhar, Silviu Cucerzan, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific Research, vital for improving human life, is hindered by its inherent complexity, slow pace, and the need for specialized experts. To enhance its productivity, we propose a ResearchAgent, a large language model-powered research idea writing agent, which automatically generates problems, methods, and experiment designs while iteratively refining them based on scientific literature. Specifically, starting with a core paper as the primary focus to generate ideas, our ResearchAgent is augmented not only with relevant publications through connecting information over an academic graph but also entities retrieved from an entity-centric knowledge store based on their underlying concepts, mined and shared across numerous papers. In addition, mirroring the human approach to iteratively improving ideas with peer discussions, we leverage multiple ReviewingAgents that provide reviews and feedback iteratively. Further, they are instantiated with human preference-aligned large language models whose criteria for evaluation are derived from actual human judgments. We experimentally validate our ResearchAgent on scientific publications across multiple disciplines, showcasing its effectiveness in generating novel, clear, and valid research ideas based on human and model-based evaluation results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanming Cao, Chengyu Tao, Juan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: The surface quality inspection of manufacturing parts based on 3D point cloud data has attracted increasing attention in recent years. The reason is that the 3D point cloud can capture the entire surface of manufacturing parts, unlike the previous practices that focus on some key product characteristics. However, achieving accurate 3D anomaly detection is challenging, due to the complex surfaces of manufacturing parts and the difficulty of collecting sufficient anomaly samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel untrained anomaly detection method based on 3D point cloud data for complex manufacturing parts, which can achieve accurate anomaly detection in a single sample without training data. In the proposed framework, we transform an input sample into two sets of profiles along different directions. Based on one set of the profiles, a novel segmentation module is devised to segment the complex surface into multiple basic and simple components. In each component, another set of profiles, which have the nature of similar shapes, can be modeled as a low-rank matrix. Thus, accurate 3D anomaly detection can be achieved by using Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) on these low-rank matrices. Extensive numerical experiments on different types of parts show that our method achieves promising results compared with the benchmark methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Albert Wolff, Edmir Xhoxhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent reports from the World Health Organization highlight that Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) have been involved in over half of the road fatalities in recent years, with occlusion risk - a scenario where VRUs are hidden from drivers' view by obstacles like parked vehicles - being a critical contributing factor. To address this, we present a novel algorithm that quantifies occlusion risk based on the dynamics of both vehicles and VRUs. This algorithm has undergone testing and evaluation using a real-world dataset from German intersections. Additionally, we introduce the concept of Maximum Tracking Loss (MTL), which measures the longest consecutive duration a VRU remains untracked by any vehicle in a given scenario. Our study extends to examining the role of the Collective Perception Service (CPS) in VRU safety. CPS enhances safety by enabling vehicles to share sensor information, thereby potentially reducing occlusion risks. Our analysis reveals that a 25% market penetration of CPS-equipped vehicles can substantially diminish occlusion risks and significantly curtail MTL. These findings demonstrate how various scenarios pose different levels of risk to VRUs and how the deployment of Collective Perception can markedly improve their safety. Furthermore, they underline the efficacy of our proposed metrics to capture occlusion risk as a safety factor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuong Vy Nguyen, Alexander Glaser, Felix Biessmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel deep-learning (DL) architectures have reached a level where they can generate digital media, including photorealistic images, that are difficult to distinguish from real data. These technologies have already been used to generate training data for Machine Learning (ML) models, and large text-to-image models like DALL-E 2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion are achieving remarkable results in realistic high-resolution image generation. Given these developments, issues of data authentication in monitoring and verification deserve a careful and systematic analysis: How realistic are synthetic images? How easily can they be generated? How useful are they for ML researchers, and what is their potential for Open Science? In this work, we use novel DL models to explore how synthetic satellite images can be created using conditioning mechanisms. We investigate the challenges of synthetic satellite image generation and evaluate the results based on authenticity and state-of-the-art metrics. Furthermore, we investigate how synthetic data can alleviate the lack of data in the context of ML methods for remote-sensing. Finally we discuss implications of synthetic satellite imagery in the context of monitoring and verification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monitoring the threat landscape to be aware of actual or potential attacks is of utmost importance to cybersecurity professionals. Information about cyber threats is typically distributed using natural language reports. Natural language processing can help with managing this large amount of unstructured information, yet to date, the topic has received little attention. With this paper, we present AnnoCTR, a new CC-BY-SA-licensed dataset of cyber threat reports. The reports have been annotated by a domain expert with named entities, temporal expressions, and cybersecurity-specific concepts including implicitly mentioned techniques and tactics. Entities and concepts are linked to Wikipedia and the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base, the most widely-used taxonomy for classifying types of attacks. Prior datasets linking to MITRE ATT&CK either provide a single label per document or annotate sentences out-of-context; our dataset annotates entire documents in a much finer-grained way. In an experimental study, we model the annotations of our dataset using state-of-the-art neural models. In our few-shot scenario, we find that for identifying the MITRE ATT&CK concepts that are mentioned explicitly or implicitly in a text, concept descriptions from MITRE ATT&CK are an effective source for training data augmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal expression (TE) normalization is a well-studied problem. However, the predominately used rule-based systems are highly restricted to specific settings, and upcoming machine learning approaches suffer from a lack of labeled data. In this work, we explore the feasibility of proprietary and open-source large language models (LLMs) for TE normalization using in-context learning to inject task, document, and example information into the model. We explore various sample selection strategies to retrieve the most relevant set of examples. By using a window-based prompt design approach, we can perform TE normalization across sentences, while leveraging the LLM knowledge without training the model. Our experiments show competitive results to models designed for this task. In particular, our method achieves large performance improvements for non-standard settings by dynamically including relevant examples during inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Handi Deng, Yucheng Zhou, Jiaxuan Xiang, Liujie Gu, Yan Luo, Hai Feng, Mingyuan Liu, Cheng Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Amidst the rapid advancements in generative language models, the investigation of how training data shapes the performance of GPT models is still emerging. This paper presents GPTfluence, a novel approach that leverages a featurized simulation to assess the impact of training examples on the training dynamics of GPT models. Our approach not only traces the influence of individual training instances on performance trajectories, such as loss and other key metrics, on targeted test points but also enables a comprehensive comparison with existing methods across various training scenarios in GPT models, ranging from 14 million to 2.8 billion parameters, across a range of downstream tasks. Contrary to earlier methods that struggle with generalization to new data, GPTfluence introduces a parameterized simulation of training dynamics, demonstrating robust generalization capabilities to unseen training data. This adaptability is evident across both fine-tuning and instruction-tuning scenarios, spanning tasks in natural language understanding and generation. We will make our code and data publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: The paper shows that the application of the fixed-effect multiple linear regression model to an overparameterized dataset is equivalent to fitting the data with a hyper-curve parameterized by a single scalar parameter. This equivalence allows for a predictor-focused approach, where each predictor is described by a function of the chosen parameter. It is proven that a linear model will produce exact predictions even in the presence of nonlinear dependencies that violate the model assumptions. Parameterization in terms of the dependent variable and the monomial basis in the predictor function space are applied here to both synthetic and experimental data. The hyper-curve approach is especially suited for the regularization of problems with noise in predictor variables and can be used to remove noisy and "improper" predictors from the model.</p>

We propose an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for estimating both the signals and the change point locations. Assuming Gaussian covariates, we give an exact asymptotic characterization of its estimation performance in the limit where the number of samples grows proportionally to the signal dimension. Our algorithm can be tailored to exploit any prior information on the signal, noise, and change points. It also enables uncertainty quantification in the form of an efficiently computable approximate posterior distribution, whose asymptotic form we characterize exactly. We validate our theory via numerical experiments, and demonstrate the favorable performance of our estimators on both synthetic data and images.</p>

While this method is known to asymptotically achieve the optimal rate for a wide range of problems, there have been no non-asymptotic results matching these optimal rates outside of a select few, typically linear, model classes. By leveraging modern tools from learning with dependent data, we provide the first rate-optimal non-asymptotic analysis of this method for our more general setting of nonlinearly parametrized model classes. Moreover, we show that our results can be applied to a particular class of identifiable AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, resulting in the first optimal non-asymptotic rates for identification of ARMA models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Healthcare data is a valuable resource for research, analysis, and decision-making in the medical field. However, healthcare data is often fragmented and distributed across various sources, making it challenging to combine and analyze effectively. Record linkage, also known as data matching, is a crucial step in integrating and cleaning healthcare data to ensure data quality and accuracy. Apache Spark, a powerful open-source distributed big data processing framework, provides a robust platform for performing record linkage tasks with the aid of its machine learning library. In this study, we developed a new distributed data-matching model based on the Apache Spark Machine Learning library. To ensure the correct functioning of our model, the validation phase has been performed on the training data. The main challenge is data imbalance because a large amount of data is labeled false, and a small number of records are labeled true. By utilizing SVM and Regression algorithms, our results demonstrate that research data was neither over-fitted nor under-fitted, and this shows that our distributed model works well on the data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models for understanding and generating code (code LLMs) have witnessed tremendous progress in recent years. With the rapid development of code LLMs, many popular evaluation benchmarks, such as HumanEval, DS-1000, and MBPP, have emerged to measure the performance of code LLMs with a particular focus on code generation tasks. However, they are insufficient to cover the full range of expected capabilities of code LLMs, which span beyond code generation to answering diverse coding-related questions. To fill this gap, we propose InfiCoder-Eval, a large-scale freeform question-answering (QA) benchmark for code, comprising 234 carefully selected high-quality Stack Overflow questions that span across 15 programming languages. To evaluate the response correctness, InfiCoder-Eval supports four types of model-free metrics and domain experts carefully choose and concretize the criterion for each question. We conduct a systematic evaluation for more than 80 code LLMs on InfiCoder-Eval, leading to a series of insightful findings. Furthermore, our detailed analyses showcase possible directions for further improvement of code LLMs. InfiCoder-Eval is fully open source at https://infi-coder.github.io/inficoder-eval/ and continuously maintaining and expanding to foster more scientific and systematic practices for evaluating code LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the domain of dynamic graph representation learning (DGRL), the efficient and comprehensive capture of temporal evolution within real-world networks is crucial. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), known as their temporal dynamics and low-power characteristic, offer an efficient solution for temporal processing in DGRL task. However, owing to the spike-based information encoding mechanism of SNNs, existing DGRL methods employed SNNs face limitations in their representational capacity. Given this issue, we propose a novel framework named Spike-induced Graph Neural Network (SiGNN) for learning enhanced spatialtemporal representations on dynamic graphs. In detail, a harmonious integration of SNNs and GNNs is achieved through an innovative Temporal Activation (TA) mechanism. Benefiting from the TA mechanism, SiGNN not only effectively exploits the temporal dynamics of SNNs but also adeptly circumvents the representational constraints imposed by the binary nature of spikes. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent adaptability of SNNs, we explore an in-depth analysis of the evolutionary patterns within dynamic graphs across multiple time granularities. This approach facilitates the acquisition of a multiscale temporal node representation.Extensive experiments on various real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SiGNN in the node classification task.</p>

To address these limitations, we propose a numerical homogenization model based on operator learning: HomoGenius. The proposed model can quickly provide homogenization results for arbitrary geometries, materials, and resolutions, increasing the efficiency by a factor of 80 compared to traditional numerical homogenization methods. We validate effectiveness of our model in predicting the effective elastic modulus on periodic materials (TPMS: Triply Periodic Minimal Surface), including complex geometries, various Poisson's ratios and elastic modulus, and different resolutions for training and testing. The results show that our model possesses high precision, super efficiency, and learning capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents ExeGPT, a distributed system designed for constraint-aware LLM inference. ExeGPT finds and runs with an optimal execution schedule to maximize inference throughput while satisfying a given latency constraint. By leveraging the distribution of input and output sequences, it effectively allocates resources and determines optimal execution configurations, including batch sizes and partial tensor parallelism. We also introduce two scheduling strategies based on Round-Robin Allocation and Workload-Aware Allocation policies, suitable for different NLP workloads. We evaluate ExeGPT on six LLM instances of T5, OPT, and GPT-3 and five NLP tasks, each with four distinct latency constraints. Compared to FasterTransformer, ExeGPT achieves up to 15.2x improvements in throughput and 6x improvements in latency. Overall, ExeGPT achieves an average throughput gain of 2.9x across twenty evaluation scenarios. Moreover, when adapting to changing sequence distributions, the cost of adjusting the schedule in ExeGPT is reasonably modest. ExeGPT proves to be an effective solution for optimizing and executing LLM inference for diverse NLP workload and serving conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: An excellent representation is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL) performance, especially in vision-based reinforcement learning tasks. The quality of the environment representation directly influences the achievement of the learning task. Previous vision-based RL typically uses explicit or implicit ways to represent environments, such as images, points, voxels, and neural radiance fields. However, these representations contain several drawbacks. They cannot either describe complex local geometries or generalize well to unseen scenes, or require precise foreground masks. Moreover, these implicit neural representations are akin to a ``black box", significantly hindering interpretability. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its explicit scene representation and differentiable rendering nature, is considered a revolutionary change for reconstruction and representation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework to be the representation of RL tasks, called GSRL. Through validation in the RoboMimic environment, our method achieves better results than other baselines in multiple tasks, improving the performance by 10%, 44%, and 15% compared with baselines on the hardest task. This work is the first attempt to leverage generalizable 3DGS as a representation for RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> E. M. C. Sijben, J. C. Jansen, M. de Ridder, P. A. N. Bosman, T. Alderliesten</p>
<p>Abstract: Volume measurement of a paraganglioma (a rare neuroendocrine tumor that typically forms along major blood vessels and nerve pathways in the head and neck region) is crucial for monitoring and modeling tumor growth in the long term. However, in clinical practice, using available tools to do these measurements is time-consuming and suffers from tumor-shape assumptions and observer-to-observer variation. Growth modeling could play a significant role in solving a decades-old dilemma (stemming from uncertainty regarding how the tumor will develop over time). By giving paraganglioma patients treatment, severe symptoms can be prevented. However, treating patients who do not actually need it, comes at the cost of unnecessary possible side effects and complications. Improved measurement techniques could enable growth model studies with a large amount of tumor volume data, possibly giving valuable insights into how these tumors develop over time. Therefore, we propose an automated tumor volume measurement method based on a deep learning segmentation model using no-new-UNnet (nnUNet). We assess the performance of the model based on visual inspection by a senior otorhinolaryngologist and several quantitative metrics by comparing model outputs with manual delineations, including a comparison with variation in manual delineation by multiple observers. Our findings indicate that the automatic method performs (at least) equal to manual delineation. Finally, using the created model, and a linking procedure that we propose to track the tumor over time, we show how additional volume measurements affect the fit of known growth functions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a supervised learning approach for automatic extraction of keyphrases from single documents. Our solution uses simple to compute statistical and positional features of candidate phrases and does not rely on any external knowledge base or on pre-trained language models or word embeddings. The ranking component of our proposed solution is a fairly lightweight ensemble model. Evaluation on benchmark datasets shows that our approach achieves significantly higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art baseline models, including all deep learning-based unsupervised models compared with, and is competitive with some supervised deep learning-based models too. Despite the supervised nature of our solution, the fact that does not rely on any corpus of "golden" keywords or any external knowledge corpus means that our solution bears the advantages of unsupervised solutions to a fair extent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqiang Yan, Yingtao Gan, Yiqiao Mao, Yangdong Ye, Hui Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view action clustering leverages the complementary information from different camera views to enhance the clustering performance. Although existing approaches have achieved significant progress, they assume all camera views are available in advance, which is impractical when the camera view is incremental over time. Besides, learning the invariant information among multiple camera views is still a challenging issue, especially in continual learning scenario. Aiming at these problems, we propose a novel continual action clustering (CAC) method, which is capable of learning action categories in a continual learning manner. To be specific, we first devise a category memory library, which captures and stores the learned categories from historical views. Then, as a new camera view arrives, we only need to maintain a consensus partition matrix, which can be updated by leveraging the incoming new camera view rather than keeping all of them. Finally, a three-step alternate optimization is proposed, in which the category memory library and consensus partition matrix are optimized. The empirical experimental results on 6 realistic multi-view action collections demonstrate the excellent clustering performance and time/space efficiency of the CAC compared with 15 state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songlin Xu, Xinyu Zhang, Lianhui Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Student simulation in online education is important to address dynamic learning behaviors of students with diverse backgrounds. Existing simulation models based on deep learning usually need massive training data, lacking prior knowledge in educational contexts. Large language models (LLMs) may contain such prior knowledge since they are pre-trained from a large corpus. However, because student behaviors are dynamic and multifaceted with individual differences, directly prompting LLMs is not robust nor accurate enough to capture fine-grained interactions among diverse student personas, learning behaviors, and learning outcomes. This work tackles this problem by presenting a newly annotated fine-grained large-scale dataset and proposing EduAgent, a novel generative agent framework incorporating cognitive prior knowledge (i.e., theoretical findings revealed in cognitive science) to guide LLMs to first reason correlations among various behaviors and then make simulations. Our two experiments show that EduAgent could not only mimic and predict learning behaviors of real students but also generate realistic learning behaviors of virtual students without real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangpeng Li, Ali Mostafavi</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a limitation in the literature of data-driven analyses for the ex-post evaluation of community risk and resilience, particularly using features related to the performance of coupled human-infrastructure systems. To address this gap, in this study we created a machine learning-based method for the ex-post assessment of community risk and resilience and their interplay based on features related to the coupled human-infrastructure systems performance. Utilizing feature groups related to population protective actions, infrastructure/building performance features, and recovery features, we examined the risk and resilience performance of communities in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. These features related to the coupled human-infrastructure systems performance were processed using the K-means clustering method to classify census block groups into four distinct clusters then, based on feature analysis, these clusters were labeled and designated into four quadrants of risk-resilience archetypes. Finally, we analyzed the disparities in risk-resilience status of spatial areas across different clusters as well as different income groups. The findings unveil the risk-resilience status of spatial areas shaped by their coupled human-infrastructure systems performance and their interactions. The results also inform about features that contribute to high resilience in high-risk areas. For example, the results indicate that in high-risk areas, evacuation rates contributed to a greater resilience, while in low-risk areas, preparedness contributed to greater resilience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcin Pietro\'n, Dominik \.Zurek, Kamil Faber, Roberto Corizzo</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection tools and methods enable key analytical capabilities in modern cyberphysical and sensor-based systems. Despite the fast-paced development in deep learning architectures for anomaly detection, model optimization for a given dataset is a cumbersome and time-consuming process. Neuroevolution could be an effective and efficient solution to this problem, as a fully automated search method for learning optimal neural networks, supporting both gradient and non-gradient fine tuning. However, existing frameworks incorporating neuroevolution lack of support for new layers and architectures and are typically limited to convolutional and LSTM layers. In this paper we propose AD-NEv++, a three-stage neuroevolution-based method that synergically combines subspace evolution, model evolution, and fine-tuning. Our method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by optimizing the mutation operator in the neuroevolution process, while supporting a wide spectrum of neural layers, including attention, dense, and graph convolutional layers. Our extensive experimental evaluation was conducted with widely adopted multivariate anomaly detection benchmark datasets, and showed that the models generated by AD-NEv++ outperform well-known deep learning architectures and neuroevolution-based approaches for anomaly detection. Moreover, results show that AD-NEv++ can improve and outperform the state-of-the-art GNN (Graph Neural Networks) model architecture in all anomaly detection benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chufeng Li, Jianyong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: As a branch of time series forecasting, stock movement forecasting is one of the challenging problems for investors and researchers. Since Transformer was introduced to analyze financial data, many researchers have dedicated themselves to forecasting stock movement using Transformer or attention mechanisms. However, existing research mostly focuses on individual stock information but ignores stock market information and high noise in stock data. In this paper, we propose a novel method using the attention mechanism in which both stock market information and individual stock information are considered. Meanwhile, we propose a novel EMD-based algorithm for reducing short-term noise in stock data. Two randomly selected exchange-traded funds (ETFs) spanning over ten years from US stock markets are used to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed attention-based method. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed attention-based method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chin-Yun Yu, Christopher Mitcheltree, Alistair Carson, Stefan Bilbao, Joshua D. Reiss, Gy\"orgy Fazekas</p>
<p>Abstract: Infinite impulse response filters are an essential building block of many time-varying audio systems, such as audio effects and synthesisers. However, their recursive structure impedes end-to-end training of these systems using automatic differentiation. Although non-recursive filter approximations like frequency sampling and frame-based processing have been proposed and widely used in previous works, they cannot accurately reflect the gradient of the original system. We alleviate this difficulty by re-expressing a time-varying all-pole filter to backpropagate the gradients through itself, so the filter implementation is not bound to the technical limitations of automatic differentiation frameworks. This implementation can be employed within any audio system containing filters with poles for efficient gradient evaluation. We demonstrate its training efficiency and expressive capabilities for modelling real-world dynamic audio systems on a phaser, time-varying subtractive synthesiser, and feed-forward compressor. We make our code available and provide the trained audio effect and synth models in a VST plugin at https://christhetree.github.io/all_pole_filters/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijun Tan, Xiuyu Li, Shishir Patil, Ziyang Wu, Tianjun Zhang, Kurt Keutzer, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Raluca Ada Popa</p>
<p>Abstract: Processing long contexts remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the quadratic computational and memory overhead of the self-attention mechanism and the substantial KV cache sizes during generation. We propose a novel approach to address this problem by learning contexts offline through context compression and in-domain parameter-efficient finetuning. Our method enables an LLM to create a concise representation of the original context and efficiently retrieve relevant information to answer questions accurately. We introduce LLoCO, a technique that combines context compression, retrieval, and parameter-efficient finetuning using LoRA. Our approach extends the effective context window of a 4k token LLaMA2-7B model to handle up to 128k tokens. We evaluate our approach on several long-context question-answering datasets, demonstrating that LLoCO significantly outperforms in-context learning while using $30\times$ fewer tokens during inference. LLoCO achieves up to $7.62\times$ speed-up and substantially reduces the cost of long document question answering, making it a promising solution for efficient long context processing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Sch\"afer, Shauli Ravfogel, Thomas Hofmann, Tiago Pimentel, Imanol Schlag</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilinguality is crucial for extending recent advancements in language modelling to diverse linguistic communities. To maintain high performance while representing multiple languages, multilingual models ideally align representations, allowing what is learned in one language to generalise to others. Prior research has emphasised the importance of parallel data and shared vocabulary elements as key factors for such alignment. In this study, we investigate an unintuitive novel driver of cross-lingual generalisation: language imbalance. In controlled experiments on perfectly equivalent cloned languages, we observe that the existence of a predominant language during training boosts the performance of less frequent languages and leads to stronger alignment of model representations across languages. Furthermore, we find that this trend is amplified with scale: with large enough models or long enough training, we observe that bilingual training data with a 90/10 language split yields better performance on both languages than a balanced 50/50 split. Building on these insights, we design training schemes that can improve performance in all cloned languages, even without altering the training data. As we extend our analysis to real languages, we find that infrequent languages still benefit from frequent ones, yet whether language imbalance causes cross-lingual generalisation there is not conclusive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Schrodi, David T. Hoffmann, Max Argus, Volker Fischer, Thomas Brox</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP have gained popularity for their versatile applicable learned representations in various downstream tasks. Despite their successes in some tasks, like zero-shot image recognition, they also perform surprisingly poor on other tasks, like attribute detection. Previous work has attributed these challenges to the modality gap, a separation of image and text in the shared representation space, and a bias towards objects over other factors, such as attributes. In this work we investigate both phenomena. We find that only a few embedding dimensions drive the modality gap. Further, we propose a measure for object bias and find that object bias does not lead to worse performance on other concepts, such as attributes. But what leads to the emergence of the modality gap and object bias? To answer this question we carefully designed an experimental setting which allows us to control the amount of shared information between the modalities. This revealed that the driving factor behind both, the modality gap and the object bias, is the information imbalance between images and captions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Taojiannan Yang, Huafeng Kuang, Jie Wu, Zhaoning Wang, Xuefeng Xiao, Chen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, existing efforts like ControlNet incorporated image-based conditional controls. In this paper, we reveal that existing methods still face significant challenges in generating images that align with the image conditional controls. To this end, we propose ControlNet++, a novel approach that improves controllable generation by explicitly optimizing pixel-level cycle consistency between generated images and conditional controls. Specifically, for an input conditional control, we use a pre-trained discriminative reward model to extract the corresponding condition of the generated images, and then optimize the consistency loss between the input conditional control and extracted condition. A straightforward implementation would be generating images from random noises and then calculating the consistency loss, but such an approach requires storing gradients for multiple sampling timesteps, leading to considerable time and memory costs. To address this, we introduce an efficient reward strategy that deliberately disturbs the input images by adding noise, and then uses the single-step denoised images for reward fine-tuning. This avoids the extensive costs associated with image sampling, allowing for more efficient reward fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that ControlNet++ significantly improves controllability under various conditional controls. For example, it achieves improvements over ControlNet by 7.9% mIoU, 13.4% SSIM, and 7.6% RMSE, respectively, for segmentation mask, line-art edge, and depth conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwen Tang, Jiaming Liu, Dong Wang, Zhigang Wang, Shanghang Zhang, Bin Zhao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large foundation models have recently emerged as a prominent focus of interest, attaining superior performance in widespread scenarios. Due to the scarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trained transformers from vision to 3D domains. However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are still limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high computation cost. More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D models, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm. In this paper, we introduce Any2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models (vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding. Given a frozen transformer from any source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection strategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions within the source modality. This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token with a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D geometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the transformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors. Then, within each transformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The adapter incorporates prior spatial knowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D tokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers. We conduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Code and models are released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/Any2Point.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Wang, Shiqiang Wang, Rong-Rong Chen, Mingyue Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical SGD (H-SGD) has emerged as a new distributed SGD algorithm for multi-level communication networks. In H-SGD, before each global aggregation, workers send their updated local models to local servers for aggregations. Despite recent research efforts, the effect of local aggregation on global convergence still lacks theoretical understanding. In this work, we first introduce a new notion of "upward" and "downward" divergences. We then use it to conduct a novel analysis to obtain a worst-case convergence upper bound for two-level H-SGD with non-IID data, non-convex objective function, and stochastic gradient. By extending this result to the case with random grouping, we observe that this convergence upper bound of H-SGD is between the upper bounds of two single-level local SGD settings, with the number of local iterations equal to the local and global update periods in H-SGD, respectively. We refer to this as the "sandwich behavior". Furthermore, we extend our analytical approach based on "upward" and "downward" divergences to study the convergence for the general case of H-SGD with more than two levels, where the "sandwich behavior" still holds. Our theoretical results provide key insights of why local aggregation can be beneficial in improving the convergence of H-SGD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanjie Li, Changsheng Li, Kaituo Feng, Ye Yuan, Guoren Wang, Hongyuan Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph structured data often possess dynamic characters in nature. Recent years have witnessed the increasing attentions paid to dynamic graph neural networks for modelling graph data. However, almost all existing approaches operate under the assumption that, upon the establishment of a new link, the embeddings of the neighboring nodes should undergo updates to learn temporal dynamics. Nevertheless, these approaches face the following limitation: If the node introduced by a new connection contains noisy information, propagating its knowledge to other nodes becomes unreliable and may even lead to the collapse of the model. In this paper, we propose Ada-DyGNN: a robust knowledge Adaptation framework via reinforcement learning for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks. In contrast to previous approaches, which update the embeddings of the neighbor nodes immediately after adding a new link, Ada-DyGNN adaptively determines which nodes should be updated. Considering that the decision to update the embedding of one neighbor node can significantly impact other neighbor nodes, we conceptualize the node update selection as a sequence decision problem and employ reinforcement learning to address it effectively. By this means, we can adaptively propagate knowledge to other nodes for learning robust node embedding representations. To the best of our knowledge, our approach constitutes the first attempt to explore robust knowledge adaptation via reinforcement learning specifically tailored for dynamic graph neural networks. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that Ada-DyGNN achieves the state-of-the-art performance. In addition, we conduct experiments by introducing different degrees of noise into the dataset, quantitatively and qualitatively illustrating the robustness of Ada-DyGNN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep graph clustering has recently received significant attention due to its ability to enhance the representation learning capabilities of models in unsupervised scenarios. Nevertheless, deep clustering for temporal graphs, which could capture crucial dynamic interaction information, has not been fully explored. It means that in many clustering-oriented real-world scenarios, temporal graphs can only be processed as static graphs. This not only causes the loss of dynamic information but also triggers huge computational consumption. To solve the problem, we propose a general framework for deep Temporal Graph Clustering called TGC, which introduces deep clustering techniques to suit the interaction sequence-based batch-processing pattern of temporal graphs. In addition, we discuss differences between temporal graph clustering and static graph clustering from several levels. To verify the superiority of the proposed framework TGC, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results show that temporal graph clustering enables more flexibility in finding a balance between time and space requirements, and our framework can effectively improve the performance of existing temporal graph learning methods.

<p>Abstract: Animal-borne sensors ('bio-loggers') can record a suite of kinematic and environmental data, which can elucidate animal ecophysiology and improve conservation efforts. Machine learning techniques are used for interpreting the large amounts of data recorded by bio-loggers, but there exists no common framework for comparing the different machine learning techniques in this domain. To address this, we present the Bio-logger Ethogram Benchmark (BEBE), a collection of datasets with behavioral annotations, as well as a modeling task and evaluation metrics. BEBE is to date the largest, most taxonomically diverse, publicly available benchmark of this type, and includes 1654 hours of data collected from 149 individuals across nine taxa. In addition, using BEBE, we test a novel self-supervised learning approach to identifying animal behaviors based on bio-logger data, using a deep neural network pre-trained with self-supervision on data collected from human wrist-worn accelerometers. We show that this approach out-performs common alternatives, especially in a setting with a low amount of training data.

<p>Abstract: Randomized smoothing-based certification is an effective approach for obtaining robustness certificates of deep neural networks (DNNs) against adversarial attacks. This method constructs a smoothed DNN model and certifies its robustness through statistical sampling, but it is computationally expensive, especially when certifying with a large number of samples. Furthermore, when the smoothed model is modified (e.g., quantized or pruned), certification guarantees may not hold for the modified DNN, and recertifying from scratch can be prohibitively expensive.
  We present the first approach for incremental robustness certification for randomized smoothing, IRS. We show how to reuse the certification guarantees for the original smoothed model to certify an approximated model with very few samples. IRS significantly reduces the computational cost of certifying modified DNNs while maintaining strong robustness guarantees. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing up to 3x certification speedup over the certification that applies randomized smoothing of the approximate model from scratch.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06611">Learning the Positions in CountSketch</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Li, Honghao Lin, Simin Liu, Ali Vakilian, David P. Woodruff</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider sketching algorithms which first compress data by multiplication with a random sketch matrix, and then apply the sketch to quickly solve an optimization problem, e.g., low-rank approximation and regression. In the learning-based sketching paradigm proposed by~\cite{indyk2019learning}, the sketch matrix is found by choosing a random sparse matrix, e.g., CountSketch, and then the values of its non-zero entries are updated by running gradient descent on a training data set. Despite the growing body of work on this paradigm, a noticeable omission is that the locations of the non-zero entries of previous algorithms were fixed, and only their values were learned. In this work, we propose the first learning-based algorithms that also optimize the locations of the non-zero entries. Our first proposed algorithm is based on a greedy algorithm. However, one drawback of the greedy algorithm is its slower training time. We fix this issue and propose approaches for learning a sketching matrix for both low-rank approximation and Hessian approximation for second order optimization. The latter is helpful for a range of constrained optimization problems, such as LASSO and matrix estimation with a nuclear norm constraint. Both approaches achieve good accuracy with a fast running time. Moreover, our experiments suggest that our algorithm can still reduce the error significantly even if we only have a very limited number of training matrices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengdao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: To characterize the function space explored by neural networks (NNs) is an important aspect of learning theory. In this work, noticing that a multi-layer NN generates implicitly a hierarchy of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) - named a neural Hilbert ladder (NHL) - we define the function space as an infinite union of RKHSs, which generalizes the existing Barron space theory of two-layer NNs. We then establish several theoretical properties of the new space. First, we prove a correspondence between functions expressed by L-layer NNs and those belonging to L-level NHLs. Second, we prove generalization guarantees for learning an NHL with a controlled complexity measure. Third, we derive a non-Markovian dynamics of random fields that governs the evolution of the NHL which is induced by the training of multi-layer NNs in an infinite-width mean-field limit. Fourth, we show examples of depth separation in NHLs under the ReLU activation function. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the feature learning aspect of NN training through the lens of NHLs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruqi Bai, Saurabh Bagchi, David I. Inouye</p>
<p>Abstract: While prior domain generalization (DG) benchmarks consider train-test dataset heterogeneity, we evaluate Federated DG which introduces federated learning (FL) specific challenges. Additionally, we explore domain-based heterogeneity in clients' local datasets - a realistic Federated DG scenario. Prior Federated DG evaluations are limited in terms of the number or heterogeneity of clients and dataset diversity. To address this gap, we propose an Federated DG benchmark methodology that enables control of the number and heterogeneity of clients and provides metrics for dataset difficulty. We then apply our methodology to evaluate 14 Federated DG methods, which include centralized DG methods adapted to the FL context, FL methods that handle client heterogeneity, and methods designed specifically for Federated DG. Our results suggest that despite some progress, there remain significant performance gaps in Federated DG particularly when evaluating with a large number of clients, high client heterogeneity, or more realistic datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katerina Hlavackova-Schindler, Anna Melnykova, Irene Tubikanec</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate Hawkes processes (MHPs) are versatile probabilistic tools used to model various real-life phenomena: earthquakes, operations on stock markets, neuronal activity, virus propagation and many others. In this paper, we focus on MHPs with exponential decay kernels and estimate connectivity graphs, which represent the Granger causal relations between their components. We approach this inference problem by proposing an optimization criterion and model selection algorithm based on the minimum message length (MML) principle. MML compares Granger causal models using the Occam's razor principle in the following way: even when models have a comparable goodness-of-fit to the observed data, the one generating the most concise explanation of the data is preferred. While most of the state-of-art methods using lasso-type penalization tend to overfitting in scenarios with short time horizons, the proposed MML-based method achieves high F1 scores in these settings. We conduct a numerical study comparing the proposed algorithm to other related classical and state-of-art methods, where we achieve the highest F1 scores in specific sparse graph settings. We illustrate the proposed method also on G7 sovereign bond data and obtain causal connections, which are in agreement with the expert knowledge available in the literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nate Rahn, Pierluca D'Oro, Harley Wiltzer, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Marc G. Bellemare</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents for continuous control are known to exhibit significant instability in their performance over time. In this work, we provide a fresh perspective on these behaviors by studying the return landscape: the mapping between a policy and a return. We find that popular algorithms traverse noisy neighborhoods of this landscape, in which a single update to the policy parameters leads to a wide range of returns. By taking a distributional view of these returns, we map the landscape, characterizing failure-prone regions of policy space and revealing a hidden dimension of policy quality. We show that the landscape exhibits surprising structure by finding simple paths in parameter space which improve the stability of a policy. To conclude, we develop a distribution-aware procedure which finds such paths, navigating away from noisy neighborhoods in order to improve the robustness of a policy. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the optimization, evaluation, and design of agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: The computational design of novel protein structures has the potential to impact numerous scientific disciplines greatly. Toward this goal, we introduce FoldFlow, a series of novel generative models of increasing modeling power based on the flow-matching paradigm over $3\mathrm{D}$ rigid motions -- i.e. the group $\text{SE}(3)$ -- enabling accurate modeling of protein backbones. We first introduce FoldFlow-Base, a simulation-free approach to learning deterministic continuous-time dynamics and matching invariant target distributions on $\text{SE}(3)$. We next accelerate training by incorporating Riemannian optimal transport to create FoldFlow-OT, leading to the construction of both more simple and stable flows. Finally, we design FoldFlow-SFM, coupling both Riemannian OT and simulation-free training to learn stochastic continuous-time dynamics over $\text{SE}(3)$. Our family of FoldFlow, generative models offers several key advantages over previous approaches to the generative modeling of proteins: they are more stable and faster to train than diffusion-based approaches, and our models enjoy the ability to map any invariant source distribution to any invariant target distribution over $\text{SE}(3)$. Empirically, we validate FoldFlow, on protein backbone generation of up to $300$ amino acids leading to high-quality designable, diverse, and novel samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominik Baumann, Erfaun Noorani, James Price, Ole Peters, Colm Connaughton, Thomas B. Sch\"on</p>
<p>Abstract: Envisioned application areas for reinforcement learning (RL) include autonomous driving, precision agriculture, and finance, which all require RL agents to make decisions in the real world. A significant challenge hindering the adoption of RL methods in these domains is the non-robustness of conventional algorithms. In this paper, we argue that a fundamental issue contributing to this lack of robustness lies in the focus on the expected value of the return as the sole ``correct'' optimization objective. The expected value is the average over the statistical ensemble of infinitely many trajectories. For non-ergodic returns, this average differs from the average over a single but infinitely long trajectory. Consequently, optimizing the expected value can lead to policies that yield exceptionally high returns with probability zero but almost surely result in catastrophic outcomes. This problem can be circumvented by transforming the time series of collected returns into one with ergodic increments. This transformation enables learning robust policies by optimizing the long-term return for individual agents rather than the average across infinitely many trajectories. We propose an algorithm for learning ergodicity transformations from data and demonstrate its effectiveness in an instructive, non-ergodic environment and on standard RL benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gugan Thoppe, L. A. Prashanth, Sanjay Bhat</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the problem of estimating risk measures of the infinite-horizon discounted cost within a Markov cost process. The risk measures we study include variance, Value-at-Risk (VaR), and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). First, we show that estimating any of these risk measures with $\epsilon$-accuracy, either in expected or high-probability sense, requires at least $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples. Then, using a truncation scheme, we derive an upper bound for the CVaR and variance estimation. This bound matches our lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we discuss an extension of our estimation scheme that covers more general risk measures satisfying a certain continuity criterion, e.g., spectral risk measures, utility-based shortfall risk. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide lower and upper bounds for estimating any risk measure beyond the mean within a Markovian setting. Our lower bounds also extend to the infinite-horizon discounted costs' mean. Even in that case, our lower bound of $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2) $ improves upon the existing $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ bound [13].</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Deng, Ruijie Zhu, Xuerui Qiu, Yule Duan, Malu Zhang, Liangjian Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: The attention mechanism has been proven to be an effective way to improve spiking neural network (SNN). However, based on the fact that the current SNN input data flow is split into tensors to process on GPUs, none of the previous works consider the properties of tensors to implement an attention module. This inspires us to rethink current SNN from the perspective of tensor-relevant theories. Using tensor decomposition, we design the \textit{projected full attention} (PFA) module, which demonstrates excellent results with linearly growing parameters. Specifically, PFA is composed by the \textit{linear projection of spike tensor} (LPST) module and \textit{attention map composing} (AMC) module. In LPST, we start by compressing the original spike tensor into three projected tensors using a single property-preserving strategy with learnable parameters for each dimension. Then, in AMC, we exploit the inverse procedure of the tensor decomposition process to combine the three tensors into the attention map using a so-called connecting factor. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed PFA module, we integrate it into the widely used VGG and ResNet architectures for classification tasks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both static and dynamic benchmark datasets, surpassing the existing SNN models with Transformer-based and CNN-based backbones.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning suffers from limitations in real practices primarily due to the number of required interactions with virtual environments. It results in a challenging problem because we are implausible to obtain a local optimal strategy with only a few attempts for many learning methods. Hereby, we design an improved reinforcement learning method based on model predictive control that models the environment through a data-driven approach. Based on the learned environment model, it performs multi-step prediction to estimate the value function and optimize the policy. The method demonstrates higher learning efficiency, faster convergent speed of strategies tending to the local optimal value, and less sample capacity space required by experience replay buffers. Experimental results, both in classic databases and in a dynamic obstacle avoidance scenario for an unmanned aerial vehicle, validate the proposed approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorena Poenaru-Olaru, Natalia Karpova, Luis Cruz, Jan Rellermeyer, Arie van Deursen</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection techniques are essential in automating the monitoring of IT systems and operations. These techniques imply that machine learning algorithms are trained on operational data corresponding to a specific period of time and that they are continuously evaluated on newly emerging data. Operational data is constantly changing over time, which affects the performance of deployed anomaly detection models. Therefore, continuous model maintenance is required to preserve the performance of anomaly detectors over time. In this work, we analyze two different anomaly detection model maintenance techniques in terms of the model update frequency, namely blind model retraining and informed model retraining. We further investigate the effects of updating the model by retraining it on all the available data (full-history approach) and only the newest data (sliding window approach). Moreover, we investigate whether a data change monitoring tool is capable of determining when the anomaly detection model needs to be updated through retraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewook Lee, Seongmin Heo, Jay H. Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting the lifespan of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for optimizing operational strategies and mitigating risks. While numerous studies have aimed at predicting battery lifespan, few have examined the interpretability of their models or how such insights could improve predictions. Addressing this gap, we introduce three innovative models that integrate shallow attention layers into a foundational model from our previous work, which combined elements of recurrent and convolutional neural networks. Utilizing a well-known public dataset, we showcase our methodology's effectiveness. Temporal attention is applied to identify critical timesteps and highlight differences among test cell batches, particularly underscoring the significance of the "rest" phase. Furthermore, by applying cyclic attention via self-attention to context vectors, our approach effectively identifies key cycles, enabling us to strategically decrease the input size for quicker predictions. Employing both single- and multi-head attention mechanisms, we have systematically minimized the required input from 100 to 50 and then to 30 cycles, refining this process based on cyclic attention scores. Our refined model exhibits strong regression capabilities, accurately forecasting the initiation of rapid capacity fade with an average deviation of only 58 cycles by analyzing just the initial 30 cycles of easily accessible input data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daojun Liang, Haixia Zhang, Dongfeng Yuan, Bingzheng Zhang, Minggao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we find that ubiquitous time series (TS) forecasting models are prone to severe overfitting. To cope with this problem, we embrace a de-redundancy approach to progressively reinstate the intrinsic values of TS for future intervals. Specifically, we renovate the vanilla Transformer by reorienting the information aggregation mechanism from addition to subtraction. Then, we incorporate an auxiliary output branch into each block of the original model to construct a highway leading to the ultimate prediction. The output of subsequent modules in this branch will subtract the previously learned results, enabling the model to learn the residuals of the supervision signal, layer by layer. This designing facilitates the learning-driven implicit progressive decomposition of the input and output streams, empowering the model with heightened versatility, interpretability, and resilience against overfitting. Since all aggregations in the model are minus signs, which is called Minusformer. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method outperform existing state-of-the-art methods, yielding an average performance improvement of 11.9% across various datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marios Papachristou, M. Amin Rahimian</p>
<p>Abstract: How can individuals exchange information to learn from each other despite their privacy needs and security concerns? For example, consider individuals deliberating a contentious topic and being concerned about divulging their private experiences. Preserving individual privacy and enabling efficient social learning are both important desiderata but seem fundamentally at odds with each other and very hard to reconcile. We do so by controlling information leakage using rigorous statistical guarantees that are based on differential privacy (DP). Our agents use log-linear rules to update their beliefs after communicating with their neighbors. Adding DP randomization noise to beliefs provides communicating agents with plausible deniability with regard to their private information and their network neighborhoods. We consider two learning environments one for distributed maximum-likelihood estimation given a finite number of private signals and another for online learning from an infinite, intermittent signal stream. Noisy information aggregation in the finite case leads to interesting tradeoffs between rejecting low-quality states and making sure all high-quality states are accepted in the algorithm output. Our results flesh out the nature of the trade-offs in both cases between the quality of the group decision outcomes, learning accuracy, communication cost, and the level of privacy protections that the agents are afforded.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have empowered the advance in graph-structured data analysis. Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 has heralded a new era in deep learning. However, their application to graph data poses distinct challenges due to the inherent difficulty of translating graph structures to language. To this end, we introduce the Large Language and Graph Assistant (LLaGA), an innovative model that effectively integrates LLM capabilities to handle the complexities of graph-structured data. LLaGA retains the general-purpose nature of LLMs while adapting graph data into a format compatible with LLM input. LLaGA achieves this by reorganizing graph nodes to structure-aware sequences and then mapping these into the token embedding space through a versatile projector. LLaGA excels in versatility, generalizability and interpretability, allowing it to perform consistently well across different datasets and tasks, extend its ability to unseen datasets or tasks, and provide explanations for graphs. Our extensive experiments across popular graph benchmarks show that LLaGA delivers outstanding performance across four datasets and three tasks using one single model, surpassing state-of-the-art graph models in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising framework for learning from distributed data while maintaining privacy. The development of efficient FL algorithms encounters various challenges, including heterogeneous data and systems, limited communication capacities, and constrained local computational resources. Recently developed FedADMM methods show great resilience to both data and system heterogeneity. However, they still suffer from performance deterioration if the hyperparameters are not carefully tuned. To address this issue, we propose an inexact and self-adaptive FedADMM algorithm, termed FedADMM-InSa. First, we design an inexactness criterion for the clients' local updates to eliminate the need for empirically setting the local training accuracy. This inexactness criterion can be assessed by each client independently based on its unique condition, thereby reducing the local computational cost and mitigating the undesirable straggle effect. The convergence of the resulting inexact ADMM is proved under the assumption of strongly convex loss functions. Additionally, we present a self-adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts each client's penalty parameter, enhancing algorithm robustness by mitigating the need for empirical penalty parameter choices for each client. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are conducted. As validated by some numerical tests, our proposed algorithm can reduce the clients' local computational load significantly and also accelerate the learning process compared to the vanilla FedADMM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhui Deng, Zichao Yue, Cunxi Yu, Gokce Sarar, Ryan Carey, Rajeev Jain, Zhiru Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity for learning circuit representations in various electronic design automation (EDA) tasks, they face challenges in scalability when applied to large graphs and exhibit limited generalizability to new designs. These limitations make them less practical for addressing large-scale, complex circuit problems. In this work we propose HOGA, a novel attention-based model for learning circuit representations in a scalable and generalizable manner. HOGA first computes hop-wise features per node prior to model training. Subsequently, the hop-wise features are solely used to produce node representations through a gated self-attention module, which adaptively learns important features among different hops without involving the graph topology. As a result, HOGA is adaptive to various structures across different circuits and can be efficiently trained in a distributed manner. To demonstrate the efficacy of HOGA, we consider two representative EDA tasks: quality of results (QoR) prediction and functional reasoning. Our experimental results indicate that (1) HOGA reduces estimation error over conventional GNNs by 46.76% for predicting QoR after logic synthesis; (2) HOGA improves 10.0% reasoning accuracy over GNNs for identifying functional blocks on unseen gate-level netlists after complex technology mapping; (3) The training time for HOGA almost linearly decreases with an increase in computing resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: We prove non-asymptotic error bounds for particle gradient descent (PGD)~(Kuntz et al., 2023), a recently introduced algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of large latent variable models obtained by discretizing a gradient flow of the free energy. We begin by showing that, for models satisfying a condition generalizing both the log-Sobolev and the Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities (LSI and P{\L}I, respectively), the flow converges exponentially fast to the set of minimizers of the free energy. We achieve this by extending a result well-known in the optimal transport literature (that the LSI implies the Talagrand inequality) and its counterpart in the optimization literature (that the P{\L}I implies the so-called quadratic growth condition), and applying it to our new setting. We also generalize the Bakry--\'Emery Theorem and show that the LSI/P{\L}I generalization holds for models with strongly concave log-likelihoods. For such models, we further control PGD's discretization error, obtaining non-asymptotic error bounds. While we are motivated by the study of PGD, we believe that the inequalities and results we extend may be of independent interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Long, Qiyuan Wang, Yazhou Ren, Yipeng Liu, Ce Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Anchor-based large-scale multi-view clustering has attracted considerable attention for its effectiveness in handling massive datasets. However, current methods mainly seek the consensus embedding feature for clustering by exploring global correlations between anchor graphs or projection matrices.In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient scalable multi-view tensor clustering (S^2MVTC) approach, where our focus is on learning correlations of embedding features within and across views. Specifically, we first construct the embedding feature tensor by stacking the embedding features of different views into a tensor and rotating it. Additionally, we build a novel tensor low-frequency approximation (TLFA) operator, which incorporates graph similarity into embedding feature learning, efficiently achieving smooth representation of embedding features within different views. Furthermore, consensus constraints are applied to embedding features to ensure inter-view semantic consistency. Experimental results on six large-scale multi-view datasets demonstrate that S^2MVTC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of clustering performance and CPU execution time, especially when handling massive data. The code of S^2MVTC is publicly available at https://github.com/longzhen520/S2MVTC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravi Mangal, Nina Narodytska, Divya Gopinath, Boyue Caroline Hu, Anirban Roy, Susmit Jha, Corina Pasareanu</p>
<p>Abstract: The analysis of vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) is highly desirable but it is very challenging due to the difficulty of expressing formal specifications for vision tasks and the lack of efficient verification procedures. In this paper, we propose to leverage emerging multimodal, vision-language, foundation models (VLMs) as a lens through which we can reason about vision models. VLMs have been trained on a large body of images accompanied by their textual description, and are thus implicitly aware of high-level, human-understandable concepts describing the images. We describe a logical specification language $\texttt{Con}_{\texttt{spec}}$ designed to facilitate writing specifications in terms of these concepts. To define and formally check $\texttt{Con}_{\texttt{spec}}$ specifications, we build a map between the internal representations of a given vision model and a VLM, leading to an efficient verification procedure of natural-language properties for vision models. We demonstrate our techniques on a ResNet-based classifier trained on the RIVAL-10 dataset using CLIP as the multimodal model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zewen Liu, Guancheng Wan, B. Aditya Prakash, Max S. Y. Lau, Wei Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often fall short when confronted with the growing challenges of today. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into \textit{Neural Models} and \textit{Hybrid Models}. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinbao Qiao, Meng Zhang, Ming Tang, Ermin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning strives to uphold the data owners' right to be forgotten by enabling models to selectively forget specific data. Recent methods suggest that one approach of data forgetting is by precomputing and storing statistics carrying second-order information to improve computational and memory efficiency. However, they rely on restrictive assumptions and the computation/storage suffer from the curse of model parameter dimensionality, making it challenging to apply to most deep neural networks. In this work, we propose a Hessian-free online unlearning method. We propose to maintain a statistical vector for each data point, computed through affine stochastic recursion approximation of the difference between retrained and learned models. Our proposed algorithm achieves near-instantaneous online unlearning as it only requires a vector addition operation. Based on the strategy that recollecting statistics for forgetting data, the proposed method significantly reduces the unlearning runtime. Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed scheme surpasses existing results by orders of magnitude in terms of time and memory costs, while also enhancing accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roi Livni</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze the sample complexity of full-batch Gradient Descent (GD) in the setup of non-smooth Stochastic Convex Optimization. We show that the generalization error of GD, with common choice of hyper-parameters, can be $\tilde \Theta(d/m + 1/\sqrt{m})$, where $d$ is the dimension and $m$ is the sample size. This matches the sample complexity of \emph{worst-case} empirical risk minimizers. That means that, in contrast with other algorithms, GD has no advantage over naive ERMs. Our bound follows from a new generalization bound that depends on both the dimension as well as the learning rate and number of iterations. Our bound also shows that, for general hyper-parameters, when the dimension is strictly larger than number of samples, $T=\Omega(1/\epsilon^4)$ iterations are necessary to avoid overfitting. This resolves an open problem by Schlisserman et al.23 and Amir er Al.21, and improves over previous lower bounds that demonstrated that the sample size must be at least square root of the dimension.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Hagai, Yair Weiss</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to fool deep learning classifiers with tiny perturbations of the input has lead to the development of adversarial training in which the loss with respect to adversarial examples is minimized in addition to the training examples. While adversarial training improves the robustness of the learned classifiers, the procedure is computationally expensive, sensitive to hyperparameters and may still leave the classifier vulnerable to other types of small perturbations. In this paper we analyze the adversarial robustness of the 1 Nearest Neighbor (1NN) classifier and compare its performance to adversarial training. We prove that under reasonable assumptions, the 1 NN classifier will be robust to {\em any} small image perturbation of the training images and will give high adversarial accuracy on test images as the number of training examples goes to infinity. In experiments with 45 different binary image classification problems taken from CIFAR10, we find that 1NN outperform TRADES (a powerful adversarial training algorithm) in terms of average adversarial accuracy. In additional experiments with 69 pretrained robust models for CIFAR10, we find that 1NN outperforms almost all of them in terms of robustness to perturbations that are only slightly different from those seen during training. Taken together, our results suggest that modern adversarial training methods still fall short of the robustness of the simple 1NN classifier. our code can be found at https://github.com/amirhagai/On-Adversarial-Training-And-The-1-Nearest-Neighbor-Classifier</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Lu, Matthew Y. R. Yang, Zuoqiu Liu, Gautam Kamath, Yaoliang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Copyright infringement may occur when a generative model produces samples substantially similar to some copyrighted data that it had access to during the training phase. The notion of access usually refers to including copyrighted samples directly in the training dataset, which one may inspect to identify an infringement. We argue that such visual auditing largely overlooks a concealed copyright infringement, where one constructs a disguise that looks drastically different from the copyrighted sample yet still induces the effect of training Latent Diffusion Models on it. Such disguises only require indirect access to the copyrighted material and cannot be visually distinguished, thus easily circumventing the current auditing tools. In this paper, we provide a better understanding of such disguised copyright infringement by uncovering the disguises generation algorithm, the revelation of the disguises, and importantly, how to detect them to augment the existing toolbox. Additionally, we introduce a broader notion of acknowledgment for comprehending such indirect access.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Sawarni, Nirjhar Das, Siddharth Barman, Gaurav Sinha</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the generalized linear contextual bandit problem within the requirements of limited adaptivity. In this paper, we present two algorithms, B-GLinCB and RS-GLinCB, that address, respectively, two prevalent limited adaptivity models: batch learning with stochastic contexts and rare policy switches with adversarial contexts. For both these models, we establish essentially tight regret bounds. Notably, in the obtained bounds, we manage to eliminate a dependence on a key parameter $\kappa$, which captures the non-linearity of the underlying reward model. For our batch learning algorithm B-GLinCB, with $\Omega\left( \log{\log T} \right)$ batches, the regret scales as $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Further, we establish that our rarely switching algorithm RS-GLinCB updates its policy at most $\tilde{O}(\log^2 T)$ times and achieves a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Our approach for removing the dependence on $\kappa$ for generalized linear contextual bandits might be of independent interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Dean, Dilip Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Overparameterized deep neural networks (DNNs), if not sufficiently regularized, are susceptible to overfitting their training examples and not generalizing well to test data. To discourage overfitting, researchers have developed multicomponent loss functions that reduce intra-class feature correlation and maximize inter-class feature distance in one or more layers of the network. By analyzing the penultimate feature layer activations output by a DNN's feature extraction section prior to the linear classifier, we find that modified forms of the intra-class feature covariance and inter-class prototype separation are key components of a fundamental Chebyshev upper bound on the probability of misclassification, which we designate the Chebyshev Prototype Risk (CPR). While previous approaches' covariance loss terms scale quadratically with the number of network features, our CPR bound indicates that an approximate covariance loss in log-linear time is sufficient to reduce the bound and is scalable to large architectures. We implement the terms of the CPR bound into our Explicit CPR (exCPR) loss function and observe from empirical results on multiple datasets and network architectures that our training algorithm reduces overfitting and improves upon previous approaches in many settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuanghong Shen, Qi Liu, Zhenya Huang, Yonghe Zheng, Minghao Yin, Minjuan Wang, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern online education has the capacity to provide intelligent educational services by automatically analyzing substantial amounts of student behavioral data. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is one of the fundamental tasks for student behavioral data analysis, aiming to monitor students' evolving knowledge state during their problem-solving process. In recent years, a substantial number of studies have concentrated on this rapidly growing field, significantly contributing to its advancements. In this survey, we will conduct a thorough investigation of these progressions. Firstly, we present three types of fundamental KT models with distinct technical routes. Subsequently, we review extensive variants of the fundamental KT models that consider more stringent learning assumptions. Moreover, the development of KT cannot be separated from its applications, thereby we present typical KT applications in various scenarios. To facilitate the work of researchers and practitioners in this field, we have developed two open-source algorithm libraries: EduData that enables the download and preprocessing of KT-related datasets, and EduKTM that provides an extensible and unified implementation of existing mainstream KT models. Finally, we discuss potential directions for future research in this rapidly growing field. We hope that the current survey will assist both researchers and practitioners in fostering the development of KT, thereby benefiting a broader range of students.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Timothy Bennett</p>
<p>Abstract: If $A$ and $B$ are sets such that $A \subset B$, generalisation may be understood as the inference from $A$ of a hypothesis sufficient to construct $B$. One might infer any number of hypotheses from $A$, yet only some of those may generalise to $B$. How can one know which are likely to generalise? One strategy is to choose the shortest, equating the ability to compress information with the ability to generalise (a proxy for intelligence). We examine this in the context of a mathematical formalism of enactive cognition. We show that compression is neither necessary nor sufficient to maximise performance (measured in terms of the probability of a hypothesis generalising). We formulate a proxy unrelated to length or simplicity, called weakness. We show that if tasks are uniformly distributed, then there is no choice of proxy that performs at least as well as weakness maximisation in all tasks while performing strictly better in at least one. In experiments comparing maximum weakness and minimum description length in the context of binary arithmetic, the former generalised at between $1.1$ and $5$ times the rate of the latter. We argue this demonstrates that weakness is a far better proxy, and explains why Deepmind's Apperception Engine is able to generalise effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Devaux (BPH, GIGH, UNSW), C\'ecile Proust-Lima (BPH), Robin Genuer (BPH)</p>
<p>Abstract: The R package DynForest implements random forests for predicting a continuous, a categorical or a (multiple causes) time-to-event outcome based on time-fixed and time-dependent predictors. The main originality of DynForest is that it handles time-dependent predictors that can be endogeneous (i.e., impacted by the outcome process), measured with error and measured at subject-specific times. At each recursive step of the tree building process, the time-dependent predictors are internally summarized into individual features on which the split can be done. This is achieved using flexible linear mixed models (thanks to the R package lcmm) which specification is pre-specified by the user. DynForest returns the mean for continuous outcome, the category with a majority vote for categorical outcome or the cumulative incidence function over time for survival outcome. DynForest also computes variable importance and minimal depth to inform on the most predictive variables or groups of variables. This paper aims to guide the user with step-by-step examples for fitting random forests using DynForest.</p>

<p>Abstract: The usual goal of supervised learning is to find the best model, the one that optimizes a particular performance measure. However, what if the explanation provided by this model is completely different from another model and different again from another model despite all having similarly good fit statistics? Is it possible that the equally effective models put the spotlight on different relationships in the data? Inspired by Anscombe's quartet, this paper introduces a Rashomon Quartet, i.e. a set of four models built on a synthetic dataset which have practically identical predictive performance. However, the visual exploration reveals distinct explanations of the relations in the data. This illustrative example aims to encourage the use of methods for model visualization to compare predictive models beyond their performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate whether Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is able to synthesize sophisticated and safe movement skills for a low-cost, miniature humanoid robot that can be composed into complex behavioral strategies in dynamic environments. We used Deep RL to train a humanoid robot with 20 actuated joints to play a simplified one-versus-one (1v1) soccer game. The resulting agent exhibits robust and dynamic movement skills such as rapid fall recovery, walking, turning, kicking and more; and it transitions between them in a smooth, stable, and efficient manner. The agent's locomotion and tactical behavior adapts to specific game contexts in a way that would be impractical to manually design. The agent also developed a basic strategic understanding of the game, and learned, for instance, to anticipate ball movements and to block opponent shots. Our agent was trained in simulation and transferred to real robots zero-shot. We found that a combination of sufficiently high-frequency control, targeted dynamics randomization, and perturbations during training in simulation enabled good-quality transfer. Although the robots are inherently fragile, basic regularization of the behavior during training led the robots to learn safe and effective movements while still performing in a dynamic and agile way -- well beyond what is intuitively expected from the robot. Indeed, in experiments, they walked 181% faster, turned 302% faster, took 63% less time to get up, and kicked a ball 34% faster than a scripted baseline, while efficiently combining the skills to achieve the longer term objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Collin Beaudoin, Koustubh Phalak, Swaroop Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Identification and verification of molecular properties such as side effects is one of the most important and time-consuming steps in the process of molecule synthesis. For example, failure to identify side effects before submission to regulatory groups can cost millions of dollars and months of additional research to the companies. Failure to identify side effects during the regulatory review can also cost lives. The complexity and expense of this task have made it a candidate for a machine learning-based solution. Prior approaches rely on complex model designs and excessive parameter counts for side effect predictions. We believe reliance on complex models only shifts the difficulty away from chemists rather than alleviating the issue. Implementing large models is also expensive without prior access to high-performance computers. We propose a heuristic approach that allows for the utilization of simple neural networks, specifically the recurrent neural network, with a 98+% reduction in the number of required parameters compared to available large language models while still obtaining near identical results as top-performing models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Sadegh Salehi, Subhadip Mukherjee, Lindon Roberts, Matthias J. Ehrhardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Various tasks in data science are modeled utilizing the variational regularization approach, where manually selecting regularization parameters presents a challenge. The difficulty gets exacerbated when employing regularizers involving a large number of hyperparameters. To overcome this challenge, bilevel learning can be employed to learn such parameters from data. However, neither exact function values nor exact gradients with respect to the hyperparameters are attainable, necessitating methods that only rely on inexact evaluation of such quantities. State-of-the-art inexact gradient-based methods a priori select a sequence of the required accuracies and cannot identify an appropriate step size since the Lipschitz constant of the hypergradient is unknown. In this work, we propose an algorithm with backtracking line search that only relies on inexact function evaluations and hypergradients and show convergence to a stationary point. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm determines the required accuracy dynamically rather than manually selected before running it. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of our approach for hyperparameter estimation on a range of relevant problems in imaging and data science such as total variation and field of experts denoising and multinomial logistic regression. Particularly, the results show that the algorithm is robust to its own hyperparameters such as the initial accuracies and step size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justice Mason, Christine Allen-Blanchette, Nicholas Zolman, Elizabeth Davison, Naomi Ehrich Leonard</p>
<p>Abstract: In many real-world settings, image observations of freely rotating 3D rigid bodies may be available when low-dimensional measurements are not. However, the high-dimensionality of image data precludes the use of classical estimation techniques to learn the dynamics. The usefulness of standard deep learning methods is also limited, because an image of a rigid body reveals nothing about the distribution of mass inside the body, which, together with initial angular velocity, is what determines how the body will rotate. We present a physics-based neural network model to estimate and predict 3D rotational dynamics from image sequences. We achieve this using a multi-stage prediction pipeline that maps individual images to a latent representation homeomorphic to $\mathbf{SO}(3)$, computes angular velocities from latent pairs, and predicts future latent states using the Hamiltonian equations of motion. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on new rotating rigid-body datasets of sequences of synthetic images of rotating objects, including cubes, prisms and satellites, with unknown uniform and non-uniform mass distributions. Our model outperforms competing baselines on our datasets, producing better qualitative predictions and reducing the error observed for the state-of-the-art Hamiltonian Generative Network by a factor of 2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanishq Kumar, Blake Bordelon, Samuel J. Gershman, Cengiz Pehlevan</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose that the grokking phenomenon, where the train loss of a neural network decreases much earlier than its test loss, can arise due to a neural network transitioning from lazy training dynamics to a rich, feature learning regime. To illustrate this mechanism, we study the simple setting of vanilla gradient descent on a polynomial regression problem with a two layer neural network which exhibits grokking without regularization in a way that cannot be explained by existing theories. We identify sufficient statistics for the test loss of such a network, and tracking these over training reveals that grokking arises in this setting when the network first attempts to fit a kernel regression solution with its initial features, followed by late-time feature learning where a generalizing solution is identified after train loss is already low. We find that the key determinants of grokking are the rate of feature learning -- which can be controlled precisely by parameters that scale the network output -- and the alignment of the initial features with the target function $y(x)$. We argue this delayed generalization arises when (1) the top eigenvectors of the initial neural tangent kernel and the task labels $y(x)$ are misaligned, but (2) the dataset size is large enough so that it is possible for the network to generalize eventually, but not so large that train loss perfectly tracks test loss at all epochs, and (3) the network begins training in the lazy regime so does not learn features immediately. We conclude with evidence that this transition from lazy (linear model) to rich training (feature learning) can control grokking in more general settings, like on MNIST, one-layer Transformers, and student-teacher networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengzhou Xia, Tianyu Gao, Zhiyuan Zeng, Danqi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The popularity of LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) and other recently emerged moderate-sized large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential of building smaller yet powerful LLMs. Regardless, the cost of training such models from scratch on trillions of tokens remains high. In this work, we study structured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from pre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1) targeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target shape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an end-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting the Sheared-LLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art open-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, OpenLLaMA and the concurrent TinyLlama models, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while requiring only 3% of compute compared to training such models from scratch. This work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs with structured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building competitive small-scale LLMs</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiwalayo Eisape, MH Tessler, Ishita Dasgupta, Fei Sha, Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Tal Linzen</p>
<p>Abstract: A central component of rational behavior is logical inference: the process of determining which conclusions follow from a set of premises. Psychologists have documented several ways in which humans' inferences deviate from the rules of logic. Do language models, which are trained on text generated by humans, replicate such human biases, or are they able to overcome them? Focusing on the case of syllogisms -- inferences from two simple premises -- we show that, within the PaLM2 family of transformer language models, larger models are more logical than smaller ones, and also more logical than humans. At the same time, even the largest models make systematic errors, some of which mirror human reasoning biases: they show sensitivity to the (irrelevant) ordering of the variables in the syllogism, and draw confident but incorrect inferences from particular syllogisms (syllogistic fallacies). Overall, we find that language models often mimic the human biases included in their training data, but are able to overcome them in some cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Wiedemann, Reinhard Heckel</p>
<p>Abstract: Cryogenic electron tomography is a technique for imaging biological samples in 3D. A microscope collects a series of 2D projections of the sample, and the goal is to reconstruct the 3D density of the sample called the tomogram. Reconstruction is difficult as the 2D projections are noisy and can not be recorded from all directions, resulting in a missing wedge of information. Tomograms conventionally reconstructed with filtered back-projection suffer from noise and strong artifacts due to the missing wedge. Here, we propose a deep-learning approach for simultaneous denoising and missing wedge reconstruction called DeepDeWedge. The algorithm requires no ground truth data and is based on fitting a neural network to the 2D projections using a self-supervised loss. DeepDeWedge performs better than CryoCARE and IsoNet, which are state-of-the-art methods for denoising and missing wedge reconstruction, and similarly and, in some cases, better than the combination of the two methods. At the same time, DeepDeWedge is simpler than this two-step approach, as it does denoising and missing wedge reconstruction simultaneously rather than sequentially.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuhao Qin, Evangelos Pournaras</p>
<p>Abstract: Swarms of autonomous interactive drones, with the support of recharging technology, can provide compelling sensing capabilities in Smart Cities, such as traffic monitoring and disaster response. This paper aims to deliver a novel coordination solution for the cost-effective navigation, sensing, and recharging of drones. Existing approaches, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer long-term adaptability, but lack energy efficiency, resilience, and flexibility in dynamic environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach where each drone independently determines its flying direction and recharging place using DRL, while adapting navigation and sensing through distributed optimization, which improves energy-efficiency during sensing tasks. Furthermore, drones efficiently exchange information while retaining decision-making autonomy via a structured tree communication model. Extensive experimentation with datasets generated from realistic urban mobility underscores an outstanding performance of the proposed solution compared to state-of-the-art methods. Significant new insights show that long-term methods optimize scarce drone resource for traffic management, while the integration of short-term methods is crucial for advising on charging policies and maintaining battery safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentyn Melnychuk, Dennis Frauen, Stefan Feuerriegel</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation make widespread use of representation learning. Here, the idea is to reduce the variance of the low-sample CATE estimation by a (potentially constrained) low-dimensional representation. However, low-dimensional representations can lose information about the observed confounders and thus lead to bias, because of which the validity of representation learning for CATE estimation is typically violated. In this paper, we propose a new, representation-agnostic refutation framework for estimating bounds on the representation-induced confounding bias that comes from dimensionality reduction (or other constraints on the representations) in CATE estimation. First, we establish theoretically under which conditions CATE is non-identifiable given low-dimensional (constrained) representations. Second, as our remedy, we propose a neural refutation framework which performs partial identification of CATE or, equivalently, aims at estimating lower and upper bounds of the representation-induced confounding bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds in a series of experiments. In sum, our refutation framework is of direct relevance in practice where the validity of CATE estimation is of importance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ainesh Bakshi, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Samuel B. Hopkins, Rajesh Jayaram, Silvio Lattanzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) is a family of methods for embedding an $n$-point metric into low-dimensional Euclidean space. We study the Kamada-Kawai formulation of MDS: given a set of non-negative dissimilarities $\{d_{i,j}\}_{i , j \in [n]}$ over $n$ points, the goal is to find an embedding $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\} \in \mathbb{R}^k$ that minimizes \[\text{OPT} = \min_{x} \mathbb{E}_{i,j \in [n]} \left[ \left(1-\frac{\|x_i - x_j\|}{d_{i,j}}\right)^2 \right] \]
  Kamada-Kawai provides a more relaxed measure of the quality of a low-dimensional metric embedding than the traditional bi-Lipschitz-ness measure studied in theoretical computer science; this is advantageous because strong hardness-of-approximation results are known for the latter, Kamada-Kawai admits nontrivial approximation algorithms. Despite its popularity, our theoretical understanding of MDS is limited. Recently, Demaine, Hesterberg, Koehler, Lynch, and Urschel (arXiv:2109.11505) gave the first approximation algorithm with provable guarantees for Kamada-Kawai in the constant-$k$ regime, with cost $\text{OPT} +\epsilon$ in $n^2 2^{\text{poly}(\Delta/\epsilon)}$ time, where $\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the input. In this work, we give the first approximation algorithm for MDS with quasi-polynomial dependency on $\Delta$: we achieve a solution with cost $\tilde{O}(\log \Delta)\text{OPT}^{\Omega(1)}+\epsilon$ in time $n^{O(1)}2^{\text{poly}(\log(\Delta)/\epsilon)}$.
  Our approach is based on a novel analysis of a conditioning-based rounding scheme for the Sherali-Adams LP Hierarchy. Crucially, our analysis exploits the geometry of low-dimensional Euclidean space, allowing us to avoid an exponential dependence on the aspect ratio. We believe our geometry-aware treatment of the Sherali-Adams Hierarchy is an important step towards developing general-purpose techniques for efficient metric optimization algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Tokmak, Christian Fiedler, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Sebastian Trimpe, Johannes K\"ohler</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety guarantees are vital in many control applications, such as robotics. Model predictive control (MPC) provides a constructive framework for controlling safety-critical systems, but is limited by its computational complexity. We address this problem by presenting a novel algorithm that automatically computes an explicit approximation to nonlinear MPC schemes while retaining closed-loop guarantees. Specifically, the problem can be reduced to a function approximation problem, which we then tackle by proposing ALKIA-X, the Adaptive and Localized Kernel Interpolation Algorithm with eXtrapolated reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm. ALKIA-X is a non-iterative algorithm that ensures numerically well-conditioned computations, a fast-to-evaluate approximating function, and the guaranteed satisfaction of any desired bound on the approximation error. Hence, ALKIA-X automatically computes an explicit function that approximates the MPC, yielding a controller suitable for safety-critical systems and high sampling rates. We apply ALKIA-X to approximate two nonlinear MPC schemes, demonstrating reduced computational demand and applicability to realistic problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anchen Sun, Juan J Londono, Batya Elbaum, Luis Estrada, Roberto Jose Lazo, Laura Vitale, Hugo Gonzalez Villasanti, Riccardo Fusaroli, Lynn K Perry, Daniel S Messinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Young children spend substantial portions of their waking hours in noisy preschool classrooms. In these environments, children's vocal interactions with teachers are critical contributors to their language outcomes, but manually transcribing these interactions is prohibitive. Using audio from child- and teacher-worn recorders, we propose an automated framework that uses open source software both to classify speakers (ALICE) and to transcribe their utterances (Whisper). We compare results from our framework to those from a human expert for 110 minutes of classroom recordings, including 85 minutes from child-word microphones (n=4 children) and 25 minutes from teacher-worn microphones (n=2 teachers). The overall proportion of agreement, that is, the proportion of correctly classified teacher and child utterances, was .76, with an error-corrected kappa of .50 and a weighted F1 of .76. The word error rate for both teacher and child transcriptions was .15, meaning that 15% of words would need to be deleted, added, or changed to equate the Whisper and expert transcriptions. Moreover, speech features such as the mean length of utterances in words, the proportion of teacher and child utterances that were questions, and the proportion of utterances that were responded to within 2.5 seconds were similar when calculated separately from expert and automated transcriptions. The results suggest substantial progress in analyzing classroom speech that may support children's language development. Future research using natural language processing is under way to improve speaker classification and to analyze results from the application of the automated framework to a larger dataset containing classroom recordings from 13 children and 3 teachers observed on 17 occasions over one year.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuren Qi, Yushu Zhang, Chao Wang, Zhihua Xia, Xiaochun Cao, Jian Weng</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing robust and interpretable vision systems is a crucial step towards trustworthy artificial intelligence. In this regard, a promising paradigm considers embedding task-required invariant structures, e.g., geometric invariance, in the fundamental image representation. However, such invariant representations typically exhibit limited discriminability, limiting their applications in larger-scale trustworthy vision tasks. For this open problem, we conduct a systematic investigation of hierarchical invariance, exploring this topic from theoretical, practical, and application perspectives. At the theoretical level, we show how to construct over-complete invariants with a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-like hierarchical architecture yet in a fully interpretable manner. The general blueprint, specific definitions, invariant properties, and numerical implementations are provided. At the practical level, we discuss how to customize this theoretical framework into a given task. With the over-completeness, discriminative features w.r.t. the task can be adaptively formed in a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-like manner. We demonstrate the above arguments with accuracy, invariance, and efficiency results on texture, digit, and parasite classification experiments. Furthermore, at the application level, our representations are explored in real-world forensics tasks on adversarial perturbations and Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). Such applications reveal that the proposed strategy not only realizes the theoretically promised invariance, but also exhibits competitive discriminability even in the era of deep learning. For robust and interpretable vision tasks at larger scales, hierarchical invariant representation can be considered as an effective alternative to traditional CNN and invariants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert J. Wakhloo, Will Slatton, SueYeon Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans and animals can recognize latent structures in their environment and apply this information to efficiently navigate the world. However, it remains unclear what aspects of neural activity contribute to these computational capabilities. Here, we develop an analytical theory linking the geometry of a neural population's activity to the generalization performance of a linear readout on a set of tasks that depend on a common latent structure. We show that four geometric measures of the activity determine performance across tasks. Using this theory, we find that experimentally observed disentangled representations naturally emerge as an optimal solution to the multi-task learning problem. When data is scarce, these optimal neural codes compress less informative latent variables, and when data is abundant, they expand these variables in the state space. We validate our theory using macaque ventral stream recordings. Our results therefore tie population geometry to multi-task learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce GEM3D -- a new deep, topology-aware generative model of 3D shapes. The key ingredient of our method is a neural skeleton-based representation encoding information on both shape topology and geometry. Through a denoising diffusion probabilistic model, our method first generates skeleton-based representations following the Medial Axis Transform (MAT), then generates surfaces through a skeleton-driven neural implicit formulation. The neural implicit takes into account the topological and geometric information stored in the generated skeleton representations to yield surfaces that are more topologically and geometrically accurate compared to previous neural field formulations. We discuss applications of our method in shape synthesis and point cloud reconstruction tasks, and evaluate our method both qualitatively and quantitatively. We demonstrate significantly more faithful surface reconstruction and diverse shape generation results compared to the state-of-the-art, also involving challenging scenarios of reconstructing and synthesizing structurally complex, high-genus shape surfaces from Thingi10K and ShapeNet.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Syntax-Aware Fill-In-the-Middle (SAFIM), a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on the code Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) task. This benchmark focuses on syntax-aware completions of program structures such as code blocks and conditional expressions, and includes 17,720 examples from multiple programming languages, sourced from recent code submissions after April 2022 to minimize data contamination. SAFIM provides a robust framework with various prompt designs and novel syntax-aware post-processing techniques, facilitating accurate and fair comparisons across LLMs. Our comprehensive evaluation of 15 LLMs shows that FIM pretraining not only enhances FIM proficiency but also improves Left-to-Right (L2R) inference using LLMs. Our findings challenge conventional beliefs and suggest that pretraining methods and data quality have more impact than model size. SAFIM thus serves as a foundational platform for future research in effective pretraining strategies for code LLMs. The evaluation toolkit and dataset are available at https://github.com/gonglinyuan/safim, and the leaderboard is available at https://safimbenchmark.com.</p>

<p>Abstract: When analysing Differentially Private (DP) machine learning pipelines, the potential privacy cost of data-dependent pre-processing is frequently overlooked in privacy accounting. In this work, we propose a general framework to evaluate the additional privacy cost incurred by non-private data-dependent pre-processing algorithms. Our framework establishes upper bounds on the overall privacy guarantees by utilising two new technical notions: a variant of DP termed Smooth DP and the bounded sensitivity of the pre-processing algorithms. In addition to the generic framework, we provide explicit overall privacy guarantees for multiple data-dependent pre-processing algorithms, such as data imputation, quantization, deduplication and PCA, when used in combination with several DP algorithms. Notably, this framework is also simple to implement, allowing direct integration into existing DP pipelines.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15304">KTbench: A Novel Data Leakage-Free Framework for Knowledge Tracing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahya Badran, Christine Preisach</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is concerned with predicting students' future performance on learning items in intelligent tutoring systems. Learning items are tagged with skill labels called knowledge concepts (KCs). Many KT models expand the sequence of item-student interactions into KC-student interactions by replacing learning items with their constituting KCs. This often results in a longer sequence length. This approach addresses the issue of sparse item-student interactions and minimises model parameters. However, two problems have been identified with such models.
  The first problem is the model's ability to learn correlations between KCs belonging to the same item, which can result in the leakage of ground truth labels and hinder performance. This problem can lead to a significant decrease in performance on datasets with a higher number of KCs per item. The second problem is that the available benchmark implementations ignore accounting for changes in sequence length when expanding KCs, leading to different models being tested with varying sequence lengths but still compared against the same benchmark.
  To address these problems, we introduce a general masking framework that mitigates the first problem and enhances the performance of such KT models while preserving the original model architecture without significant alterations. Additionally, we introduce KTbench, an open-source benchmark library designed to ensure the reproducibility of this work while mitigating the second problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-An Liu, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial ranking attacks have gained increasing attention due to their success in probing vulnerabilities, and, hence, enhancing the robustness, of neural ranking models. Conventional attack methods employ perturbations at a single granularity, e.g., word or sentence level, to target documents. However, limiting perturbations to a single level of granularity may reduce the flexibility of adversarial examples, thereby diminishing the potential threat of the attack. Therefore, we focus on generating high-quality adversarial examples by incorporating multi-granular perturbations. Achieving this objective involves tackling a combinatorial explosion problem, which requires identifying an optimal combination of perturbations across all possible levels of granularity, positions, and textual pieces. To address this challenge, we transform the multi-granular adversarial attack into a sequential decision-making process, where perturbations in the next attack step build on the perturbed document in the current attack step. Since the attack process can only access the final state without direct intermediate signals, we use reinforcement learning to perform multi-granular attacks. During the reinforcement learning process, two agents work cooperatively to identify multi-granular vulnerabilities as attack targets and organize perturbation candidates into a final perturbation sequence. Experimental results show that our attack method surpasses prevailing baselines in both attack effectiveness and imperceptibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haofeng Yuan, Rongping Zhu, Wanlu Yang, Shiji Song, Keyou You, Yuli Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The traveling purchaser problem (TPP) is an important combinatorial optimization problem with broad applications. Due to the coupling between routing and purchasing, existing works on TPPs commonly address route construction and purchase planning simultaneously, which, however, leads to exact methods with high computational cost and heuristics with sophisticated design but limited performance. In sharp contrast, we propose a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which addresses route construction and purchase planning separately, while evaluating and optimizing the solution from a global perspective. The key components of our approach include a bipartite graph representation for TPPs to capture the market-product relations, and a policy network that extracts information from the bipartite graph and uses it to sequentially construct the route. One significant benefit of our framework is that we can efficiently construct the route using the policy network, and once the route is determined, the associated purchasing plan can be easily derived through linear programming, while, leveraging DRL, we can train the policy network to optimize the global solution objective. Furthermore, by introducing a meta-learning strategy, the policy network can be trained stably on large-sized TPP instances, and generalize well across instances of varying sizes and distributions, even to much larger instances that are never seen during training. Experiments on various synthetic TPP instances and the TPPLIB benchmark demonstrate that our DRL-based approach can significantly outperform well-established TPP heuristics, reducing the optimality gap by 40%-90%, and also showing an advantage in runtime, especially on large-sized instances.</p>

<p>Abstract: Projected policy gradient under the simplex parameterization, policy gradient and natural policy gradient under the softmax parameterization, are fundamental algorithms in reinforcement learning. There have been a flurry of recent activities in studying these algorithms from the theoretical aspect. Despite this, their convergence behavior is still not fully understood, even given the access to exact policy evaluations. In this paper, we focus on the discounted MDP setting and conduct a systematic study of the aforementioned policy optimization methods. Several novel results are presented, including 1) global linear convergence of projected policy gradient for any constant step size, 2) sublinear convergence of softmax policy gradient for any constant step size, 3) global linear convergence of softmax natural policy gradient for any constant step size, 4) global linear convergence of entropy regularized softmax policy gradient for a wider range of constant step sizes than existing result, 5) tight local linear convergence rate of entropy regularized natural policy gradient, and 6) a new and concise local quadratic convergence rate of soft policy iteration without the assumption on the stationary distribution under the optimal policy. New and elementary analysis techniques have been developed to establish these results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lynn Miller, Charlotte Pelletier, Geoffrey I. Webb</p>
<p>Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellite missions have been providing detailed images about the state of the Earth and its land cover for over 50 years. Long term missions, such as NASA's Landsat, Terra, and Aqua satellites, and more recently, the ESA's Sentinel missions, record images of the entire world every few days. Although single images provide point-in-time data, repeated images of the same area, or satellite image time series (SITS) provide information about the changing state of vegetation and land use. These SITS are useful for modeling dynamic processes and seasonal changes such as plant phenology. They have potential benefits for many aspects of land and natural resource management, including applications in agricultural, forest, water, and disaster management, urban planning, and mining. However, the resulting satellite image time series (SITS) are complex, incorporating information from the temporal, spatial, and spectral dimensions. Therefore, deep learning methods are often deployed as they can analyze these complex relationships. This review presents a summary of the state-of-the-art methods of modelling environmental, agricultural, and other Earth observation variables from SITS data using deep learning methods. We aim to provide a resource for remote sensing experts interested in using deep learning techniques to enhance Earth observation models with temporal information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Dada, Marie Bauer, Amanda Butler Contreras, Osman Alperen Kora\c{s}, Constantin Marc Seibold, Kaleb E Smith, Jens Kleesiek</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to significantly contribute to patient care, diagnostics, and administrative processes. Emerging biomedical LLMs address healthcare-specific challenges, including privacy demands and computational constraints. However, evaluation of these models has primarily been limited to non-clinical tasks, which do not reflect the complexity of practical clinical applications. Additionally, there has been no thorough comparison between biomedical and general-domain LLMs for clinical tasks. To fill this gap, we present the Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation (CLUE), a benchmark tailored to evaluate LLMs on real-world clinical tasks. CLUE includes two novel datasets derived from MIMIC IV discharge letters and four existing tasks designed to test the practical applicability of LLMs in healthcare settings. Our evaluation covers several biomedical and general domain LLMs, providing insights into their clinical performance and applicability. CLUE represents a step towards a standardized approach to evaluating and developing LLMs in healthcare to align future model development with the real-world needs of clinical application. We publish our evaluation and data generation scripts: https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/CLUE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirban Mukherjee, Hannah Hanwen Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Social science research often hinges on the relationship between categorical variables and outcomes. We introduce CAVIAR, a novel method for embedding categorical variables that assume values in a high-dimensional ambient space but are sampled from an underlying manifold. Our theoretical and numerical analyses outline challenges posed by such categorical variables in causal inference. Specifically, dynamically varying and sparse levels can lead to violations of the Donsker conditions and a failure of the estimation functionals to converge to a tight Gaussian process. Traditional approaches, including the exclusion of rare categorical levels and principled variable selection models like LASSO, fall short. CAVIAR embeds the data into a lower-dimensional global coordinate system. The mapping can be derived from both structured and unstructured data, and ensures stable and robust estimates through dimensionality reduction. In a dataset of direct-to-consumer apparel sales, we illustrate how high-dimensional categorical variables, such as zip codes, can be succinctly represented, facilitating inference and analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Zecchin, Kai Yu, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pre-trained sequence models, such as transformers, excel as few-shot learners capable of in-context learning (ICL). In ICL, a model is trained to adapt its operation to a new task based on limited contextual information, typically in the form of a few training examples for the given task. Previous work has explored the use of ICL for channel equalization in single-user multi-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this work, we demonstrate that ICL can be also used to tackle the problem of multi-user equalization in cell-free MIMO systems with limited fronthaul capacity. In this scenario, a task is defined by channel statistics, signal-to-noise ratio, and modulation schemes. The context encompasses the users' pilot sequences, the corresponding quantized received signals, and the current received data signal. Different prompt design strategies are proposed and evaluated that encompass also large-scale fading and modulation information. Experiments demonstrate that ICL-based equalization provides estimates with lower mean squared error as compared to the linear minimum mean squared error equalizer, especially in the presence of limited fronthaul capacity and pilot contamination.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05985">Boosting Digital Safeguards: Blending Cryptography and Steganography</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anamitra Maiti, Subham Laha, Rishav Upadhaya, Soumyajit Biswas, Vikas Chaudhary, Biplab Kar, Nikhil Kumar, Jaydip Sen</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's digital age, the internet is essential for communication and the sharing of information, creating a critical need for sophisticated data security measures to prevent unauthorized access and exploitation. Cryptography encrypts messages into a cipher text that is incomprehensible to unauthorized readers, thus safeguarding data during its transmission. Steganography, on the other hand, originates from the Greek term for "covered writing" and involves the art of hiding data within another medium, thereby facilitating covert communication by making the message invisible. This proposed approach takes advantage of the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL), especially through the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to improve upon traditional steganographic methods. By embedding encrypted data within another medium, our method ensures that the communication remains hidden from prying eyes. The application of GANs enables a smart, secure system that utilizes the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to slight alterations in data, enhancing the protection against detection. By merging the encryption techniques of cryptography with the hiding capabilities of steganography, and augmenting these with the strengths of AI, we introduce a comprehensive security system designed to maintain both the privacy and integrity of information. This system is crafted not just to prevent unauthorized access or modification of data, but also to keep the existence of the data hidden. This fusion of technologies tackles the core challenges of data security in the current era of open digital communication, presenting an advanced solution with the potential to transform the landscape of information security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiven Sinha, Ameya Prabhu, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Siddharth Bhat, Matthias Bethge</p>
<p>Abstract: Proving geometric theorems constitutes a hallmark of visual reasoning combining both intuitive and logical skills. Therefore, automated theorem proving of Olympiad-level geometry problems is considered a notable milestone in human-level automated reasoning. The introduction of AlphaGeometry, a neuro-symbolic model trained with 100 million synthetic samples, marked a major breakthrough. It solved 25 of 30 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems whereas the reported baseline based on Wu's method solved only ten. In this note, we revisit the IMO-AG-30 Challenge introduced with AlphaGeometry, and find that Wu's method is surprisingly strong. Wu's method alone can solve 15 problems, and some of them are not solved by any of the other methods. This leads to two key findings: (i) Combining Wu's method with the classic synthetic methods of deductive databases and angle, ratio, and distance chasing solves 21 out of 30 methods by just using a CPU-only laptop with a time limit of 5 minutes per problem. Essentially, this classic method solves just 4 problems less than AlphaGeometry and establishes the first fully symbolic baseline strong enough to rival the performance of an IMO silver medalist. (ii) Wu's method even solves 2 of the 5 problems that AlphaGeometry failed to solve. Thus, by combining AlphaGeometry with Wu's method we set a new state-of-the-art for automated theorem proving on IMO-AG-30, solving 27 out of 30 problems, the first AI method which outperforms an IMO gold medalist.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06647">From Protoscience to Epistemic Monoculture: How Benchmarking Set the Stage for the Deep Learning Revolution</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bernard J. Koch, David Peterson</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, AI research has focused heavily on building ever-larger deep learning models. This approach has simultaneously unlocked incredible achievements in science and technology, and hindered AI from overcoming long-standing limitations with respect to explainability, ethical harms, and environmental efficiency. Drawing on qualitative interviews and computational analyses, our three-part history of AI research traces the creation of this "epistemic monoculture" back to a radical reconceptualization of scientific progress that began in the late 1980s. In the first era of AI research (1950s-late 1980s), researchers and patrons approached AI as a "basic" science that would advance through autonomous exploration and organic assessments of progress (e.g., peer-review, theoretical consensus). The failure of this approach led to a retrenchment of funding in the 1980s. Amid this "AI Winter," an intervention by the U.S. government reoriented the field towards measurable progress on tasks of military and commercial interest. A new evaluation system called "benchmarking" provided an objective way to quantify progress on tasks by focusing exclusively on increasing predictive accuracy on example datasets. Distilling science down to verifiable metrics clarified the roles of scientists, allowed the field to rapidly integrate talent, and provided clear signals of significance and progress. But history has also revealed a tradeoff to this streamlined approach to science: the consolidation around external interests and inherent conservatism of benchmarking has disincentivized exploration beyond scaling monoculture. In the discussion, we explain how AI's monoculture offers a compelling challenge to the belief that basic, exploration-driven research is needed for scientific progress. Implications for the spread of AI monoculture to other sciences in the era of generative AI are also discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas F Burns</p>
<p>Abstract: I introduce a novel associative memory model named Correlated Dense Associative Memory (CDAM), which integrates both auto- and hetero-association in a unified framework for continuous-valued memory patterns. Employing an arbitrary graph structure to semantically link memory patterns, CDAM is theoretically and numerically analysed, revealing four distinct dynamical modes: auto-association, narrow hetero-association, wide hetero-association, and neutral quiescence. Drawing inspiration from inhibitory modulation studies, I employ anti-Hebbian learning rules to control the range of hetero-association, extract multi-scale representations of community structures in graphs, and stabilise the recall of temporal sequences. Experimental demonstrations showcase CDAM's efficacy in handling real-world data, replicating a classical neuroscience experiment, performing image retrieval, and simulating arbitrary finite automata.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) on solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complex liquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI Molecular Simulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytes for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MD simulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Our current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with experimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability to molecules not included in the quantum mechanical dataset. We envision this work as paving the way to a "universal MLFF" capable of simulating properties of common organic liquids.</p>
