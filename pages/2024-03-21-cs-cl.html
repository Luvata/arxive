<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengxian Lyu, Cheng Peng, Xiaohan Li, Patrick Balian, Jiang Bian, Yonghui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic text summarization (ATS) is an emerging technology to assist clinicians in providing continuous and coordinated care. This study presents an approach to summarize doctor-patient dialogues using generative large language models (LLMs). We developed prompt-tuning algorithms to instruct generative LLMs to summarize clinical text. We examined the prompt-tuning strategies, the size of soft prompts, and the few-short learning ability of GatorTronGPT, a generative clinical LLM developed using 277 billion clinical and general English words with up to 20 billion parameters. We compared GatorTronGPT with a previous solution based on fine-tuning of a widely used T5 model, using a clinical benchmark dataset MTS-DIALOG. The experimental results show that the GatorTronGPT- 20B model achieved the best performance on all evaluation metrics. The proposed solution has a low computing cost as the LLM parameters are not updated during prompt-tuning. This study demonstrates the efficiency of generative clinical LLMs for clinical ATS through prompt tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M Manvith Prabhu, Haricharana Srinivasa, Anand Kumar M</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper summarizes Team SCaLAR's work on SemEval-2024 Task 5: Legal Argument Reasoning in Civil Procedure. To address this Binary Classification task, which was daunting due to the complexity of the Legal Texts involved, we propose a simple yet novel similarity and distance-based unsupervised approach to generate labels. Further, we explore the Multi-level fusion of Legal-Bert embeddings using ensemble features, including CNN, GRU, and LSTM. To address the lengthy nature of Legal explanation in the dataset, we introduce T5-based segment-wise summarization, which successfully retained crucial information, enhancing the model's performance. Our unsupervised system witnessed a 20-point increase in macro F1-score on the development set and a 10-point increase on the test set, which is promising given its uncomplicated architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo-Ru Lu, Nikita Haduong, Chien-Yu Lin, Hao Cheng, Noah A. Smith, Mari Ostendorf</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based NLP models are powerful but have high computational costs that limit deployment scenarios. Finetuned encoder-decoder models are popular in specialized domains and can outperform larger more generalized decoder-only models, such as GPT-4. We introduce a new configuration for encoder-decoder models that improves efficiency on structured output and question-answering tasks where multiple outputs are required of a single input. Our method, prompt-in-decoder (PiD), encodes the input once and decodes output in parallel, boosting both training and inference efficiency by avoiding duplicate input encoding, thereby reducing the decoder's memory footprint. We achieve computation reduction that roughly scales with the number of subtasks, gaining up to 4.6x speed-up over state-of-the-art models for dialogue state tracking, summarization, and question-answering tasks with comparable or better performance. We release our training/inference code and checkpoints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michele Resta, Davide Bacciu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Neural Machine Translation systems exhibit strong performance in several different languages and are constantly improving. Their ability to learn continuously is, however, still severely limited by the catastrophic forgetting issue. In this work, we leverage a key property of encoder-decoder Transformers, i.e. their generative ability, to propose a novel approach to continually learning Neural Machine Translation systems. We show how this can effectively learn on a stream of experiences comprising different languages, by leveraging a replay memory populated by using the model itself as a generator of parallel sentences. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can counteract catastrophic forgetting without requiring explicit memorization of training data. Code will be publicly available upon publication.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiqi He, Kwanghee Choi, Lindia Tjuatja, Nathaniel R. Robinson, Jiatong Shi, Shinji Watanabe, Graham Neubig, David R. Mortensen, Lori Levin</p>
<p>Abstract: Thousands of the world's languages are in danger of extinction--a tremendous threat to cultural identities and human language diversity. Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) is a form of linguistic annotation that can support documentation and resource creation for these languages' communities. IGT typically consists of (1) transcriptions, (2) morphological segmentation, (3) glosses, and (4) free translations to a majority language. We propose Wav2Gloss: a task to extract these four annotation components automatically from speech, and introduce the first dataset to this end, Fieldwork: a corpus of speech with all these annotations covering 37 languages with standard formatting and train/dev/test splits. We compare end-to-end and cascaded Wav2Gloss methods, with analysis suggesting that pre-trained decoders assist with translation and glossing, that multi-task and multilingual approaches are underperformant, and that end-to-end systems perform better than cascaded systems, despite the text-only systems' advantages. We provide benchmarks to lay the ground work for future research on IGT generation from speech.</p>

This paper details our solution for the BetterMixture challenge, which focuses on the fine-tuning data mixing for large language models. Our approach, which secured third place, incorporates data deduplication, low-level and high-level quality filtering, and diversity selection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Parnell, Inigo Jauregi Unanue, Massimo Piccardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-lingual summarization (XLS) generates summaries in a language different from that of the input documents (e.g., English to Spanish), allowing speakers of the target language to gain a concise view of their content. In the present day, the predominant approach to this task is to take a performing, pretrained multilingual language model (LM) and fine-tune it for XLS on the language pairs of interest. However, the scarcity of fine-tuning samples makes this approach challenging in some cases. For this reason, in this paper we propose revisiting the summarize-and-translate pipeline, where the summarization and translation tasks are performed in a sequence. This approach allows reusing the many, publicly-available resources for monolingual summarization and translation, obtaining a very competitive zero-shot performance. In addition, the proposed pipeline is completely differentiable end-to-end, allowing it to take advantage of few-shot fine-tuning, where available. Experiments over two contemporary and widely adopted XLS datasets (CrossSum and WikiLingua) have shown the remarkable zero-shot performance of the proposed approach, and also its strong few-shot performance compared to an equivalent multilingual LM baseline, that the proposed approach has been able to outperform in many languages with only 10% of the fine-tuning samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Zhou, Jianmin Wang, Chunyan Li, Zixu Wang, Yiping Liu, Siqi Sun, Jianxin Lin, Longyue Wang, Xiangxiang Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: While various models and computational tools have been proposed for structure and property analysis of molecules, generating molecules that conform to all desired structures and properties remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a multi-constraint molecular generation large language model, TSMMG, which, akin to a student, incorporates knowledge from various small models and tools, namely, the 'teachers'. To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of text-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers', enabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions through various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably performs in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described property requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an average molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 88.08%, 65.27%, and 61.44%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot testing, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have not been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language styles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through empirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG contributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative approach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data scarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains of drug discovery and materials science.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13250">Facilitating Pornographic Text Detection for Open-Domain Dialogue Systems via Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Huachuan Qiu, Shuai Zhang, Hongliang He, Anqi Li, Zhenzhong Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Pornographic content occurring in human-machine interaction dialogues can cause severe side effects for users in open-domain dialogue systems. However, research on detecting pornographic language within human-machine interaction dialogues is an important subject that is rarely studied. To advance in this direction, we introduce CensorChat, a dialogue monitoring dataset aimed at detecting whether the dialogue session contains pornographic content. To this end, we collect real-life human-machine interaction dialogues in the wild and break them down into single utterances and single-turn dialogues, with the last utterance spoken by the chatbot. We propose utilizing knowledge distillation of large language models to annotate the dataset. Specifically, first, the raw dataset is annotated by four open-source large language models, with the majority vote determining the label. Second, we use ChatGPT to update the empty label from the first step. Third, to ensure the quality of the validation and test sets, we utilize GPT-4 for label calibration. If the current label does not match the one generated by GPT-4, we employ a self-criticism strategy to verify its correctness. Finally, to facilitate the detection of pornographic text, we develop a series of text classifiers using a pseudo-labeled dataset. Detailed data analysis demonstrates that leveraging knowledge distillation techniques with large language models provides a practical and cost-efficient method for developing pornographic text detectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Todd K Moon, Jacob H. Gunther</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the years there has been ongoing interest in detecting authorship of a text based on statistical properties of the text, such as by using occurrence rates of noncontextual words. In previous work, these techniques have been used, for example, to determine authorship of all of \emph{The Federalist Papers}. Such methods may be useful in more modern times to detect fake or AI authorship. Progress in statistical natural language parsers introduces the possibility of using grammatical structure to detect authorship. In this paper we explore a new possibility for detecting authorship using grammatical structural information extracted using a statistical natural language parser. This paper provides a proof of concept, testing author classification based on grammatical structure on a set of "proof texts," The Federalist Papers and Sanditon which have been as test cases in previous authorship detection studies. Several features extracted from the statistical natural language parser were explored: all subtrees of some depth from any level; rooted subtrees of some depth, part of speech, and part of speech by level in the parse tree. It was found to be helpful to project the features into a lower dimensional space. Statistical experiments on these documents demonstrate that information from a statistical parser can, in fact, assist in distinguishing authors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charles Goddard, Shamane Siriwardhana, Malikeh Ehghaghi, Luke Meyers, Vlad Karpukhin, Brian Benedict, Mark McQuade, Jacob Solawetz</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of the open-source language model landscape presents an opportunity to merge the competencies of these model checkpoints by combining their parameters. Advances in transfer learning, the process of fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific tasks, has resulted in the development of vast amounts of task-specific models, typically specialized in individual tasks and unable to utilize each other's strengths. Model merging facilitates the creation of multitask models without the need for additional training, offering a promising avenue for enhancing model performance and versatility. By preserving the intrinsic capabilities of the original models, model merging addresses complex challenges in AI - including the difficulties of catastrophic forgetting and multi-task learning. To support this expanding area of research, we introduce MergeKit, a comprehensive, open-source library designed to facilitate the application of model merging strategies. MergeKit offers an extensible framework to efficiently merge models on any hardware, providing utility to researchers and practitioners. To date, thousands of models have been merged by the open-source community, leading to the creation of some of the worlds most powerful open-source model checkpoints, as assessed by the Open LLM Leaderboard.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Liu, Souvik Kundu, Anni Li, Junrui Wan, Lianghao Jiang, Peter Anthony Beerel</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, dubbed as Adaptive Freezing of Low Rank Adaptation (AFLoRA). Specifically, for each pre-trained frozen weight tensor, we add a parallel path of trainable low-rank matrices, namely a down-projection and an up-projection matrix, each of which is followed by a feature transformation vector. Based on a novel freezing score, we the incrementally freeze these projection matrices during fine-tuning to reduce the computation and alleviate over-fitting. Our experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of up to $0.85\%$ as evaluated on GLUE benchmark while yeilding up to $9.5\times$ fewer average trainable parameters. While compared in terms of runtime, AFLoRA can yield up to $1.86\times$ improvement as opposed to similar PEFT alternatives. Besides the practical utility of our approach, we provide insights on the trainability requirements of LoRA paths at different modules and the freezing schedule for the different projection matrices. Code will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with complex logical reasoning due to logical inconsistencies and the inherent difficulty of such reasoning. We use Lean, a theorem proving framework, to address these challenges. By formalizing logical reasoning problems into theorems within Lean, we can solve them by proving or disproving the corresponding theorems. This method reduces the risk of logical inconsistencies with the help of Lean's symbolic solver. It also enhances our ability to treat complex reasoning tasks by using Lean's extensive library of theorem proofs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FOLIO dataset and achieves performance near this level on ProofWriter. Notably, these results were accomplished by fine-tuning on fewer than 100 in-domain samples for each dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic extraction of medical information from clinical documents poses several challenges: high costs of required clinical expertise, limited interpretability of model predictions, restricted computational resources and privacy regulations. Recent advances in domain-adaptation and prompting methods showed promising results with minimal training data using lightweight masked language models, which are suited for well-established interpretability methods. We are first to present a systematic evaluation of these methods in a low-resource setting, by performing multi-class section classification on German doctor's letters. We conduct extensive class-wise evaluations supported by Shapley values, to validate the quality of our small training data set and to ensure the interpretability of model predictions. We demonstrate that a lightweight, domain-adapted pretrained model, prompted with just 20 shots, outperforms a traditional classification model by 30.5% accuracy. Our results serve as a process-oriented guideline for clinical information extraction projects working with low-resource.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijian Lu, Aiwei Liu, Dianzhi Yu, Jingjing Li, Irwin King</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, text watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs) can embed hidden features to texts generated by LLMs to facilitate subsequent detection, thus alleviating the problem of misuse of LLMs. Although the current text watermarking algorithms perform well in most high-entropy scenarios, its performance in low-entropy scenarios still needs to be improved. In this work, we proposed that the influence of token entropy should be fully considered in the watermark detection process, that is, the weight of each token should be adjusted according to its entropy during watermark detection, rather than setting the weight of all tokens to the same value as in previous methods. Specifically, we proposed an Entropy-based Watermark Detection (EWD) that gives higher-entropy tokens higher weights during watermark detection, so as to better reflect the degree of watermarking. Furthermore, the proposed detection process is training-free and fully automated. %In actual detection, we use a proxy-LLM to calculate the entropy of each token, without the need to use the original LLM. In the experiment, we found that our method can achieve better detection performance in low-entropy scenarios, and our method is also general and can be applied to texts with different entropy distributions. Our code and data will be available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adnan Al Ali, Jind\v{r}ich Libovick\'y</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural language models, which reach state-of-the-art results on most natural language processing tasks, are trained on large text corpora that inevitably contain value-burdened content and often capture undesirable biases, which the models reflect. This case study focuses on the political biases of pre-trained encoders in Czech and compares them with a representative value survey. Because Czech is a gendered language, we also measure how the grammatical gender coincides with responses to men and women in the survey. We introduce a novel method for measuring the model's perceived political values. We find that the models do not assign statement probability following value-driven reasoning, and there is no systematic difference between feminine and masculine sentences. We conclude that BERT-sized models do not manifest systematic alignment with political values and that the biases observed in the models are rather due to superficial imitation of training data patterns than systematic value beliefs encoded in the models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paloma Garc\'ia-de-Herreros, Vagrant Gautam, Philipp Slusallek, Dietrich Klakow, Marius Mosbach</p>
<p>Abstract: ORCA (Shen et al., 2023) is a recent technique for cross-modal fine-tuning, i.e., applying pre-trained transformer models to modalities beyond their training data. The technique consists primarily of training an embedder and fine-tuning the embedder and model. Despite its high performance on a variety of downstream tasks, we do not understand precisely how each of these components contribute to ORCA's success. Therefore, we run a series of ablations and find that embedder training does not help 2D tasks at all, contrary to what the original paper posits. In 1D tasks, some amount of embedder training is necessary but more is not better. In 4 out of 6 datasets we experiment with, it is model fine-tuning that makes the biggest difference. Through our ablations and baselines, we contribute a better understanding of the individual components of ORCA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Zeldes, Tatsuya Aoyama, Yang Janet Liu, Siyao Peng, Debopam Das, Luke Gessler</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article we present Enhanced Rhetorical Structure Theory (eRST), a new theoretical framework for computational discourse analysis, based on an expansion of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). The framework encompasses discourse relation graphs with tree-breaking, nonprojective and concurrent relations, as well as implicit and explicit signals which give explainable rationales to our analyses. We survey shortcomings of RST and other existing frameworks, such as Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT), the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) and Discourse Dependencies, and address these using constructs in the proposed theory. We provide annotation, search and visualization tools for data, and present and evaluate a freely available corpus of English annotated according to our framework, encompassing 12 spoken and written genres with over 200K tokens. Finally, we discuss automatic parsing, evaluation metrics and applications for data in our framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of multi-reward reinforcement learning to jointly optimize for multiple text qualities for natural language generation. We focus on the task of counselor reflection generation, where we optimize the generators to simultaneously improve the fluency, coherence, and reflection quality of generated counselor responses. We introduce two novel bandit methods, DynaOpt and C-DynaOpt, which rely on the broad strategy of combining rewards into a single value and optimizing them simultaneously. Specifically, we employ non-contextual and contextual multi-arm bandits to dynamically adjust multiple reward weights during training. Through automatic and manual evaluations, we show that our proposed techniques, DynaOpt and C-DynaOpt, outperform existing naive and bandit baselines, showcasing their potential for enhancing language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adian Liusie, Yassir Fathullah, Mark J. F. Gales</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities and versatility in NLP tasks, however they sometimes fail to maintain crucial invariances for specific tasks. One example is permutation sensitivity, where LLMs' outputs may significantly vary depending on the order of the input options. While debiasing techniques can mitigate these issues, and yield better performance and reliability, they often come with a high computational cost at inference. This paper addresses this inefficiency at inference time. The aim is to distill the capabilities of a computationally intensive, debiased, teacher model into a more compact student model. We explore two variants of student models: one based on pure distillation, and the other on an error-correction approach for more complex tasks, where the student corrects a single biased decision from the teacher to achieve a debiased output. Our approach is general and can be applied to both black-box and white-box LLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our compact, encoder-only student models can outperform their larger, biased teacher counterparts, achieving better results with significantly fewer parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction-finetuned Large Language Models inherit clear political leanings that have been shown to influence downstream task performance. We expand this line of research beyond the two-party system in the US and audit Llama Chat in the context of EU politics in various settings to analyze the model's political knowledge and its ability to reason in context. We adapt, i.e., further fine-tune, Llama Chat on speeches of individual euro-parties from debates in the European Parliament to reevaluate its political leaning based on the EUandI questionnaire. Llama Chat shows considerable knowledge of national parties' positions and is capable of reasoning in context. The adapted, party-specific, models are substantially re-aligned towards respective positions which we see as a starting point for using chat-based LLMs as data-driven conversational engines to assist research in political science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meet Doshi, Raj Dabre, Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the utility of \textit{Translationese} as synthetic data created using machine translation for pre-training language models (LMs). Pre-training requires vast amounts of monolingual data, which is mostly unavailable for languages other than English. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using synthetic data to address this data scarcity. We take the case of English and Indic languages and translate web-crawled monolingual documents (clean) into the target language. Then, we train language models containing 28M and 85M parameters on this translationese data (synthetic). We show that their performance on downstream natural language understanding and generative tasks is only 3.56\% poorer on NLU tasks and 1.51\% on NLG tasks than LMs pre-trained on clean data. Further, we propose the use of lightweight \textit{TinyLMs} pre-trained on clean data to filter synthetic data efficiently which significantly improves the performance of our models. We also find that LMs trained on synthetic data strongly benefit from extended pretraining on a tiny fraction (10\%) of clean data. We release the data we collected and created as a part of this work, \textit{IndicMonoDoc}, the largest collection of monolingual document-level corpora, which we hope will help bridge the gap between English and non-English performance for large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gorka Azkune, Ander Salaberria, Eneko Agirre</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper shows that text-only Language Models (LM) can learn to ground spatial relations like "left of" or "below" if they are provided with explicit location information of objects and they are properly trained to leverage those locations. We perform experiments on a verbalized version of the Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset, where images are coupled with textual statements which contain real or fake spatial relations between two objects of the image. We verbalize the images using an off-the-shelf object detector, adding location tokens to every object label to represent their bounding boxes in textual form. Given the small size of VSR, we do not observe any improvement when using locations, but pretraining the LM over a synthetic dataset automatically derived by us improves results significantly when using location tokens. We thus show that locations allow LMs to ground spatial relations, with our text-only LMs outperforming Vision-and-Language Models and setting the new state-of-the-art for the VSR dataset. Our analysis show that our text-only LMs can generalize beyond the relations seen in the synthetic dataset to some extent, learning also more useful information than that encoded in the spatial rules we used to create the synthetic dataset itself.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongzhan Chen, Hehong Chen, Ming Yan, Wenshen Xu, Xing Gao, Weizhou Shen, Xiaojun Quan, Chenliang Li, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of various AI conversational agents, including role-playing conversational agents that mimic diverse characters and human behaviors. While prior research has predominantly focused on enhancing the conversational capability, role-specific knowledge, and stylistic attributes of these agents, there has been a noticeable gap in assessing their social intelligence. In this paper, we introduce RoleInteract, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of role-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels of social interactions. The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and covers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and 30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. We find that agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in group level. Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the influence exerted by other agents within the group. Experimental results on RoleInteract confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social interaction of role-playing conversational agents. The benchmark is publicly accessible at https://github.com/X-PLUG/RoleInteract.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mitodru Niyogi, Arnab Bhattacharya</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present PARAMANU-AYN, a language model based exclusively on case documents of the Supreme Court of India, the Constitution of India, and the Indian Penal Code. The novel Auto Regressive (AR) decoder based model is pretrained from scratch at a context size of 8192. We evaluated our pretrained legal model on perplexity metrics. We also instruction-tuned our pretrained model on a set of 10,763 instructions covering various legal tasks such as legal reasoning, judgement explanation, legal clause generation, legal drafting, legal contract drafting, case summarization, constitutional question-answering, etc. We also evaluated the responses of prompts for instruction-tuned models by GPT-3.5-Turbo on clarity, relevance, completeness, and legal reasoning metrics in a scale of 10. Our model can be run on CPU and achieved 42.46 tokens/sec CPU inference speed. We found that our models, despite not being pretrained on legal books, various legal contracts, and legal documents, were able to learn the domain knowledge required for drafting various legal contracts and legal clauses, and generalize to draft legal contracts and legal clauses with limited instruction tuning. Hence, we conclude that for a strong domain-specialized generative language model (such as legal), very large amounts of data are not required to develop models from scratch. We believe that this work is the first attempt to make a dedicated generative legal language model from scratch for Indian Supreme Court jurisdiction or in legal NLP overall. We plan to release our Paramanu-Ayn model at https://www.bharatgpts.com.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity recently due to their outstanding performance in various downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, low-resource languages are still lagging behind current state-of-the-art (SOTA) developments in the field of NLP due to insufficient resources to train LLMs. Ethiopian languages exhibit remarkable linguistic diversity, encompassing a wide array of scripts, and are imbued with profound religious and cultural significance. This paper introduces EthioLLM -- multilingual large language models for five Ethiopian languages (Amharic, Ge'ez, Afan Oromo, Somali, and Tigrinya) and English, and Ethiobenchmark -- a new benchmark dataset for various downstream NLP tasks. We evaluate the performance of these models across five downstream NLP tasks. We open-source our multilingual language models, new benchmark datasets for various downstream tasks, and task-specific fine-tuned language models and discuss the performance of the models.

<p>Abstract: The relationship between language model tokenization and performance is an open area of research. Here, we investigate how different tokenization schemes impact number agreement in Spanish plurals. We find that morphologically-aligned tokenization performs similarly to other tokenization schemes, even when induced artificially for words that would not be tokenized that way during training. We then present exploratory analyses demonstrating that language model embeddings for different plural tokenizations have similar distributions along the embedding space axis that maximally distinguishes singular and plural nouns. Our results suggest that morphologically-aligned tokenization is a viable tokenization approach, and existing models already generalize some morphological patterns to new items. However, our results indicate that morphological tokenization is not strictly required for performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehun Jung, Ximing Lu, Liwei Jiang, Faeze Brahman, Peter West, Pang Wei Koh, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The current winning recipe for automatic summarization is using proprietary large-scale language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT as is, or imitation learning from them as teacher models. While increasingly ubiquitous dependence on such large-scale language models is convenient, there remains an important question of whether small-scale models could have achieved competitive results, if we were to seek an alternative learning method -- that allows for a more cost-efficient, controllable, yet powerful summarizer. We present InfoSumm, a novel framework to distill a powerful summarizer based on the information-theoretic objective for summarization, without relying on either the LLM's capability or human-written references. To achieve this, we first propose a novel formulation of the desiderata of summarization (saliency, faithfulness and brevity) through the lens of mutual information between the original document and the summary. Based on this formulation, we start off from Pythia-2.8B as the teacher model, which is not yet capable of summarization, then self-train the model to optimize for the information-centric measures of ideal summaries. Distilling from the improved teacher, we arrive at a compact but powerful summarizer with only 568M parameters that performs competitively against ChatGPT, without ever relying on ChatGPT's capabilities. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our approach outperforms in-domain supervised models in human evaluation, let alone state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, and wins over ChatGPT in controllable summarization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13786">Chain-of-Interaction: Enhancing Large Language Models for Psychiatric Behavior Understanding by Dyadic Contexts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangzeng Han, Weisi Liu, Xiaolei Huang, Brian Borsari</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic coding patient behaviors is essential to support decision making for psychotherapists during the motivational interviewing (MI), a collaborative communication intervention approach to address psychiatric issues, such as alcohol and drug addiction. While the behavior coding task has rapidly adapted machine learning to predict patient states during the MI sessions, lacking of domain-specific knowledge and overlooking patient-therapist interactions are major challenges in developing and deploying those models in real practice. To encounter those challenges, we introduce the Chain-of-Interaction (CoI) prompting method aiming to contextualize large language models (LLMs) for psychiatric decision support by the dyadic interactions. The CoI prompting approach systematically breaks down the coding task into three key reasoning steps, extract patient engagement, learn therapist question strategies, and integrates dyadic interactions between patients and therapists. This approach enables large language models to leverage the coding scheme, patient state, and domain knowledge for patient behavioral coding. Experiments on real-world datasets can prove the effectiveness and flexibility of our prompting method with multiple state-of-the-art LLMs over existing prompting baselines. We have conducted extensive ablation analysis and demonstrate the critical role of dyadic interactions in applying LLMs for psychotherapy behavior understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olga Golovneva, Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have a surprising failure: when trained on "A has a feature B", they do not generalize to "B is a feature of A", which is termed the Reversal Curse. Even when training with trillions of tokens this issue still appears due to Zipf's law - hence even if we train on the entire internet. This work proposes an alternative training scheme, called reverse training, whereby all words are used twice, doubling the amount of available tokens. The LLM is trained in both forward and reverse directions by reversing the training strings while preserving (i.e., not reversing) chosen substrings, such as entities. We show that data-matched reverse-trained models provide superior performance to standard models on standard tasks, and compute-matched reverse-trained models provide far superior performance on reversal tasks, helping resolve the reversal curse issue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajendra Kumar Solanki</p>
<p>Abstract: In our times, when the world is increasingly becoming more dependent on software programs, writing bug-free, correct programs is crucial. Program verification based on formal methods can guarantee this by detecting run-time errors in safety-critical systems to avoid possible adverse impacts on human life and save time and money.
  This project work tries to leverage Abstract Interpretation techniques for static analysis of C programs. C Analyzer is a tool developed for static analysis of C programs. This implementation of C Analyzer provides a plug-and-play domain architecture for multiple abstract domains to be used. C Analyzer supports four abstract domains - Interval, Octagon, Polyhedra, and Bit Vector. We use these different domains for required precision in program verification. C Analyzer tool uses LLVM C/C++ compiler frontend Clang API to generate and traverse the Control Flow Graph (CFG) of a given C program. This tool generates invariants in different abstract domains for statements in basic blocks of CFG during CFG traversal. Using these invariants, some properties of a program, such as dividing by zero, modulus zero, arithmetic overflow, etc., can be analyzed. We also use a source-to-source transformation tool, CIL (Common Intermediate language), to transform some C constructs into simpler constructs, such as transforming logical operators, switch statements, and conditional operators into if-else ladders and transforming do-while and for loops into while loops.
  Using C Analyzer, C program constructs such as declarations, assignments, binary operations (arithmetic, relational, bitwise shift, etc.), conditions (if-else), loops (while, do while, for loop), nested conditions, and nested loops can be analyzed. Currently, this tool does not support arrays, structures, unions, pointers, or function calls.</p>

These SMILES strings are used in different complex machine learning-based drug-related research and representation works.

Our experiments affirm the possibility with very competitive scores. The study explores the notion of viewing each atom and bond as sentence components, employing basic NLP methods to categorize drug types, proving that complex problems can also be solved with simpler perspectives.

<p>Abstract: Few-shot prompting and step-by-step reasoning have enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling complex tasks including code generation. In this paper, we introduce a prompt selection and augmentation algorithm aimed at improving mathematical reasoning and robot arm operations. Our approach incorporates a multi-stage example augmentation scheme combined with an example selection scheme. This algorithm improves LLM performance by selecting a set of examples that increase diversity, minimize redundancy, and increase relevance to the question. When combined with the Program-of-Thought prompting, our algorithm demonstrates an improvement in performance on the GSM8K and SVAMP benchmarks, with increases of 0.3% and 1.1% respectively. Furthermore, in simulated tabletop environments, our algorithm surpasses the Code-as-Policies approach by achieving a 3.4% increase in successful task completions and a decrease of over 70% in the number of examples used. Its ability to discard examples that contribute little to solving the problem reduces the inferencing time of an LLM-powered robotics system. This algorithm also offers important benefits for industrial process automation by streamlining the development and deployment process, reducing manual programming effort, and enhancing code reusability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyi Zhu, Jeroen Galjaard, Pin-Yu Chen, Lydia Y. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLM) are increasingly used for text generation tasks, it is critical to audit their usages, govern their applications, and mitigate their potential harms. Existing watermark techniques are shown effective in embedding single human-imperceptible and machine-detectable patterns without significantly affecting generated text quality and semantics. However, the efficiency in detecting watermarks, i.e., the minimum number of tokens required to assert detection with significance and robustness against post-editing, is still debatable. In this paper, we propose, Duwak, to fundamentally enhance the efficiency and quality of watermarking by embedding dual secret patterns in both token probability distribution and sampling schemes. To mitigate expression degradation caused by biasing toward certain tokens, we design a contrastive search to watermark the sampling scheme, which minimizes the token repetition and enhances the diversity. We theoretically explain the interdependency of the two watermarks within Duwak. We evaluate Duwak extensively on Llama2 under various post-editing attacks, against four state-of-the-art watermarking techniques and combinations of them. Our results show that Duwak marked text achieves the highest watermarked text quality at the lowest required token count for detection, up to 70% tokens less than existing approaches, especially under post paraphrasing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Researchers and innovators have made enormous efforts in developing ideation methods, such as morphological analysis and design-by-analogy, to aid engineering design ideation for problem solving and innovation. Among these, TRIZ stands out as the most well-known approach, widely applied for systematic innovation. However, the complexity of TRIZ resources and concepts, coupled with its reliance on users' knowledge, experience, and reasoning capabilities, limits its practicability. This paper proposes AutoTRIZ, an artificial ideation tool that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the TRIZ methodology. By leveraging the broad knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs, AutoTRIZ offers a novel approach to design automation and interpretable ideation with artificial intelligence. We demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of AutoTRIZ through consistency experiments in contradiction detection and comparative studies with cases collected from TRIZ textbooks. Moreover, the proposed LLM-based framework holds the potential for extension to automate other knowledge-based ideation methods, including SCAMPER, Design Heuristics, and Design-by-Analogy, paving the way for a new era of artificial ideation for design and innovation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuowen Yuan, Zidi Xiong, Yi Zeng, Ning Yu, Ruoxi Jia, Dawn Song, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities across various tasks in different domains. However, the emergence of biases and the potential for generating harmful content in LLMs, particularly under malicious inputs, pose significant challenges. Current mitigation strategies, while effective, are not resilient under adversarial attacks. This paper introduces Resilient Guardrails for Large Language Models (RigorLLM), a novel framework designed to efficiently and effectively moderate harmful and unsafe inputs and outputs for LLMs. By employing a multi-faceted approach that includes energy-based training data augmentation through Langevin dynamics, optimizing a safe suffix for inputs via minimax optimization, and integrating a fusion-based model combining robust KNN with LLMs based on our data augmentation, RigorLLM offers a robust solution to harmful content moderation. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that RigorLLM not only outperforms existing baselines like OpenAI API and Perspective API in detecting harmful content but also exhibits unparalleled resilience to jailbreaking attacks. The innovative use of constrained optimization and a fusion-based guardrail approach represents a significant step forward in developing more secure and reliable LLMs, setting a new standard for content moderation frameworks in the face of evolving digital threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rushi Qiang, Ruiyi Zhang, Pengtao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a popular method for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models in downstream tasks by learning low-rank incremental matrices. Though LoRA and its variants effectively reduce the number of trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning methods, they often overfit training data, resulting in sub-optimal generalization on test data. To address this problem, we introduce BiLoRA, an overfitting-alleviating fine-tuning approach based on bi-level optimization (BLO). BiLoRA employs pseudo singular value decomposition to parameterize low-rank incremental matrices and splits the training of pseudo singular vectors and values across two different subsets of training data. This division, embedded within separate levels of the BLO framework, mitigates the risk of overfitting to a single dataset. Tested on ten datasets covering natural language understanding and generation tasks and applied to various well-known large pre-trained models, BiLoRA significantly outperforms LoRA methods and other fine-tuning approaches, with similar amounts of trainable parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divyansh Singhvi, Andrej Erkelens, Raghav Jain, Diganta Misra, Naomi Saphra</p>
<p>Abstract: Measuring nonlinear feature interaction is an established approach to understanding complex patterns of attribution in many models. In this paper, we use Shapley Taylor interaction indices (STII) to analyze the impact of underlying data structure on model representations in a variety of modalities, tasks, and architectures. Considering linguistic structure in masked and auto-regressive language models (MLMs and ALMs), we find that STII increases within idiomatic expressions and that MLMs scale STII with syntactic distance, relying more on syntax in their nonlinear structure than ALMs do. Our speech model findings reflect the phonetic principal that the openness of the oral cavity determines how much a phoneme varies based on its context. Finally, we study image classifiers and illustrate that feature interactions intuitively reflect object boundaries. Our wide range of results illustrates the benefits of interdisciplinary work and domain expertise in interpretability research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption in various domains. However, these advancements have also introduced additional safety risks and raised concerns regarding their detrimental impact on already marginalized populations. Despite growing mitigation efforts to develop safety safeguards, such as supervised safety-oriented fine-tuning and leveraging safe reinforcement learning from human feedback, multiple concerns regarding the safety and ingrained biases in these models remain. Furthermore, previous work has demonstrated that models optimized for safety often display exaggerated safety behaviors, such as a tendency to refrain from responding to certain requests as a precautionary measure. As such, a clear trade-off between the helpfulness and safety of these models has been documented in the literature. In this paper, we further investigate the effectiveness of safety measures by evaluating models on already mitigated biases. Using the case of Llama 2 as an example, we illustrate how LLMs' safety responses can still encode harmful assumptions. To do so, we create a set of non-toxic prompts, which we then use to evaluate Llama models. Through our new taxonomy of LLMs responses to users, we observe that the safety/helpfulness trade-offs are more pronounced for certain demographic groups which can lead to quality-of-service harms for marginalized populations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Towhidul Absar Chowdhury, Naveen Sharma, Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh</p>
<p>Abstract: A community needs assessment is a tool used by non-profits and government agencies to quantify the strengths and issues of a community, allowing them to allocate their resources better. Such approaches are transitioning towards leveraging social media conversations to analyze the needs of communities and the assets already present within them. However, manual analysis of exponentially increasing social media conversations is challenging. There is a gap in the present literature in computationally analyzing how community members discuss the strengths and needs of the community. To address this gap, we introduce the task of identifying, extracting, and categorizing community needs and assets from conversational data using sophisticated natural language processing methods. To facilitate this task, we introduce the first dataset about community needs and assets consisting of 3,511 conversations from Reddit, annotated using crowdsourced workers. Using this dataset, we evaluate an utterance-level classification model compared to sentiment classification and a popular large language model (in a zero-shot setting), where we find that our model outperforms both baselines at an F1 score of 94% compared to 49% and 61% respectively. Furthermore, we observe through our study that conversations about needs have negative sentiments and emotions, while conversations about assets focus on location and entities. The dataset is available at https://github.com/towhidabsar/CommunityNeeds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihao Zhu, Leah Chong, Maria Yang, Jianxi Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: In human-centered design, developing a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of user experiences, i.e., empathic understanding, is paramount for designing products that truly meet human needs. Nevertheless, accurately comprehending the real underlying mental states of a large human population remains a significant challenge today. This difficulty mainly arises from the trade-off between depth and scale of user experience research: gaining in-depth insights from a small group of users does not easily scale to a larger population, and vice versa. This paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for performing mental inference tasks, specifically inferring users' underlying goals and fundamental psychological needs (FPNs). Baseline and benchmark datasets were collected from human users and designers to develop an empathic accuracy metric for measuring the mental inference performance of LLMs. The empathic accuracy of inferring goals and FPNs of different LLMs with varied zero-shot prompt engineering techniques are experimented against that of human designers. Experimental results suggest that LLMs can infer and understand the underlying goals and FPNs of users with performance comparable to that of human designers, suggesting a promising avenue for enhancing the scalability of empathic design approaches through the integration of advanced artificial intelligence technologies. This work has the potential to significantly augment the toolkit available to designers during human-centered design, enabling the development of both large-scale and in-depth understanding of users' experiences.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop Polaris, the first safety-focused LLM constellation for real-time patient-AI healthcare conversations. Unlike prior LLM works in healthcare focusing on tasks like question answering, our work specifically focuses on long multi-turn voice conversations. Our one-trillion parameter constellation system is composed of several multibillion parameter LLMs as co-operative agents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging conversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks performed by nurses to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. We develop a sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that optimize for diverse objectives. We train our models on proprietary data, clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and other medical reasoning documents. We align our models to speak like medical professionals, using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones between patient actors and experienced nurses. This allows our system to express unique capabilities such as rapport building, trust building, empathy and bedside manner. Finally, we present the first comprehensive clinician evaluation of an LLM system for healthcare. We recruited over 1100 U.S. licensed nurses and over 130 U.S. licensed physicians to perform end-to-end conversational evaluations of our system by posing as patients and rating the system on several measures. We demonstrate Polaris performs on par with human nurses on aggregate across dimensions such as medical safety, clinical readiness, conversational quality, and bedside manner. Additionally, we conduct a challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support agents, where we demonstrate our LLM agents significantly outperform a much larger general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) as well as from its own medium-size class (LLaMA-2 70B).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihan Zhou, Qixiang Fang, Leonardo Neves, Francesco Barbieri, Yozen Liu, Han Liu, Maarten W. Bos, Ron Dotsch</p>
<p>Abstract: User embeddings play a crucial role in user engagement forecasting and personalized services. Recent advances in sequence modeling have sparked interest in learning user embeddings from behavioral data. Yet behavior-based user embedding learning faces the unique challenge of dynamic user modeling. As users continuously interact with the apps, user embeddings should be periodically updated to account for users' recent and long-term behavior patterns. Existing methods highly rely on stateless sequence models that lack memory of historical behavior. They have to either discard historical data and use only the most recent data or reprocess the old and new data jointly. Both cases incur substantial computational overhead. To address this limitation, we introduce User Stateful Embedding (USE). USE generates user embeddings and reflects users' evolving behaviors without the need for exhaustive reprocessing by storing previous model states and revisiting them in the future. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training objective named future W-behavior prediction to transcend the limitations of next-token prediction by forecasting a broader horizon of upcoming user behaviors. By combining it with the Same User Prediction, a contrastive learning-based objective that predicts whether different segments of behavior sequences belong to the same user, we further improve the embeddings' distinctiveness and representativeness. We conducted experiments on 8 downstream tasks using Snapchat users' behavioral logs in both static (i.e., fixed user behavior sequences) and dynamic (i.e., periodically updated user behavior sequences) settings. We demonstrate USE's superior performance over established baselines. The results underscore USE's effectiveness and efficiency in integrating historical and recent user behavior sequences into user embeddings in dynamic user modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Askari, Anshuman Chhabra, Bernhard Clemm von Hohenberg, Michael Heseltine, Magdalena Wojcieszak</p>
<p>Abstract: Polarization, declining trust, and wavering support for democratic norms are pressing threats to U.S. democracy. Exposure to verified and quality news may lower individual susceptibility to these threats and make citizens more resilient to misinformation, populism, and hyperpartisan rhetoric. This project examines how to enhance users' exposure to and engagement with verified and ideologically balanced news in an ecologically valid setting. We rely on a large-scale two-week long field experiment (from 1/19/2023 to 2/3/2023) on 28,457 Twitter users. We created 28 bots utilizing GPT-2 that replied to users tweeting about sports, entertainment, or lifestyle with a contextual reply containing two hardcoded elements: a URL to the topic-relevant section of quality news organization and an encouragement to follow its Twitter account. To further test differential effects by gender of the bots, treated users were randomly assigned to receive responses by bots presented as female or male. We examine whether our over-time intervention enhances the following of news media organization, the sharing and the liking of news content and the tweeting about politics and the liking of political content. We find that the treated users followed more news accounts and the users in the female bot treatment were more likely to like news content than the control. Most of these results, however, were small in magnitude and confined to the already politically interested Twitter users, as indicated by their pre-treatment tweeting about politics. These findings have implications for social media and news organizations, and also offer direction for future work on how Large Language Models and other computational interventions can effectively enhance individual on-platform engagement with quality news and public affairs.</p>

<p>Abstract: To investigate the role of language in human collective behaviors, we developed the Agent Group Chat simulation to simulate linguistic interactions among multi-agent in different settings. Agents are asked to free chat in this simulation for their own purposes based on their character setting, aiming to see agents exhibit emergent behaviours that are both unforeseen and significant. Four narrative scenarios, Inheritance Disputes, Law Court Debates, Philosophical Discourses, Movie Casting Contention, are integrated into Agent Group Chat to evaluate its support for diverse storylines. By configuring specific environmental settings within Agent Group Chat, we are able to assess whether agents exhibit behaviors that align with human expectations. We evaluate the disorder within the environment by computing the n-gram Shannon entropy of all the content speak by characters. Our findings reveal that under the premise of agents possessing substantial alignment with human expectations, facilitating more extensive information exchange within the simulation ensures greater orderliness amidst diversity, which leads to the emergence of more unexpected and meaningful emergent behaviors.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements indicate that scaling up Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) effectively enhances performance on downstream multimodal tasks. The prevailing MLLM paradigm, \emph{e.g.}, LLaVA, transforms visual features into text-like tokens using a \emph{static} vision-language mapper, thereby enabling \emph{static} LLMs to develop the capability to comprehend visual information through visual instruction tuning. Although promising, the \emph{static} tuning strategy~\footnote{The static tuning refers to the trained model with static parameters.} that shares the same parameters may constrain performance across different downstream multimodal tasks. In light of this, we introduce HyperLLaVA, which involves adaptive tuning of the projector and LLM parameters, in conjunction with a dynamic visual expert and language expert, respectively. These experts are derived from HyperNetworks, which generates adaptive parameter shifts through visual and language guidance, enabling dynamic projector and LLM modeling in two-stage training.
  Our experiments demonstrate that our solution significantly surpasses LLaVA on existing MLLM benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench, and LLaVA-Bench. ~\footnote{Our project is available on the link https://github.com/DCDmllm/HyperLLaVA}.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a way of enhancing the reliability of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in addressing hallucination effects, where models generate incorrect or unrelated responses. Without additional instruction tuning paradigm, we introduce Counterfactual Inception, a novel method that implants counterfactual thoughts into LMMs using carefully chosen, misaligned counterfactual keywords. This method is grounded in the concept of counterfactual thinking, a cognitive process where humans consider alternative realities and outcomes. By applying this human-like reasoning mechanism to LMMs, we aim to reduce hallucination effects and improve the models' trustworthiness. We also propose Dual-modality Verification Process (DVP), a rigorous framework for selecting optimal counterfactual keywords to trigger counterfactual thinking into LMMs, concurrently considering visual and linguistic context. Our extensive experiments across various LMMs, including both open-source and proprietary models, corroborate that our method significantly mitigates hallucination phenomena across different datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunhang Li, Yansong Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of text2motion is to generate motion sequences from given textual descriptions, where a model should explore the interactions between natural language instructions and human body movements. While most existing works are confined to coarse-grained motion descriptions (e.g., "A man squats."), fine-grained ones specifying movements of relevant body parts are barely explored. Models trained with coarse texts may not be able to learn mappings from fine-grained motion-related words to motion primitives, resulting in the failure in generating motions from unseen descriptions. In this paper, we build a large-scale language-motion dataset with fine-grained textual descriptions, FineHumanML3D, by feeding GPT-3.5-turbo with delicate prompts. Accordingly, we design a new text2motion model, FineMotionDiffuse, which makes full use of fine-grained textual information. Our experiments show that FineMotionDiffuse trained on FineHumanML3D acquires good results in quantitative evaluation. We also find this model can better generate spatially/chronologically composite motions by learning the implicit mappings from simple descriptions to the corresponding basic motions.</p>

CONLINE also serializes the complex inputs and outputs to improve comprehension and generate test case to ensure the framework's adaptability for real-world applications. CONLINE is validated through rigorous experiments on the DS-1000 and ClassEval datasets. It shows that CONLINE substantially improves the quality of complex code generation, highlighting its potential to enhance the practicality and reliability of LLMs in generating intricate code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengzhe Feng, Yanan Sun, Ke Li, Pan Zhou, Jiancheng Lv, Aojun Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: As Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), a popular approach for code intelligence, continue to grow in size, the computational cost of their usage has become prohibitively expensive. Prompt learning, a recent development in the field of natural language processing, emerges as a potential solution to address this challenge. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of prompt learning in code intelligence tasks. We unveil its reliance on manually designed prompts, which often require significant human effort and expertise. Moreover, we discover existing automatic prompt design methods are very limited to code intelligence tasks due to factors including gradient dependence, high computational demands, and limited applicability. To effectively address both issues, we propose Genetic Auto Prompt (GenAP), which utilizes an elaborate genetic algorithm to automatically design prompts. With GenAP, non-experts can effortlessly generate superior prompts compared to meticulously manual-designed ones. GenAP operates without the need for gradients or additional computational costs, rendering it gradient-free and cost-effective. Moreover, GenAP supports both understanding and generation types of code intelligence tasks, exhibiting great applicability. We conduct GenAP on three popular code intelligence PLMs with three canonical code intelligence tasks including defect prediction, code summarization, and code translation. The results suggest that GenAP can effectively automate the process of designing prompts. Specifically, GenAP outperforms all other methods across all three tasks (e.g., improving accuracy by an average of 2.13% for defect prediction). To the best of our knowledge, GenAP is the first work to automatically design prompts for code intelligence PLMs.</p>

Recently, LLMs have been applied in robotics action planning, particularly using a code generation approach that converts complex high-level instructions into mid-level policy codes. In contrast, our approach acquires text descriptions of the task and scene objects, then formulates action planning through natural language reasoning, and outputs coordinate level control commands, thus reducing the necessity for intermediate representation code as policies. Our approach is evaluated on a multi-modal prompt simulation benchmark, demonstrating that our prompt engineering experiments with natural language reasoning significantly enhance success rates compared to its absence. Furthermore, our approach illustrates the potential for natural language descriptions to transfer robotics skills from known tasks to previously unseen tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The diffusion model has long been plagued by scalability and quadratic complexity issues, especially within transformer-based structures. In this study, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of a State-Space Model called Mamba to extend its applicability to visual data generation. Firstly, we identify a critical oversight in most current Mamba-based vision methods, namely the lack of consideration for spatial continuity in the scan scheme of Mamba. Secondly, building upon this insight, we introduce a simple, plug-and-play, zero-parameter method named Zigzag Mamba, which outperforms Mamba-based baselines and demonstrates improved speed and memory utilization compared to transformer-based baselines. Lastly, we integrate Zigzag Mamba with the Stochastic Interpolant framework to investigate the scalability of the model on large-resolution visual datasets, such as FacesHQ $1024\times 1024$ and UCF101, MultiModal-CelebA-HQ, and MS COCO $256\times 256$.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruozhen He, Paola Cascante-Bonilla, Ziyan Yang, Alexander C. Berg, Vicente Ordonez</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce SynGround, a novel framework that combines data-driven learning and knowledge transfer from various large-scale pretrained models to enhance the visual grounding capabilities of a pretrained vision-and-language model. The knowledge transfer from the models initiates the generation of image descriptions through an image description generator. These descriptions serve dual purposes: they act as prompts for synthesizing images through a text-to-image generator, and as queries for synthesizing text, from which phrases are extracted using a large language model. Finally, we leverage an open-vocabulary object detector to generate synthetic bounding boxes for the synthetic images and texts. We finetune a pretrained vision-and-language model on this dataset by optimizing a mask-attention consistency objective that aligns region annotations with gradient-based model explanations. The resulting model improves the grounding capabilities of an off-the-shelf vision-and-language model. Particularly, SynGround improves the pointing game accuracy of ALBEF on the Flickr30k dataset from 79.38% to 87.26%, and on RefCOCO+ Test A from 69.35% to 79.06% and on RefCOCO+ Test B from 53.77% to 63.67%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mihir Parmar, Swaroop Mishra, Mor Geva, Chitta Baral</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, progress in NLU has been driven by benchmarks. These benchmarks are typically collected by crowdsourcing, where annotators write examples based on annotation instructions crafted by dataset creators. In this work, we hypothesize that annotators pick up on patterns in the crowdsourcing instructions, which bias them to write many similar examples that are then over-represented in the collected data. We study this form of bias, termed instruction bias, in 14 recent NLU benchmarks, showing that instruction examples often exhibit concrete patterns, which are propagated by crowdworkers to the collected data. This extends previous work (Geva et al., 2019) and raises a new concern of whether we are modeling the dataset creator's instructions, rather than the task. Through a series of experiments, we show that, indeed, instruction bias can lead to overestimation of model performance, and that models struggle to generalize beyond biases originating in the crowdsourcing instructions. We further analyze the influence of instruction bias in terms of pattern frequency and model size, and derive concrete recommendations for creating future NLU benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongsheng Zhu, Zhenyu Mao, Jinghui Lu, Rui Zhao, Fei Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has recently achieved compelling performance in unsupervised sentence representation. As an essential element, data augmentation protocols, however, have not been well explored. The pioneering work SimCSE resorting to a simple dropout mechanism (viewed as continuous augmentation) surprisingly dominates discrete augmentations such as cropping, word deletion, and synonym replacement as reported. To understand the underlying rationales, we revisit existing approaches and attempt to hypothesize the desiderata of reasonable data augmentation methods: balance of semantic consistency and expression diversity. We then develop three simple yet effective discrete sentence augmentation schemes: punctuation insertion, modal verbs, and double negation. They act as minimal noises at lexical level to produce diverse forms of sentences. Furthermore, standard negation is capitalized on to generate negative samples for alleviating feature suppression involved in contrastive learning. We experimented extensively with semantic textual similarity on diverse datasets. The results support the superiority of the proposed methods consistently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingjian Liu, Jiang Li, Xiaoping Wang, Zhigang Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) has attracted growing attention in recent years as a result of the advancement and implementation of human-computer interface technologies. In this paper, we propose an emotional inertia and contagion-driven dependency modeling approach (EmotionIC) for ERC task. Our EmotionIC consists of three main components, i.e., Identity Masked Multi-Head Attention (IMMHA), Dialogue-based Gated Recurrent Unit (DiaGRU), and Skip-chain Conditional Random Field (SkipCRF). Compared to previous ERC models, EmotionIC can model a conversation more thoroughly at both the feature-extraction and classification levels. The proposed model attempts to integrate the advantages of attention- and recurrence-based methods at the feature-extraction level. Specifically, IMMHA is applied to capture identity-based global contextual dependencies, while DiaGRU is utilized to extract speaker- and temporal-aware local contextual information. At the classification level, SkipCRF can explicitly mine complex emotional flows from higher-order neighboring utterances in the conversation. Experimental results show that our method can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art models on four benchmark datasets. The ablation studies confirm that our modules can effectively model emotional inertia and contagion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiqiang Wu, Cheng Hou, Shanshan Lao, Jiayi Li, Ngai Wong, Zhe Zhao, Yujiu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a predominant approach for BERT compression. Previous KD-based methods focus on designing extra alignment losses for the student model to mimic the behavior of the teacher model. These methods transfer the knowledge in an indirect way. In this paper, we propose a novel Weight-Inherited Distillation (WID), which directly transfers knowledge from the teacher. WID does not require any additional alignment loss and trains a compact student by inheriting the weights, showing a new perspective of knowledge distillation. Specifically, we design the row compactors and column compactors as mappings and then compress the weights via structural re-parameterization. Experimental results on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks show that WID outperforms previous state-of-the-art KD-based baselines. Further analysis indicates that WID can also learn the attention patterns from the teacher model without any alignment loss on attention distributions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuekai Zhu, Biqing Qi, Kaiyan Zhang, Xinwei Long, Zhouhan Lin, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing tasks, their huge size and the inaccessibility of parameters present challenges for practical deployment. Previous studies try to distill task-specific ability from LLMs to smaller models, using data synthesis and chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning. However, synthetic CoT data often contains faulty reasoning, which deteriorates the quality of distillation, especially in reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose Program-aided Distillation (PaD), which introduces reasoning programs to suppress the errors in distilled data, and thus achieves better distillation quality for reasoning tasks. In PaD, we utilize the reasoning program to substitute the CoT, allowing automated error checking of synthetic data. Further, through error injecting and further training, the small distilling model could iteratively self-refine the reasoning. Moreover, we conduct a step-wise beam search by step-by-step verifying to acquire more exact reasoning chains. We evaluate PaD on arithmetic reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and general ability. Experimental results demonstrate that smaller models using PaD can not only outperform certain LLMs~(e.g., LLaMA-1 13B) but also achieve strong improvement over baselines with a significantly smaller scale of parameters and data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tarek Naous, Michael J. Ryan, Alan Ritter, Wei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: As the reach of large language models (LMs) expands globally, their ability to cater to diverse cultural contexts becomes crucial. Despite advancements in multilingual capabilities, models are not designed with appropriate cultural nuances. In this paper, we show that multilingual and Arabic monolingual LMs exhibit bias towards entities associated with Western culture. We introduce CAMeL, a novel resource of 628 naturally-occurring prompts and 20,368 entities spanning eight types that contrast Arab and Western cultures. CAMeL provides a foundation for measuring cultural biases in LMs through both extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations. Using CAMeL, we examine the cross-cultural performance in Arabic of 16 different LMs on tasks such as story generation, NER, and sentiment analysis, where we find concerning cases of stereotyping and cultural unfairness. We further test their text-infilling performance, revealing the incapability of appropriate adaptation to Arab cultural contexts. Finally, we analyze 6 Arabic pre-training corpora and find that commonly used sources such as Wikipedia may not be best suited to build culturally aware LMs, if used as they are without adjustment. We will make CAMeL publicly available at: https://github.com/tareknaous/camel</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Agrawal, Mirac Suzgun, Lester Mackey, Adam Tauman Kalai</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art language models (LMs) are notoriously susceptible to generating hallucinated information. Such inaccurate outputs not only undermine the reliability of these models but also limit their use and raise serious concerns about misinformation and propaganda. In this work, we focus on hallucinated book and article references and present them as the "model organism" of language model hallucination research, due to their frequent and easy-to-discern nature. We posit that if a language model cites a particular reference in its output, then it should ideally possess sufficient information about its authors and content, among other relevant details. Using this basic insight, we illustrate that one can identify hallucinated references without ever consulting any external resources, by asking a set of direct or indirect queries to the language model about the references. These queries can be considered as "consistency checks." Our findings highlight that while LMs, including GPT-4, often produce inconsistent author lists for hallucinated references, they also often accurately recall the authors of real references. In this sense, the LM can be said to "know" when it is hallucinating references. Furthermore, these findings show how hallucinated references can be dissected to shed light on their nature.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqian Cui, Xiangling Fu, Shaohui Liu, Mingjun Gu, Xien Liu, Ji Wu, Irwin King</p>
<p>Abstract: Disease name normalization is an important task in the medical domain. It classifies disease names written in various formats into standardized names, serving as a fundamental component in smart healthcare systems for various disease-related functions. Nevertheless, the most significant obstacle to existing disease name normalization systems is the severe shortage of training data. While data augmentation is a powerful approach for addressing data scarcity, our findings reveal that conventional data augmentation techniques often impede task performance, primarily due to the multi-axis and multi-granularity nature of disease names. Consequently, we introduce a set of customized data augmentation techniques designed to leverage the semantic information inherent in disease names. These techniques aim to enhance the model's understanding of the semantic intricacies and classification structure of disease names. Through extensive experimentation, we illustrate that our proposed plug-and-play methods not only surpass general data augmentation techniques but also exhibit significant performance improvements across various baseline models and training objectives, particularly in scenarios with limited training data. This underscores its potential for widespread application in medical language processing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinghui Li, Yong Jiang, Yangning Li, Xingyu Lu, Pengjun Xie, Ying Shen, Hai-Tao Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) is a fundamental task for Information Extraction and Knowledge Graphs. The general form of EL (i.e., end-to-end EL) aims to first find mentions in the given input document and then link the mentions to corresponding entities in a specific knowledge base. Recently, the paradigm of retriever-reader promotes the progress of end-to-end EL, benefiting from the advantages of dense entity retrieval and machine reading comprehension. However, the existing study only trains the retriever and the reader separately in a pipeline manner, which ignores the benefit that the interaction between the retriever and the reader can bring to the task. To advance the retriever-reader paradigm to perform more perfectly on end-to-end EL, we propose BEER$^2$, a Bidirectional End-to-End training framework for Retriever and Reader. Through our designed bidirectional end-to-end training, BEER$^2$ guides the retriever and the reader to learn from each other, make progress together, and ultimately improve EL performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks of multiple domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed BEER$^2$.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12725">Generative Multimodal Entity Linking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Senbao Shi, Zhenran Xu, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) is the task of mapping mentions with multimodal contexts to the referent entities from a knowledge base. Existing MEL methods mainly focus on designing complex multimodal interaction mechanisms and require fine-tuning all model parameters, which can be prohibitively costly and difficult to scale in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we propose GEMEL, a Generative Multimodal Entity Linking framework based on LLMs, which directly generates target entity names. We keep the vision and language model frozen and only train a feature mapper to enable cross-modality interactions. To adapt LLMs to the MEL task, we leverage the in-context learning capability of LLMs by retrieving multimodal instances as demonstrations. Extensive experiments show that, with only ~0.3% of the model parameters fine-tuned, GEMEL achieves state-of-the-art results on two well-established MEL datasets (7.7% accuracy gains on WikiDiverse and 8.8% accuracy gains on WikiMEL). The performance gain stems from mitigating the popularity bias of LLM predictions and disambiguating less common entities effectively. Further analysis verifies the generality and scalability of GEMEL. Our framework is compatible with any off-the-shelf language model, paving the way towards an efficient and general solution for utilizing LLMs in the MEL task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinghui Li, Shirong Ma, Shaoshen Chen, Haojing Huang, Shulin Huang, Yangning Li, Hai-Tao Zheng, Ying Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Chinese Text Error Correction (CTEC) aims to detect and correct errors in the input text, which benefits human daily life and various downstream tasks. Recent approaches mainly employ Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to resolve CTEC. Although PLMs have achieved remarkable success in CTEC, we argue that previous studies still overlook the importance of human thinking patterns. To enhance the development of PLMs for CTEC, inspired by humans' daily error-correcting behavior, we propose a novel model-agnostic progressive learning framework, named ProTEC, which guides PLMs-based CTEC models to learn to correct like humans. During the training process, ProTEC guides the model to learn text error correction by incorporating these sub-tasks into a progressive paradigm. During the inference process, the model completes these sub-tasks in turn to generate the correction results. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed model-agnostic ProTEC framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detectives frequently engage in information detection and reasoning simultaneously when making decisions across various cases, especially when confronted with a vast amount of information. With the rapid development of large language models~(LLMs), evaluating how these models identify key information and reason to solve questions becomes increasingly relevant. We introduces the DetectBench, a reading comprehension dataset designed to assess a model's ability to jointly ability in key information detection and multi-hop reasoning when facing complex and implicit information. The DetectBench comprises 3,928 questions, each paired with a paragraph averaging 190 tokens in length. To enhance model's detective skills, we propose the Detective Thinking Framework. These methods encourage models to identify all possible clues within the context before reasoning. Our experiments reveal that existing models perform poorly in both information detection and multi-hop reasoning. However, the Detective Thinking Framework approach alleviates this issue.</p>

<p>Abstract: We show the viability of tackling misuses of large language models beyond the identification of machine-generated text. While existing zero-bit watermark methods focus on detection only, some malicious misuses demand tracing the adversary user for counteracting them. To address this, we propose Multi-bit Watermark via Position Allocation, embedding traceable multi-bit information during language model generation. Through allocating tokens onto different parts of the messages, we embed longer messages in high corruption settings without added latency. By independently embedding sub-units of messages, the proposed method outperforms the existing works in terms of robustness and latency. Leveraging the benefits of zero-bit watermarking, our method enables robust extraction of the watermark without any model access, embedding and extraction of long messages ($\geq$ 32-bit) without finetuning, and maintaining text quality, while allowing zero-bit detection all at the same time.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanzhen Luo, Qingyu Zhou, Feng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Keyphrase extraction (KPE) is an important task in Natural Language Processing for many scenarios, which aims to extract keyphrases that are present in a given document. Many existing supervised methods treat KPE as sequential labeling, span-level classification, or generative tasks. However, these methods lack the ability to utilize keyphrase information, which may result in biased results. In this study, we propose Diff-KPE, which leverages the supervised Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to guide the text diffusion process for generating enhanced keyphrase representations. Diff-KPE first generates the desired keyphrase embeddings conditioned on the entire document and then injects the generated keyphrase embeddings into each phrase representation. A ranking network and VIB are then optimized together with rank loss and classification loss, respectively. This design of Diff-KPE allows us to rank each candidate phrase by utilizing both the information of keyphrases and the document. Experiments show that Diff-KPE outperforms existing KPE methods on a large open domain keyphrase extraction benchmark, OpenKP, and a scientific domain dataset, KP20K.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora demonstrate impressive capabilities in a wide range of tasks. While there are ongoing efforts to adapt these models to languages beyond English, the attention given to their evaluation methodologies remains limited. Current multilingual benchmarks often rely on back translations or re-implementations of English tests, limiting their capacity to capture unique cultural and linguistic nuances. To bridge this gap for the Korean language, we introduce the HAE-RAE Bench, a dataset curated to challenge models lacking Korean cultural and contextual depth. The dataset encompasses six downstream tasks across four domains: vocabulary, history, general knowledge, and reading comprehension. Unlike traditional evaluation suites focused on token and sequence classification or mathematical and logical reasoning, the HAE-RAE Bench emphasizes a model's aptitude for recalling Korean-specific knowledge and cultural contexts. Comparative analysis with prior Korean benchmarks indicates that the HAE-RAE Bench presents a greater challenge to non-Korean models by disturbing abilities and knowledge learned from English being transferred.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyi Chen, Karan Sikka, Michael Cogswell, Heng Ji, Ajay Divakaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently demonstrated strong efficacy as visual assistants that can parse natural queries about the visual content and generate human-like outputs. In this work, we explore the ability of these models to demonstrate human-like reasoning based on the perceived information. To address a crucial concern regarding the extent to which their reasoning capabilities are fully consistent and grounded, we also measure the reasoning consistency of these models. We achieve this by proposing a chain-of-thought (CoT) based consistency measure. However, such an evaluation requires a benchmark that encompasses both high-level inference and detailed reasoning chains, which is costly. We tackle this challenge by proposing a LLM-Human-in-the-Loop pipeline, which notably reduces cost while simultaneously ensuring the generation of a high-quality dataset. Based on this pipeline and the existing coarse-grained annotated dataset, we build the CURE benchmark to measure both the zero-shot reasoning performance and consistency of VLMs. We evaluate existing state-of-the-art VLMs, and find that even the best-performing model is unable to demonstrate strong visual reasoning capabilities and consistency, indicating that substantial efforts are required to enable VLMs to perform visual reasoning as systematically and consistently as humans. As an early step, we propose a two-stage training framework aimed at improving both the reasoning performance and consistency of VLMs. The first stage involves employing supervised fine-tuning of VLMs using step-by-step reasoning samples automatically generated by LLMs. In the second stage, we further augment the training process by incorporating feedback provided by LLMs to produce reasoning chains that are highly consistent and grounded. We empirically highlight the effectiveness of our framework in both reasoning performance and consistency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Since the resurgence of deep learning, vision-language models (VLMs) enhanced by large language models (LLMs) have grown exponentially in popularity. However, while LLMs can utilize extensive background knowledge and task information with in-context learning, most VLMs still struggle with understanding complex multi-modal prompts with multiple images, making VLMs less effective in downstream vision-language tasks. In this paper, we address the limitation above by 1) introducing vision-language Model with Multi-Modal In-Context Learning(MMICL), a new approach to allow the VLM to deal with multi-modal inputs efficiently; 2) proposing a novel context scheme to augment the in-context learning ability of the VLM; 3) constructing the Multi-modal In-Context Learning (MIC) dataset, designed to enhance the VLM's ability to understand complex multi-modal prompts. Our experiments confirm that MMICL achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on a wide range of general vision-language tasks, especially for complex benchmarks, including MME and MMBench. Our analysis demonstrates that MMICL effectively tackles the challenge of complex multi-modal prompt understanding and emerges the impressive ICL ability. Furthermore, we observe that MMICL successfully alleviates language bias in VLMs, a common issue for VLMs that often leads to hallucination when faced with extensive textual context.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Fang, Xiaofei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper works on non-autoregressive automatic speech recognition. A unimodal aggregation (UMA) is proposed to segment and integrate the feature frames that belong to the same text token, and thus to learn better feature representations for text tokens. The frame-wise features and weights are both derived from an encoder. Then, the feature frames with unimodal weights are integrated and further processed by a decoder. Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss is applied for training. Compared to the regular CTC, the proposed method learns better feature representations and shortens the sequence length, resulting in lower recognition error and computational complexity. Experiments on three Mandarin datasets show that UMA demonstrates superior or comparable performance to other advanced non-autoregressive methods, such as self-conditioned CTC. Moreover, by integrating self-conditioned CTC into the proposed framework, the performance can be further noticeably improved.</p>

The paper additionally introduces the first domain-specific multilingual transformer language model for political science applications, which was additionally pre-trained on 1.72 billion words from parliamentary proceedings of 27 European parliaments. We present experiments demonstrating how the additional pre-training on parliamentary data can significantly improve the model downstream performance, in our case, sentiment identification in parliamentary proceedings. We further show that our multilingual model performs very well on languages not seen during fine-tuning, and that additional fine-tuning data from other languages significantly improves the target parliament's results. The paper makes an important contribution to multiple disciplines inside the social sciences, and bridges them with computer science and computational linguistics. Lastly, the resulting fine-tuned language model sets up a more robust approach to sentiment analysis of political texts across languages, which allows scholars to study political sentiment from a comparative perspective using standardized tools and techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jieun Han, Haneul Yoo, Junho Myung, Minsun Kim, Tak Yeon Lee, So-Yeon Ahn, Alice Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of generative AI in education is expanding, yet empirical analyses of large-scale, real-world interactions between students and AI systems still remain limited. In this study, we present ChEDDAR, ChatGPT & EFL Learner's Dialogue Dataset As Revising an essay, which is collected from a semester-long longitudinal experiment involving 212 college students enrolled in English as Foreign Langauge (EFL) writing courses. The students were asked to revise their essays through dialogues with ChatGPT. ChEDDAR includes a conversation log, utterance-level essay edit history, self-rated satisfaction, and students' intent, in addition to session-level pre-and-post surveys documenting their objectives and overall experiences. We analyze students' usage patterns and perceptions regarding generative AI with respect to their intent and satisfaction. As a foundational step, we establish baseline results for two pivotal tasks in task-oriented dialogue systems within educational contexts: intent detection and satisfaction estimation. We finally suggest further research to refine the integration of generative AI into education settings, outlining potential scenarios utilizing ChEDDAR.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00785">BooookScore: A systematic exploration of book-length summarization in the era of LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yapei Chang, Kyle Lo, Tanya Goyal, Mohit Iyyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Summarizing book-length documents (>100K tokens) that exceed the context window size of large language models (LLMs) requires first breaking the input document into smaller chunks and then prompting an LLM to merge, update, and compress chunk-level summaries. Despite the complexity and importance of this task, it has yet to be meaningfully studied due to the challenges of evaluation: existing book-length summarization datasets (e.g., BookSum) are in the pretraining data of most public LLMs, and existing evaluation methods struggle to capture errors made by modern LLM summarizers. In this paper, we present the first study of the coherence of LLM-based book-length summarizers implemented via two prompting workflows: (1) hierarchically merging chunk-level summaries, and (2) incrementally updating a running summary. We obtain 1193 fine-grained human annotations on GPT-4 generated summaries of 100 recently-published books and identify eight common types of coherence errors made by LLMs. Because human evaluation is expensive and time-consuming, we develop an automatic metric, BooookScore, that measures the proportion of sentences in a summary that do not contain any of the identified error types. BooookScore has high agreement with human annotations and allows us to systematically evaluate the impact of many other critical parameters (e.g., chunk size, base LLM) while saving $15K USD and 500 hours in human evaluation costs. We find that closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude 2 produce summaries with higher BooookScore than those generated by open-source models. While LLaMA 2 falls behind other models, Mixtral achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-Turbo. Incremental updating yields lower BooookScore but higher level of detail than hierarchical merging, a trade-off sometimes preferred by annotators.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now available from cloud API providers in various sizes and configurations. While this diversity offers a broad spectrum of choices, effectively leveraging the options to optimize computational cost and performance remains challenging. In this work, we present AutoMix, an approach that strategically routes queries to larger LMs, based on the approximate correctness of outputs from a smaller LM. Central to AutoMix is a few-shot self-verification mechanism, which estimates the reliability of its own outputs without requiring training. Given that verifications can be noisy, we employ a meta-verifier in AutoMix to refine the accuracy of these assessments. Our experiments using LLAMA2-13B and GPT-4, on five context-grounded reasoning datasets demonstrate that AutoMix surpasses established baselines, improving the incremental benefit per cost by up to 86%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaonan Li, Changtai Zhu, Linyang Li, Zhangyue Yin, Tianxiang Sun, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Verifiable generation aims to let the large language model (LLM) generate text with supporting documents, which enables the user to flexibly verify the answer and makes the LLM's output more reliable. Retrieval plays a crucial role in verifiable generation. Specifically, the retrieved documents not only supplement knowledge to help the LLM generate correct answers, but also serve as supporting evidence for the user to verify the LLM's output. However, the widely used retrievers become the bottleneck of the entire pipeline and limit the overall performance. Their capabilities are usually inferior to LLMs since they often have much fewer parameters than the large language model and have not been demonstrated to scale well to the size of LLMs. If the retriever does not correctly find the supporting documents, the LLM can not generate the correct and verifiable answer, which overshadows the LLM's remarkable abilities. To address these limitations, we propose \LLatrieval (Large Language Model Verified Retrieval), where the LLM updates the retrieval result until it verifies that the retrieved documents can sufficiently support answering the question. Thus, the LLM can iteratively provide feedback to retrieval and facilitate the retrieval result to fully support verifiable generation. Experiments show that LLatrieval significantly outperforms extensive baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Tauman Kalai, Santosh S. Vempala</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent language models generate false but plausible-sounding text with surprising frequency. Such "hallucinations" are an obstacle to the usability of language-based AI systems and can harm people who rely upon their outputs. This work shows that there is an inherent statistical lower-bound on the rate that pretrained language models hallucinate certain types of facts, having nothing to do with the transformer LM architecture or data quality. For "arbitrary" facts whose veracity cannot be determined from the training data, we show that hallucinations must occur at a certain rate for language models that satisfy a statistical calibration condition appropriate for generative language models. Specifically, if the maximum probability of any fact is bounded, we show that the probability of generating a hallucination is close to the fraction of facts that occur exactly once in the training data (a "Good-Turing" estimate), even assuming ideal training data without errors.
  One conclusion is that models pretrained to be sufficiently good predictors (i.e., calibrated) may require post-training to mitigate hallucinations on the type of arbitrary facts that tend to appear once in the training set. However, our analysis also suggests that there is no statistical reason that pretraining will lead to hallucination on facts that tend to appear more than once in the training data (like references to publications such as articles and books, whose hallucinations have been particularly notable and problematic) or on systematic facts (like arithmetic calculations). Therefore, different architectures and learning algorithms may mitigate these latter types of hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huachuan Qiu, Anqi Li, Lizhi Ma, Zhenzhong Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Dialogue systems are increasingly integrated into mental health support to help clients facilitate exploration, gain insight, take action, and ultimately heal themselves. A practical and user-friendly dialogue system should be client-centric, focusing on the client's behaviors. However, existing dialogue systems publicly available for mental health support often concentrate solely on the counselor's strategies rather than the behaviors expressed by clients. This can lead to unreasonable or inappropriate counseling strategies and corresponding responses generated by the dialogue system. To address this issue, we propose PsyChat, a client-centric dialogue system that provides psychological support through online chat. The client-centric dialogue system comprises five modules: client behavior recognition, counselor strategy selection, input packer, response generator, and response selection. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed dialogue system for real-life mental health support. Furthermore, the case study demonstrates that the dialogue system can predict the client's behaviors, select appropriate counselor strategies, and generate accurate and suitable responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Yu, Lei Zang, Jiaotuan Wang, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Chinese classical poetry generation has attracted much research interest, but achieving effective control over format and content simultaneously remains challenging. Traditional systems usually accept keywords as user inputs, resulting in limited control over content. Large language models (LLMs) improve content control by allowing unrestricted user instructions, but the token-by-token generation process frequently makes format errors. Motivated by this, we propose CharPoet, a Chinese classical poetry generation system based on token-free LLM, which provides effective control over both format and content. Our token-free architecture generates in a character-by-character manner, enabling precise control over the number of characters. Pruned from existing token-based LLMs, CharPoet inherits their pretrained capabilities and can generate poetry following instructions like "Write me a poem for my mother's birthday." CharPoet achieves format accuracy above 0.96, outperforming Jiuge-GPT-2 (0.91) and GPT-4 (0.38). In terms of content quality, CharPoet surpasses traditional systems including Jiuge, and is comparable to other LLMs. Our system is open source and available at https://modelscope.cn/models/CharPoet/CharPoet. A video demonstration of CharPoet is available at https://youtu.be/voZ25qEp3Dc.</p>

<p>Abstract: In our research, we pioneer a novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and LLaMa2, diverging from traditional robustness-focused binary evaluations. Our study introduces two distinct evaluation frameworks: a coarse-grained evaluation and a fine-grained evaluation. Each framework, using a scoring range from 0 to 1, offers a unique perspective, enabling a more comprehensive and nuanced evaluation of attack effectiveness and empowering attackers to refine their attack prompts with greater understanding. Furthermore, we have developed a comprehensive ground truth dataset specifically tailored for jailbreak tasks. This dataset not only serves as a crucial benchmark for our current study but also establishes a foundational resource for future research, enabling consistent and comparative analyses in this evolving field. Upon meticulous comparison with traditional evaluation methods, we discovered that our evaluation aligns with the baseline's trend while offering a more profound and detailed assessment. We believe that by accurately evaluating the effectiveness of attack prompts in the Jailbreak task, our work lays a solid foundation for assessing a wider array of similar or even more complex tasks in the realm of prompt injection, potentially revolutionizing this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng-Han Chiang, Hung-yi Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can solve problems step-by-step. While this chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning boosts LLMs' performance, it is unclear if LLMs \textit{know} when to use CoT and whether those CoT are always necessary to answer the question. This paper shows that LLMs tend to generate redundant calculations and reasoning on a manually constructed math QA dataset, GSM8K-Zero. GSM8K-Zero is constructed such that the questions can be answered without any calculations, but LLMs, including Llama-2 models and Claude-2, tend to generate lengthy and unnecessary calculations to answer the questions. We also conduct experiments to explain why LLMs generate redundant calculations and reasonings. GSM8K-Zero is publicly available at https://github.com/d223302/Over-Reasoning-of-LLMs and https://huggingface.co/datasets/dcml0714/GSM8K-Zero.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangmeng Li, Fei Song, Yifan Jin, Wenwen Qiang, Changwen Zheng, Fuchun Sun, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: As a novel and effective fine-tuning paradigm based on large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), prompt-tuning aims to reduce the gap between downstream tasks and pre-training objectives. While prompt-tuning has yielded continuous advancements in various tasks, such an approach still remains a persistent defect: prompt-tuning methods fail to generalize to specific few-shot patterns. From the perspective of distribution analyses, we disclose that the intrinsic issues behind the phenomenon are the over-multitudinous conceptual knowledge contained in PLMs and the abridged knowledge for target downstream domains, which jointly result in that PLMs mis-locate the knowledge distributions corresponding to the target domains in the universal knowledge embedding space. To this end, we intuitively explore to approximate the unabridged target domains of downstream tasks in a debiased manner, and then abstract such domains to generate discriminative prompts, thereby providing the de-ambiguous guidance for PLMs. Guided by such an intuition, we propose a simple yet effective approach, namely BayesPrompt, to learn prompts that contain the domain discriminative information against the interference from domain-irrelevant knowledge. BayesPrompt primitively leverages known distributions to approximate the debiased factual distributions of target domains and further uniformly samples certain representative features from the approximated distributions to generate the ultimate prompts for PLMs. We provide theoretical insights with the connection to domain adaptation. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyan Guo, Rui Wang, Junliang Guo, Xu Tan, Jiang Bian, Yujiu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across diverse tasks, recent studies showcase that causal LLMs suffer from the "reversal curse". It is a typical example that the model knows "A's father is B", but is unable to reason "B's child is A". This limitation poses a challenge to the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it suggests a gap in the models' ability to comprehend and apply bidirectional reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct substantial evaluation and identify that the root cause of the reversal curse lies in the different word order between the training and inference stage, namely, the poor ability of causal language models to predict antecedent words within the training data. Accordingly, permutation on the training data is considered as a potential solution, since this can make the model predict antecedent words or tokens. However, previous permutation methods may disrupt complete phrases or entities, thereby posing challenges for the model to comprehend and learn from training data. To address this issue, we propose Semantic-aware Permutation Training (SPT), which addresses this issue by segmenting the training sentences into semantic units (i.e., entities or phrases) with an assistant language model and permuting these units before feeding into the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPT effectively mitigates the reversal curse since the performance on reversed questions approximates that on the forward ones, and significantly advances the performance of existing works.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the many advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their unprecedented rapid evolution, their impact and integration into every facet of our daily lives is limited due to various reasons. One critical factor hindering their widespread adoption is the occurrence of hallucinations, where LLMs invent answers that sound realistic, yet drift away from factual truth. In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting hallucinations in large language models, which tackles a critical issue in the adoption of these models in various real-world scenarios. Through extensive evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs, including Llama-2, we study the hallucination levels of various recent LLMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to automatically detect them. Notably, we observe up to 62% hallucinations for Llama-2 in a specific experiment, where our method achieves a Balanced Accuracy (B-ACC) of 87%, all without relying on external knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pretrained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable few-shot learning capabilities when provided with properly formatted examples. However, selecting the "best" examples remains an open challenge. We propose a complexity-based prompt selection approach for sequence tagging tasks. This approach avoids the training of a dedicated model for selection of examples, and instead uses certain metrics to align the syntactico-semantic complexity of test sentences and examples. We use both sentence- and word-level metrics to match the complexity of examples to the (test) sentence being considered. Our results demonstrate that our approach extracts greater performance from PLMs: it achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot NER, achieving a 5% absolute improvement in F1 score on the CoNLL2003 dataset for GPT-4. We also see large gains of upto 28.85 points (F1/Acc.) in smaller models like GPT-j-6B.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of Multi-modal Pre-training highlights the necessity for a robust Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph (MMKG) representation learning framework. This framework is crucial for integrating structured knowledge into multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale, aiming to alleviate issues like knowledge misconceptions and multi-modal hallucinations. In this work, to evaluate models' ability to accurately embed entities within MMKGs, we focus on two widely researched tasks: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) and Multi-modal Entity Alignment (MMEA). Building on this foundation, we propose a novel SNAG method that utilizes a Transformer-based architecture equipped with modality-level noise masking for the robust integration of multi-modal entity features in KGs. By incorporating specific training objectives for both MKGC and MMEA, our approach achieves SOTA performance across a total of ten datasets (three for MKGC and seven for MEMA), demonstrating its robustness and versatility. Besides, SNAG can not only function as a standalone model but also enhance other existing methods, providing stable performance improvements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanyue Zhang, Pengfei Li, Yilong Lai, Deyu Zhou, Yulan He</p>
<p>Abstract: As more than 70$\%$ of reviews in the existing opinion summary data set are positive, current opinion summarization approaches are reluctant to generate negative summaries given the input of negative texts. To address such sentiment bias, a direct approach without the over-reliance on a specific framework is to generate additional data based on large language models to balance the emotional distribution of the dataset. However, data augmentation based on large language models faces two disadvantages: 1) the potential issues or toxicity in the augmented data; 2) the expensive costs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation framework based on both large and small language models for debiasing opinion summarization. In specific, a small size of synthesized negative reviews is obtained by rewriting the positive text via a large language model. Then, a disentangle reconstruction model is trained based on the generated data. After training, a large amount of synthetic data can be obtained by decoding the new representation obtained from the combination of different sample representations and filtering based on confusion degree and sentiment classification. Experiments have proved that our framework can effectively alleviate emotional bias same as using only large models, but more economically.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the results of the SHROOM, a shared task focused on detecting hallucinations: outputs from natural language generation (NLG) systems that are fluent, yet inaccurate. Such cases of overgeneration put in jeopardy many NLG applications, where correctness is often mission-critical. The shared task was conducted with a newly constructed dataset of 4000 model outputs labeled by 5 annotators each, spanning 3 NLP tasks: machine translation, paraphrase generation and definition modeling.
  The shared task was tackled by a total of 58 different users grouped in 42 teams, out of which 27 elected to write a system description paper; collectively, they submitted over 300 prediction sets on both tracks of the shared task. We observe a number of key trends in how this approach was tackled -- many participants rely on a handful of model, and often rely either on synthetic data for fine-tuning or zero-shot prompting strategies. While a majority of the teams did outperform our proposed baseline system, the performances of top-scoring systems are still consistent with a random handling of the more challenging items.</p>

This protocol is comprised of five tasks, each designed to evaluate a key property that a synthetic user should exhibit: choosing which items to talk about, expressing binary preferences, expressing open-ended preferences, requesting recommendations, and giving feedback. Through evaluation of baseline simulators, we demonstrate these tasks effectively reveal deviations of language models from human behavior, and offer insights on how to reduce the deviations with model selection and prompting strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuxiao Liu, Kevin Lin, Linjie Li, Jianfeng Wang, Yaser Yacoob, Lijuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the promising progress in multi-modal tasks, current large multi-modal models (LMMs) are prone to hallucinating inconsistent descriptions with respect to the associated image and human instructions. This paper addresses this issue by introducing the first large and diverse visual instruction tuning dataset, named Large-scale Robust Visual (LRV)-Instruction. Our dataset comprises 400k visual instructions generated by GPT4, covering 16 vision-and-language tasks with open-ended instructions and answers. Unlike existing studies that primarily focus on positive instruction samples, we design LRV-Instruction to include both positive and negative instructions for more robust visual instruction tuning. Our negative instructions are designed at three semantic levels: (i) Nonexistent Object Manipulation, (ii) Existent Object Manipulation and (iii) Knowledge Manipulation. To efficiently measure the hallucination generated by LMMs, we propose GPT4-Assisted Visual Instruction Evaluation (GAVIE), a stable approach to evaluate visual instruction tuning like human experts. GAVIE does not require human-annotated groundtruth answers and can adapt to diverse instruction formats. We conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate the hallucination of LMMs. Our results demonstrate existing LMMs exhibit significant hallucinations when presented with our negative instructions, particularly Existent Object and Knowledge Manipulation instructions. Moreover, we successfully mitigate hallucination by finetuning MiniGPT4 and mPLUG-Owl on LRV-Instruction while improving performance on several public datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we observed that a balanced ratio of positive and negative instances in the training data leads to a more robust model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyin Wang, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Ji Wu, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the in-context learning abilities of the Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) models released by OpenAI. A novel speech-based in-context learning (SICL) approach is proposed for test-time adaptation, which can reduce the word error rates (WERs) with only a small number of labelled speech samples without gradient descent. Language-level adaptation experiments using Chinese dialects showed that when applying SICL to isolated word ASR, consistent and considerable relative WER reductions can be achieved using Whisper models of any size on two dialects, which is on average 32.3%. A k-nearest-neighbours-based in-context example selection technique can be applied to further improve the efficiency of SICL, which can increase the average relative WER reduction to 36.4%. The findings are verified using speaker adaptation or continuous speech recognition tasks, and both achieved considerable relative WER reductions. Detailed quantitative analyses are also provided to shed light on SICL's adaptability to phonological variances and dialect-specific lexical nuances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Merrill, Ashish Sabharwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent theoretical work has identified surprisingly simple reasoning problems, such as checking if two nodes in a graph are connected or simulating finite-state machines, that are provably unsolvable by standard transformers that answer immediately after reading their input. However, in practice, transformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a "chain of thought" or "scratchpad", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of intermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such intermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a decoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of increase depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For instance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of decoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard transformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps, assuming a slight generalization to standard pre-norm, adds a clear new ability (under standard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our results also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within context-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps with generalized pre-norm make them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems -- the first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard complexity classes. Together, our results provide a nuanced framework for understanding how the length of a transformer's chain of thought or scratchpad impacts its reasoning power.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junu Kim, Chaeeun Shim, Bosco Seong Kyu Yang, Chami Im, Sung Yoon Lim, Han-Gil Jeong, Edward Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing clinical prediction models (e.g., mortality prediction) based on electronic health records (EHRs) typically relies on expert opinion for feature selection and adjusting observation window size. This burdens experts and creates a bottleneck in the development process. We propose Retrieval-Enhanced Medical prediction model (REMed) to address such challenges. REMed can essentially evaluate an unlimited number of clinical events, select the relevant ones, and make predictions. This approach effectively eliminates the need for manual feature selection and enables an unrestricted observation window. We verified these properties through experiments on 27 clinical tasks and two independent cohorts from publicly available EHR datasets, where REMed outperformed other contemporary architectures that aim to handle as many events as possible. Notably, we found that the preferences of REMed align closely with those of medical experts. We expect our approach to significantly expedite the development of EHR prediction models by minimizing clinicians' need for manual involvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant research attention. However, fully harnessing the potential of LLMs for agent-based tasks presents inherent challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of diverse data sources featuring multi-turn trajectories. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{AgentOhana} as a comprehensive solution to address these challenges. \textit{AgentOhana} aggregates agent trajectories from distinct environments, spanning a wide array of scenarios. It meticulously standardizes and unifies these trajectories into a consistent format, streamlining the creation of a generic data loader optimized for agent training. Leveraging the data unification, our training pipeline maintains equilibrium across different data sources and preserves independent randomness across devices during dataset partitioning and model training. Additionally, we present \textbf{xLAM-v0.1}, a large action model tailored for AI agents, which demonstrates exceptional performance across various benchmarks.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10943">MIntRec2.0: A Large-scale Benchmark Dataset for Multimodal Intent Recognition and Out-of-scope Detection in Conversations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlei Zhang, Xin Wang, Hua Xu, Qianrui Zhou, Kai Gao, Jianhua Su, jinyue Zhao, Wenrui Li, Yanting Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition poses significant challenges, requiring the incorporation of non-verbal modalities from real-world contexts to enhance the comprehension of human intentions. Existing benchmark datasets are limited in scale and suffer from difficulties in handling out-of-scope samples that arise in multi-turn conversational interactions. We introduce MIntRec2.0, a large-scale benchmark dataset for multimodal intent recognition in multi-party conversations. It contains 1,245 dialogues with 15,040 samples, each annotated within a new intent taxonomy of 30 fine-grained classes. Besides 9,304 in-scope samples, it also includes 5,736 out-of-scope samples appearing in multi-turn contexts, which naturally occur in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive information on the speakers in each utterance, enriching its utility for multi-party conversational research. We establish a general framework supporting the organization of single-turn and multi-turn dialogue data, modality feature extraction, multimodal fusion, as well as in-scope classification and out-of-scope detection. Evaluation benchmarks are built using classic multimodal fusion methods, ChatGPT, and human evaluators. While existing methods incorporating nonverbal information yield improvements, effectively leveraging context information and detecting out-of-scope samples remains a substantial challenge. Notably, large language models exhibit a significant performance gap compared to humans, highlighting the limitations of machine learning methods in the cognitive intent understanding task. We believe that MIntRec2.0 will serve as a valuable resource, providing a pioneering foundation for research in human-machine conversational interactions, and significantly facilitating related applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixian Ma, Weikai Huang, Jieyu Zhang, Tanmay Gupta, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world multi-modal problems are rarely solved by a single machine learning model, and often require multi-step computational plans that involve stitching several models. Tool-augmented LLMs hold tremendous promise for automating the generation of such computational plans. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating LLMs as planners for multi-step multi-modal tasks has prevented a systematic study of planner design decisions. Should LLMs generate a full plan in a single shot or step-by-step? Should they invoke tools directly with Python code or through structured data formats like JSON? Does feedback improve planning? To answer these questions and more, we introduce m&m's: a benchmark containing 4K+ multi-step multi-modal tasks involving 33 tools that include multi-modal models, (free) public APIs, and image processing modules. For each of these task queries, we provide automatically generated plans using this realistic toolset. We further provide a high-quality subset of 1,565 task plans that are human-verified and correctly executable. With m&m's, we evaluate 6 popular LLMs with 2 planning strategies (multi-step vs. step-by-step planning), 2 plan formats (JSON vs. code), and 3 types of feedback (parsing/verification/execution). Finally, we summarize takeaways from our extensive experiments.
