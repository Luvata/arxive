<p><b>Authors:</b> Chidaksh Ravuru, Sagar Srinivas Sakhinana, Venkataramana Runkana</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series modeling is crucial for many applications, however, it faces challenges such as complex spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution shifts in learning from historical context to predict task-specific outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach using an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for time series analysis. The framework leverages a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture where the master agent orchestrates specialized sub-agents and delegates the end-user request to the relevant sub-agent. The sub-agents utilize smaller, pre-trained language models (SLMs) customized for specific time series tasks through fine-tuning using instruction tuning and direct preference optimization, and retrieve relevant prompts from a shared repository of prompt pools containing distilled knowledge about historical patterns and trends to improve predictions on new data. Our proposed modular, multi-agent RAG approach offers flexibility and achieves state-of-the-art performance across major time series tasks by tackling complex challenges more effectively than task-specific customized methods across benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lun Ai, Stephen H. Muggleton, Shi-shun Liang, Geoff S. Baldwin</p>
<p>Abstract: We apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery, based on comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs). Predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs. Learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models and offers a realistic approach to a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruairidh M. Battleday, Samuel J. Gershman</p>
<p>Abstract: A suite of impressive scientific discoveries have been driven by recent advances in artificial intelligence. These almost all result from training flexible algorithms to solve difficult optimization problems specified in advance by teams of domain scientists and engineers with access to large amounts of data. Although extremely useful, this kind of problem solving only corresponds to one part of science - the "easy problem." The other part of scientific research is coming up with the problem itself - the "hard problem." Solving the hard problem is beyond the capacities of current algorithms for scientific discovery because it requires continual conceptual revision based on poorly defined constraints. We can make progress on understanding how humans solve the hard problem by studying the cognitive science of scientists, and then use the results to design new computational agents that automatically infer and update their scientific paradigms.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14511">Unveiling the Statistical Foundations of Chain-of-Thought Prompting Methods</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyang Hu, Fengzhuo Zhang, Siyu Chen, Zhuoran Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its variants have gained popularity as effective methods for solving multi-step reasoning problems using pretrained large language models (LLMs). In this work, we analyze CoT prompting from a statistical estimation perspective, providing a comprehensive characterization of its sample complexity. To this end, we introduce a multi-step latent variable model that encapsulates the reasoning process, where the latent variable encodes the task information. Under this framework, we demonstrate that when the pretraining dataset is sufficiently large, the estimator formed by CoT prompting is equivalent to a Bayesian estimator. This estimator effectively solves the multi-step reasoning problem by aggregating a posterior distribution inferred from the demonstration examples in the prompt. Moreover, we prove that the statistical error of the CoT estimator can be decomposed into two main components: (i) a prompting error, which arises from inferring the true task using CoT prompts, and (ii) the statistical error of the pretrained LLM. We establish that, under appropriate assumptions, the prompting error decays exponentially to zero as the number of demonstrations increases. Additionally, we explicitly characterize the approximation and generalization errors of the pretrained LLM. Notably, we construct a transformer model that approximates the target distribution of the multi-step reasoning problem with an error that decreases exponentially in the number of transformer blocks. Our analysis extends to other variants of CoT, including Self-Consistent CoT, Tree-of-Thought, and Selection-Inference, offering a broad perspective on the efficacy of these methods. We also provide numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Y. Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces EVINCE (Entropy and Variation IN Conditional Exchanges), a dialogue framework advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by enhancing versatility, adaptivity, and reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Leveraging adversarial debate and a novel dual entropy theory, EVINCE improves prediction accuracy, robustness, and stability in LLMs by integrating statistical modeling, information theory, and machine learning to balance diverse perspective exploration with strong prior exploitation. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through consistent convergence of information-theoretic metrics, particularly improved mutual information, fostering productive LLM collaboration. We apply EVINCE to healthcare, showing improved disease diagnosis, and discuss its broader implications for decision-making across domains. This work provides theoretical foundations and empirical validation for EVINCE, paving the way for advancements in LLM collaboration and AGI development.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14597">On Centralized Critics in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueguang Lyu, Andrea Baisero, Yuchen Xiao, Brett Daley, Christopher Amato</p>
<p>Abstract: Centralized Training for Decentralized Execution where agents are trained offline in a centralized fashion and execute online in a decentralized manner, has become a popular approach in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In particular, it has become popular to develop actor-critic methods that train decentralized actors with a centralized critic where the centralized critic is allowed access global information of the entire system, including the true system state. Such centralized critics are possible given offline information and are not used for online execution. While these methods perform well in a number of domains and have become a de facto standard in MARL, using a centralized critic in this context has yet to be sufficiently analyzed theoretically or empirically. In this paper, we therefore formally analyze centralized and decentralized critic approaches, and analyze the effect of using state-based critics in partially observable environments. We derive theories contrary to the common intuition: critic centralization is not strictly beneficial, and using state values can be harmful. We further prove that, in particular, state-based critics can introduce unexpected bias and variance compared to history-based critics. Finally, we demonstrate how the theory applies in practice by comparing different forms of critics on a wide range of common multi-agent benchmarks. The experiments show practical issues such as the difficulty of representation learning with partial observability, which highlights why the theoretical problems are often overlooked in the literature.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14640">Effect of Adaptation Rate and Cost Display in a Human-AI Interaction Game</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason T. Isa, Bohan Wu, Qirui Wang, Yilin Zhang, Samuel A. Burden, Lillian J. Ratliff, Benjamin J. Chasnov</p>
<p>Abstract: As interactions between humans and AI become more prevalent, it is critical to have better predictors of human behavior in these interactions. We investigated how changes in the AI's adaptive algorithm impact behavior predictions in two-player continuous games. In our experiments, the AI adapted its actions using a gradient descent algorithm under different adaptation rates while human participants were provided cost feedback. The cost feedback was provided by one of two types of visual displays: (a) cost at the current joint action vector, or (b) cost in a local neighborhood of the current joint action vector. Our results demonstrate that AI adaptation rate can significantly affect human behavior, having the ability to shift the outcome between two game theoretic equilibrium. We observed that slow adaptation rates shift the outcome towards the Nash equilibrium, while fast rates shift the outcome towards the human-led Stackelberg equilibrium. The addition of localized cost information had the effect of shifting outcomes towards Nash, compared to the outcomes from cost information at only the current joint action vector. Future work will investigate other effects that influence the convergence of gradient descent games.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14649">Emergent Language in Open-Ended Environments</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Cornelius Wolff, Julius Mayer, Elia Bruni, Xenia Ohmer</p>
<p>Abstract: Emergent language research has made significant progress in recent years, but still largely fails to explore how communication emerges in more complex and situated multi-agent systems. Existing setups often employ a reference game, which limits the range of language emergence phenomena that can be studied, as the game consists of a single, purely language-based interaction between the agents. In this paper, we address these limitations and explore the emergence and utility of token-based communication in open-ended multi-agent environments, where situated agents interact with the environment through movement and communication over multiple time-steps. Specifically, we introduce two novel cooperative environments: Multi-Agent Pong and Collectors. These environments are interesting because optimal performance requires the emergence of a communication protocol, but moderate success can be achieved without one. By employing various methods from explainable AI research, such as saliency maps, perturbation, and diagnostic classifiers, we are able to track and interpret the agents' language channel use over time. We find that the emerging communication is sparse, with the agents only generating meaningful messages and acting upon incoming messages in states where they cannot succeed without coordination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Monnin, Cherif-Hassan Nousradine, Lucas Jarnac, Laurel Zuckerman, Miguel Couceiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become ubiquitous publicly available knowledge sources, and are nowadays covering an ever increasing array of domains. However, not all knowledge represented is useful or pertaining when considering a new application or specific task. Also, due to their increasing size, handling large KGs in their entirety entails scalability issues. These two aspects asks for efficient methods to extract subgraphs of interest from existing KGs. To this aim, we introduce KGPrune, a Web Application that, given seed entities of interest and properties to traverse, extracts their neighboring subgraphs from Wikidata. To avoid topical drift, KGPrune relies on a frugal pruning algorithm based on analogical reasoning to only keep relevant neighbors while pruning irrelevant ones. The interest of KGPrune is illustrated by two concrete applications, namely, bootstrapping an enterprise KG and extracting knowledge related to looted artworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development history of landscape architecture (LA) reflects the human pursuit of environmental beautification and ecological balance. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that simulate and extend human intelligence, immense opportunities have been provided for LA, offering scientific and technological support throughout the entire workflow. In this article, we comprehensively review the applications of AI technology in the field of LA. First, we introduce the many potential benefits that AI brings to the design, planning, and management aspects of LA. Secondly, we discuss how AI can assist the LA field in solving its current development problems, including urbanization, environmental degradation and ecological decline, irrational planning, insufficient management and maintenance, and lack of public participation. Furthermore, we summarize the key technologies and practical cases of applying AI in the LA domain, from design assistance to intelligent management, all of which provide innovative solutions for the planning, design, and maintenance of LA. Finally, we look ahead to the problems and opportunities in LA, emphasizing the need to combine human expertise and judgment for rational decision-making. This article provides both theoretical and practical guidance for LA designers, researchers, and technology developers. The successful integration of AI technology into LA holds great promise for enhancing the field's capabilities and achieving more sustainable, efficient, and user-friendly outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Bhardwaj, Ajit Noonia, Sandeep Chaurasia, Mukesh Kumar, Abdulnaser Rashid, Mohamed Tahar Ben Othman</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has emerged as a game-changing technology in data extraction, revolutionizing the way organizations process and analyze large volumes of documents such as invoices, purchase orders, and payment advices. This study investigates the use of RPA for structured data extraction and evaluates its advantages over manual processes. By comparing human-performed tasks with those executed by RPA software bots, we assess efficiency and accuracy in data extraction from invoices, focusing on the effectiveness of the RPA system. Through four distinct scenarios involving varying numbers of invoices, we measure efficiency in terms of time and effort required for task completion, as well as accuracy by comparing error rates between manual and RPA processes. Our findings highlight the significant efficiency gains achieved by RPA, with bots completing tasks in significantly less time compared to manual efforts across all cases. Moreover, the RPA system consistently achieves perfect accuracy, mitigating the risk of errors and enhancing process reliability. These results underscore the transformative potential of RPA in optimizing operational efficiency, reducing human labor costs, and improving overall business performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current artificial intelligence (AI) models often focus on enhancing performance through meticulous parameter tuning and optimization techniques. However, the fundamental design principles behind these models receive comparatively less attention, which can limit our understanding of their potential and constraints. This comprehensive review explores the diverse design inspirations that have shaped modern AI models, i.e., brain-inspired artificial intelligence (BIAI). We present a classification framework that categorizes BIAI approaches into physical structure-inspired and human behavior-inspired models. We also examine the real-world applications where different BIAI models excel, highlighting their practical benefits and deployment challenges. By delving into these areas, we provide new insights and propose future research directions to drive innovation and address current gaps in the field. This review offers researchers and practitioners a comprehensive overview of the BIAI landscape, helping them harness its potential and expedite advancements in AI development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nada Shahin, Leila Ismail</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing Deaf and Hard of Hearing population worldwide and the persistent shortage of certified sign language interpreters, there is a pressing need for an efficient, signs-driven, integrated end-to-end translation system, from sign to gloss to text and vice-versa. There has been a wealth of research on machine translations and related reviews. However, there are few works on sign language machine translation considering the particularity of the language being continuous and dynamic. This paper aims to address this void, providing a retrospective analysis of the temporal evolution of sign language machine translation algorithms and a taxonomy of the Transformers architectures, the most used approach in language translation. We also present the requirements of a real-time Quality-of-Service sign language ma-chine translation system underpinned by accurate deep learning algorithms. We propose future research directions for sign language translation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Liu, Chuan Zhou, Peng Zhang, Yanan Cao, Yongchao Liu, Zhao Li, Hongyang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) constitutes a foundational task, directed towards learning representations for entities and relations within knowledge graphs (KGs), with the objective of crafting representations comprehensive enough to approximate the logical and symbolic interconnections among entities. In this paper, we define a metric Z-counts to measure the difficulty of training each triple ($<$head entity, relation, tail entity$>$) in KGs with theoretical analysis. Based on this metric, we propose \textbf{CL4KGE}, an efficient \textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{L}earning based training strategy for \textbf{KGE}. This method includes a difficulty measurer and a training scheduler that aids in the training of KGE models. Our approach possesses the flexibility to act as a plugin within a wide range of KGE models, with the added advantage of adaptability to the majority of KGs in existence. The proposed method has been evaluated on popular KGE models, and the results demonstrate that it enhances the state-of-the-art methods. The use of Z-counts as a metric has enabled the identification of challenging triples in KGs, which helps in devising effective training strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper demonstrates that model-based reinforcement learning (model-based RL) is a suitable approach for the task of analogical reasoning. We hypothesize that model-based RL can solve analogical reasoning tasks more efficiently through the creation of internal models. To test this, we compared DreamerV3, a model-based RL method, with Proximal Policy Optimization, a model-free RL method, on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) tasks. Our results indicate that model-based RL not only outperforms model-free RL in learning and generalizing from single tasks but also shows significant advantages in reasoning across similar tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roko Parac, Lorenzo Nodari, Leo Ardon, Daniel Furelos-Blanco, Federico Cerutti, Alessandra Russo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents PROB-IRM, an approach that learns robust reward machines (RMs) for reinforcement learning (RL) agents from noisy execution traces. The key aspect of RM-driven RL is the exploitation of a finite-state machine that decomposes the agent's task into different subtasks. PROB-IRM uses a state-of-the-art inductive logic programming framework robust to noisy examples to learn RMs from noisy traces using the Bayesian posterior degree of beliefs, thus ensuring robustness against inconsistencies. Pivotal for the results is the interleaving between RM learning and policy learning: a new RM is learned whenever the RL agent generates a trace that is believed not to be accepted by the current RM. To speed up the training of the RL agent, PROB-IRM employs a probabilistic formulation of reward shaping that uses the posterior Bayesian beliefs derived from the traces. Our experimental analysis shows that PROB-IRM can learn (potentially imperfect) RMs from noisy traces and exploit them to train an RL agent to solve its tasks successfully. Despite the complexity of learning the RM from noisy traces, agents trained with PROB-IRM perform comparably to agents provided with handcrafted RMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shusaku Egami, Takahiro Ugai, Ken Fukuda</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), which ground various non-symbolic data (e.g., images and videos) into symbols, have attracted attention as resources enabling knowledge processing and machine learning across modalities. However, the construction of MMKGs for videos consisting of multiple events, such as daily activities, is still in the early stages. In this paper, we construct an MMKG based on synchronized multi-view simulated videos of daily activities. Besides representing the content of daily life videos as event-centric knowledge, our MMKG also includes frame-by-frame fine-grained changes, such as bounding boxes within video frames. In addition, we provide support tools for querying our MMKG. As an application example, we demonstrate that our MMKG facilitates benchmarking vision-language models by providing the necessary vision-language datasets for a tailored task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel Boersma, Krishna Manoorkar, Alessandra Palmigiano, Mattia Panettiere, Apostolos Tzimoulis, Nachoem Wijnberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Categorization of business processes is an important part of auditing. Large amounts of transactional data in auditing can be represented as transactions between financial accounts using weighted bipartite graphs. We view such bipartite graphs as many-valued formal contexts, which we use to obtain explainable categorization of these business processes in terms of financial accounts involved in a business process by using methods in formal concept analysis. We use Dempster-Shafer mass functions to represent agendas showing different interest in different set of financial accounts. We also model some possible deliberation scenarios between agents with different interrogative agendas to reach an aggregated agenda and categorization. The framework developed in this paper provides a formal ground to obtain and study explainable categorizations from the data represented as bipartite graphs according to the agendas of different agents in an organization (e.g. an audit firm), and interaction between these through deliberation. We use this framework to describe a machine-leaning meta algorithm for outlier detection and classification which can provide local and global explanations of its result and demonstrate it through an outlier detection algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Earth Observation Satellite Planning (EOSP) is a difficult optimization problem with considerable practical interest. A set of requested observations must be scheduled on an agile Earth observation satellite while respecting constraints on their visibility window, as well as maneuver constraints that impose varying delays between successive observations. In addition, the problem is largely oversubscribed: there are much more candidate observations than what can possibly be achieved. Therefore, one must select the set of observations that will be performed while maximizing their weighted cumulative benefit, and propose a feasible schedule for these observations. As previous work mostly focused on heuristic and iterative search algorithms, this paper presents a new technique for selecting and scheduling observations based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). GNNs are used to extract relevant information from the graphs representing instances of the EOSP, and DRL drives the search for optimal schedules. Our simulations show that it is able to learn on small problem instances and generalize to larger real-world instances, with very competitive performance compared to traditional approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Udo Schlegel, Daniel A. Keim</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for Deep Neural Network models has developed significantly, offering numerous techniques to extract explanations from models. However, evaluating explanations is often not trivial, and differences in applied metrics can be subtle, especially with non-intelligible data. Thus, there is a need for visualizations tailored to explore explanations for domains with such data, e.g., time series. We propose DAVOTS, an interactive visual analytics approach to explore raw time series data, activations of neural networks, and attributions in a dense-pixel visualization to gain insights into the data, models' decisions, and explanations. To further support users in exploring large datasets, we apply clustering approaches to the visualized data domains to highlight groups and present ordering strategies for individual and combined data exploration to facilitate finding patterns. We visualize a CNN trained on the FordA dataset to demonstrate the approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Lucassen, Mark Henry, Philippa Wright, Owen Yeung</p>
<p>Abstract: Many theoretical obstacles to AI alignment are consequences of reflective stability - the problem of designing alignment mechanisms that the AI would not disable if given the option. However, problems stemming from reflective stability are not obviously present in current LLMs, leading to disagreement over whether they will need to be solved to enable safe delegation of cognitive labor. In this paper, we propose Counterfactual Priority Change (CPC) destabilization as a mechanism by which reflective stability problems may arise in future LLMs. We describe two risk factors for CPC-destabilization: 1) CPC-based stepping back and 2) preference instability. We develop preliminary evaluations for each of these risk factors, and apply them to frontier LLMs. Our findings indicate that in current LLMs, increased scale and capability are associated with increases in both CPC-based stepping back and preference instability, suggesting that CPC-destabilization may cause reflective stability problems in future LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Sovrano, Michael Lognoul, Giulia Vilone</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant investment and development have gone into integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical and healthcare applications, leading to advanced control systems in medical technology. However, the opacity of AI systems raises concerns about essential characteristics needed in such sensitive applications, like transparency and trustworthiness. Our study addresses these concerns by investigating a process for selecting the most adequate Explainable AI (XAI) methods to comply with the explanation requirements of key EU regulations in the context of smart bioelectronics for medical devices. The adopted methodology starts with categorising smart devices by their control mechanisms (open-loop, closed-loop, and semi-closed-loop systems) and delving into their technology. Then, we analyse these regulations to define their explainability requirements for the various devices and related goals. Simultaneously, we classify XAI methods by their explanatory objectives. This allows for matching legal explainability requirements with XAI explanatory goals and determining the suitable XAI algorithms for achieving them. Our findings provide a nuanced understanding of which XAI algorithms align better with EU regulations for different types of medical devices. We demonstrate this through practical case studies on different neural implants, from chronic disease management to advanced prosthetics. This study fills a crucial gap in aligning XAI applications in bioelectronics with stringent provisions of EU regulations. It provides a practical framework for developers and researchers, ensuring their AI innovations advance healthcare technology and adhere to legal and ethical standards.</p>

The robot uses planning to find sequences of actions that must be performed in order to gracefully cancel a previously received command. The Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is used to write a domain to model kitchen activities and behaviours, and this domain is enriched with knowledge from online ontologies and knowledge graphs, like DBPedia.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sakhinana Sagar Srinivas, Vijay Sri Vaikunth, Venkataramana Runkana</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the Process Engineering Operations Assistant (PEOA), an AI-driven framework designed to solve complex problems in the chemical and process industries. The framework employs a modular architecture orchestrated by a meta-agent, which serves as the central coordinator, managing an action generator and instruction-tuned small-scale language models (expert models). The action generator decomposes complex problems into sub-tasks and identifies suitable expert models to execute each, delivering precise solutions for multi-step problem-solving. Key techniques include advanced knowledge modeling using property graphs for improved information retrieval, facilitating more accurate and contextually relevant solutions. Additionally, the framework utilizes a teacher-student transfer-learning approach with GPT-4 (Omni) to fine-tune the action generator and expert models for domain adaptation, alongside an iterative problem-solving mechanism with sophisticated error handling. Custom datasets were developed to evaluate the framework against leading proprietary language models on various engineering tasks. The results demonstrate the framework effectiveness in automating calculations, accelerating prototyping, and providing AI-augmented decision support for industrial processes, marking a significant advancement in process engineering capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have completely transformed the domain of computational pathology (CPath), which in turn altered the diagnostic workflow of pathologists by integrating foundation models (FMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in their assessment and decision-making process. FMs overcome the limitations of existing deep learning approaches in CPath by learning a representation space that can be adapted to a wide variety of downstream tasks without explicit supervision. VLMs allow pathology reports written in natural language to be used as a rich semantic information source to improve existing models as well as generate predictions in natural language form. In this survey, a holistic and systematic overview of recent innovations in FMs and VLMs in CPath is presented. Furthermore, the tools, datasets and training schemes for these models are summarized in addition to categorizing them into distinct groups. This extensive survey highlights the current trends in CPath and the way it is going to be transformed through FMs and VLMs in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonne van Dreven, Abbas Cheddad, Sadi Alawadi, Ahmad Nauman Ghazi, Jad Al Koussa, Dirk Vanhoudt</p>
<p>Abstract: District Heating (DH) systems are essential for energy-efficient urban heating. However, despite the advancements in automated fault detection and diagnosis (FDD), DH still faces challenges in operational faults that impact efficiency. This study introduces the Shared Nearest Neighbor Enhanced District Heating Anomaly Detection (SHEDAD) approach, designed to approximate the DH network topology and allow for local anomaly detection without disclosing sensitive information, such as substation locations. The approach leverages a multi-adaptive k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph to improve the initial neighborhood creation. Moreover, it introduces a merging technique that reduces noise and eliminates trivial edges. We use the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) and modified z-scores to flag anomalous substations. The results reveal that SHEDAD outperforms traditional clustering methods, achieving significantly lower intra-cluster variance and distance. Additionally, SHEDAD effectively isolates and identifies two distinct categories of anomalies: supply temperatures and substation performance. We identified 30 anomalous substations and reached a sensitivity of approximately 65\% and specificity of approximately 97\%. By focusing on this subset of poor-performing substations in the network, SHEDAD enables more targeted and effective maintenance interventions, which can reduce energy usage while optimizing network performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kihwan Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Supply chain networks describe interactions between products, manufacture facilities, storages in the context of supply and demand of the products. Supply chain data are inherently under graph structure; thus, it can be fertile ground for applications of graph neural network (GNN). Very recently, supply chain dataset, SupplyGraph, has been released to the public. Though the SupplyGraph dataset is valuable given scarcity of publicly available data, there was less clarity on description of the dataset, data quality assurance process, and hyperparameters of the selected models. Further, for generalizability of findings, it would be more convincing to present the findings by performing statistical analyses on the distribution of errors rather than showing the average value of the errors. Therefore, this study assessed the supply chain dataset, SupplyGraph, with better clarity on analyses processes, data quality assurance, machine learning (ML) model specifications. After data quality assurance procedures, this study compared performance of Multilayer Perceptions (MLP), Graph Convolution Network (GCN), and Graph Attention Network (GAT) on a demanding forecasting task while matching hyperparameters as feasible as possible. The analyses revealed that GAT performed best, followed by GCN and MLP. Those performance improvements were statistically significant at $\alpha = 0.05$ after correction for multiple comparisons. This study also discussed several considerations in applying GNN to supply chain networks. The current study reinforces the previous study in supply chain benchmark dataset with respect to description of the dataset and methodology, so that the future research in applications of GNN to supply chain becomes more reproducible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heejae Chon, Seonghyeon Lee, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) have exhibited impressive abilities in generating codes from natural language requirements. In this work, we highlight the diversity of code generated by LMs as a critical criterion for evaluating their code generation capabilities, in addition to functional correctness. Despite its practical implications, there is a lack of studies focused on assessing the diversity of generated code, which overlooks its importance in the development of code LMs. We propose a systematic approach to evaluate the diversity of generated code, utilizing various metrics for inter-code similarity as well as functional correctness. Specifically, we introduce a pairwise code similarity measure that leverages large LMs' capabilities in code understanding and reasoning, demonstrating the highest correlation with human judgment. We extensively investigate the impact of various factors on the quality of generated code, including model sizes, temperatures, training approaches, prompting strategies, and the difficulty of input problems. Our consistent observation of a positive correlation between the test pass score and the inter-code similarity score indicates that current LMs tend to produce functionally correct code with limited diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Jindong Han, Wei Fan, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal time series forecasting plays a critical role in various real-world applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and climate analysis. The recent advancements in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have inspired efforts to reprogram these models for time series forecasting tasks, by leveraging their superior reasoning and generalization capabilities. However, existing approaches fall short in handling complex spatial inter-series dependencies and intrinsic intra-series frequency components, limiting their spatio-temporal forecasting performance. Moreover, the linear mapping of continuous time series to a compressed subset vocabulary in reprogramming constrains the spatio-temporal semantic expressivity of PLMs and may lead to potential information bottleneck. To overcome the above limitations, we propose \textsc{RePST}, a tailored PLM reprogramming framework for spatio-temporal forecasting. The key insight of \textsc{RePST} is to decouple the spatio-temporal dynamics in the frequency domain, allowing better alignment with the PLM text space. Specifically, we first decouple spatio-temporal data in Fourier space and devise a structural diffusion operator to obtain temporal intrinsic and spatial diffusion signals, making the dynamics more comprehensible and predictable for PLMs. To avoid information bottleneck from a limited vocabulary, we further propose a discrete reprogramming strategy that selects relevant discrete textual information from an expanded vocabulary space in a differentiable manner. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting models, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longyu Feng, Huahang Li, Chen Jason Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Schema matching is the process of identifying correspondences between the elements of two given schemata, essential for database management systems, data integration, and data warehousing. The inherent uncertainty of current schema matching algorithms leads to the generation of a set of candidate matches. Storing these results necessitates the use of databases and systems capable of handling probabilistic queries. This complicates the querying process and increases the associated storage costs. Motivated by GPT-4 outstanding performance, we explore its potential to reduce uncertainty. Our proposal is to supplant the role of crowdworkers with GPT-4 for querying the set of candidate matches. To get more precise correspondence verification responses from GPT-4, We have crafted Semantic-match and Abbreviation-match prompt for GPT-4, achieving state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets DeepMDatasets 100% (+0.0) and Fabricated-Datasets 91.8% (+2.2) recall rate. To optimise budget utilisation, we have devised a cost-aware solution. Within the constraints of the budget, our solution delivers favourable outcomes with minimal time expenditure.
  We introduce a novel framework, Prompt-Matcher, to reduce the uncertainty in the process of integration of multiple automatic schema matching algorithms and the selection of complex parameterization. It assists users in diminishing the uncertainty associated with candidate schema match results and in optimally ranking the most promising matches. We formally define the Correspondence Selection Problem, aiming to optimise the revenue within the confines of the GPT-4 budget. We demonstrate that CSP is NP-Hard and propose an approximation algorithm with minimal time expenditure. Ultimately, we demonstrate the efficacy of Prompt-Matcher through rigorous experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duo Wang, Yuan Zuo, Fengzhi Li, Junjie Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot graph machine learning, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has garnered significant interest due to the challenge of scarce labeled data. While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), as a form of deep generative model, have been widely used in recent years, and shown great great peformance in a number of different domains, including image generation and anomaly detection, etc.. This paper aims to explore neural network model compression method based on VAE. The experiment uses different neural network models for MNIST recognition as compression targets, including Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). These models are the most basic models in deep learning, and other more complex and advanced models are based on them or inherit their features and evolve. In the experiment, the first step is to train the models mentioned above, each trained model will have different accuracy and number of total parameters. And then the variants of parameters for each model are processed as training data in VAEs separately, and the trained VAEs are tested by the true model parameters. The experimental results show that using the latent space as a representation of the model compression can improve the compression rate compared to some traditional methods such as pruning and quantization, meanwhile the accuracy is not greatly affected using the model parameters reconstructed based on the latent space. In the future, a variety of different large-scale deep learning models will be used more widely, so exploring different ways to save time and space on saving or transferring models will become necessary, and the use of VAE in this paper can provide a basis for these further explorations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yali Du, Hui Sun, Ming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Programs implemented in various programming languages form the foundation of software applications. To alleviate the burden of program migration and facilitate the development of software systems, automated program translation across languages has garnered significant attention. Previous approaches primarily focus on pairwise translation paradigms, learning translation between pairs of languages using bilingual parallel data. However, parallel data is difficult to collect for some language pairs, and the distribution of program semantics across languages can shift, posing challenges for pairwise program translation. In this paper, we argue that jointly learning a unified model to translate code across multiple programming languages is superior to separately learning from bilingual parallel data. We propose Variational Interaction for Multilingual Program Translation~(VIM-PT), a disentanglement-based generative approach that jointly trains a unified model for multilingual program translation across multiple languages. VIM-PT disentangles code into language-shared and language-specific features, using variational inference and interaction information with a novel lower bound, then achieves program translation through conditional generation. VIM-PT demonstrates four advantages: 1) captures language-shared information more accurately from various implementations and improves the quality of multilingual program translation, 2) mines and leverages the capability of non-parallel data, 3) addresses the distribution shift of program semantics across languages, 4) and serves as a unified model, reducing deployment complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale "pre-train and prompt learning" paradigms have demonstrated remarkable adaptability, enabling broad applications across diverse domains such as question answering, image recognition, and multimodal retrieval. This approach fully leverages the potential of large-scale pre-trained models, reducing downstream data requirements and computational costs while enhancing model applicability across various tasks. Graphs, as versatile data structures that capture relationships between entities, play pivotal roles in fields such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and biological graphs. Despite the success of pre-train and prompt learning paradigms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), their application in graph domains remains nascent. In graph-structured data, not only do the node and edge features often have disparate distributions, but the topological structures also differ significantly. This diversity in graph data can lead to incompatible patterns or gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning on downstream graphs. We aim to bridge this gap by summarizing methods for alleviating these disparities. This includes exploring prompt design methodologies, comparing related techniques, assessing application scenarios and datasets, and identifying unresolved problems and challenges. This survey categorizes over 100 relevant works in this field, summarizing general design principles and the latest applications, including text-attributed graphs, molecules, proteins, and recommendation systems.

<p>Abstract: Dynamic graph modeling is crucial for analyzing evolving patterns in various applications. Existing approaches often integrate graph neural networks with temporal modules or redefine dynamic graph modeling as a generative sequence task. However, these methods typically rely on isolated historical contexts of the target nodes from a narrow perspective, neglecting occurrences of similar patterns or relevant cases associated with other nodes. In this work, we introduce the Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Dynamic Graph Modeling (RAG4DyG) framework, which leverages guidance from contextually and temporally analogous examples to broaden the perspective of each node. This approach presents two critical challenges: (1) How to identify and retrieve high-quality demonstrations that are contextually and temporally analogous to dynamic graph samples? (2) How can these demonstrations be effectively integrated to improve dynamic graph modeling? To address these challenges, we propose RAG4DyG, which enriches the understanding of historical contexts by retrieving and learning from contextually and temporally pertinent demonstrations. Specifically, we employ a time- and context-aware contrastive learning module to identify and retrieve relevant cases for each query sequence. Moreover, we design a graph fusion strategy to integrate the retrieved cases, thereby augmenting the inherent historical contexts for improved prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets across different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of RAG4DyG for dynamic graph modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important part of many performance critical applications. This paper provides a simple alternative to existing approaches such as ensemble learning and bayesian neural networks. By directly modeling the loss distribution with an Implicit Quantile Network, we get an estimate of how uncertain the model is of its predictions. For experiments with MNIST and CIFAR datasets, the mean of the estimated loss distribution is 2x higher for incorrect predictions. When data with high estimated uncertainty is removed from the test dataset, the accuracy of the model goes up as much as 10%. This method is simple to implement while offering important information to applications where the user has to know when the model could be wrong (e.g. deep learning for healthcare).</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is an important optimization problem underlying the deployment of robots in automated warehouses and factories. Despite the large body of work on this topic, most approaches make heavy simplifications, both on the environment and the agents, which make the resulting algorithms impractical for real-life scenarios. In this paper, we consider a realistic problem of online order delivery in a warehouse, where a fleet of robots bring the products belonging to each order from shelves to workstations. This creates a stream of inter-dependent pickup and delivery tasks and the associated MAPF problem consists of computing realistic collision-free robot trajectories fulfilling these tasks. To solve this MAPF problem, we propose an extension of the standard Prioritized Planning algorithm to deal with the inter-dependent tasks (Interleaved Prioritized Planning) and a novel Via-Point Star (VP*) algorithm to compute an optimal dynamics-compliant robot trajectory to visit a sequence of goal locations while avoiding moving obstacles. We prove the completeness of our approach and evaluate it in simulation as well as in a real warehouse.</p>

<p>Abstract: The conventional training approach for image captioning involves pre-training a network using teacher forcing and subsequent fine-tuning with Self-Critical Sequence Training to maximize hand-crafted captioning metrics. However, when attempting to optimize modern and higher-quality metrics like CLIP-Score and PAC-Score, this training method often encounters instability and fails to acquire the genuine descriptive capabilities needed to produce fluent and informative captions. In this paper, we propose a new training paradigm termed Direct CLIP-Based Optimization (DiCO). Our approach jointly learns and optimizes a reward model that is distilled from a learnable captioning evaluator with high human correlation. This is done by solving a weighted classification problem directly inside the captioner. At the same time, DiCO prevents divergence from the original model, ensuring that fluency is maintained. DiCO not only exhibits improved stability and enhanced quality in the generated captions but also aligns more closely with human preferences compared to existing methods, especially in modern metrics. Additionally, it maintains competitive performance in traditional metrics. Our source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/DiCO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengyang Xiao, Sujie Hu, Yuqi Shen, Chengyu Fang, Jinfa Huang, Chunming He, Longxiang Tang, Ziyun Yang, Xiu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) refers to the task of identifying and segmenting objects that blend seamlessly into their surroundings, posing a significant challenge for computer vision systems. In recent years, COD has garnered widespread attention due to its potential applications in surveillance, wildlife conservation, autonomous systems, and more. While several surveys on COD exist, they often have limitations in terms of the number and scope of papers covered, particularly regarding the rapid advancements made in the field since mid-2023. To address this void, we present the most comprehensive review of COD to date, encompassing both theoretical frameworks and practical contributions to the field. This paper explores various COD methods across four domains, including both image-level and video-level solutions, from the perspectives of traditional and deep learning approaches. We thoroughly investigate the correlations between COD and other camouflaged scenario methods, thereby laying the theoretical foundation for subsequent analyses. Beyond object-level detection, we also summarize extended methods for instance-level tasks, including camouflaged instance segmentation, counting, and ranking. Additionally, we provide an overview of commonly used benchmarks and evaluation metrics in COD tasks, conducting a comprehensive evaluation of deep learning-based techniques in both image and video domains, considering both qualitative and quantitative performance. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current COD models and propose 9 promising directions for future research, focusing on addressing inherent challenges and exploring novel, meaningful technologies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhan Li, Sifan Wu, Christopher Smith, Thomas Lo, Bang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Writing clinical notes and documenting medical exams is a critical task for healthcare professionals, serving as a vital component of patient care documentation. However, manually writing these notes is time-consuming and can impact the amount of time clinicians can spend on direct patient interaction and other tasks. Consequently, the development of automated clinical note generation systems has emerged as a clinically meaningful area of research within AI for health. In this paper, we present three key contributions to the field of clinical note generation using large language models (LLMs). First, we introduce CliniKnote, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 1,200 complex doctor-patient conversations paired with their full clinical notes. This dataset, created and curated by medical experts with the help of modern neural networks, provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating models in clinical note generation tasks. Second, we propose the K-SOAP (Keyword, Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) note format, which enhances traditional SOAP~\cite{podder2023soap} (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes by adding a keyword section at the top, allowing for quick identification of essential information. Third, we develop an automatic pipeline to generate K-SOAP notes from doctor-patient conversations and benchmark various modern LLMs using various metrics. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and performance compared to standard LLM finetuning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Fawi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces CURLoRA, a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) that leverages CUR matrix decomposition in the context of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our method addresses two critical challenges in LLM fine-tuning: mitigating catastrophic forgetting during continual learning and reducing the number of trainable parameters. We propose a unique modification to the CUR decomposition process, utilizing inverted probabilities for column and row selection which acts as an implicit regularization, and initializing the $U$ matrix as a zero matrix, and only fine-tuning it. We demonstrate through experiments on multiple datasets that CURLoRA outperforms standard LoRA in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. It maintains model stability and performance across tasks while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Our results show that CURLoRA achieves very good and stable task accuracy while maintaining base model's perplexity scores fixed compared to LoRA upon continual fine-tuning, particularly in scenarios with limited data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Lingenberg, Markus Reuter, Gopika Sudhakaran, Dominik Gojny, Stefan Roth, Simone Schaub-Meyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Simple data augmentation techniques, such as rotations and flips, are widely used to enhance the generalization power of computer vision models. However, these techniques often fail to modify high-level semantic attributes of a class. To address this limitation, researchers have explored generative augmentation methods like the recently proposed DA-Fusion. Despite some progress, the variations are still largely limited to textural changes, thus falling short on aspects like varied viewpoints, environment, weather conditions, or even class-level semantic attributes (eg, variations in a dog's breed). To overcome this challenge, we propose DIAGen, building upon DA-Fusion. First, we apply Gaussian noise to the embeddings of an object learned with Textual Inversion to diversify generations using a pre-trained diffusion model's knowledge. Second, we exploit the general knowledge of a text-to-text generative model to guide the image generation of the diffusion model with varied class-specific prompts. Finally, we introduce a weighting mechanism to mitigate the impact of poorly generated samples. Experimental results across various datasets show that DIAGen not only enhances semantic diversity but also improves the performance of subsequent classifiers. The advantages of DIAGen over standard augmentations and the DA-Fusion baseline are particularly pronounced with out-of-distribution samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Zarifis, Xusen Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has progressed in its ability and has seen explosive growth in adoption. However, the consumer's perspective on its use, particularly in specific scenarios such as financial advice, is unclear. This research develops a model of how to build trust in the advice given by GenAI when answering financial questions. Design/methodology/approach: The model is tested with survey data using structural equation modelling (SEM) and multi-group analysis (MGA). The MGA compares two scenarios, one where the consumer makes a specific question and one where a vague question is made. Findings: This research identifies that building trust for consumers is different when they ask a specific financial question in comparison to a vague one. Humanness has a different effect in the two scenarios. When a financial question is specific, human-like interaction does not strengthen trust, while (1) when a question is vague, humanness builds trust. The four ways to build trust in both scenarios are (2) human oversight and being in the loop, (3) transparency and control, (4) accuracy and usefulness and finally (5) ease of use and support. Originality/value: This research contributes to a better understanding of the consumer's perspective when using GenAI for financial questions and highlights the importance of understanding GenAI in specific contexts from specific stakeholders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Messaoud Djeddou, Aouatef Hellal, Ibrahim A. Hameed, Xingang Zhao, Djehad Al Dallal</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the development of a hybrid deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model enhanced by autoencoders and data augmentation techniques to predict critical heat flux (CHF) with high accuracy. By augmenting the original input features using three different autoencoder configurations, the model's predictive capabilities were significantly improved. The hybrid models were trained and tested on a dataset of 7225 samples, with performance metrics including the coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) used for evaluation. Among the tested models, the DCNN_3F-A2 configuration demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving an R2 of 0.9908 during training and 0.9826 during testing, outperforming the base model and other augmented versions. These results suggest that the proposed hybrid approach, combining deep learning with feature augmentation, offers a robust solution for CHF prediction, with the potential to generalize across a wider range of conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a powerful approach for compressing a large model into a smaller, more efficient model, particularly beneficial for latency-sensitive applications like recommender systems. However, current KD research predominantly focuses on Computer Vision (CV) and NLP tasks, overlooking unique data characteristics and challenges inherent to recommender systems. This paper addresses these overlooked challenges, specifically: (1) mitigating data distribution shifts between teacher and student models, (2) efficiently identifying optimal teacher configurations within time and budgetary constraints, and (3) enabling computationally efficient and rapid sharing of teacher labels to support multiple students. We present a robust KD system developed and rigorously evaluated on multiple large-scale personalized video recommendation systems within Google. Our live experiment results demonstrate significant improvements in student model performance while ensuring consistent and reliable generation of high quality teacher labels from a continuous data stream of data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Liu, Pragaash Ponnusamy, Tianle Cai, Han Guo, Yoon Kim, Ben Athiwaratkun</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation sparsity can enable practical inference speedups in large language models (LLMs) by reducing the compute and memory-movement required for matrix multiplications during the forward pass. However, existing methods face limitations that inhibit widespread adoption. Some approaches are tailored towards older models with ReLU-based sparsity, while others require extensive continued pre-training on up to hundreds of billions of tokens. This paper describes TEAL, a simple training-free method that applies magnitude-based activation sparsity to hidden states throughout the entire model. TEAL achieves 40-50% model-wide sparsity with minimal performance degradation across Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, with sizes varying from 7B to 70B. We improve existing sparse kernels and demonstrate wall-clock decoding speed-ups of up to 1.53$\times$ and 1.8$\times$ at 40% and 50% model-wide sparsity. TEAL is compatible with weight quantization, enabling further efficiency gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cherag Aroraa, Tracy Holloway King, Jayant Kumar, Yi Lu, Sanat Sharma, Arvind Srikantan, David Uvalle, Josep Valls-Vargas, Harsha Vardhan</p>
<p>Abstract: As user content and queries become increasingly multi-modal, the need for effective multi-modal search systems has grown. Traditional search systems often rely on textual and metadata annotations for indexed images, while multi-modal embeddings like CLIP enable direct search using text and image embeddings. However, embedding-based approaches face challenges in integrating contextual features such as user locale and recency. Building a scalable multi-modal search system requires fine-tuning several components. This paper presents a multi-modal search architecture and a series of AB tests that optimize embeddings and multi-modal technologies in Adobe Express template search. We address considerations such as embedding model selection, the roles of embeddings in matching and ranking, and the balance between dense and sparse embeddings. Our iterative approach demonstrates how utilizing sparse, dense, and contextual features enhances short and long query search, significantly reduces null rates (over 70\%), and increases click-through rates (CTR). Our findings provide insights into developing robust multi-modal search systems, thereby enhancing relevance for complex queries.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces StyleSpeech, a novel Text-to-Speech~(TTS) system that enhances the naturalness and accuracy of synthesized speech. Building upon existing TTS technologies, StyleSpeech incorporates a unique Style Decorator structure that enables deep learning models to simultaneously learn style and phoneme features, improving adaptability and efficiency through the principles of Lower Rank Adaptation~(LoRA). LoRA allows efficient adaptation of style features in pre-trained models. Additionally, we introduce a novel automatic evaluation metric, the LLM-Guided Mean Opinion Score (LLM-MOS), which employs large language models to offer an objective and robust protocol for automatically assessing TTS system performance. Extensive testing on benchmark datasets shows that our approach markedly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods in producing natural, accurate, and high-quality speech. These advancements not only pushes the boundaries of current TTS system capabilities, but also facilitate the application of TTS system in more dynamic and specialized, such as interactive virtual assistants, adaptive audiobooks, and customized voice for gaming.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asim Biswal, Liana Patel, Siddarth Jha, Amog Kamsetty, Shu Liu, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Carlos Guestrin, Matei Zaharia</p>
<p>Abstract: AI systems that serve natural language questions over databases promise to unlock tremendous value. Such systems would allow users to leverage the powerful reasoning and knowledge capabilities of language models (LMs) alongside the scalable computational power of data management systems. These combined capabilities would empower users to ask arbitrary natural language questions over custom data sources. However, existing methods and benchmarks insufficiently explore this setting. Text2SQL methods focus solely on natural language questions that can be expressed in relational algebra, representing a small subset of the questions real users wish to ask. Likewise, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) considers the limited subset of queries that can be answered with point lookups to one or a few data records within the database. We propose Table-Augmented Generation (TAG), a unified and general-purpose paradigm for answering natural language questions over databases. The TAG model represents a wide range of interactions between the LM and database that have been previously unexplored and creates exciting research opportunities for leveraging the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LMs over data. We systematically develop benchmarks to study the TAG problem and find that standard methods answer no more than 20% of queries correctly, confirming the need for further research in this area. We release code for the benchmark at https://github.com/TAG-Research/TAG-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mina Kaviani, Jurandy Almeida, Fabio L. Verdi</p>
<p>Abstract: The Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) plays a pivotal role in 5G networks, optimizing infrastructure dynamically to ensure high Quality of Service (QoS). Recent research has focused on improving CQI estimation in 5G networks using machine learning. In this field, the selection of the proper loss function is critical for training an accurate model. Two commonly used loss functions are Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Roughly speaking, MSE put more weight on outliers, MAE on the majority. Here, we argue that the Huber loss function is more suitable for CQI prediction, since it combines the benefits of both MSE and MAE. To achieve this, the Huber loss transitions smoothly between MSE and MAE, controlled by a user-defined hyperparameter called delta. However, finding the right balance between sensitivity to small errors (MAE) and robustness to outliers (MSE) by manually choosing the optimal delta is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel loss function, named Residual-based Adaptive Huber Loss (RAHL). In RAHL, a learnable residual is added to the delta, enabling the model to adapt based on the distribution of errors in the data. Our approach effectively balances model robustness against outliers while preserving inlier data precision. The widely recognized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed in conjunction with RAHL, showcasing significantly improved results compared to the aforementioned loss functions. The obtained results affirm the superiority of RAHL, offering a promising avenue for enhanced CQI prediction in 5G networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijiang Liu, Huanrui Yang, Youxin Chen, Rongyu Zhang, Miao Wang, Yuan Du, Li Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in language tasks, especially with supervised fine-tuning after pre-training. However, their substantial memory and computational requirements hinder practical applications. Structural pruning, which reduces less significant weight dimensions, is one solution. Yet, traditional post-hoc pruning often leads to significant performance loss, with limited recovery from further fine-tuning due to reduced capacity. Since the model fine-tuning refines the general and chaotic knowledge in pre-trained models, we aim to incorporate structural pruning with the fine-tuning, and propose the Pruning-Aware Tuning (PAT) paradigm to eliminate model redundancy while preserving the model performance to the maximum extend. Specifically, we insert the innovative Hybrid Sparsification Modules (HSMs) between the Attention and FFN components to accordingly sparsify the upstream and downstream linear modules. The HSM comprises a lightweight operator and a globally shared trainable mask. The lightweight operator maintains a training overhead comparable to that of LoRA, while the trainable mask unifies the channels to be sparsified, ensuring structural pruning. Additionally, we propose the Identity Loss which decouples the transformation and scaling properties of the HSMs to enhance training robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAT excels in both performance and efficiency. For example, our Llama2-7b model with a 25\% pruning ratio achieves 1.33$\times$ speedup while outperforming the LoRA-finetuned model by up to 1.26\% in accuracy with a similar training cost.

<p>Abstract: Adversarial training has been shown to be successful in enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. However, this robustness is accompanied by a significant decline in accuracy on clean data. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Tangent Direction Guided Adversarial Training (TART), that leverages the tangent space of the data manifold to ameliorate the existing adversarial defense algorithms. We argue that training with adversarial examples having large normal components significantly alters the decision boundary and hurts accuracy. TART mitigates this issue by estimating the tangent direction of adversarial examples and allocating an adaptive perturbation limit according to the norm of their tangential component. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work to consider the concept of tangent space and direction in the context of adversarial defense. We validate the effectiveness of TART through extensive experiments on both simulated and benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that TART consistently boosts clean accuracy while retaining a high level of robustness against adversarial attacks. Our findings suggest that incorporating the geometric properties of data can lead to more effective and efficient adversarial training methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Abundant, well-annotated multimodal data in remote sensing are pivotal for aligning complex visual remote sensing (RS) scenes with human language, enabling the development of specialized vision language models across diverse RS interpretation tasks. However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1 million RS images, each accompanied by multiple descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anbai Jiang, Yuchen Shi, Pingyi Fan, Wei-Qiang Zhang, Jia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine anomalous sound detection (ASD) has emerged as one of the most promising applications in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to its unprecedented efficacy in mitigating risks of malfunctions and promoting production efficiency. Previous works mainly investigated the machine ASD task under centralized settings. However, developing the ASD system under decentralized settings is crucial in practice, since the machine data are dispersed in various factories and the data should not be explicitly shared due to privacy concerns. To enable these factories to cooperatively develop a scalable ASD model while preserving their privacy, we propose a novel framework named CoopASD, where each factory trains an ASD model on its local dataset, and a central server aggregates these local models periodically. We employ a pre-trained model as the backbone of the ASD model to improve its robustness and develop specialized techniques to stabilize the model under a completely non-iid and domain shift setting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiaoxin Li, Ruifeng Chen, Peng Wang, Guotao Quan, Yanfeng Du, Dong Liang, Yinsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has been widely used to obtain quantitative elemental composition of imaged subjects for personalized and precise medical diagnosis. Compared with DECT leveraging advanced X-ray source and/or detector technologies, the use of the sequential-scanning data acquisition scheme to implement DECT may make a broader impact on clinical practice because this scheme requires no specialized hardware designs and can be directly implemented into conventional CT systems. However, since the concentration of iodinated contrast agent in the imaged subject varies over time, sequentially scanned data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally inconsistent. As existing material basis image reconstruction approaches assume that the data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally consistent, the violation of this assumption results in inaccurate quantification of material concentration. In this work, we developed sequential-scanning DECT imaging using high temporal resolution image reconstruction and error-compensated material basis image generation, ACCELERATION in short, to address the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially scanned data sets and improve quantification accuracy of material concentration in sequential-scanning DECT. ACCELERATION has been validated and evaluated using numerical simulation data sets generated from clinical human subject exams and experimental human subject studies. Results demonstrated the improvement of quantification accuracy and image quality using ACCELERATION.</p>

While large language models and machine translation have been celebrated as a way to break down barriers, we regard their use as a symptom of linguistic exclusion of scientists and potential readers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanbing Zhu, Bingke Zhu, Zhen Chen, Huan Xu, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment and recognize semantically meaningful regions based on text-based descriptions during inference. A typical solution to address this task is to leverage powerful vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to bridge the gap between open- and close-vocabulary recognition. As VLMs are usually pretrained with low-resolution images (e.g. $224\times224$), most previous methods operate only on downscaled images. We question this design as low resolution features often fail to preserve fine details. Although employing additional image backbones for high-resolution inputs can mitigate this issue, it may also introduce significant computation overhead. Therefore, we propose MROVSeg, a multi-resolution training framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with a single pretrained CLIP backbone, that uses sliding windows to slice the high-resolution input into uniform patches, each matching the input size of the well-trained image encoder. Its key components include a Multi-Res Adapter, which restores the spatial geometry and grasps local-global correspondences across patches by learnable convolutional and scale attention layers. To achieve accurate segmentation, we introduce Multi-grained Masked Attention scheme to aggregate multi-grained semantics by performing cross-attention between object queries and multi-resolution CLIP features within the region of interests. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of MROVSeg on well-established open-vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmarks, particularly for high-resolution inputs, establishing new standards for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nisal Ranasinghe, Yu Xia, Sachith Seneviratne, Saman Halgamuge</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are powerful function approximators, yet their ``black-box" nature often renders them opaque and difficult to interpret. While many post-hoc explanation methods exist, they typically fail to capture the underlying reasoning processes of the networks. A truly interpretable neural network would be trained similarly to conventional models using techniques such as backpropagation, but additionally provide insights into the learned input-output relationships. In this work, we introduce the concept of interpretability pipelineing, to incorporate multiple interpretability techniques to outperform each individual technique. To this end, we first evaluate several architectures that promise such interpretability, with a particular focus on two recent models selected for their potential to incorporate interpretability into standard neural network architectures while still leveraging backpropagation: the Growing Interpretable Neural Network (GINN) and Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN). We analyze the limitations and strengths of each and introduce a novel interpretable neural network GINN-KAN that synthesizes the advantages of both models. When tested on the Feynman symbolic regression benchmark datasets, GINN-KAN outperforms both GINN and KAN. To highlight the capabilities and the generalizability of this approach, we position GINN-KAN as an alternative to conventional black-box networks in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). We expect this to have far-reaching implications in the application of deep learning pipelines in the natural sciences. Our experiments with this interpretable PINN on 15 different partial differential equations demonstrate that GINN-KAN augmented PINNs outperform PINNs with black-box networks in solving differential equations and surpass the capabilities of both GINN and KAN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Despoina Siampou, Jialiang Li, John Krumm, Cyrus Shahabi, Hua Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Encoding geospatial data is crucial for enabling machine learning (ML) models to perform tasks that require spatial reasoning, such as identifying the topological relationships between two different geospatial objects. However, existing encoding methods are limited as they are typically customized to handle only specific types of spatial data, which impedes their applicability across different downstream tasks where multiple data types coexist. To address this, we introduce Poly2Vec, an encoding framework that unifies the modeling of different geospatial objects, including 2D points, polylines, and polygons, irrespective of the downstream task. We leverage the power of the 2D Fourier transform to encode useful spatial properties, such as shape and location, from geospatial objects into fixed-length vectors. These vectors are then inputted into neural network models for spatial reasoning tasks.This unified approach eliminates the need to develop and train separate models for each distinct spatial type. We evaluate Poly2Vec on both synthetic and real datasets of mixed geometry types and verify its consistent performance across several downstream spatial reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Assaf Shmuel, Oren Glickman, Teddy Lazebnik</p>
<p>Abstract: The analysis of tabular datasets is highly prevalent both in scientific research and real-world applications of Machine Learning (ML). Unlike many other ML tasks, Deep Learning (DL) models often do not outperform traditional methods in this area. Previous comparative benchmarks have shown that DL performance is frequently equivalent or even inferior to models such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs). In this study, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark aimed at better characterizing the types of datasets where DL models excel. Although several important benchmarks for tabular datasets already exist, our contribution lies in the variety and depth of our comparison: we evaluate 111 datasets with 20 different models, including both regression and classification tasks. These datasets vary in scale and include both those with and without categorical variables. Importantly, our benchmark contains a sufficient number of datasets where DL models perform best, allowing for a thorough analysis of the conditions under which DL models excel. Building on the results of this benchmark, we train a model that predicts scenarios where DL models outperform alternative methods with 86.1% accuracy (AUC 0.78). We present insights derived from this characterization and compare these findings to previous benchmarks.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14834">Strategic Optimization and Challenges of Large Language Models in Object-Oriented Programming</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zinan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the area of code generation research, the emphasis has transitioned from crafting individual functions to developing class-level method code that integrates contextual information. This shift has brought several benchmarks such as ClassEval and CoderEval, which consider class-level contexts. Nevertheless, the influence of specific contextual factors at the method level remains less explored.
  This research focused on method-level code generation within the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) framework. Based on CoderEval, we devised experiments that varied the extent of contextual information in the prompts, ranging from method-specific to project-wide details. We introduced the innovative metric of "Prompt-Token Cost-Effectiveness" to evaluate the economic viability of incorporating additional contextual layers. Our findings indicate that prompts enriched with method invocation details yield the highest cost-effectiveness. Additionally, our study revealed disparities among Large Language Models (LLMs) regarding error type distributions and the level of assistance they provide to developers. Notably, larger LLMs do not invariably perform better. We also observed that tasks with higher degrees of coupling present more substantial challenges, suggesting that the choice of LLM should be tailored to the task's coupling degree. For example, GPT-4 exhibited improved performance in low-coupling scenarios, whereas GPT-3.5 seemed better suited for tasks with high coupling. By meticulously curating prompt content and selecting the appropriate LLM, developers can optimize code quality while maximizing cost-efficiency during the development process.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present GameNGen, the first game engine powered entirely by a neural model that enables real-time interaction with a complex environment over long trajectories at high quality. GameNGen can interactively simulate the classic game DOOM at over 20 frames per second on a single TPU. Next frame prediction achieves a PSNR of 29.4, comparable to lossy JPEG compression. Human raters are only slightly better than random chance at distinguishing short clips of the game from clips of the simulation. GameNGen is trained in two phases: (1) an RL-agent learns to play the game and the training sessions are recorded, and (2) a diffusion model is trained to produce the next frame, conditioned on the sequence of past frames and actions. Conditioning augmentations enable stable auto-regressive generation over long trajectories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhee Yoon, Sanghyu Yoon, Hankook Lee, Ye Seul Sim, Sungik Choi, Kyungeun Lee, Hye-Seung Cho, Woohyung Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which determines whether a given sample is part of the in-distribution (ID), has recently shown promising results through training with synthetic OOD datasets. Nonetheless, existing methods often produce outliers that are considerably distant from the ID, showing limited efficacy for capturing subtle distinctions between ID and OOD. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Semantic Outlier generation via Nuisance Awareness (SONA), which notably produces challenging outliers by directly leveraging pixel-space ID samples through diffusion models. Our approach incorporates SONA guidance, providing separate control over semantic and nuisance regions of ID samples. Thereby, the generated outliers achieve two crucial properties: (i) they present explicit semantic-discrepant information, while (ii) maintaining various levels of nuisance resemblance with ID. Furthermore, the improved OOD detector training with SONA outliers facilitates learning with a focus on semantic distinctions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving an impressive AUROC of 88% on near-OOD datasets, which surpasses the performance of baseline methods by a significant margin of approximately 6%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Du, Zhuo Li, Pengyu Cheng, Xiang Wan, Anningzhe Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a focal point in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. However, a critical concern is the presence of toxic content within the pre-training corpus of these models, which can lead to the generation of inappropriate outputs. Investigating methods for detecting internal faults in LLMs can help us understand their limitations and improve their security. Existing methods primarily focus on jailbreaking attacks, which involve manually or automatically constructing adversarial content to prompt the target LLM to generate unexpected responses. These methods rely heavily on prompt engineering, which is time-consuming and usually requires specially designed questions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a target-driven attack paradigm that focuses on directly eliciting the target response instead of optimizing the prompts. We introduce the use of another LLM as the detector for toxic content, referred to as ToxDet. Given a target toxic response, ToxDet can generate a possible question and a preliminary answer to provoke the target model into producing desired toxic responses with meanings equivalent to the provided one. ToxDet is trained by interacting with the target LLM and receiving reward signals from it, utilizing reinforcement learning for the optimization process. While the primary focus of the target models is on open-source LLMs, the fine-tuned ToxDet can also be transferred to attack black-box models such as GPT-4o, achieving notable results. Experimental results on AdvBench and HH-Harmless datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in detecting the tendencies of target LLMs to generate harmful responses. This algorithm not only exposes vulnerabilities but also provides a valuable resource for researchers to strengthen their models against such attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of deep learning models has revolutionized various industries over the last decade, leading to a surge in connected devices and infrastructures. However, these models can be tricked into making incorrect predictions with high confidence, leading to disastrous failures and security concerns. To this end, we explore the impact of adversarial attacks on multivariate time-series forecasting and investigate methods to counter them. Specifically, we employ untargeted white-box attacks, namely the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Basic Iterative Method (BIM), to poison the inputs to the training process, effectively misleading the model. We also illustrate the subtle modifications to the inputs after the attack, which makes detecting the attack using the naked eye quite difficult. Having demonstrated the feasibility of these attacks, we develop robust models through adversarial training and model hardening. We are among the first to showcase the transferability of these attacks and defenses by extrapolating our work from the benchmark electricity data to a larger, 10-year real-world data used for predicting the time-to-failure of hard disks. Our experimental results confirm that the attacks and defenses achieve the desired security thresholds, leading to a 72.41% and 94.81% decrease in RMSE for the electricity and hard disk datasets respectively after implementing the adversarial defenses.</p>

<p>Abstract: The VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenges (VoxSRC) were a series of challenges and workshops that ran annually from 2019 to 2023. The challenges primarily evaluated the tasks of speaker recognition and diarisation under various settings including: closed and open training data; as well as supervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised training for domain adaptation. The challenges also provided publicly available training and evaluation datasets for each task and setting, with new test sets released each year. In this paper, we provide a review of these challenges that covers: what they explored; the methods developed by the challenge participants and how these evolved; and also the current state of the field for speaker verification and diarisation. We chart the progress in performance over the five installments of the challenge on a common evaluation dataset and provide a detailed analysis of how each year's special focus affected participants' performance. This paper is aimed both at researchers who want an overview of the speaker recognition and diarisation field, and also at challenge organisers who want to benefit from the successes and avoid the mistakes of the VoxSRC challenges.

<p>Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm was recently proposed as a local learning method to address the limitations of backpropagation (BP), offering biological plausibility along with memory-efficient and highly parallelized computational benefits. However, it suffers from suboptimal performance and poor generalization, largely due to inadequate theoretical support and a lack of effective learning strategies. In this work, we reformulate FF using distance metric learning and propose a distance-forward algorithm (DF) to improve FF performance in supervised vision tasks while preserving its local computational properties, making it competitive for efficient on-chip learning. To achieve this, we reinterpret FF through the lens of centroid-based metric learning and develop a goodness-based N-pair margin loss to facilitate the learning of discriminative features. Furthermore, we integrate layer-collaboration local update strategies to reduce information loss caused by greedy local parameter updates. Our method surpasses existing FF models and other advanced local learning approaches, with accuracies of 99.7\% on MNIST, 88.2\% on CIFAR-10, 59\% on CIFAR-100, 95.9\% on SVHN, and 82.5\% on ImageNette, respectively. Moreover, it achieves comparable performance with less than 40\% memory cost compared to BP training, while exhibiting stronger robustness to multiple types of hardware-related noise, demonstrating its potential for online learning and energy-efficient computation on neuromorphic chips.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated exceptional recognition capabilities in traditional computer vision (CV) tasks. However, existing CV models often suffer a significant decrease in accuracy when confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In contrast to these DNN models, human can maintain a consistently low error rate when facing OOD scenes, partly attributed to the rich prior cognitive knowledge stored in the human brain. Previous OOD generalization researches only focus on the single modal, overlooking the advantages of multimodal learning method. In this paper, we utilize the multimodal learning method to improve the OOD generalization and propose a novel Brain-machine Fusion Learning (BMFL) framework. We adopt the cross-attention mechanism to fuse the visual knowledge from CV model and prior cognitive knowledge from the human brain. Specially, we employ a pre-trained visual neural encoding model to predict the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) from visual features which eliminates the need for the fMRI data collection and pre-processing, effectively reduces the workload associated with conventional BMFL methods. Furthermore, we construct a brain transformer to facilitate the extraction of knowledge inside the fMRI data. Moreover, we introduce the Pearson correlation coefficient maximization regularization method into the training process, which improves the fusion capability with better constrains. Our model outperforms the DINOv2 and baseline models on the ImageNet-1k validation dataset as well as six curated OOD datasets, showcasing its superior performance in diverse scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayomide Odumakinde, Daniel D'souza, Pat Verga, Beyza Ermis, Sara Hooker</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of synthetic data has played a critical role in recent state-of-art breakthroughs. However, overly relying on a single oracle teacher model to generate data has been shown to lead to model collapse and invite propagation of biases. These limitations are particularly evident in multilingual settings, where the absence of a universally effective teacher model that excels across all languages presents significant challenges. In this work, we address these extreme difference by introducing "multilingual arbitrage", which capitalizes on performance variations between multiple models for a given language. To do so, we strategically route samples through a diverse pool of models, each with unique strengths in different languages. Across exhaustive experiments on state-of-art models, our work suggests that arbitrage techniques allow for spectacular gains in performance that far outperform relying on a single teacher. In particular, compared to the best single teacher, we observe gains of up to 56.5% improvement in win rates averaged across all languages when switching to multilingual arbitrage. We observe the most significant gains for the least resourced languages in our pool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyun Huang, Jianxu Mao, Yaonan Wang, Junfei Yi, Ziming Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rapid expansion of model sizes has led to large-scale pre-trained models demonstrating remarkable capabilities. Consequently, there has been a trend towards increasing the scale of models. However, this trend introduces significant challenges, including substantial computational costs of training and transfer to downstream tasks. To address these issues, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been introduced. These methods optimize large-scale pre-trained models for specific tasks by fine-tuning a select group of parameters. Among these PEFT methods, adapter-based and prompt-based methods are the primary techniques. Specifically, in the field of visual fine-tuning, adapters gain prominence over prompts because of the latter's relatively weaker performance and efficiency. Under the circumstances, we refine the widely-used Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) method, proposing Cross Visual Prompt Tuning (CVPT). CVPT calculates cross-attention between the prompt tokens and the embedded tokens, which allows us to compute the semantic relationship between them and conduct the fine-tuning of models exactly to adapt visual tasks better. Furthermore, we introduce the weight-sharing mechanism to initialize the parameters of cross-attention, which avoids massive learnable parameters from cross-attention and enhances the representative capability of cross-attention. We conduct comprehensive testing across 25 datasets and the result indicates that CVPT significantly improves VPT's performance and efficiency in visual tasks. For example, on the VTAB-1K benchmark, CVPT outperforms VPT over 4% in average accuracy, rivaling the advanced adapter-based methods in performance and efficiency. Our experiments confirm that prompt-based methods can achieve exceptional results in visual fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Liu, Li Liu, Yawen Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Even in the era of large models, one of the well-known issues in continual learning (CL) is catastrophic forgetting, which is significantly challenging when the continual data stream exhibits a long-tailed distribution, termed as Long-Tailed Continual Learning (LTCL). Existing LTCL solutions generally require the label distribution of the data stream to achieve re-balance training. However, obtaining such prior information is often infeasible in real scenarios since the model should learn without pre-identifying the majority and minority classes. To this end, we propose a novel Prior-free Balanced Replay (PBR) framework to learn from long-tailed data stream with less forgetting. Concretely, motivated by our experimental finding that the minority classes are more likely to be forgotten due to the higher uncertainty, we newly design an uncertainty-guided reservoir sampling strategy to prioritize rehearsing minority data without using any prior information, which is based on the mutual dependence between the model and samples. Additionally, we incorporate two prior-free components to further reduce the forgetting issue: (1) Boundary constraint is to preserve uncertain boundary supporting samples for continually re-estimating task boundaries. (2) Prototype constraint is to maintain the consistency of learned class prototypes along with training. Our approach is evaluated on three standard long-tailed benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance to existing CL methods and previous SOTA LTCL approach in both task- and class-incremental learning settings, as well as ordered- and shuffled-LTCL settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Chen, Anqi Chen, Bingkun Jiang, Mohammad S. Obaidat, Ni Li, Xinyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognition refers to the function of information perception and processing, which is the fundamental psychological essence of human beings. It is responsible for reasoning and decision-making, while its evaluation is significant for the aviation domain in mitigating potential safety risks. Existing studies tend to use varied methods for cognitive state evaluation yet have limitations in timeliness, generalisation, and interpretability. Accordingly, this study adopts brain functional connectivity with electroencephalography signals to capture associations in brain regions across multiple subjects for evaluating real-time cognitive states. Specifically, a virtual reality-based flight platform is constructed with multi-screen embedded. Three distinctive cognitive tasks are designed and each has three degrees of difficulty. Thirty subjects are acquired for analysis and evaluation. The results are interpreted through different perspectives, including inner-subject and cross-subject for task-wise and gender-wise underlying brain functional connectivity. Additionally, this study incorporates questionnaire-based, task performance-based, and physiological measure-based approaches to fairly label the trials. A multi-class cognitive state evaluation is further conducted with the active brain connections. Benchmarking results demonstrate that the identified brain regions have considerable influences in cognition, with a multi-class accuracy rate of 95.83% surpassing existing studies. The derived findings bring significance to understanding the dynamic relationships among human brain functional regions, cross-subject cognitive behaviours, and decision-making, which have promising practical application values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojun Jiang, Zhenguo Sun, Yu Sun, Ning Jia, Meng Li, Shaqi Luo, Shiji Song, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiac ultrasound probe guidance aims to help novices adjust the 6-DOF probe pose to obtain high-quality sectional images. Cardiac ultrasound faces two major challenges: (1) the inherently complex structure of the heart, and (2) significant individual variations. Previous works have only learned the population-averaged 2D and 3D structures of the heart rather than personalized cardiac structural features, leading to a performance bottleneck. Clinically, we observed that sonographers adjust their understanding of a patient's cardiac structure based on prior scanning sequences, thereby modifying their scanning strategies. Inspired by this, we propose a sequence-aware self-supervised pre-training method. Specifically, our approach learns personalized 2D and 3D cardiac structural features by predicting the masked-out images and actions in a scanning sequence. We hypothesize that if the model can predict the missing content it has acquired a good understanding of the personalized cardiac structure. In the downstream probe guidance task, we also introduced a sequence modeling approach that models individual cardiac structural information based on the images and actions from historical scan data, enabling more accurate navigation decisions. Experiments on a large-scale dataset with 1.36 million samples demonstrated that our proposed sequence-aware paradigm can significantly reduce navigation errors, with translation errors decreasing by 15.90% to 36.87% and rotation errors decreasing by 11.13% to 20.77%, compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Zhang, Xiaoqian Zhang, Jiakai Wang, Yuancheng Yang, Taiying Peng, Chao Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) has significantly advanced the clinical practice of pathology. Despite the progress made, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a promising paradigm within CPath, continues to face challenges, particularly related to incomplete information utilization. Existing frameworks, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), attention, and selective scan space state sequential model (SSM), lack sufficient flexibility and scalability in fusing diverse features, and cannot effectively fuse diverse features. Additionally, current approaches do not adequately exploit order-related and order-independent features, resulting in suboptimal utilization of sequence information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MIL framework called Mamba2MIL. Our framework utilizes the state space duality model (SSD) to model long sequences of patches of whole slide images (WSIs), which, combined with weighted feature selection, supports the fusion processing of more branching features and can be extended according to specific application needs. Moreover, we introduce a sequence transformation method tailored to varying WSI sizes, which enhances sequence-independent features while preserving local sequence information, thereby improving sequence information utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mamba2MIL surpasses state-of-the-art MIL methods. We conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets, achieving improvements in nearly all performance metrics. Specifically, on the NSCLC dataset, Mamba2MIL achieves a binary tumor classification AUC of 0.9533 and an accuracy of 0.8794. On the BRACS dataset, it achieves a multiclass classification AUC of 0.7986 and an accuracy of 0.4981. The code is available at https://github.com/YuqiZhang-Buaa/Mamba2MIL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Du, Huishuai Zhang, Dongyan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the hallucination in generative question answering (GQA) where the answer can not be derived from the document, we propose a novel evidence-enhanced triplet generation framework, EATQA, encouraging the model to predict all the combinations of (Question, Evidence, Answer) triplet by flipping the source pair and the target label to understand their logical relationships, i.e., predict Answer(A), Question(Q), and Evidence(E) given a QE, EA, and QA pairs, respectively. Furthermore, we bridge the distribution gap to distill the knowledge from evidence in inference stage. Our framework ensures the model to learn the logical relation between query, evidence and answer, which simultaneously improves the evidence generation and query answering. In this paper, we apply EATQA to LLama and it outperforms other LLMs-based methods and hallucination mitigation approaches on two challenging GQA benchmarks. Further analysis shows that our method not only keeps prior knowledge within LLM, but also mitigates hallucination and generates faithful answers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chan Hsu, Jun-Ting Wu, Yihuang Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and inferencing Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) are vital for developing personalized treatment recommendations. Many state-of-the-art approaches achieve inspiring performance in estimating HTE on benchmark datasets or simulation studies. However, the indirect predicting manner and complex model architecture reduce the interpretability of these approaches. To mitigate the gap between predictive performance and heterogeneity interpretability, we introduce the Causal Rule Forest (CRF), a novel approach to learning hidden patterns from data and transforming the patterns into interpretable multi-level Boolean rules. By training the other interpretable causal inference models with data representation learned by CRF, we can reduce the predictive errors of these models in estimating HTE and CATE, while keeping their interpretability for identifying subgroups that a treatment is more effective. Our experiments underscore the potential of CRF to advance personalized interventions and policies, paving the way for future research to enhance its scalability and application across complex causal inference challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: The escalating prevalence of cannabis use poses a significant public health challenge globally. In the U.S., cannabis use is more prevalent among emerging adults (EAs) (ages 18-25) than any other age group, with legalization in the multiple states contributing to a public perception that cannabis is less risky than in prior decades. To address this growing concern, we developed MiWaves, a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to optimize the delivery of personalized intervention prompts to reduce cannabis use among EAs. MiWaves leverages domain expertise and prior data to tailor the likelihood of delivery of intervention messages. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the algorithm's design, including key decisions and experimental outcomes. The finalized MiWaves RL algorithm was deployed in a clinical trial from March to May 2024.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pavan Uttej Ravva, Behdokht Kiafar, Pinar Kullu, Jicheng Li, Anjana Bhat, Roghayeh Leila Barmaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by significant challenges in social interaction and comprehending communication signals. Recently, therapeutic interventions for ASD have increasingly utilized Deep learning powered-computer vision techniques to monitor individual progress over time. These models are trained on private, non-public datasets from the autism community, creating challenges in comparing results across different models due to privacy-preserving data-sharing issues. This work introduces MMASD+. MMASD+ consists of diverse data modalities, including 3D-Skeleton, 3D Body Mesh, and Optical Flow data. It integrates the capabilities of Yolov8 and Deep SORT algorithms to distinguish between the therapist and children, addressing a significant barrier in the original dataset. Additionally, a Multimodal Transformer framework is proposed to predict 11 action types and the presence of ASD. This framework achieves an accuracy of 95.03% for predicting action types and 96.42% for predicting ASD presence, demonstrating over a 10% improvement compared to models trained on single data modalities. These findings highlight the advantages of integrating multiple data modalities within the Multimodal Transformer framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: The general capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) highly rely on the composition and selection on extensive pretraining datasets, treated as commercial secrets by several institutions. To mitigate this issue, we open-source the details of a universally applicable data processing pipeline and validate its effectiveness and potential by introducing a competitive LLM baseline. Specifically, the data processing pipeline consists of broad collection to scale up and reweighting to improve quality. We then pretrain a 7B model BaichuanSEED with 3T tokens processed by our pipeline without any deliberate downstream task-related optimization, followed by an easy but effective supervised fine-tuning stage. BaichuanSEED demonstrates consistency and predictability throughout training and achieves comparable performance on comprehensive benchmarks with several commercial advanced large language models, such as Qwen1.5 and Llama3. We also conduct several heuristic experiments to discuss the potential for further optimization of downstream tasks, such as mathematics and coding.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel post-processing algorithm that is both model-agnostic and does not require the sensitive attribute at test time. In addition, our algorithm is explicitly designed to enforce minimal changes between biased and debiased predictions; a property that, while highly desirable, is rarely prioritized as an explicit objective in fairness literature. Our approach leverages a multiplicative factor applied to the logit value of probability scores produced by a black-box classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through empirical evaluations, comparing its performance against other four debiasing algorithms on two widely used datasets in fairness research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Rutherford, Michael Beukman, Timon Willi, Bruno Lacerda, Nick Hawes, Jakob Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: What data or environments to use for training to improve downstream performance is a longstanding and very topical question in reinforcement learning. In particular, Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) methods have gained recent attention as their adaptive curricula enable agents to be robust to in- and out-of-distribution tasks. We ask to what extent these methods are themselves robust when applied to a novel setting, closely inspired by a real-world robotics problem. Surprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art UED methods either do not improve upon the na\"{i}ve baseline of Domain Randomisation (DR), or require substantial hyperparameter tuning to do so. Our analysis shows that this is due to their underlying scoring functions failing to predict intuitive measures of ``learnability'', i.e., in finding the settings that the agent sometimes solves, but not always. Based on this, we instead directly train on levels with high learnability and find that this simple and intuitive approach outperforms UED methods and DR in several binary-outcome environments, including on our domain and the standard UED domain of Minigrid. We further introduce a new adversarial evaluation procedure for directly measuring robustness, closely mirroring the conditional value at risk (CVaR). We open-source all our code and present visualisations of final policies here: https://github.com/amacrutherford/sampling-for-learnability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baijiong Lin, Weisen Jiang, Pengguang Chen, Shu Liu, Ying-Cong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task dense scene understanding, which trains a model for multiple dense prediction tasks, has a wide range of application scenarios. Capturing long-range dependency and enhancing cross-task interactions are crucial to multi-task dense prediction. In this paper, we propose MTMamba++, a novel architecture for multi-task scene understanding featuring with a Mamba-based decoder. It contains two types of core blocks: self-task Mamba (STM) block and cross-task Mamba (CTM) block. STM handles long-range dependency by leveraging state-space models, while CTM explicitly models task interactions to facilitate information exchange across tasks. We design two types of CTM block, namely F-CTM and S-CTM, to enhance cross-task interaction from feature and semantic perspectives, respectively. Experiments on NYUDv2, PASCAL-Context, and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MTMamba++ over CNN-based and Transformer-based methods.

<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations have gained prominence as a powerful framework for capturing complex data modalities, encompassing a wide range from 3D shapes to images and audio. Within the realm of 3D shape representation, Neural Signed Distance Functions (SDF) have demonstrated remarkable potential in faithfully encoding intricate shape geometry. However, learning SDFs from sparse 3D point clouds in the absence of ground truth supervision remains a very challenging task. While recent methods rely on smoothness priors to regularize the learning, our method introduces a regularization term that leverages adversarial samples around the shape to improve the learned SDFs. Through extensive experiments and evaluations, we illustrate the efficacy of our proposed method, highlighting its capacity to improve SDF learning with respect to baselines and the state-of-the-art using synthetic and real data.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research paper introduces an innovative word-level Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model specifically designed for digital Urdu text recognition. Utilizing transformer-based architectures and attention mechanisms, the model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of approximately 160,000 Urdu text images, achieving a character error rate (CER) of 0.178, which highlights its superior accuracy in recognizing Urdu characters. The model's strength lies in its unique architecture, incorporating the permuted autoregressive sequence (PARSeq) model, which allows for context-aware inference and iterative refinement by leveraging bidirectional context information to enhance recognition accuracy. Furthermore, its capability to handle a diverse range of Urdu text styles, fonts, and variations enhances its applicability in real-world scenarios. Despite its promising results, the model has some limitations, such as difficulty with blurred images, non-horizontal orientations, and overlays of patterns, lines, or other text, which can occasionally lead to suboptimal performance. Additionally, trailing or following punctuation marks can introduce noise into the recognition process. Addressing these challenges will be a focus of future research, aiming to refine the model further, explore data augmentation techniques, optimize hyperparameters, and integrate contextual improvements for more accurate and efficient Urdu text recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charlotte Rodriguez, Laura Degioanni, Laetitia Kameni, Richard Vidal, Giovanni Neglia</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring, understanding, and optimizing the energy consumption of Machine Learning (ML) are various reasons why it is necessary to evaluate the energy usage of ML. However, there exists no universal tool that can answer this question for all use cases, and there may even be disagreement on how to evaluate energy consumption for a specific use case. Tools and methods are based on different approaches, each with their own advantages and drawbacks, and they need to be mapped out and explained in order to select the most suitable one for a given situation. We address this challenge through two approaches. First, we conduct a systematic literature review of all tools and methods that permit to evaluate the energy consumption of ML (both at training and at inference), irrespective of whether they were originally designed for machine learning or general software. Second, we develop and use an experimental protocol to compare a selection of these tools and methods. The comparison is both qualitative and quantitative on a range of ML tasks of different nature (vision, language) and computational complexity. The systematic literature review serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the array of tools and methods used in evaluating energy consumption of ML, for various use cases going from basic energy monitoring to consumption optimization. Two open-source repositories are provided for further exploration. The first one contains tools that can be used to replicate this work or extend the current review. The second repository houses the experimental protocol, allowing users to augment the protocol with new ML computing tasks and additional energy evaluation tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghazal Alinezhad Noghre, Armin Danesh Pazho, Hamed Tabkhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce PoseWatch, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. PoseWatch features an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that enhances the representation of human motion over time, which is also beneficial for broader human behavior analysis tasks. The architecture's core, a Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PoseWatch consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD. This work not only demonstrates the efficacy of PoseWatch but also highlights the potential of integrating Natural Language Processing techniques with computer vision to advance human behavior analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Numerous studies have highlighted that atypical brain development, particularly during infancy and toddlerhood, is linked to an increased likelihood of being diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental condition, such as autism. Accurate brain tissue segmentations for morphological analysis are essential in numerous infant studies. However, due to ongoing white matter (WM) myelination changing tissue contrast in T1- and T2-weighted images, automatic tissue segmentation in 6-month infants is particularly difficult. On the other hand, manual labelling by experts is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we propose the first 8-tissue segmentation pipeline for six-month-old infant brains. This pipeline utilizes domain adaptation (DA) techniques to leverage our longitudinal data, including neonatal images segmented with the neonatal Developing Human Connectome Project structural pipeline. Our pipeline takes raw 6-month images as inputs and generates the 8-tissue segmentation as outputs, forming an end-to-end segmentation pipeline. The segmented tissues include WM, gray matter (GM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), ventricles, cerebellum, basal ganglia, brainstem, and hippocampus/amygdala. Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) and Attention U-Net were employed to achieve the image contrast transformation between neonatal and 6-month images and perform tissue segmentation on the synthesized 6-month images (neonatal images with 6-month intensity contrast), respectively. Moreover, we incorporated the segmentation outputs from Infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Toolbox (iBEAT) and another Attention U-Net to further enhance the performance and construct the end-to-end segmentation pipeline. Our evaluation with real 6-month images achieved a DICE score of 0.92, an HD95 of 1.6, and an ASSD of 0.42.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown high agreement with human raters across a variety of tasks, demonstrating potential to ease the challenges of human data collection. In computational social science (CSS), researchers are increasingly leveraging LLM annotations to complement slow and expensive human annotations. Still, guidelines for collecting and using LLM annotations, without compromising the validity of downstream conclusions, remain limited. We introduce Confidence-Driven Inference: a method that combines LLM annotations and LLM confidence indicators to strategically select which human annotations should be collected, with the goal of producing accurate statistical estimates and provably valid confidence intervals while reducing the number of human annotations needed. Our approach comes with safeguards against LLM annotations of poor quality, guaranteeing that the conclusions will be both valid and no less accurate than if we only relied on human annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Confidence-Driven Inference over baselines in statistical estimation tasks across three CSS settings--text politeness, stance, and bias--reducing the needed number of human annotations by over 25% in each. Although we use CSS settings for demonstration, Confidence-Driven Inference can be used to estimate most standard quantities across a broad range of NLP problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA) is a critical tool for assessing retinal vascular dynamics and aiding in the diagnosis of eye diseases. However, its invasive nature and less accessibility compared to Color Fundus (CF) images pose significant challenges. Current CF to FFA translation methods are limited to static generation. In this work, we pioneer dynamic FFA video generation from static CF images. We introduce an autoregressive GAN for smooth, memory-saving frame-by-frame FFA synthesis. To enhance the focus on dynamic lesion changes in FFA regions, we design a knowledge mask based on clinical experience. Leveraging this mask, our approach integrates innovative knowledge mask-guided techniques, including knowledge-boosted attention, knowledge-aware discriminators, and mask-enhanced patchNCE loss, aimed at refining generation in critical areas and addressing the pixel misalignment challenge. Our method achieves the best FVD of 1503.21 and PSNR of 11.81 compared to other common video generation approaches. Human assessment by an ophthalmologist confirms its high generation quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucheng Jiang, Yijia Shao, Dekun Ma, Sina J. Semnani, Monica S. Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: While language model (LM)-powered chatbots and generative search engines excel at answering concrete queries, discovering information in the terrain of unknown unknowns remains challenging for users. To emulate the common educational scenario where children/students learn by listening to and participating in conversations of their parents/teachers, we create Collaborative STORM (Co-STORM). Unlike QA systems that require users to ask all the questions, Co-STORM lets users observe and occasionally steer the discourse among several LM agents. The agents ask questions on the user's behalf, allowing the user to discover unknown unknowns serendipitously. To facilitate user interaction, Co-STORM assists users in tracking the discourse by organizing the uncovered information into a dynamic mind map, ultimately generating a comprehensive report as takeaways. For automatic evaluation, we construct the WildSeek dataset by collecting real information-seeking records with user goals. Co-STORM outperforms baseline methods on both discourse trace and report quality. In a further human evaluation, 70% of participants prefer Co-STORM over a search engine, and 78% favor it over a RAG chatbot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxiong Wang, Daniele Paliotta, Avner May, Alexander M. Rush, Tri Dao</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best instruction-tuned linear RNN model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cl\'elia de Mulatier, Matteo Marsili</p>
<p>Abstract: Finding the model that best describes a high-dimensional dataset is a daunting task, even more so if one aims to consider all possible high-order patterns of the data, going beyond pairwise models. For binary data, we show that this task becomes feasible when restricting the search to a family of simple models, that we call Minimally Complex Models (MCMs). MCMs are maximum entropy models that have interactions of arbitrarily high order grouped into independent components of minimal complexity. They are simple in information-theoretic terms, which means they can only fit well certain types of data patterns and are therefore easy to falsify. We show that Bayesian model selection restricted to these models is computationally feasible and has many advantages. First, the model evidence, which balances goodness-of-fit against complexity, can be computed efficiently without any parameter fitting, enabling very fast explorations of the space of MCMs. Second, the family of MCMs is invariant under gauge transformations, which can be used to develop a representation-independent approach to statistical modeling. For small systems (up to 15 variables), combining these two results allows us to select the best MCM among all, even though the number of models is already extremely large. For larger systems, we propose simple heuristics to find optimal MCMs in reasonable times. Besides, inference and sampling can be performed without any computational effort. Finally, because MCMs have interactions of any order, they can reveal the presence of important high-order dependencies in the data, providing a new approach to explore high-order dependencies in complex systems. We apply our method to synthetic data and real-world examples, illustrating how MCMs portray the structure of dependencies among variables in a simple manner, extracting falsifiable predictions on symmetries and invariance from the data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peihua Mai, Ran Yan, Zhe Huang, Youjia Yang, Yan Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language understanding by capturing hidden semantics in vector space. This process enriches the value of text embeddings for various downstream tasks, thereby fostering the Embedding-as-a-Service (EaaS) business model. However, the risk of privacy leakage due to direct text transmission to servers remains a critical concern. To address this, we introduce Split-N-Denoise (SnD), an private inference framework that splits the model to execute the token embedding layer on the client side at minimal computational cost. This allows the client to introduce noise prior to transmitting the embeddings to the server, and subsequently receive and denoise the perturbed output embeddings for downstream tasks. Our approach is designed for the inference stage of LLMs and requires no modifications to the model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate SnD's effectiveness in optimizing the privacy-utility tradeoff across various LLM architectures and diverse downstream tasks. The results reveal an improvement in performance under the same privacy budget compared to the baselines by over 10\% on average, offering clients a privacy-preserving solution for local privacy protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Unggi Lee, Minji Jeon, Yunseo Lee, Gyuri Byun, Yoorim Son, Jaeyoon Shin, Hongkyu Ko, Hyeoncheol Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Art appreciation is vital in nurturing critical thinking and emotional intelligence among learners. However, traditional art appreciation education has often been hindered by limited access to art resources, especially for disadvantaged students, and an imbalanced emphasis on STEM subjects in mainstream education. In response to these challenges, recent technological advancements have paved the way for innovative solutions. This study explores the application of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in art appreciation education, focusing on developing LLaVA-Docent, a model that leverages these advancements. Our approach involved a comprehensive literature review and consultations with experts in the field, leading to developing a robust data framework. Utilizing this framework, we generated a virtual dialogue dataset that was leveraged by GPT-4. This dataset was instrumental in training the MLLM, named LLaVA-Docent. Six researchers conducted quantitative and qualitative evaluations of LLaVA-Docent to assess its effectiveness, benchmarking it against the GPT-4 model in a few-shot setting. The evaluation process revealed distinct strengths and weaknesses of the LLaVA-Docent model. Our findings highlight the efficacy of LLaVA-Docent in enhancing the accessibility and engagement of art appreciation education. By harnessing the potential of MLLMs, this study makes a significant contribution to the field of art education, proposing a novel methodology that reimagines the way art appreciation is taught and experienced.</p>

<p>Abstract: In domain-specific applications, GPT-4, augmented with precise prompts or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shows notable potential but faces the critical tri-lemma of performance, cost, and data privacy. High performance requires sophisticated processing techniques, yet managing multiple agents within a complex workflow often proves costly and challenging. To address this, we introduce the PEER (Plan, Execute, Express, Review) multi-agent framework. This systematizes domain-specific tasks by integrating precise question decomposition, advanced information retrieval, comprehensive summarization, and rigorous self-assessment. Given the concerns of cost and data privacy, enterprises are shifting from proprietary models like GPT-4 to custom models, striking a balance between cost, security, and performance. We developed industrial practices leveraging online data and user feedback for efficient model tuning. This study provides best practice guidelines for applying multi-agent systems in domain-specific problem-solving and implementing effective agent tuning strategies. Our empirical studies, particularly in the financial question-answering domain, demonstrate that our approach achieves 95.0% of GPT-4's performance, while effectively managing costs and ensuring data privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunjie He, Daniel Hernandez, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Bo Xiong, Yuqicheng Zhu, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Query embedding approaches answer complex logical queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) by computing and operating on low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and queries. However, current query embedding models heavily rely on excessively parameterized neural networks and cannot explain the knowledge learned from the graph. We propose a novel query embedding method, AConE, which explains the knowledge learned from the graph in the form of $SROI^-$ description logic axioms while being more parameter-efficient than most existing approaches. AConE associates queries to a $SROI^-$ description logic concept. Every $SROI^-$ concept is embedded as a cone in complex vector space, and each $SROI^-$ relation is embedded as a transformation that rotates and scales cones. We show theoretically that AConE can learn $SROI^-$ axioms, and defines an algebra whose operations correspond one to one to $SROI^-$ description logic concept constructs. Our empirical study on multiple query datasets shows that AConE achieves superior results over previous baselines with fewer parameters. Notably on the WN18RR dataset, AConE achieves significant improvement over baseline models. We provide comprehensive analyses showing that the capability to represent axioms positively impacts the results of query answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungjun Han, Wongyung Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and the complexity of rapid decision-making in critical care settings pose significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have shown promise, the integration of large language models (LLMs) offers new possibilities for enhancing triage accuracy and clinical decision-making. This study presents an LLM-driven CDSS designed to assist ED physicians and nurses in patient triage, treatment planning, and overall emergency care management.
  We developed a multi-agent CDSS utilizing Llama-3-70b as the base LLM, orchestrated by CrewAI and Langchain. The system comprises four AI agents emulating key ED roles: Triage Nurse, Emergency Physician, Pharmacist, and ED Coordinator. It incorporates the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS) for triage assessment and integrates with the RxNorm API for medication management.
  The model was evaluated using the Asclepius dataset, with performance assessed by a clinical emergency medicine specialist. The CDSS demonstrated high accuracy in triage decision-making compared to the baseline of a single-agent system. Furthermore, the system exhibited strong performance in critical areas, including primary diagnosis, critical findings identification, disposition decision-making, treatment planning, and resource allocation.
  Our multi-agent CDSS demonstrates significant potential for supporting comprehensive emergency care management. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI technologies, this system offers a scalable and adaptable tool that could enhance emergency medical care delivery, potentially alleviating ED overcrowding and improving patient outcomes. This work contributes to the growing field of AI applications in emergency medicine and offers a promising direction for future research and clinical implementation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guojin Chen, Haoyu Yang, Haoxing Ren, Bei Yu, David Z. Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical proximity correction (OPC) is crucial for pushing the boundaries of semiconductor manufacturing and enabling the continued scaling of integrated circuits. While pixel-based OPC, termed as inverse lithography technology (ILT), has gained research interest due to its flexibility and precision. Its complexity and intricate features can lead to challenges in mask writing, increased defects, and higher costs, hence hindering widespread industrial adoption. In this paper, we propose DiffOPC, a differentiable OPC framework that enjoys the virtue of both edge-based OPC and ILT. By employing a mask rule-aware gradient-based optimization approach, DiffOPC efficiently guides mask edge segment movement during mask optimization, minimizing wafer error by propagating true gradients from the cost function back to the mask edges. Our approach achieves lower edge placement error while reducing manufacturing cost by half compared to state-of-the-art OPC techniques, bridging the gap between the high accuracy of pixel-based OPC and the practicality required for industrial adoption, thus offering a promising solution for advanced semiconductor manufacturing.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, numerous new LLMs have emerged, each possessing domain-specific expertise. This proliferation has highlighted the need for quick, high-quality, and cost-effective LLM query response methods. Yet, no single LLM exists to efficiently balance this trilemma.

To address this challenge, we present PolyRouter, a non-monolithic LLM querying system that seamlessly integrates various LLM experts into a single query interface and dynamically routes incoming queries to the most high-performant expert based on query's requirements. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that when compared to standalone expert models, PolyRouter improves query efficiency by up to 40%, and leads to significant cost reductions of up to 30%, while maintaining or enhancing model performance by up to 10%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianyu Wang, Meng Wang, Huazhu Fu, Daoqiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Model intellectual property (IP) protection has attracted growing attention as science and technology advancements stem from human intellectual labor and computational expenses. Ensuring IP safety for trainers and owners is of utmost importance, particularly in domains where ownership verification and applicability authorization are required. A notable approach to safeguarding model IP involves proactively preventing the use of well-trained models of authorized domains from unauthorized domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel Compact Un-transferable Pyramid Isolation Domain (CUPI-Domain) which serves as a barrier against illegal transfers from authorized to unauthorized domains. Drawing inspiration from human transitive inference and learning abilities, the CUPI-Domain is designed to obstruct cross-domain transfers by emphasizing the distinctive style features of the authorized domain. This emphasis leads to failure in recognizing irrelevant private style features on unauthorized domains. To this end, we propose novel CUPI-Domain generators, which select features from both authorized and CUPI-Domain as anchors. Then, we fuse the style features and semantic features of these anchors to generate labeled and style-rich CUPI-Domain. Additionally, we design external Domain-Information Memory Banks (DIMB) for storing and updating labeled pyramid features to obtain stable domain class features and domain class-wise style features. Based on the proposed whole method, the novel style and discriminative loss functions are designed to effectively enhance the distinction in style and discriminative features between authorized and unauthorized domains, respectively. Moreover, we provide two solutions for utilizing CUPI-Domain based on whether the unauthorized domain is known: target-specified CUPI-Domain and target-free CUPI-Domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: The standard approach to answering an identifiable causal-effect query (e.g., $P(Y|do(X)$) when given a causal diagram and observational data is to first generate an estimand, or probabilistic expression over the observable variables, which is then evaluated using the observational data. In this paper, we propose an alternative paradigm for answering causal-effect queries over discrete observable variables. We propose to instead learn the causal Bayesian network and its confounding latent variables directly from the observational data. Then, efficient probabilistic graphical model (PGM) algorithms can be applied to the learned model to answer queries. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this \emph{model completion} learning approach can be more effective than estimand approaches, particularly for larger models in which the estimand expressions become computationally difficult.
  We illustrate our method's potential using a benchmark collection of Bayesian networks and synthetically generated causal models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davood Karimi, Simon K. Warfield, Ali Gholipour</p>
<p>Abstract: It is highly desirable to know how uncertain a model's predictions are, especially for models that are complex and hard to understand as in deep learning. Although there has been a growing interest in using deep learning methods in diffusion-weighted MRI, prior works have not addressed the issue of model uncertainty. Here, we propose a deep learning method to estimate the diffusion tensor and compute the estimation uncertainty. Data-dependent uncertainty is computed directly by the network and learned via loss attenuation. Model uncertainty is computed using Monte Carlo dropout. We also propose a new method for evaluating the quality of predicted uncertainties. We compare the new method with the standard least-squares tensor estimation and bootstrap-based uncertainty computation techniques. Our experiments show that when the number of measurements is small the deep learning method is more accurate and its uncertainty predictions are better calibrated than the standard methods. We show that the estimation uncertainties computed by the new method can highlight the model's biases, detect domain shift, and reflect the strength of noise in the measurements. Our study shows the importance and practical value of modeling prediction uncertainties in deep learning-based diffusion MRI analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianyu Wang, Meng Wang, Daoqiang Zhang, Huazhu Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has attracted considerable attention, which transfers knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain. Reducing inter-domain differences has always been a crucial factor to improve performance in UDA, especially for tasks where there is a large gap between source and target domains. To this end, we propose a novel style-aware feature fusion method (SAFF) to bridge the large domain gap and transfer knowledge while alleviating the loss of class-discriminative information. Inspired by the human transitive inference and learning ability, a novel style-aware self-intermediate domain (SSID) is investigated to link two seemingly unrelated concepts through a series of intermediate auxiliary synthesized concepts. Specifically, we propose a novel learning strategy of SSID, which selects samples from both source and target domains as anchors, and then randomly fuses the object and style features of these anchors to generate labeled and style-rich intermediate auxiliary features for knowledge transfer. Moreover, we design an external memory bank to store and update specified labeled features to obtain stable class features and class-wise style features. Based on the proposed memory bank, the intra- and inter-domain loss functions are designed to improve the class recognition ability and feature compatibility, respectively. Meanwhile, we simulate the rich latent feature space of SSID by infinite sampling and the convergence of the loss function by mathematical theory. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly used domain adaptive benchmarks to evaluate the proposed SAFF, and the experimental results show that the proposed SAFF can be easily combined with different backbone networks and obtain better performance as a plug-in-plug-out module.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihyeon Lee, Dain Kim, Doohae Jung, Boseop Kim, Kyoung-Woon On</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning, which offers substantial advantages over fine-tuning, is predominantly observed in decoder-only models, while encoder-decoder (i.e., seq2seq) models excel in methods that rely on weight updates. Recently, a few studies have demonstrated the feasibility of few-shot learning with seq2seq models; however, this has been limited to tasks that align well with the seq2seq architecture, such as summarization and translation. Inspired by these initial studies, we provide a first-ever extensive experiment comparing the in-context few-shot learning capabilities of decoder-only and encoder-decoder models on a broad range of tasks. Furthermore, we propose two methods to more effectively elicit in-context learning ability in seq2seq models: objective-aligned prompting and a fusion-based approach. Remarkably, our approach outperforms a decoder-only model that is six times larger and exhibits significant performance improvements compared to conventional seq2seq models across a variety of settings. We posit that, with the right configuration and prompt design, seq2seq models can be highly effective few-shot learners for a wide spectrum of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijia Zhang, Le Zhang, Jindong Han, Hao Liu, Yanjie Fu, Jingbo Zhou, Yu Mei, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is crucial for the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), playing a pivotal role in modern urban traffic management. Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently. Extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ASeer compared with twelve competitive baselines across six metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoi Do, Duong Nguyen, Hoa Nguyen, Long Tran-Thanh, Nguyen-Hoang Tran, Quoc-Viet Pham</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores Large Batch Training techniques using layer-wise adaptive scaling ratio (LARS) across diverse settings, uncovering insights. LARS algorithms with warm-up tend to be trapped in sharp minimizers early on due to redundant ratio scaling. Additionally, a fixed steep decline in the latter phase restricts deep neural networks from effectively navigating early-phase sharp minimizers. Building on these findings, we propose Time Varying LARS (TVLARS), a novel algorithm that replaces warm-up with a configurable sigmoid-like function for robust training in the initial phase. TVLARS promotes gradient exploration early on, surpassing sharp optimizers and gradually transitioning to LARS for robustness in later phases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TVLARS consistently outperforms LARS and LAMB in most cases, with up to 2\% improvement in classification scenarios. Notably, in all self-supervised learning cases, TVLARS dominates LARS and LAMB with performance improvements of up to 10\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz Schauer, Marcel Wien\"obst</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of inferring a Bayesian network structure (directed acyclic graph, DAG for short), we devise a non-reversible continuous time Markov chain, the ``Causal Zig-Zag sampler'', that targets a probability distribution over classes of observationally equivalent (Markov equivalent) DAGs. The classes are represented as completed partially directed acyclic graphs (CPDAGs). The non-reversible Markov chain relies on the operators used in Chickering's Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) and is endowed with a momentum variable, which improves mixing significantly as we show empirically. The possible target distributions include posterior distributions based on a prior over DAGs and a Markov equivalent likelihood. We offer an efficient implementation wherein we develop new algorithms for listing, counting, uniformly sampling, and applying possible moves of the GES operators, all of which significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art run-time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Li, Dejian Lai, Xiaoqian Jiang, Kai Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Liver transplantation often faces fairness challenges across subgroups defined by sensitive attributes such as age group, gender, and race/ethnicity. Machine learning models for outcome prediction can introduce additional biases. Therefore, we introduce Fairness through the Equitable Rate of Improvement in Multitask Learning (FERI) algorithm for fair predictions of graft failure risk in liver transplant patients. FERI constrains subgroup loss by balancing learning rates and preventing subgroup dominance in the training process. Our results show that FERI maintained high predictive accuracy with AUROC and AUPRC comparable to baseline models. More importantly, FERI demonstrated an ability to improve fairness without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, for the gender, FERI reduced the demographic parity disparity by 71.74%, and for the age group, it decreased the equalized odds disparity by 40.46%. Therefore, the FERI algorithm advanced fairness-aware predictive modeling in healthcare and provides an invaluable tool for equitable healthcare systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Tian, Guangsheng Zhang, Bo Liu, Tianqing Zhu, Ming Ding, Wanlei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies have developed fairness methods for biased models that exhibit discriminatory behaviors towards specific subgroups. While these models have shown promise in achieving fair predictions, recent research has identified their potential vulnerability to score-based membership inference attacks (MIAs). In these attacks, adversaries can infer whether a particular data sample was used during training by analyzing the model's prediction scores. However, our investigations reveal that these score-based MIAs are ineffective when targeting fairness-enhanced models in binary classifications. The attack models trained to launch the MIAs degrade into simplistic threshold models, resulting in lower attack performance. Meanwhile, we observe that fairness methods often lead to prediction performance degradation for the majority subgroups of the training data. This raises the barrier to successful attacks and widens the prediction gaps between member and non-member data. Building upon these insights, we propose an efficient MIA method against fairness-enhanced models based on fairness discrepancy results (FD-MIA). It leverages the difference in the predictions from both the original and fairness-enhanced models and exploits the observed prediction gaps as attack clues. We also explore potential strategies for mitigating privacy leakages. Extensive experiments validate our findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Levin, Randall Correll, Takanori Ide, Takafumi Suzuki, Takaho Saito, Alan Arai</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to be effective in producing approximate solutions to some vehicle routing problems (VRPs), especially when using policies generated by encoder-decoder attention mechanisms. While these techniques have been quite successful for relatively simple problem instances, there are still under-researched and highly complex VRP variants for which no effective RL method has been demonstrated. In this work we focus on one such VRP variant, which contains multiple trucks and multi-leg routing requirements. In these problems, demand is required to move along sequences of nodes, instead of just from a start node to an end node. With the goal of making deep RL a viable strategy for real-world industrial-scale supply chain logistics, we develop new extensions to existing encoder-decoder attention models which allow them to handle multiple trucks and multi-leg routing requirements. Our models have the advantage that they can be trained for a small number of trucks and nodes, and then embedded into a large supply chain to yield solutions for larger numbers of trucks and nodes. We test our approach on a real supply chain environment arising in the operations of Japanese automotive parts manufacturer Aisin Corporation, and find that our algorithm outperforms Aisin's previous best solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atith Gandhi, Raj Sanjay Shah, Vijay Marupudi, Sashank Varma</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks often suffer from catastrophic interference (CI): performance on previously learned tasks drops off significantly when learning a new task. This contrasts strongly with humans, who can continually learn new tasks without appreciably forgetting previous tasks. Prior work has explored various techniques for mitigating CI and promoting continual learning such as regularization, rehearsal, generative replay, and context-specific components. This paper takes a different approach, one guided by cognitive science research showing that in naturalistic environments, the probability of encountering a task decreases as a power-law of the time since it was last performed. We argue that techniques for mitigating CI should be compared against the intrinsic mitigation in simulated naturalistic learning environments. Thus, we evaluate the extent of the natural mitigation of CI when training models in power-law environments, similar to those humans face. Our results show that natural rehearsal environments are better at mitigating CI than existing methods, calling for the need for better evaluation processes. The benefits of this environment include simplicity, rehearsal that is agnostic to both tasks and models, and the lack of a need for extra neural circuitry. In addition, we explore popular mitigation techniques in power-law environments to create new baselines for continual learning research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kausik Lakkaraju, Vedant Khandelwal, Biplav Srivastava, Forest Agostinelli, Hengtao Tang, Prathamjeet Singh, Dezhi Wu, Matt Irvin, Ashish Kundu</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform education with its power of uncovering insights from massive data about student learning patterns. However, ethical and trustworthy concerns of AI have been raised but are unsolved. Prominent ethical issues in high school AI education include data privacy, information leakage, abusive language, and fairness. This paper describes technological components that were built to address ethical and trustworthy concerns in a multi-modal collaborative platform (called ALLURE chatbot) for high school students to collaborate with AI to solve the Rubik's cube. In data privacy, we want to ensure that the informed consent of children, parents, and teachers, is at the center of any data that is managed. Since children are involved, language, whether textual, audio, or visual, is acceptable both from users and AI and the system can steer interaction away from dangerous situations. In information management, we also want to ensure that the system, while learning to improve over time, does not leak information about users from one group to another.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Niu, Jianming Hu, Guyue Zhou, Xianyuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: The burgeoning fields of robot learning and embodied AI have triggered an increasing demand for large quantities of data. However, collecting sufficient unbiased data from the target domain remains a challenge due to costly data collection processes and stringent safety requirements. Consequently, researchers often resort to data from easily accessible source domains, such as simulation and laboratory environments, for cost-effective data acquisition and rapid model iteration. Nevertheless, the environments and embodiments of these source domains can be quite different from their target domain counterparts, underscoring the need for effective cross-domain policy transfer approaches. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of existing cross-domain policy transfer methods. Through a nuanced categorization of domain gaps, we encapsulate the overarching insights and design considerations of each problem setting. We also provide a high-level discussion about the key methodologies used in cross-domain policy transfer problems. Lastly, we summarize the open challenges that lie beyond the capabilities of current paradigms and discuss potential future directions in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agus Hartoyo, Jan Argasi\'nski, Aleksandra Trenk, Kinga Przybylska, Anna B{\l}asiak, Alessandro Crimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Covariance and Hessian matrices have been analyzed separately in the literature for classification problems. However, integrating these matrices has the potential to enhance their combined power in improving classification performance. We present a novel approach that combines the eigenanalysis of a covariance matrix evaluated on a training set with a Hessian matrix evaluated on a deep learning model to achieve optimal class separability in binary classification tasks. Our approach is substantiated by formal proofs that establish its capability to maximize between-class mean distance and minimize within-class variances, particularly under ideal data conditions such as isotropy around class means and dominant leading eigenvalues. By projecting data into the combined space of the most relevant eigendirections from both matrices, we achieve optimal class separability as per the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) criteria. Empirical validation across neural and health datasets consistently supports our theoretical framework and demonstrates that our method outperforms established methods. Our method stands out by addressing both LDA criteria, unlike PCA and the Hessian method, which predominantly emphasize one criterion each. This comprehensive approach captures intricate patterns and relationships, enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, through the utilization of both LDA criteria, our method outperforms LDA itself by leveraging higher-dimensional feature spaces, in accordance with Cover's theorem, which favors linear separability in higher dimensions. Our method also surpasses kernel-based methods and manifold learning techniques in performance. Additionally, our approach sheds light on complex DNN decision-making, rendering them comprehensible within a 2D space.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of Recommender Systems (RecSys), new algorithms frequently claim state-of-the-art performance based on evaluations over a limited set of arbitrarily selected datasets. However, this approach may fail to holistically reflect their effectiveness due to the significant impact of dataset characteristics on algorithm performance. Addressing this deficiency, this paper introduces a novel benchmarking methodology to facilitate a fair and robust comparison of RecSys algorithms, thereby advancing evaluation practices. By utilizing a diverse set of $30$ open datasets, including two introduced in this work, and evaluating $11$ collaborative filtering algorithms across $9$ metrics, we critically examine the influence of dataset characteristics on algorithm performance. We further investigate the feasibility of aggregating outcomes from multiple datasets into a unified ranking. Through rigorous experimental analysis, we validate the reliability of our methodology under the variability of datasets, offering a benchmarking strategy that balances quality and computational demands. This methodology enables a fair yet effective means of evaluating RecSys algorithms, providing valuable guidance for future research endeavors.</p>

However, creating automatic stance labeling systems requires the manual annotation of stances, which is both tedious and resource-intensive. This paper introduces a stance labeling method that makes use of weak signals of sentence tone, then consolidating these signals with a Data Programmingmodel for the final stance label. In a time of international conflict, understanding the public opinion towards the country's military is crucial for recruitment. We present DIVERSE, a dataset involve stances towards YouTube videos of the US military (Dataset available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10493803).

<p>Abstract: Machine learning models often make predictions based on biased features such as gender, race, and other social attributes, posing significant fairness risks, especially in societal applications, such as hiring, banking, and criminal justice. Traditional approaches to addressing this issue involve retraining or fine-tuning neural networks with fairness-aware optimization objectives. However, these methods can be impractical due to significant computational resources, complex industrial tests, and the associated CO2 footprint. Additionally, regular users often fail to fine-tune models because they lack access to model parameters In this paper, we introduce the Inference-Time Rule Eraser (Eraser), a novel method designed to address fairness concerns by removing biased decision-making rules from deployed models during inference without altering model weights. We begin by establishing a theoretical foundation for modifying model outputs to eliminate biased rules through Bayesian analysis. Next, we present a specific implementation of Eraser that involves two stages: (1) distilling the biased rules from the deployed model into an additional patch model, and (2) removing these biased rules from the output of the deployed model during inference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its superior performance in addressing fairness concerns in AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghong Li, Xiuzhuang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: While existing depression prediction methods based on deep learning show promise, their practical application is hindered by the lack of trustworthiness, as these deep models are often deployed as black box models, leaving us uncertain on the confidence of their predictions. For high-risk clinical applications like depression prediction, uncertainty quantification is essential in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce conformal depression prediction (CDP), a depression prediction method with uncertainty quantification based on conformal prediction (CP), giving valid confidence intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees for the model predictions. CDP is a plug-and-play module that requires neither model retraining nor an assumption about the depression data distribution. As CDP provides only an average coverage guarantee across all inputs rather than per-input performance guarantee, we further propose CDP-ACC, an improved conformal prediction with approximate conditional coverage. CDP-ACC firstly estimates the prediction distribution through neighborhood relaxation, and then introduces a conformal score function by constructing nested sequences, so as to provide a tighter prediction interval adaptive to specific input. We empirically demonstrate the application of CDP in uncertainty-aware facial depression prediction, as well as the effectiveness and superiority of CDP-ACC on the AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014 datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nhung Bui, Xinyang Lu, Rachael Hwee Ling Sim, See-Kiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread applications of neural networks (NNs) trained on personal data, machine unlearning has become increasingly important for enabling individuals to exercise their personal data ownership, particularly the "right to be forgotten" from trained NNs. Since retraining is computationally expensive, we seek approximate unlearning algorithms for NNs that return identical models to the retrained oracle. While Newton's method has been successfully used to approximately unlearn linear models, we observe that adapting it for NN is challenging due to degenerate Hessians that make computing Newton's update impossible. Additionally, we show that when coupled with popular techniques to resolve the degeneracy, Newton's method often incurs offensively large norm updates and empirically degrades model performance post-unlearning. To address these challenges, we propose CureNewton's method, a principle approach that leverages cubic regularization to handle the Hessian degeneracy effectively. The added regularizer eliminates the need for manual finetuning and affords a natural interpretation within the unlearning context. Experiments across different models and datasets show that our method can achieve competitive unlearning performance to the state-of-the-art algorithm in practical unlearning settings, while being theoretically justified and efficient in running time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeinab Sherkatghanad, Moloud Abdar, Mohammadreza Bakhtyari, Pawel Plawiak, Vladimir Makarenkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time augmentation (TTA) is a well-known technique employed during the testing phase of computer vision tasks. It involves aggregating multiple augmented versions of input data. Combining predictions using a simple average formulation is a common and straightforward approach after performing TTA. This paper introduces a novel framework for optimizing TTA, called BayTTA (Bayesian-based TTA), which is based on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). First, we generate a prediction list associated with different variations of the input data created through TTA. Then, we use BMA to combine predictions weighted by the respective posterior probabilities. Such an approach allows one to take into account model uncertainty, and thus to enhance the predictive performance of the related machine learning or deep learning model. We evaluate the performance of BayTTA on various public data, including three medical image datasets comprising skin cancer, breast cancer, and chest X-ray images and two well-known gene editing datasets, CRISPOR and GUIDE-seq. Our experimental results indicate that BayTTA can be effectively integrated into state-of-the-art deep learning models used in medical image analysis as well as into some popular pre-trained CNN models such as VGG-16, MobileNetV2, DenseNet201, ResNet152V2, and InceptionRes-NetV2, leading to the enhancement in their accuracy and robustness performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Shi, Weili Song, Xinting Zhang, Jiahe Shi, Cuicui Luo, Xiang Ao, Hamid Arian, Luis Seco</p>
<p>Abstract: The complexity of financial data, characterized by its variability and low signal-to-noise ratio, necessitates advanced methods in quantitative investment that prioritize both performance and interpretability.Transitioning from early manual extraction to genetic programming, the most advanced approach in the alpha factor mining domain currently employs reinforcement learning to mine a set of combination factors with fixed weights. However, the performance of resultant alpha factors exhibits inconsistency, and the inflexibility of fixed factor weights proves insufficient in adapting to the dynamic nature of financial markets. To address this issue, this paper proposes a two-stage formulaic alpha generating framework AlphaForge, for alpha factor mining and factor combination. This framework employs a generative-predictive neural network to generate factors, leveraging the robust spatial exploration capabilities inherent in deep learning while concurrently preserving diversity. The combination model within the framework incorporates the temporal performance of factors for selection and dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to each component alpha factor. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms contemporary benchmarks in formulaic alpha factor mining. Furthermore, our model exhibits a notable enhancement in portfolio returns within the realm of quantitative investment and real money investment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Skanda Koppula, Ignacio Rocco, Yi Yang, Joe Heyward, Jo\~ao Carreira, Andrew Zisserman, Gabriel Brostow, Carl Doersch</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new benchmark, TAPVid-3D, for evaluating the task of long-range Tracking Any Point in 3D (TAP-3D). While point tracking in two dimensions (TAP) has many benchmarks measuring performance on real-world videos, such as TAPVid-DAVIS, three-dimensional point tracking has none. To this end, leveraging existing footage, we build a new benchmark for 3D point tracking featuring 4,000+ real-world videos, composed of three different data sources spanning a variety of object types, motion patterns, and indoor and outdoor environments. To measure performance on the TAP-3D task, we formulate a collection of metrics that extend the Jaccard-based metric used in TAP to handle the complexities of ambiguous depth scales across models, occlusions, and multi-track spatio-temporal smoothness. We manually verify a large sample of trajectories to ensure correct video annotations, and assess the current state of the TAP-3D task by constructing competitive baselines using existing tracking models. We anticipate this benchmark will serve as a guidepost to improve our ability to understand precise 3D motion and surface deformation from monocular video. Code for dataset download, generation, and model evaluation is available at https://tapvid3d.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngkyung Seo, Yoonseok Heo, Jun-Seok Koh, Du-Seong Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-session dialog system, it is essential to continuously update the memory as the session progresses. Simply accumulating memory can make it difficult to focus on the content of the conversation for inference due to the limited input sentence size. Therefore, efficient and accurate conversation model that is capable of managing memory to reflect the conversation history continuously is necessary. This paper presents a conversation model that efficiently manages memory as sessions progress and incorporates this into the model to reflect the conversation history accurately with 3 methodologies: SFT, DPO and DPO with SFT model. Our model using DPO algorithm shows an improvement about 0.0591 of BERTScore in memory accuracy, and the rate of responses reflecting the memory increased as well. Also, response generation performance enhanced about 4.292 in fluency, 3.935 in coherence, and 2.896 in consistency. This paper describes a training method that yields better performance than models with more than twice the parameter size, even when the model size is smaller. Thus, our model demonstrates efficiency not only in terms of accuracy but also in resource utilization.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09096">STD-PLM: Understanding Both Spatial and Temporal Properties of Spatial-Temporal Data with PLM</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> YiHeng Huang, Xiaowei Mao, Shengnan Guo, Yubin Chen, Junfeng Shen, Tiankuo Li, Youfang Lin, Huaiyu Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation are important for real-world intelligent systems. Most existing methods are tailored for individual forecasting or imputation tasks but are not designed for both. Additionally, they are less effective for zero-shot and few-shot learning. While pre-trained language model (PLM) have exhibited strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities across various tasks, including few-shot and zero-shot learning, their applications in spatial-temporal data understanding has been constrained by insufficient modeling of complex correlations such as the temporal correlations, spatial connectivity, non-pairwise and high-order spatial-temporal correlations within data. In this paper, we propose STD-PLM for understanding both spatial and temporal properties of \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{D}ata with \underline{PLM}, which is capable of implementing both spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation tasks. STD-PLM understands spatial-temporal correlations via explicitly designed spatial and temporal tokenizers. Topology-aware node embeddings are designed for PLM to comprehend and exploit the topology structure of data in inductive manner. Furthermore, to mitigate the efficiency issues introduced by the PLM, we design a sandglass attention module (SGA) combined with a specific constrained loss function, which significantly improves the model's efficiency while ensuring performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STD-PLM exhibits competitive performance and generalization capabilities across the forecasting and imputation tasks on various datasets. Moreover, STD-PLM achieves promising results on both few-shot and zero-shot tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranjan Sapkota, Zhichao Meng, Martin Churuvija, Xiaoqiang Du, Zenghong Ma, Manoj Karkee</p>
<p>Abstract: This study performed an extensive evaluation of the performances of all configurations of YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10 object detection algorithms for fruitlet (of green fruit) detection in commercial orchards. Additionally, this research performed and validated in-field counting of fruitlets using an iPhone and machine vision sensors in 5 different apple varieties (Scifresh, Scilate, Honeycrisp, Cosmic crisp & Golden delicious). This comprehensive investigation of total 17 different configurations (5 for YOLOv8, 6 for YOLOv9 and 6 for YOLOv10) revealed that YOLOv9 outperforms YOLOv10 and YOLOv8 in terms of mAP@50, while YOLOv10x outperformed all 17 configurations tested in terms of precision and recall. Specifically, YOLOv9 Gelan-e achieved the highest mAP@50 of 0.935, outperforming YOLOv10n's 0.921 and YOLOv8s's 0.924. In terms of precision, YOLOv10x achieved the highest precision of 0.908, indicating superior object identification accuracy compared to other configurations tested (e.g. YOLOv9 Gelan-c with a precision of 0.903 and YOLOv8m with 0.897. In terms of recall, YOLOv10s achieved the highest in its series (0.872), while YOLOv9 Gelan m performed the best among YOLOv9 configurations (0.899), and YOLOv8n performed the best among the YOLOv8 configurations (0.883). Meanwhile, three configurations of YOLOv10: YOLOv10b, YOLOv10l, and YOLOv10x achieved superior post-processing speeds of 1.5 milliseconds, outperforming all other configurations within the YOLOv9 and YOLOv8 families. Specifically, YOLOv9 Gelan-e recorded a post-processing speed of 1.9 milliseconds, and YOLOv8m achieved 2.1 milliseconds. Furthermore, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest inference speed among all configurations tested, achieving a processing time of 4.1 milliseconds while YOLOv9 Gelan-t and YOLOv10n also demonstrated comparatively slower inference speeds of 9.3 ms and 5.5 ms, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timo Wilm, Philipp Normann, Felix Stepprath</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces MultiTRON, an approach that adapts Pareto front approximation techniques to multi-objective session-based recommender systems using a transformer neural network. Our approach optimizes trade-offs between key metrics such as click-through and conversion rates by training on sampled preference vectors. A significant advantage is that after training, a single model can access the entire Pareto front, allowing it to be tailored to meet the specific requirements of different stakeholders by adjusting an additional input vector that weights the objectives. We validate the model's performance through extensive offline and online evaluation. For broader application and research, the source code is made available at https://github.com/otto-de/MultiTRON. The results confirm the model's ability to manage multiple recommendation objectives effectively, offering a flexible tool for diverse business needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jichuan Zhang, Wei Li, Shuang Cheng, Ya-Li Li, Shengjin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to sequentially learn new classes, while maintaining the capability to locate and identify old ones. As the training data arrives with annotations only with new classes, IOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Prior methodologies mainly tackle the forgetting issue through knowledge distillation and exemplar replay, ignoring the conflict between limited model capacity and increasing knowledge. In this paper, we explore \textit{dynamic object queries} for incremental object detection built on Transformer architecture. We propose the \textbf{Dy}namic object \textbf{Q}uery-based \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{TR}ansformer (DyQ-DETR), which incrementally expands the model representation ability to achieve stability-plasticity tradeoff. First, a new set of learnable object queries are fed into the decoder to represent new classes. These new object queries are aggregated with those from previous phases to adapt both old and new knowledge well. Second, we propose the isolated bipartite matching for object queries in different phases, based on disentangled self-attention. The interaction among the object queries at different phases is eliminated to reduce inter-class confusion. Thanks to the separate supervision and computation over object queries, we further present the risk-balanced partial calibration for effective exemplar replay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyQ-DETR significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, with limited parameter overhead. Code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: In today's digital era, holding algorithmic thinking (AT) skills is crucial, not only in computer science-related fields. These abilities enable individuals to break down complex problems into more manageable steps and create a sequence of actions to solve them. To address the increasing demand for AT assessments in educational settings and the limitations of current methods, this paper introduces the virtual Cross Array Task (CAT), a digital adaptation of an unplugged assessment activity designed to evaluate algorithmic skills in Swiss compulsory education. This tool offers scalable and automated assessment, reducing human involvement and mitigating potential data collection errors. The platform features gesture-based and visual block-based programming interfaces, ensuring its usability for diverse learners, further supported by multilingual capabilities. To evaluate the virtual CAT platform, we conducted a pilot evaluation in Switzerland involving a heterogeneous group of students. The findings show the platform's usability, proficiency and suitability for assessing AT skills among students of diverse ages, development stages, and educational backgrounds, as well as the feasibility of large-scale data collection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Lai, Chuanhao Liu, Shihui Sheng, Zhiqiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection in autonomous driving is critical yet challenging due to occlusions, varying object sizes, and complex urban environments. This paper introduces the KAN-RCBEVDepth method, an innovative approach aimed at enhancing 3D object detection by fusing multimodal sensor data from cameras, LiDAR, and millimeter-wave radar. Our unique Bird's Eye View-based approach significantly improves detection accuracy and efficiency by seamlessly integrating diverse sensor inputs, refining spatial relationship understanding, and optimizing computational procedures. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques across multiple detection metrics, achieving a higher Mean Distance AP (0.389, 23\% improvement), a better ND Score (0.485, 17.1\% improvement), and a faster Evaluation Time (71.28s, 8\% faster). Additionally, the KAN-RCBEVDepth method significantly reduces errors compared to BEVDepth, with lower Transformation Error (0.6044, 13.8\% improvement), Scale Error (0.2780, 2.6\% improvement), Orientation Error (0.5830, 7.6\% improvement), Velocity Error (0.4244, 28.3\% improvement), and Attribute Error (0.2129, 3.2\% improvement). These findings suggest that our method offers enhanced accuracy, reliability, and efficiency, making it well-suited for dynamic and demanding autonomous driving scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meghdad Dehghan, Jie JW Wu, Fatemeh H. Fard, Ali Ouni</p>
<p>Abstract: [Context] Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown good performance in several software development-related tasks such as program repair, documentation, code refactoring, debugging, and testing. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Merging LLMs and adapters has shown promising results for various natural language domains and tasks, enabling the use of the learned models and adapters without additional training for a new task. [Objective] This research proposes continual merging and empirically studies the capabilities of merged adapters in Code LLMs, specially for the Automated Program Repair (APR) task. The goal is to gain insights into whether and how merging task-specific adapters can affect the performance of APR. [Method] In our framework, MergeRepair, we plan to merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter for the APR task. Particularly, we will employ two main merging scenarios for all three techniques, (i) merging using equal-weight averaging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance; and (ii) our proposed approach, continual merging, in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters and the order and weight of merged adapters matter. By exploratory study of merging techniques, we will investigate the improvement and generalizability of merged adapters for APR. Through continual merging, we will explore the capability of merged adapters and the effect of task order, as it occurs in real-world software projects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Ma, Haitao Mao, Jingzhe Liu, Zhehua Zhang, Chunlin Feng, Yu Song, Yihan Shao, Yao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning~(SSL) is essential to obtain foundation models in NLP and CV domains via effectively leveraging knowledge in large-scale unlabeled data. The reason for its success is that a suitable SSL design can help the model to follow the neural scaling law, i.e., the performance consistently improves with increasing model and dataset sizes. However, it remains a mystery whether existing SSL in the graph domain can follow the scaling behavior toward building Graph Foundation Models~(GFMs) with large-scale pre-training. In this study, we examine whether existing graph SSL techniques can follow the neural scaling behavior with the potential to serve as the essential component for GFMs. Our benchmark includes comprehensive SSL technique implementations with analysis conducted on both the conventional SSL setting and many new settings adopted in other domains. Surprisingly, despite the SSL loss continuously decreasing, no existing graph SSL techniques follow the neural scaling behavior on the downstream performance. The model performance only merely fluctuates on different data scales and model scales. Instead of the scales, the key factors influencing the performance are the choices of model architecture and pretext task design. This paper examines existing SSL techniques for the feasibility of Graph SSL techniques in developing GFMs and opens a new direction for graph SSL design with the new evaluation prototype. Our code implementation is available online to ease reproducibility on https://github.com/GraphSSLScaling/GraphSSLScaling.</p>

<p>Abstract: The constraint satisfaction problem asks to decide if a set of constraints over a relational structure $\mathcal{A}$ is satisfiable (CSP$(\mathcal{A})$). We consider CSP$(\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B})$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is a structure and $\mathcal{B}$ is an alien structure, and analyse its (parameterized) complexity when at most $k$ alien constraints are allowed. We establish connections and obtain transferable complexity results to several well-studied problems that previously escaped classification attempts. Our novel approach, utilizing logical and algebraic methods, yields an FPT versus pNP dichotomy for arbitrary finite structures and sharper dichotomies for Boolean structures and first-order reducts of $(\mathbb{N},=)$ (equality CSPs), together with many partial results for general $\omega$-categorical structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoon Tae Park, Ting Xu, Mohamed Anany</p>
<p>Abstract: Uplift modeling is essential for optimizing marketing strategies by selecting individuals likely to respond positively to specific marketing campaigns. This importance escalates in multi-treatment marketing campaigns, where diverse treatment is available and we may want to assign the customers to treatment that can make the most impact. While there are existing approaches with convenient frameworks like Causalml, there are potential spaces to enhance the effect of uplift modeling in multi treatment cases. This paper introduces a novel approach to uplift modeling in multi-treatment campaigns, leveraging score ranking and calibration techniques to improve overall performance of the marketing campaign. We review existing uplift models, including Meta Learner frameworks (S, T, X), and their application in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we delve into insights from multi-treatment studies to highlight the complexities and potential advancements in the field. Our methodology incorporates Meta-Learner calibration and a scoring rank-based offer selection strategy. Extensive experiment results with real-world datasets demonstrate the practical benefits and superior performance of our approach. The findings underscore the critical role of integrating score ranking and calibration techniques in refining the performance and reliability of uplift predictions, thereby advancing predictive modeling in marketing analytics and providing actionable insights for practitioners seeking to optimize their campaign strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in the collection and analysis of sequential educational data have brought time series analysis to a pivotal position in educational research, highlighting its essential role in facilitating data-driven decision-making. However, there is a lack of comprehensive summaries that consolidate these advancements. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to provide a comprehensive review of time series analysis techniques specifically within the educational context. We begin by exploring the landscape of educational data analytics, categorizing various data sources and types relevant to education. We then review four prominent time series methods-forecasting, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection-illustrating their specific application points in educational settings. Subsequently, we present a range of educational scenarios and applications, focusing on how these methods are employed to address diverse educational tasks, which highlights the practical integration of multiple time series methods to solve complex educational problems. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on future directions, including personalized learning analytics, multimodal data fusion, and the role of large language models (LLMs) in educational time series. The contributions of this paper include a detailed taxonomy of educational data, a synthesis of time series techniques with specific educational applications, and a forward-looking perspective on emerging trends and future research opportunities in educational analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Awsafur Rahman, Zaber Ibn Abdul Hakim, Najibul Haque Sarker, Bishmoy Paul, Shaikh Anowarul Fattah</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent surge in AI-generated songs presents exciting possibilities and challenges. While these tools democratize music creation, they also necessitate the ability to distinguish between human-composed and AI-generated songs for safeguarding artistic integrity and content curation. Existing research and datasets in fake song detection only focus on singing voice deepfake detection (SVDD), where the vocals are AI-generated but the instrumental music is sourced from real songs. However, this approach is inadequate for contemporary end-to-end AI-generated songs where all components (vocals, lyrics, music, and style) could be AI-generated. Additionally, existing datasets lack lyrics-music diversity, long-duration songs, and open fake songs. To address these gaps, we introduce SONICS, a novel dataset for end-to-end Synthetic Song Detection (SSD), comprising over 97k songs with over 49k synthetic songs from popular platforms like Suno and Udio. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of modeling long-range temporal dependencies in songs for effective authenticity detection, an aspect overlooked in existing methods. To capture these patterns, we propose a novel model, SpecTTTra, that is up to 3 times faster and 6 times more memory efficient compared to popular CNN and Transformer-based models while maintaining competitive performance. Finally, we offer both AI-based and Human evaluation benchmarks, addressing another deficiency in current research.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we aim to enhance the performance of SwiftBrush, a prominent one-step text-to-image diffusion model, to be competitive with its multi-step Stable Diffusion counterpart. Initially, we explore the quality-diversity trade-off between SwiftBrush and SD Turbo: the former excels in image diversity, while the latter excels in image quality. This observation motivates our proposed modifications in the training methodology, including better weight initialization and efficient LoRA training. Moreover, our introduction of a novel clamped CLIP loss enhances image-text alignment and results in improved image quality. Remarkably, by combining the weights of models trained with efficient LoRA and full training, we achieve a new state-of-the-art one-step diffusion model, achieving an FID of 8.14 and surpassing all GAN-based and multi-step Stable Diffusion models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laurenz Reichardt, Luca Uhr, Oliver Wasenm\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR data of urban scenarios poses unique challenges, such as heterogeneous characteristics and inherent class imbalance. Therefore, large-scale datasets are necessary to apply deep learning methods. Instance augmentation has emerged as an efficient method to increase dataset diversity. However, current methods require the time-consuming curation of 3D models or costly manual data annotation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Text3DAug, a novel approach leveraging generative models for instance augmentation. Text3DAug does not depend on labeled data and is the first of its kind to generate instances and annotations from text. This allows for a fully automated pipeline, eliminating the need for manual effort in practical applications. Additionally, Text3DAug is sensor agnostic and can be applied regardless of the LiDAR sensor used. Comprehensive experimental analysis on LiDAR segmentation, detection and novel class discovery demonstrates that Text3DAug is effective in supplementing existing methods or as a standalone method, performing on par or better than established methods, however while overcoming their specific drawbacks. The code is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and latent diffusion models (LDMs) have profoundly impacted diverse sectors, including music. This comprehensive review examines state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models and foundation models in music, spanning from representation learning, generative learning and multimodal learning. We first contextualise the significance of music in various industries and trace the evolution of AI in music. By delineating the modalities targeted by foundation models, we discover many of the music representations are underexplored in FM development. Then, emphasis is placed on the lack of versatility of previous methods on diverse music applications, along with the potential of FMs in music understanding, generation and medical application. By comprehensively exploring the details of the model pre-training paradigm, architectural choices, tokenisation, finetuning methodologies and controllability, we emphasise the important topics that should have been well explored, like instruction tuning and in-context learning, scaling law and emergent ability, as well as long-sequence modelling etc. A dedicated section presents insights into music agents, accompanied by a thorough analysis of datasets and evaluations essential for pre-training and downstream tasks. Finally, by underscoring the vital importance of ethical considerations, we advocate that following research on FM for music should focus more on such issues as interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, and copyright issues. The paper offers insights into future challenges and trends on FMs for music, aiming to shape the trajectory of human-AI collaboration in the music realm.</p>
