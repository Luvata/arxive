<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohit Kaushik, Eva Kaushik</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that combines nonlinear dynamics, perceptual psychophysics and high frequency haptic rendering to enhance realism in surgical simulation. The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods. We end by discussing the potential impact on surgical training and VR, based medical education, as well as sketching future work toward closed, loop neural feedback in haptic interfaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryosuke Kohita, Seiichiro Yoshioka</p>
<p>Abstract: Memes are a popular element of modern web communication, used not only as static artifacts but also as interactive replies within conversations. While computational research has focused on analyzing the intrinsic properties of memes, the dynamic and contextual use of memes to create humor remains an understudied area of web science. To address this gap, we introduce the Meme Reply Selection task and present MaMe-Re (Manga Meme Reply Benchmark), a benchmark of 100,000 human-annotated pairs (500,000 total annotations from 2,325 unique annotators) consisting of openly licensed Japanese manga panels and social media posts. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (1) large language models (LLMs) show preliminary evidence of capturing complex social cues such as exaggeration, moving beyond surface-level semantic matching; (2) the inclusion of visual information does not improve performance, revealing a gap between understanding visual content and effectively using it for contextual humor; (3) while LLMs can match human judgments in controlled settings, they struggle to distinguish subtle differences in wit among semantically similar candidates. These findings suggest that selecting contextually humorous replies remains an open challenge for current models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barak Or</p>
<p>Abstract: Hybrid reasoning systems that combine learned components with model-based inference are increasingly deployed in tool-augmented decision loops, yet their runtime behavior under partial observability and sustained evidence mismatch remains poorly understood. In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time. These results emphasize runtime stability as a system-level requirement for reliable reasoning under uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaaustaaub Shankar, Kelly Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) balance predictive accuracy and interpretability, but manually configuring their structure is challenging. We propose using the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II to automatically optimize GAMs, jointly minimizing prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty that captures sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty. Experiments on the California Housing dataset show that NSGA-II discovers GAMs that outperform baseline LinearGAMs in accuracy or match performance with substantially lower complexity. The resulting models are simpler, smoother, and exhibit narrower confidence intervals, enhancing interpretability. This framework provides a general approach for automated optimization of transparent, high-performing models. The code can be found at https://github.com/KaaustaaubShankar/GeneticAdditiveModels.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15878">IT-OSE: Exploring Optimal Sample Size for Industrial Data Augmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingchun Sun, Rongqiang Zhao, Zhennan Huang, Songyu Ding, Jie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In industrial scenarios, data augmentation is an effective approach to improve model performance. However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%. Furthermore, practicality experiments demonstrate that the IT-OSE exhibits generality across representative sensor-based industrial scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15879">BamaER: A Behavior-Aware Memory-Augmented Model for Exercise Recommendation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Yang, Yuhao Jiang, Rui Wang, Jipeng Guo, Yejiang Wang, Xinghe Cheng, Zezheng Wu, Jiapu Wang, Jingwei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Exercise recommendation focuses on personalized exercise selection conditioned on students' learning history, personal interests, and other individualized characteristics. Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length sequence segmentation limits the incorporation of early learning experiences, thereby hindering the modeling of long-term dependencies and the accurate estimation of knowledge mastery. To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage. Experiments on five real-world educational datasets show that BamaER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiao Qian, Jiaxu Liu, Zewei Xia, Song Chen, Chao Xu, Shengze Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a powerful paradigm for flow reconstruction, seamlessly integrating sparse velocity measurements with the governing Navier-Stokes equations to recover complete velocity and latent pressure fields. However, scaling such models to large spatiotemporal domains is hindered by computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities. In this work, we propose a robust distributed PINNs framework designed for efficient flow reconstruction via spatiotemporal domain decomposition. A critical challenge in such distributed solvers is pressure indeterminacy, where independent sub-networks drift into inconsistent local pressure baselines. We address this issue through a reference anchor normalization strategy coupled with decoupled asymmetric weighting. By enforcing a unidirectional information flow from designated master ranks where the anchor point lies to neighboring ranks, our approach eliminates gauge freedom and guarantees global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity. Furthermore, to mitigate the Python interpreter overhead associated with computing high-order physics residuals, we implement a high-performance training pipeline accelerated by CUDA graphs and JIT compilation. Extensive validation on complex flow benchmarks demonstrates that our method achieves near-linear strong scaling and high-fidelity reconstruction, establishing a scalable and physically rigorous pathway for flow reconstruction and understanding of complex hydrodynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shumeng Chen, Jane E. Huggins, Tianwen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: A P300 ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller is an assistive communication tool. It searches for the P300 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by target stimuli, distinguishing it from the neural responses to non-target stimuli embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified framework with minimum calibration effort such that, given a small amount of labeled calibration data, we employed an adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm to update the binary classifier. We evaluated our method based on character-level prediction accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and BCI utility. We applied calibration on training data and reported results on testing data. Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark. The proposed semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve the overall spelling efficiency in the real-time BCI speller system, particularly in contexts with limited labeled data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15961">R$^2$Energy: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Robust Renewable Energy Forecasting under Diverse and Extreme Conditions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Sheng, Yuan Yuan, Guozhen Zhang, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power, has made reliable forecasting critical for power system operations. While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity. R$^2$Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cherish Puniani, Tushar Kumar, Arnav Bendre, Gaurav Kumar, Shree Singhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling. However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianchi Zhao, He Liu, Hongyin Shi, Jinliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a type of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems in which arms with a Gaussian reward feedback are clustered. Such an arm setting finds applications in many real-world problems, for example, mmWave communications and portfolio management with risky assets, as a result of the universality of the Gaussian distribution. Based on the Thompson Sampling algorithm with Gaussian prior (TSG) algorithm for the selection of the optimal arm, we propose our Thompson Sampling with Clustered arms under Gaussian prior (TSCG) specific to the 2-level hierarchical structure. We prove that by utilizing the 2-level structure, we can achieve a lower regret bound than we do with ordinary TSG. In addition, when the reward is Unimodal, we can reach an even lower bound on the regret by our Unimodal Thompson Sampling algorithm with Clustered Arms under Gaussian prior (UTSCG). Each of our proposed algorithms are accompanied by theoretical evaluation of the upper regret bound, and our numerical experiments confirm the advantage of our proposed algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo De Santi, Kimon Protopapas, Ya-Ping Hsieh, Andreas Krause</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow and diffusion models are typically pre-trained on limited available data (e.g., molecular samples), covering only a fraction of the valid design space (e.g., the full molecular space). As a consequence, they tend to generate samples from only a narrow portion of the feasible domain. This is a fundamental limitation for scientific discovery applications, where one typically aims to sample valid designs beyond the available data distribution. To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions. Ultimately, we empirically evaluate our method on both illustrative, yet visually interpretable settings, and on a molecular design task showcasing the ability of FE to expand a pre-trained flow model increasing conformer diversity while preserving validity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayadev Billa</p>
<p>Abstract: Capability emergence during neural network training remains mechanistically opaque. We track five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). We find: (1) training begins with a universal representation collapse to task-specific floors that are scale-invariant across a 210X parameter range (e.g., modular arithmetic collapses to RANKME ~ 2.0 regardless of model size); (2) collapse propagates top-down through layers (32/32 task X model consistency), contradicting bottom-up feature-building intuition; (3) a geometric hierarchy in which representation geometry leads emergence (75-100% precursor rate for hard tasks), while the local learning coefficient is synchronous (0/24 precursor) and Hessian measures lag. We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%). On Pythia, global geometric patterns replicate but per-task precursor signals do not -- the precursor relationship requires task-training alignment that naturalistic pre-training does not provide. Our contribution is the geometric anatomy of emergence and its boundary conditions, not a prediction tool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marzieh Amiri Shahbazi, Ali Baheri</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guaranties for regression; yet existing methods assume Euclidean output spaces and produce prediction regions that are poorly calibrated when responses lie on Riemannian manifolds. We propose \emph{adaptive geodesic conformal prediction}, a framework that replaces Euclidean residuals with geodesic nonconformity scores and normalizes them by a cross-validated difficulty estimator to handle heteroscedastic noise. The resulting prediction regions, geodesic caps on the sphere, have position-independent area and adapt their size to local prediction difficulty, yielding substantially more uniform conditional coverage than non-adaptive alternatives. In a synthetic sphere experiment with strong heteroscedasticity and a real-world geomagnetic field forecasting task derived from IGRF-14 satellite data, the adaptive method markedly reduces conditional coverage variability and raises worst-case coverage much closer to the nominal level, while coordinate-based baselines waste a large fraction of coverage area due to chart distortion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Molecular crystal structure prediction represents a grand challenge in computational chemistry due to large sizes of constituent molecules and complex intra- and intermolecular interactions. While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> KC Santosh, Srikanth Baride, Rodrigue Rizk</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning (ML) continues its rapid expansion, the environmental cost of model training and inference has become a critical societal concern. Existing benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on standard performance metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or mAP, while largely ignoring energy consumption and carbon emissions. This single-objective evaluation paradigm is increasingly misaligned with the practical requirements of large-scale deployment, particularly in energy-constrained environments such as mobile devices, developing regions, and climate-aware enterprises. In this paper, we propose AI-CARE, an evaluation tool for reporting energy consumption, and carbon emissions of ML models. In addition, we introduce the carbon-performance tradeoff curve, an interpretable tool that visualizes the Pareto frontier between performance and carbon cost. We demonstrate, through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on representative ML workloads, that carbon-aware benchmarking changes the relative ranking of models and encourages architectures that are simultaneously accurate and environmentally responsible. Our proposal aims to shift the research community toward transparent, multi-objective evaluation and align ML progress with global sustainability goals.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bradley McDanel, Steven Li, Sruthikesh Surineni, Harshit Khaitan</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by verifying multiple drafted tokens in parallel. However, for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, this parallelism introduces a severe bottleneck: large draft trees activate many unique experts, significantly increasing memory pressure and diminishing speedups from speculative decoding relative to autoregressive decoding. Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead. Experiments across multiple model scales and datasets show that this method yields 10--30\% higher throughput than state-of-the-art speculative decoding baselines (EAGLE-3) at comparable quality, with flexibility to trade accuracy for further latency reductions through tighter budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehrab Beikzadeh, Yasaman Asadollah Salmanpour, Ashima Suvarna, Sriram Sankararaman, Matteo Malgaroli, Majid Sarrafzadeh, Saadia Gabriel</p>
<p>Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over 1 billion people worldwide, yet access to care remains limited by workforce shortages and cost constraints. While AI systems show therapeutic promise, current alignment approaches optimize objectives independently, failing to balance patient preferences with clinical safety. We survey 335 individuals with lived mental health experience to collect preference rankings across therapeutic dimensions, then develop a multi-objective alignment framework using direct preference optimization. We train reward models for six criteria -- empathy, safety, active listening, self-motivated change, trust/rapport, and patient autonomy -- and systematically compare multi-objective approaches against single-objective optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter merging. Multi-objective DPO (MODPO) achieves superior balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) compared to single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety), and therapeutic criteria outperform general communication principles by 17.2%. Blinded clinician evaluation confirms MODPO is consistently preferred, with LLM-evaluator agreement comparable to inter-clinician reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawon Ahn, Het Patel, Aemal Khattak, Jia Chen, Evangelos E. Papalexakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Railway crossings present complex safety challenges where driver behavior varies by location, time, and conditions. Traditional approaches analyze crossings individually, limiting the ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations. We propose a multi-view tensor decomposition framework that captures behavioral similarities across three temporal phases: Approach (warning activation to gate lowering), Waiting (gates down to train passage), and Clearance (train passage to gate raising). We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16065">Can Generative Artificial Intelligence Survive Data Contamination? Theoretical Guarantees under Contaminated Recursive Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Wang, Hongqian Niu, Didong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research. The project page with dataset and code links is available at omni-ieeg.github.io/omni-ieeg.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Pynadath, Ruqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs) offer a promising path toward efficient masked diffusion by enabling native key-value caching, but competitive performance has so far required two-stream attention, typically motivated as a means of decoupling token content from position. In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Afonso Louren\c{c}o, Francisca Os\'orio, Diogo Risca, Goreti Marreiros</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable and cost-effective maintenance is essential for railway safety, particularly at the wheel-rail interface, which is prone to wear and failure. Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces and demonstrates a computational pipeline for the statistical analysis of shape graph datasets, namely geometric networks embedded in 2D or 3D spaces. Unlike traditional abstract graphs, our purpose is not only to retrieve and distinguish variations in the connectivity structure of the data but also geometric differences of the network branches. Our proposed approach relies on the extraction of a specifically curated and explicit set of topological, geometric and directional features, designed to satisfy key invariance properties. We leverage the resulting feature representation for tasks such as group comparison, clustering and classification on cohorts of shape graphs. The effectiveness of this representation is evaluated on several real-world datasets including urban road/street networks, neuronal traces and astrocyte imaging. These results are benchmarked against several alternative methods, both feature-based and not.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Leo (Muxing),  Wang, Connor Mclaughlin, Lili Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning with shared representation is widely recognized as an effective way to separate commonalities from heterogeneity across various heterogeneous sources. Most existing work includes all related data sources via simultaneously training a common feature extractor and source-specific heads. It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16145">Investigating GNN Convergence on Large Randomly Generated Graphs with Realistic Node Feature Correlations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Zain Ali Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: There are a number of existing studies analysing the convergence behaviour of graph neural networks on large random graphs. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barab\'asi-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Megan Lee, Seung Ha Hwang, Inhyeok Choi, Shreyas Darade, Mengchun Zhang, Kateryna Shapovalenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals. We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Difei Xu, Meng Ding, Zebin Ma, Huanyi Xie, Youming Tao, Aicha Slaitane, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world deployments routinely face distribution shifts, group imbalances, and adversarial perturbations, under which the traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework can degrade severely.
  Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this issue by optimizing the worst-case expected loss over an uncertainty set of distributions, offering a principled approach to robustness.
  Meanwhile, as training data in DRO always involves sensitive information, safeguarding it against leakage under Differential Privacy (DP) is essential.
  In contrast to classical DP-ERM, DP-DRO has received much less attention due to its minimax optimization structure with uncertainty constraint.
  To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive study of DP-(finite-sum)-DRO with $\psi$-divergence and non-convex loss.
  First, we study DRO with general $\psi$-divergence by reformulating it as a minimization problem, and develop a novel $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP optimization method, called DP Double-Spider, tailored to this structure.
  Under mild assumptions, we show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+ (\frac{\sqrt{d \log (1/\delta)}}{n \varepsilon})^{2/3})$ in terms of the gradient norm, where $n$ denotes the data size and $d$ denotes the model dimension.
  We further improve the utility rate for specific divergences.
  In particular, for DP-DRO with KL-divergence, by transforming the problem into a compositional finite-sum optimization problem, we develop a DP Recursive-Spider method and show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}((\frac{\sqrt{d \log(1/\delta)}}{n\varepsilon})^{2/3} )$, matching the best-known result for non-convex DP-ERM.
  Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform existing approaches for DP minimax optimization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16165">HiPER: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Credit Assignment for Large Language Model Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangweizhi Peng, Yuanxin Liu, Ruida Zhou, Charles Fleming, Zhaoran Wang, Alfredo Garcia, Mingyi Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making remains challenging, particularly in long-horizon tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, where agents must execute extended sequences of actions before receiving meaningful feedback. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.
  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.
  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\% and +8.3\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks. These results highlight the importance of explicit hierarchical decomposition for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binghang Lu, Jiahao Zhang, Guang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and neural operators often suffer from severe optimization difficulties caused by ill-conditioned gradients, multi-scale spectral behavior, and stiffness induced by physical constraints. Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation reduces decoding latency by predicting many tokens in parallel, but iterative refinement often suffers from error accumulation and distribution shift under self-generated drafts. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) and their remasking samplers (e.g., ReMDM) can be viewed as modern NAR iterative refinement, where generation repeatedly revises a partially observed draft. In this work we show that \emph{training alone} can substantially improve the step-efficiency of MDLM/ReMDM sampling. We propose \textsc{DSL} (Discrete Stochastic Localization), which trains a single SNR-invariant denoiser across a continuum of corruption levels, bridging intermediate draft noise and mask-style endpoint corruption within one Diffusion Transformer. On OpenWebText, \textsc{DSL} fine-tuning yields large MAUVE gains at low step budgets, surpassing the MDLM+ReMDM baseline with \(\sim\)4$\times$ fewer denoiser evaluations, and matches autoregressive quality at high budgets. Analyses show improved self-correction and uncertainty calibration, making remasking markedly more compute-efficient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diego Labate, Dipanwita Thakur, Giancarlo Fortino</p>
<p>Abstract: Energy theft poses a significant threat to the stability and efficiency of smart grids, leading to substantial economic losses and operational challenges. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippos Bellos, NaveenJohn Premkumar, Yannis Avrithis, Nam H. Nguyen, Jason J. Corso</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-for-time series (TS) methods typically treat time shallowly, injecting positional or prompt-based cues once at the input of a largely frozen decoder, which limits temporal reasoning as this information degrades through the layers. We introduce Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), which elevates time to a first-class modality that conditions the model at multiple depths. TPC attaches a small set of learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from compact, human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention. This disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining a low parameter budget. We show that by training only the cross-attention modules and explicitly disentangling time series signal and temporal information, TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenzhen Huang, Haoyu Bian, Jiaquan Zhang, Yibei Liu, Kuien Liu, Caiyan Qin, Guoqing Wang, Yang Yang, Chaoning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Several complex physical systems are governed by multi-scale partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit both smooth low-frequency components and localized high-frequency structures. Existing physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods typically train with fixed coordinate system inputs, where geometric misalignment with these structures induces gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning that hinder convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields more uniform residual distributions and higher solution accuracy on representative 1D and 2D PDEs, while improving training stability and convergence speed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Coordinating large populations of interacting agents is a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the size of the joint state-action space scales exponentially with the number of agents. Mean-field methods alleviate this burden by aggregating agent interactions, but these approaches assume homogeneous interactions. Recent graphon-based frameworks capture heterogeneity, but are computationally expensive as the number of agents grows. Therefore, we introduce $\texttt{GMFS}$, a $\textbf{G}$raphon $\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield $\textbf{S}$ubsampling framework for scalable cooperative MARL with heterogeneous agent interactions. By subsampling $\kappa$ agents according to interaction strength, we approximate the graphon-weighted mean-field and learn a policy with sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(\kappa)$ and optimality gap $O(1/\sqrt{\kappa})$. We verify our theory with numerical simulations in robotic coordination, showing that $\texttt{GMFS}$ achieves near-optimal performance.</p>

This paper presents ModalImmune, a training framework that enforces modality immunity by intentionally and controllably collapsing selected modality information during training so the model learns joint representations that are robust to destructive modality influence. The framework combines a spectrum-adaptive collapse regularizer, an information-gain guided controller for targeted interventions, curvature-aware gradient masking to stabilize destructive updates, and a certified Neumann-truncated hyper-gradient procedure for automatic meta-parameter adaptation. Empirical evaluation on standard multimodal benchmarks demonstrates that ModalImmune improves resilience to modality removal and corruption while retaining convergence stability and reconstruction capacity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adaptation methods have been a workhorse for unlocking the transformative power of pre-trained diffusion models in diverse applications. Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction. Empirically, on D4RL offline RL benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while preserving sampling efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pooja Honna, Ayush Patravali, Nithin Nagaraj, Nanjangud C. Narendra</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) has shown promise in recent times over traditional deep learning due to its two key features: ability to learn from small sized training samples, and low compute requirements. In prior work, NL has been implemented and extensively tested on separable and time series data, and demonstrated its superior performance on both classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we investigate the next step in NL, viz., applying NL to linked data, in particular, data that is represented in the form of knowledge graphs. We integrate linked data into NL by implementing node aggregation on knowledge graphs, and then feeding the aggregated node features to the simplest NL architecture: ChaosNet. We demonstrate the results of our implementation on homophilic graph datasets as well as heterophilic graph datasets of verying heterophily. We show better efficacy of our approach on homophilic graphs than on heterophilic graphs. While doing so, we also present our analysis of the results, as well as suggestions for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaquan Zhang, Fachrina Dewi Puspitasari, Songbo Zhang, Yibei Liu, Kuien Liu, Caiyan Qin, Fan Mo, Peng Wang, Yang Yang, Chaoning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural operators offer an effective framework for learning solutions of partial differential equations for many physical systems in a resolution-invariant and data-driven manner. Existing neural operators, however, often suffer from instability in multi-layer iteration and long-horizon rollout, which stems from the unconstrained Euclidean latent space updates that violate the geometric and conservation laws. To address this challenge, we propose to constrain manifolds with low-rank Lie algebra parameterization that performs group action updates on the latent representation. Our method, termed Manifold Constraining based on Lie group (MCL), acts as an efficient \emph{plug-and-play} module that enforces geometric inductive bias to existing neural operators. Extensive experiments on various partial differential equations, such as 1-D Burgers and 2-D Navier-Stokes, over a wide range of parameters and steps demonstrate that our method effectively lowers the relative prediction error by 30-50\% at the cost of 2.26\% of parameter increase. The results show that our approach provides a scalable solution for improving long-term prediction fidelity by addressing the principled geometric constraints absent in the neural operator updates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruibiao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to sea ice modeling using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), utilizing the natural graph structure of sea ice, where nodes represent individual ice pieces, and edges model the physical interactions, including collisions. This concept is developed within a one-dimensional framework as a foundational step. Traditional numerical methods, while effective, are computationally intensive and less scalable. By utilizing GNNs, the proposed model, termed the Collision-captured Network (CN), integrates data assimilation (DA) techniques to effectively learn and predict sea ice dynamics under various conditions. The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy. This advancement offers a more efficient tool for forecasting in marginal ice zones (MIZ) and highlights the potential of combining machine learning with data assimilation for more effective and efficient modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamzeh Asgharnezhad, Pegah Tabarisaadi, Abbas Khosravi, Roohallah Alizadehsani, U. Rajendra Acharya</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has improved automated electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but limited insight into prediction reliability hinders its use in safety-critical settings. This paper proposes UCTECG-Net, an uncertainty-aware hybrid architecture that combines one-dimensional convolutions and Transformer encoders to process raw ECG signals and their spectrograms jointly. Evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic datasets, UCTECG-Net outperforms LSTM, CNN1D, and Transformer baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, achieving up to 98.58% accuracy on MIT-BIH and 99.14% on PTB. To assess predictive reliability, we integrate three uncertainty quantification methods (Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout) into all models and analyze their behavior using an uncertainty-aware confusion matrix and derived metrics. The results show that UCTECG-Net, particularly with Ensemble or EMCD, provides more reliable and better-aligned uncertainty estimates than competing architectures, offering a stronger basis for risk-aware ECG decision support.</p>

However, there exist no surface extraction methods from an implicit representation of multiple classes that guarantee topological correctness and no holes. In this work, we lay the groundwork by introducing a 2D boundary extraction algorithm for the multi-class case focusing on topological consistency and water-tightness, which also allows for setting minimum detail restraint on the approximation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using geological modelling data, showcasing its adaptiveness and ability to honour complex topology.</p>

Although Bayesian quadrature was popularised already in the 1980s, no systematic and comprehensive treatment has been published. The purpose of this survey is to fill this gap. We review the mathematical foundations of Bayesian quadrature from different points of view; present a systematic taxonomy for classifying different Bayesian quadrature methods along the three axes of modelling, inference, and sampling; collect general theoretical guarantees; and provide a controlled numerical study that explores and illustrates the effect of different choices along the axes of the taxonomy. We also provide a realistic assessment of practical challenges and limitations to application of Bayesian quadrature methods and include an up-to-date and nearly exhaustive bibliography that covers not only machine learning and statistics literature but all areas of mathematics and engineering in which Bayesian quadrature or equivalent methods have seen use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zhang, Qitong Wang, Peng Wang, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling multiscale patterns is crucial for long-term time series forecasting (TSF). However, redundancy and noise in time series, together with semantic gaps between non-adjacent scales, make the efficient alignment and integration of multi-scale temporal dependencies challenging. To address this, we propose SEMixer, a lightweight multiscale model designed for long-term TSF. SEMixer features two key components: a Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) and a Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC). RAM captures diverse time-patch interactions during training and aggregates them via dropout ensemble at inference, enhancing patch-level semantics and enabling MLP-Mixer to better model multi-scale dependencies. MPMC further stacks RAM and MLP-Mixer in a memory-efficient manner, achieving more effective temporal mixing. It addresses semantic gaps across scales and facilitates better multiscale modeling and forecasting performance. We not only validate the effectiveness of SEMixer on 10 public datasets, but also on the \textit{2025 CCF AlOps Challenge} based on 21GB real wireless network data, where SEMixer achieves third place.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zhang, Peng Wang, Yichen Li, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series data are prone to noise in various domains, and training samples may contain low-predictability patterns that deviate from the normal data distribution, leading to training instability or convergence to poor local minima. Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC). While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zizhao Wang, Chang Shi, Jiaheng Hu, Kevin Rohling, Roberto Mart\'in-Mart\'in, Amy Zhang, Peter Stone</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of universal prediction of stochastic sequences with a finite time horizon $T$ known to the learner. The question we investigate is whether it is possible to derive vanishing regret bounds that hold with high probability, complementing existing bounds from the literature that hold in expectation. We propose such high-probability bounds which have a very similar form as the prior expectation bounds. For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} \delta^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-\delta$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$. We also propose an impossibility result which proves that it is not possible to improve the exponent of $\delta$ in a bound of the same form without making additional assumptions.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we develop, for the first time, a supervised classification framework with class-dependent rewards (CDR) to predict $\geq$MM flares within 24 hr. We construct multiple datasets, covering knowledge-informed features and line-of sight (LOS) magnetograms. We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Singh, Siddharth Chandak, Eric Moulines, Vivek S. Borkar, Nicholas Bambos</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the first high-probability regret bound for classical online Q-learning in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes, without relying on optimism or bonus terms. We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $\epsilon_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $\epsilon_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Zweiger, Xinghong Fu, Han Guo, Yoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling language models to long contexts is often bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache. In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss.</p>

<p>Abstract: Weight-space models learn directly from the parameters of neural networks, enabling tasks such as predicting their accuracy on new datasets. Naive methods -- like applying MLPs to flattened parameters -- perform poorly, making the design of better weight-space architectures a central challenge. While prior work leveraged permutation symmetries in standard networks to guide such designs, no analogous analysis or tailored architecture yet exists for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). In this work, we show that KANs share the same permutation symmetries as MLPs, and propose the KAN-graph, a graph representation of their computation. Building on this, we develop WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture that learns on KANs, which naturally accounts for their symmetry. We analyze WS-KAN's expressive power, showing it can replicate an input KAN's forward pass - a standard approach for assessing expressiveness in weight-space architectures. We construct a comprehensive ``zoo'' of trained KANs spanning diverse tasks, which we use as benchmarks to empirically evaluate WS-KAN. Across all tasks, WS-KAN consistently outperforms structure-agnostic baselines, often by a substantial margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/KAN-Graph-Metanetwork.</p>

Experiments across state-of-the-art DNN benchmarks such as VGG-11, ResNet-18, and EfficientNetLite demonstrate that the efficiency benefits of HAWX scale exponentially with network size.

<p>Abstract: We study the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers on homogeneous models. We first extend existing results on the implicit bias of steepest descent in homogeneous models to normalized steepest descent with an optional learning rate schedule. We then show that for smooth homogeneous models, momentum steepest descent algorithms like Muon (spectral norm), MomentumGD ($\ell_2$ norm), and Signum ($\ell_\infty$ norm) are approximate steepest descent trajectories under a decaying learning rate schedule, proving that these algorithms too have a bias towards KKT points of the corresponding margin maximization problem. We extend the analysis to Adam (without the stability constant), which maximizes the $\ell_\infty$ margin, and to Muon-Signum and Muon-Adam, which maximize a hybrid norm. Our experiments corroborate the theory and show that the identity of the margin maximized depends on the choice of optimizer. Overall, our results extend earlier lines of work on steepest descent in homogeneous models and momentum-based optimizers in linear models.</p>

It is highlighted how XAI methods can help identify the subsystem of the process where the fault occurred. Using our knowledge of the process, we note that in most cases the same features are indicated as the most important for the decision, while insome cases the SHAP method seems to be more informative and closer to the root cause of the fault. Finally, since the used XAI methods are model-agnostic, the proposed approach is not limited to the specific process and can also be used in similar problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative concentrations of chromophores in a spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) image can reveal immense structural, functional, and molecular information about physiological processes. However, due to nonlinearities and ill-posedness inherent to sPA imaging, concentration estimation is intractable. The Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Optical Inversion Autoencoder (SPOI-AE) aims to address the sPA optical inversion and spectral unmixing problems without assuming linearity. Herein, SPOI-AE was trained and tested on \textit{in vivo} mouse lymph node sPA images with unknown ground truth chromophore concentrations. SPOI-AE better reconstructs input sPA pixels than conventional algorithms while providing biologically coherent estimates for optical parameters, chromophore concentrations, and the percent oxygen saturation of tissue. SPOI-AE's unmixing accuracy was validated using a simulated mouse lymph node phantom ground truth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oran Ridel, Alon Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: We study reward-free and reward-agnostic exploration in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs), where an agent explores an unknown environment without observing external rewards. Reward-free exploration aims to enable $\epsilon$-optimal policies for any reward revealed after exploration, while reward-agnostic exploration targets $\epsilon$-optimality for rewards drawn from a small finite class. In the reward-agnostic setting, Li, Yan, Chen, and Fan achieve minimax sample complexity, but only for restrictively small accuracy parameter $\epsilon$. We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $\epsilon$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself. Our algorithm employs an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy, which is used to gather data sufficient for accurate dynamics estimation and subsequent computation of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy once the reward is revealed. Finally, we establish a tight lower bound for reward-free exploration, closing the gap between known upper and lower bounds.</p>

We introduce a unified and extensible benchmarking suite that simplifies the evaluation of unlearning algorithms using the KLoM (KL divergence of Margins) metric. Our framework provides precomputed model ensembles, oracle outputs, and streamlined infrastructure for running evaluations out of the box. By standardizing setup and metrics, it enables reproducible, scalable, and fair comparison across unlearning methods. We aim for this benchmark to serve as a practical foundation for accelerating research and promoting best practices in machine unlearning. Our code and data are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jean Dufraiche, Paul Mangold, Micha\"el Perrot, Marc Tommasi</p>
<p>Abstract: Releasing data once and for all under noninteractive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables complete data reusability, but the resulting noise may create bias in subsequent analyses. In this work, we leverage the Weierstrass transform to characterize this bias in binary classification. We prove that inverting this transform leads to a bias-correction method to compute unbiased estimates of nonlinear functions on examples released under LDP. We then build a novel stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Inverse Weierstrass Private SGD (IWP-SGD). It converges to the true population risk minimizer at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, with $n$ the number of examples. We empirically validate IWP-SGD on binary classification tasks using synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eva Paraschou, Line Harder Clemmensen, Sneha Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional large language model (LLM) fairness alignment largely focuses on mitigating bias along single sensitive attributes, overlooking fairness as an inherently multidimensional and context-specific value. This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamil Jeziorek, Piotr Wzorek, Krzysztof Blachut, Hiroshi Nakano, Manon Dampfhoffer, Thomas Mesquida, Hiroaki Nishi, Thomas Dalgaty, Tomasz Kryjak</p>
<p>Abstract: As the volume of data recorded by embedded edge sensors increases, particularly from neuromorphic devices producing discrete event streams, there is a growing need for hardware-aware neural architectures that enable efficient, low-latency, and energy-conscious local processing. We present an FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks for audio processing. We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling. The system achieves up to 95% word-end detection accuracy, with only 10.53 microsecond latency and 1.18 W power consumption, establishing a strong benchmark for energy-efficient event-driven KWS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative model evaluation commonly relies on high-dimensional embedding spaces to compute distances between samples. We show that dataset representations in these spaces are affected by the hubness phenomenon, which distorts nearest neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics. Building on the classical Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM), we introduce Generative ICDM (GICDM), a method to correct neighborhood estimation for both real and generated data. We introduce a multi-scale extension to improve empirical behavior. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real benchmarks demonstrate that GICDM resolves hubness-induced failures, restores reliable metric behavior, and improves alignment with human judgment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulla Jasem Almansoori, Maria Ivanova, Andrey Veprikov, Aleksandr Beznosikov, Samuel Horv\'ath, Martin Tak\'a\v{c}</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters and memory. In this work, we address the gap between training with full steps with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning. We propose LoRSum, a memory-efficient subroutine that closes this gap for gradient descent by casting LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, which we prove to be an implicit block power method. We recover several recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as special cases, and show that LoRSum can also be used for updating a low-rank momentum. In order to address full steps with preconditioned gradient descent, we propose a scaled variant of LoRSum that uses structured metrics such as K-FAC and Shampoo, and we show that storing the diagonal of these metrics still allows them to perform well while remaining memory-efficient. Experiments on a synthetic task, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning on GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103, show that our method can match or improve LoRA baselines given modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jung Min Choi, Vijaya Krishna Yalavarthi, Lars Schmidt-Thieme</p>
<p>Abstract: In long-term multivariate time series forecasting, effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential. To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Shang, Peng Sun, Jingyu Lin, Zhiqiang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Analytical diffusion models offer a mathematically transparent path to generative modeling by formulating the denoising score as an empirical-Bayes posterior mean. However, this interpretability comes at a prohibitive cost: the standard formulation necessitates a full-dataset scan at every timestep, scaling linearly with dataset size. In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\bf 71 \times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines. Most notably, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K, unlocking a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasilis Gkolemis, Loukas Kavouras, Dimitrios Kyriakopoulos, Konstantinos Tsopelas, Dimitrios Rontogiannis, Giuseppe Casalicchio, Theodore Dalamagas, Christos Diou</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAMs) offer interpretability through independent univariate feature effects but underfit when interactions are present in data. GA$^2$Ms add selected pairwise interactions which improves accuracy, but sacrifices interpretability and limits model auditing. We propose \emph{Conditionally Additive Local Models} (CALMs), a new model class, that balances the interpretability of GAMs with the accuracy of GA$^2$Ms. CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions of the input space. These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting. Experiments on diverse classification and regression tasks show that CALMs consistently outperform GAMs and achieve accuracy comparable with GA$^2$Ms. Overall, CALMs offer a compelling trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaetan De Waele, Marek Wydmuch, Krzysztof Dembczy\'nski, Wojciech Kot{\l}owski, Willem Waegeman</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the central challenges in the computational analysis of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data is to identify the compounds underlying the output spectra. In recent years, this problem is increasingly tackled using deep learning methods. A common strategy involves predicting a molecular fingerprint vector from an input mass spectrum, which is then used to search for matches in a chemical compound database. While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis shows this trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets, providing guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerhard Stenzel, Isabella Debelic, Michael K\"olle, Tobias Rohe, Leo S\"unkel, Julian Hager, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien</p>
<p>Abstract: We extend directed quantum circuit synthesis (DQCS) with reinforcement learning from purely discrete gate selection to parameterized quantum state preparation with continuous single-qubit rotations \(R_x\), \(R_y\), and \(R_z\). We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \(\lambda\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \(5\times10^{-4}\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \(10^{-4}\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\% and 99\% success) and Bell states (between 61\% and 77\% success). However, scalability saturates for \(\lambda\) of approximately three to four and does not extend to ten-qubit targets even at \(\lambda=2\). The two-stage method offers only marginal accuracy gains while requiring around three times the runtime. For practicality under a fixed compute budget, we therefore recommend the one-stage PPO policy, provide explicit synthesized circuits, and contrast with a classical variational baseline to outline avenues for improved scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shafagh Abband Pashaki, Sepehr Maleki, Amir Badiee</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a capacity-constrained incentive-based demand response approach for residential smart grids. It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case.</p>

<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to multilayer perceptrons, offering enhanced interpretability via functional decomposition. However, existing KAN architectures, including spline-, wavelet-, radial-basis variants, etc., suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence, limiting scalability and practical applicability. Here, we introduce Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), a simple yet effective extension that preserves all the advantages of KAN while improving computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. By incorporating these additional features, FEKAN accelerates convergence, increases representation capacity, and substantially mitigates the computational overhead characteristic of state-of-the-art KAN architectures. We investigate FEKAN across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including function-approximation tasks, physics-informed formulations for diverse partial differential equations (PDEs), and neural operator settings that map between input and output function spaces. For function approximation, we systematically compare FEKAN against a broad family of KAN variants, FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, and the original SplineKAN. Across all tasks, FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than the underlying baseline architectures. We also establish the theoretical foundations for FEKAN, showing its superior representation capacity compared to KAN, which contributes to improved accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Boharon, Yehuda Dar</p>
<p>Abstract: We study transfer learning for a linear regression task using several least-squares pretrained models that can be overparameterized.
  We formulate the target learning task as optimization that minimizes squared errors on the target dataset with penalty on the distance of the learned model from the pretrained models. We analytically formulate the test error of the learned target model and provide the corresponding empirical evaluations.
  Our results elucidate when using more pretrained models can improve transfer learning. Specifically, if the pretrained models are overparameterized, using sufficiently many of them is important for beneficial transfer learning. However, the learning may be compromised by overparameterization bias of pretrained models, i.e., the minimum $\ell_2$-norm solution's restriction to a small subspace spanned by the training examples in the high-dimensional parameter space. We propose a simple debiasing via multiplicative correction factor that can reduce the overparameterization bias and leverage more pretrained models to learn a target predictor.</p>

<p>Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure policy performance while satisfying safety constraints. However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial attack framework to reveal vulnerabilities of Safe RL policies. Using expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction, our framework learns a constraint model and a surrogate (learner) policy, enabling gradient-based attack optimization without requiring the victim policy's internal gradients or the ground-truth safety constraints. We further provide theoretical analysis establishing feasibility and deriving perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under limited privileged access.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianmeng Hu, Yongzheng Cui, Biao Luo, Ke Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The inverse design of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures is crucial for engineering functional RNAs in synthetic biology and therapeutics. While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum machine learning in the NISQ era. While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MetaDOAR, a lightweight meta-controller that augments the Double Oracle / PSRO paradigm with a learned, partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching to enable scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning on very large cyber-network environments. MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inference-time algorithms are an emerging paradigm in which pre-trained models are used as subroutines to solve downstream tasks. Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved.
  In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\star}(x) \propto p(x) \exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\top A x + b^\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).</p>

<p>Abstract: Urban demand forecasting plays a critical role in optimizing routing, dispatching, and congestion management within Intelligent Transportation Systems. By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility. Ultimately, our methodology offers novel insights on urban micro-mobility management, helping to tackle the challenges arising from rapid urbanization and thus, contributing to more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Luisa Taccari, Kenza Tazi, Ois\'in M. Morrison, Andreas Grafberger, Juan Colonese, Corentin Carton de Wiart, Christel Prudhomme, Cinzia Mazzetti, Matthew Chantry, Florian Pappenberger</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable global streamflow forecasting is essential for flood preparedness and water resource management, yet data-driven models often suffer from a performance gap when transitioning from historical reanalysis to operational forecast products. This paper introduces AIFL (Artificial Intelligence for Floods), a deterministic LSTM-based model designed for global daily streamflow forecasting. Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Michel, Debabrota Basu, Emilie Kaufmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern AI models are not static. They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meagan Mann, Christian Muise, Erin Meger</p>
<p>Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SungJun Cho, Chetan Gohil, Rukuang Huang, Oiwi Parker Jones, Mark W. Woolrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ethan Blaser, Jiuqi Wang, Shangtong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The average reward is a fundamental performance metric in reinforcement learning (RL) focusing on the long-run performance of an agent. Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jim Zhao, Tin Sum Cheng, Wojciech Masarczyk, Aurelien Lucchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Collapse (NC) refers to the emergence of highly symmetric geometric structures in the representations of deep neural networks during the terminal phase of training. Despite its prevalence, the theoretical understanding of NC remains limited. Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results. This work provides the first theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent emergence of NC and highlights the overlooked role of weight-decay coupling in shaping the implicit biases of optimizers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuta Kikuchi, Shu Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: The RNA inverse folding problem aims to identify nucleotide sequences that preferentially adopt a given target secondary structure. While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Vecchiato, Sebastian Bruch</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) organizes a set of points into partitions, and searches only a few of them to find the nearest neighbors of a query. Despite its popularity, there are virtually no analytical tools to determine the suitability of clustering-based ANNS for a given dataset -- what we call "searchability." To address that gap, we present two measures for flat clusterings of high-dimensional points in Euclidean space. First is Clustering-Neighborhood Stability Measure (clustering-NSM), an internal measure of clustering quality -- a function of a clustering of a dataset -- that we show to be predictive of ANNS accuracy. The second, Point-Neighborhood Stability Measure (point-NSM), is a measure of clusterability -- a function of the dataset itself -- that is predictive of clustering-NSM. The two together allow us to determine whether a dataset is searchable by clustering-based ANNS given only the data points. Importantly, both are functions of nearest neighbor relationships between points, not distances, making them applicable to various distance functions including inner product.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Pan, Peter Zhiping Zhang, Hao-Wei Pang, Alex Zhu, Xiang Yu, Liying Zhang, Liang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Matched molecular pairs (MMPs) capture the local chemical edits that medicinal chemists routinely use to design analogs, but existing ML approaches either operate at the whole-molecule level with limited edit controllability or learn MMP-style edits from restricted settings and small models. We propose a variable-to-variable formulation of analog generation and train a foundation model on large-scale MMP transformations (MMPTs) to generate diverse variables conditioned on an input variable. To enable practical control, we develop prompting mechanisms that let the users specify preferred transformation patterns during generation. We further introduce MMPT-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that uses external reference analogs as contextual guidance to steer generation and generalize from project-specific series. Experiments on general chemical corpora and patent-specific datasets demonstrate improved diversity, novelty, and controllability, and show that our method recovers realistic analog structures in practical discovery scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aloni Cohen, Refael Kohen, Kobbi Nissim, Uri Stemmer</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data points from a trained model, often striving to emulate "perfect retraining", i.e., producing the model that would have been obtained had the deleted data never been included. We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $\omega(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation. To address this problem, we propose a new security definition that specifically safeguards undeleted data against leakage caused by the deletion of other points. We show that our definition permits several essential functionalities, such as bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shruti Joshi, Aaron Mueller, David Klindt, Wieland Brendel, Patrik Reizinger, Dhanya Sridhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijing Tang, Ming Yuan, Zongqi Xia, Tianxi Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Bhandari, Usman Naseem, Mehwish Nasim</p>
<p>Abstract: Personality steering in large language models (LLMs) commonly relies on injecting trait-specific steering vectors, implicitly assuming that personality traits can be controlled independently. In this work, we examine whether this assumption holds by analysing the geometric relationships between Big Five personality steering directions. We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ha Na Cho, Sairam Sutari, Alexander Lopez, Hansen Bow, Kai Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical natural language processing (NLP) models have shown promise for supporting hospital discharge planning by leveraging narrative clinical documentation. However, note-based models are particularly vulnerable to temporal and lexical leakage, where documentation artifacts encode future clinical decisions and inflate apparent predictive performance. Such behavior poses substantial risks for real-world deployment, where overconfident or temporally invalid predictions can disrupt clinical workflows and compromise patient safety. This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training. Using next-day discharge prediction after elective spine surgery as a case study, we evaluate how auditing affects predictive behavior, calibration, and safety-relevant trade-offs. Results show that audited models exhibit more conservative and better-calibrated probability estimates, with reduced reliance on discharge-related lexical cues. These findings emphasize that deployment-ready clinical NLP systems should prioritize temporal validity, calibration, and behavioral robustness over optimistic performance.</p>

However, most dense rewards rely on manual engineering, which fundamentally limits the scalability and automation of reinforcement learning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to reward design, naive VLM rewards often misalign with task progress, struggle with spatial grounding, and show limited understanding of task semantics. To address these issues, we propose MARVL-Multi-stAge guidance for Robotic manipulation via Vision-Language models. MARVL fine-tunes a VLM for spatial and semantic consistency and decomposes tasks into multi-stage subtasks with task direction projection for trajectory sensitivity. Empirically, MARVL significantly outperforms existing VLM-reward methods on the Meta-World benchmark, demonstrating superior sample efficiency and robustness on sparse-reward manipulation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but remain limited by their reliance on static training data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this constraint by retrieving external knowledge during inference, though it still depends heavily on knowledge base quality. To explore potential improvements, we evaluated three RAG variants-Standard RAG, DA-RAG, and our proposed Prompt-Enhanced Parametric RAG (P-RAG), a hybrid architecture that integrates parametric knowledge within the LLM and retrieved evidence, guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning-on both general and biomedical datasets. Using LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct fine-tuned via LoRA, we evaluate on PubMedQA and 2WikiMultihopQA. P-RAG outperforms Standard RAG on PubMedQA by 10.47 percentage points in F1 (93.33% vs. 82.86%; 12.64% relative). On 2WikiMultihopQA, P-RAG nearly doubles the overall score vs. Standard RAG (33.44% vs. 17.83%) and achieves 44.03% on the Compare subset (with 42.74% Bridge, 21.84% Inference, 8.60% Compose). CoT prompting substantially improves multi-hop reasoning but yields mixed results for simpler, single-hop queries. These findings underscore P-RAG's potential for accurate, scalable, and contextually adaptive biomedical question answering. Our contributions include: (1) LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct for biomedical QA, (2) introduction of P-RAG with Chain-of-Thought prompting, and (3) state-of-the-art results on PubMedQA and 2WikiMultihopQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyu Li, Xingchun Zhu, Yonghui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable, continuous neural sensing on wearable edge platforms is fundamental to long-term health monitoring; however, for electroencephalography (EEG)-based sleep monitoring, dense high-frequency processing is often computationally prohibitive under tight energy budgets. To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes NeuroSleep, an integrated event-driven sensing and inference system for energy-efficient sleep staging. NeuroSleep first converts raw EEG into complementary multi-scale bipolar event streams using Residual Adaptive Multi-Scale Delta Modulation (R-AMSDM), enabling an explicit fidelity-sparsity trade-off at the sensing front end. Furthermore, NeuroSleep adopts a hierarchical inference architecture that comprises an Event-based Adaptive Multi-scale Response (EAMR) module for local feature extraction, a Local Temporal-Attention Module (LTAM) for context aggregation, and an Epoch-Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF) module to capture long-term state persistence. Experimental results using subject-independent 5-fold cross-validation on the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset demonstrate that NeuroSleep achieves a mean accuracy of 74.2% with only 0.932 M parameters while reducing sparsity-adjusted effective operations by approximately 53.6% relative to dense processing. Compared with the representative dense Transformer baseline, NeuroSleep improves accuracy by 7.5% with a 45.8% reduction in computational load. By bridging neuromorphic encoding with state-aware modeling, NeuroSleep provides a scalable solution for always-on sleep analysis in resource-constrained wearable scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Hossain Sahadath, Qiyun Cheng, Shaowu Pan, Wei Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces a neural operator based surrogate modeling framework for neutron transport computation. Two architectures, the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), were trained for fixed source problems to learn the mapping from anisotropic neutron sources, Q(x,{\mu}), to the corresponding angular fluxes, {\psi}(x,{\mu}), in a one-dimensional slab geometry. Three distinct models were trained for each neural operator, corresponding to different scattering ratios (c = 0.1, 0.5, & 1.0), providing insight into their performance across distinct transport regimes (absorption-dominated, moderate, and scattering-dominated). The models were subsequently evaluated on a wide range of previously unseen source configurations, demonstrating that FNO generally achieves higher predictive accuracy, while DeepONet offers greater computational efficiency. Both models offered significant speedups that become increasingly pronounced as the scattering ratio increases, requiring <0.3% of the runtime of a conventional S_N solver. The surrogate models were further incorporated into the S_N k-eigenvalue solver, replacing the computationally intensive transport sweep loop with a single forward pass. Across varying fission cross sections and spatial-angular grids, both neural operator solvers reproduced reference eigenvalues with deviations up to 135 pcm for DeepONet and 112 pcm for FNO, while reducing runtime to <0.1% of that of the S_N solver on relatively fine grids. These results demonstrate the strong potential of neural operator frameworks as accurate, efficient, and generalizable surrogates for neutron transport, paving the way for real-time digital twin applications and repeated evaluations, such as in design optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: While autonomous vehicles have achieved reliable performance within specific operating regions, their deployment to new cities remains costly and slow. A key bottleneck is the need to collect many human demonstration trajectories when adapting driving policies to new cities that differ from those seen in training in terms of road geometry, traffic rules, and interaction patterns. In this paper, we show that self-play multi-agent reinforcement learning can adapt a driving policy to a substantially different target city using only the map and meta-information, without requiring any human demonstrations from that city. We introduce NO data Map-based self-play for Autonomous Driving (NOMAD), which enables policy adaptation in a simulator constructed based on the target-city map. Using a simple reward function, NOMAD substantially improves both task success rate and trajectory realism in target cities, demonstrating an effective and scalable alternative to data-intensive city-transfer methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Ren, Yudong Fang, Tao Zhang, Wenchi Cheng, Ben Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-disaster survivor localization using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) faces a fundamental physical challenge: the prevalence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation in collapsed structures. Unlike standard Gaussian noise, signal reflection from debris introduces strictly non-negative ranging biases. Existing robust estimators, typically designed with symmetric loss functions (e.g., Huber or Tukey), implicitly rely on the assumption of error symmetry. Consequently, they experience a theoretical mismatch in this regime, leading to a phenomenon we formally identify as Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy (SGD)-a state where the estimator stagnates due to the coupling of persistent asymmetric bias and limited observation geometry. While emerging data-driven approaches offer alternatives, they often struggle with the scarcity of training data and the sim-to-real gap inherent in unstructured disaster zones. In this work, we propose a physically-grounded solution, the AsymmetricHuberEKF, which explicitly incorporates the non-negative physical prior of NLOS biases via a derived asymmetric loss function. Theoretically, we show that standard symmetric filters correspond to a degenerate case of our framework where the physical constraint is relaxed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that resolving SGD requires not just a robust filter, but specific bilateral information, which we achieve through a co-designed active sensing strategy. Validated in a 2D nadir-view scanning scenario, our approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to symmetric baselines, offering a resilient building block for search operations where data is scarce and geometry is constrained.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haihui Pan, Yuzhong Hong, Shaoke Lv, Junwei Bao, Hongfei Jiang, Yang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research indicates that while alignment methods significantly improve the quality of large language model(LLM) outputs, they simultaneously reduce the diversity of the models' output. Although some methods have been proposed to enhance LLM output diversity, they often come at the cost of reduced performance. In this work, we first theoretically demonstrate that the alignment task can be decomposed into two distributions: quality and diversity. To enhance the diversity of LLM outputs while ensuring quality, we propose the Quality-constrained Entropy Maximization Policy Optimization (QEMPO). QEMPO aims to maximize the output entropy of the policy while ensuring output quality. By adding different constraints to QEMPO, we obtain different policies. To optimize policies, we propose both online and offline training methods. Experiments validate that QEMPO achieves performance comparable to or even better than RLHF while improving output diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiqi Lu, Ying Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that deliberately breaking detailed balance in generative diffusion processes can accelerate the reverse process without changing the stationary distribution. Considering the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, we decompose the dynamics into a symmetric component and a non-reversible anti-symmetric component that generates rotational probability currents. We then construct an exponentially optimal non-reversible perturbation that improves the long-time relaxation rate while preserving the stationary target. We analyze how such non-reversible control reshapes the macroscopic dynamical regimes of the phase transitions recently identified in generative diffusion models. We derive a general criterion for the speciation time and show that suitable non-reversible perturbations can accelerate speciation. In contrast, the collapse transition is governed by a trace-controlled phase-space contraction mechanism that is fixed by the symmetric component, and the corresponding collapse time remains unchanged under anti-symmetric perturbations. Numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture models support these findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentin Dorseuil (DI-ENS), Jamal Atif (CMAP), Olivier Capp\'e (DI-ENS)</p>
<p>Abstract: Can the privacy vulnerability of individual data points be assessed without retraining models or explicitly simulating attacks? We answer affirmatively by showing that exposure to membership inference attack (MIA) is fundamentally governed by a data point's influence on the learned model. We formalize this in the linear setting by establishing a theoretical correspondence between individual MIA risk and the leverage score, identifying it as a principled metric for vulnerability. This characterization explains how data-dependent sensitivity translates into exposure, without the computational burden of training shadow models. Building on this, we propose a computationally efficient generalization of the leverage score for deep learning. Empirical evaluations confirm a strong correlation between the proposed score and MIA success, validating this metric as a practical surrogate for individual privacy risk assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhua Wang, Killian Cressant, Pedro Braconnot Velloso, Arnaud Breloy</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses graph learning in Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs). In this context, data matrices often come with auxiliary metadata (e.g., textual descriptions associated with each node) that is usually ignored in traditional graph estimation processes. To fill this gap, we propose a graph learning approach based on Laplacian-constrained GGMs that jointly leverages the node signals and such metadata. The resulting formulation yields an optimization problem, for which we develop an efficient majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm with closed-form updates at each iteration. Experimental results on a real-world financial dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves graph clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches that use either signals or metadata alone, thus illustrating the interest of fusing both sources of information.</p>

<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel at semantic generalization but struggle to generalize to unseen physical motions in novel environments. We introduce DreamZero, a World Action Model (WAM) built upon a pretrained video diffusion backbone. Unlike VLAs, WAMs learn physical dynamics by predicting future world states and actions, using video as a dense representation of how the world evolves. By jointly modeling video and action, DreamZero learns diverse skills effectively from heterogeneous robot data without relying on repetitive demonstrations. This results in over 2x improvement in generalization to new tasks and environments compared to state-of-the-art VLAs in real robot experiments. Crucially, through model and system optimizations, we enable a 14B autoregressive video diffusion model to perform real-time closed-loop control at 7Hz. Finally, we demonstrate two forms of cross-embodiment transfer: video-only demonstrations from other robots or humans yield a relative improvement of over 42% on unseen task performance with just 10-20 minutes of data. More surprisingly, DreamZero enables few-shot embodiment adaptation, transferring to a new embodiment with only 30 minutes of play data while retaining zero-shot generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rakshit Kumar Singh, Aryan Amit Barsainyan, Bharath Ramsundar</p>
<p>Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used for first-principles simulations in chemistry and materials science, but its computational cost remains a key limitation for large systems. Motivated by recent advances in ML-based exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, this paper introduces a differentiable framework that integrates machine learning models into density functional theory (DFT) for solids and other periodic systems. The framework defines a clean API for neural network models that can act as drop in replacements for conventional exchange-correlation (XC) functionals and enables gradients to flow through the full self-consistent DFT workflow. The framework is implemented in Python using a PyTorch backend, making it fully differentiable and easy to use with standard deep learning tools. We integrate the implementation with the DeepChem library to promote the reuse of established models and to lower the barrier for experimentation. In initial benchmarks against established electronic structure packages (GPAW and PySCF), our models achieve relative errors on the order of 5-10%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stochastic-gradient MCMC methods enable scalable Bayesian posterior sampling but often suffer from sensitivity to minibatch size and gradient noise. To address this, we propose Stochastic Gradient Lattice Random Walk (SGLRW), an extension of the Lattice Random Walk discretization. Unlike conventional Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), SGLRW introduces stochastic noise only through the off-diagonal elements of the update covariance; this yields greater robustness to minibatch size while retaining asymptotic correctness. Furthermore, as comparison we analyze a natural analogue of SGLD utilizing gradient clipping. Experimental validation on Bayesian regression and classification demonstrates that SGLRW remains stable in regimes where SGLD fails, including in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient noise, and matches or improves predictive performance.</p>

It provides information on the different object detection models available, open benchmark datasets, and studies on the use of object detection models in a range of applications. Additionally, controlled studies are provided to compare various strategies and produce some illuminating findings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Schlarmann, Matthias Hein</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance gains, and their user base is growing rapidly. However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks. We release the source code at https://github.com/chs20/visual-memory-injection</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuval Levental</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a simple experiment that exposes a fundamental limitation in vision-language models (VLMs): the inability to accurately localize filled cells in binary grids when those cells lack textual identity. We generate fifteen 15x15 grids with varying density (10.7%-41.8% filled cells) and render each as two image types -- text symbols (. and #) and filled squares without gridlines -- then ask three frontier VLMs (Claude Opus, ChatGPT 5.2, and Gemini 3 Thinking) to transcribe them. In the text-symbol condition, Claude and ChatGPT achieve approximately 91% cell accuracy and 84% F1, while Gemini achieves 84% accuracy and 63% F1. In the filled-squares condition, all three models collapse to 60-73% accuracy and 29-39% F1. Critically, all conditions pass through the same visual encoder -- the text symbols are images, not tokenized text. The text-vs-squares F1 gap ranges from 34 to 54 points across models, demonstrating that VLMs behave as if they possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway. Each model exhibits a distinct failure mode in the squares condition -- systematic under-counting (Claude), massive over-counting (ChatGPT), and template hallucination (Gemini) -- but all share the same underlying deficit: severely degraded spatial localization for non-textual visual elements.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop a general framework to discover scientific algorithms and apply it to three problems in computational cosmology. Our code, MadEvolve, is similar to Google's AlphaEvolve, but places a stronger emphasis on free parameters and their optimization. Our code starts with a baseline human algorithm implementation, and then optimizes its performance metrics by making iterative changes to its code. As a further convenient feature, MadEvolve automatically generates a report that compares the input algorithm with the evolved algorithm, describes the algorithmic innovations and lists the free parameters and their function. Our code supports both auto-differentiable, gradient-based parameter optimization and gradient-free optimization methods. We apply MadEvolve to the reconstruction of cosmological initial conditions, 21cm foreground contamination reconstruction and effective baryonic physics in N-body simulations. In all cases, we find substantial improvements over the base algorithm. We make MadEvolve and our three tasks publicly available at madevolve.org.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junbo Jacob Lian, Yujun Sun, Huiling Chen, Chaoyu Zhang, Chung-Piaw Teo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can translate natural language into optimization code, but silent failures pose a critical risk: code that executes and returns solver-feasible solutions may encode semantically incorrect formulations, creating a feasibility-correctness gap of up to 90 percentage points on compositional problems. We introduce ReLoop, addressing silent failures from two complementary directions. Structured generation decomposes code production into a four-stage reasoning chain (understand, formalize, synthesize, verify) that mirrors expert modeling practice, with explicit variable-type reasoning and self-verification to prevent formulation errors at their source. Behavioral verification detects errors that survive generation by testing whether the formulation responds correctly to solver-based parameter perturbation, without requiring ground truth -- an external semantic signal that bypasses the self-consistency problem inherent in LLM-based code review. The two mechanisms are complementary: structured generation dominates on complex compositional problems, while behavioral verification becomes the largest single contributor on problems with localized formulation defects. Together with execution recovery via IIS-enhanced diagnostics, ReLoop raises correctness from 22.6% to 31.1% and execution from 72.1% to 100.0% on the strongest model, with consistent gains across five models spanning three paradigms (foundation, SFT, RL) and three benchmarks. We additionally release RetailOpt-190, 190 compositional retail optimization scenarios targeting the multi-constraint interactions where LLMs most frequently fail.</p>

<p>Abstract: The objective of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is to collectively train a model using features available on different devices while sharing the same users. This paper focuses on the saddle point reformulation of the VFL problem via the classical Lagrangian function. We first demonstrate how this formulation can be solved using deterministic methods. More importantly, we explore various stochastic modifications to adapt to practical scenarios, such as employing compression techniques for efficient information transmission, enabling partial participation for asynchronous communication, and utilizing coordinate selection for faster local computation. We show that the saddle point reformulation plays a key role and opens up possibilities to use mentioned extension that seem to be impossible in the standard minimization formulation. Convergence estimates are provided for each algorithm, demonstrating their effectiveness in addressing the VFL problem. Additionally, alternative reformulations are investigated, and numerical experiments are conducted to validate performance and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanxin Zhu, Emran Hossen, Chen Zhao, Michele Esposito, Jiguang Sun, Weihua Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose of Review Imaging derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) is rapidly evolving beyond conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based pipelines toward machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and physics informed approaches that enable fast, wire free, and scalable functional assessment of coronary stenosis. This review synthesizes recent advances in CT and angiography based FFR, with particular emphasis on emerging physics informed neural networks and neural operators (PINNs and PINOs) and key considerations for their clinical translation. Recent Findings ML/DL approaches have markedly improved automation and computational speed, enabling prediction of pressure and FFR from anatomical descriptors or angiographic contrast dynamics. However, their real-world performance and generalizability can remain variable and sensitive to domain shift, due to multi-center heterogeneity, interpretability challenges, and differences in acquisition protocols and image quality. Physics informed learning introduces conservation structure and boundary condition consistency into model training, improving generalizability and reducing dependence on dense supervision while maintaining rapid inference. Recent evaluation trends increasingly highlight deployment oriented metrics, including calibration, uncertainty quantification, and quality control gatekeeping, as essential for safe clinical use. Summary The field is converging toward imaging derived FFR methods that are faster, more automated, and more reliable. While ML/DL offers substantial efficiency gains, physics informed frameworks such as PINNs and PINOs may provide a more robust balance between speed and physical consistency. Prospective multi center validation and standardized evaluation will be critical to support broad and safe clinical adoption.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the Massive Audio Embedding Benchmark (MAEB), a large-scale benchmark covering 30 tasks across speech, music, environmental sounds, and cross-modal audio-text reasoning in 100+ languages. We evaluate 50+ models and find that no single model dominates across all tasks: contrastive audio-text models excel at environmental sound classification (e.g., ESC50) but score near random on multilingual speech tasks (e.g., SIB-FLEURS), while speech-pretrained models show the opposite pattern. Clustering remains challenging for all models, with even the best-performing model achieving only modest results. We observe that models excelling on acoustic understanding often perform poorly on linguistic tasks, and vice versa. We also show that the performance of audio encoders on MAEB correlates highly with their performance when used in audio large language models. MAEB is derived from MAEB+, a collection of 98 tasks. MAEB is designed to maintain task diversity while reducing evaluation cost, and it integrates into the MTEB ecosystem for unified evaluation across text, image, and audio modalities.

<p>Abstract: Neural solvers have achieved impressive progress in addressing simple routing problems, particularly excelling in computational efficiency. However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a powerful framework for learning representations from graph-structured data, but their direct implementation on near-term quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit depth, multi-qubit interactions, and qubit scalability constraints. In this work, we introduce a fully quantum graph convolutional architecture designed explicitly for unsupervised learning in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) regime. Our approach combines a variational quantum feature extraction layer with an edge-local and qubit-efficient quantum message-passing mechanism inspired by the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) framework. Unlike prior models that rely on global operations or multi-controlled unitaries, our model decomposes message passing into pairwise interactions along graph edges using only hardware-native single- and two-qubit gates. This design reduces the qubit requirement from $O(Nn)$ to $O(n)$ for a graph with $N$ nodes and $n$-qubit feature registers, enabling implementation on current quantum devices regardless of graph size. We train the model using the Deep Graph Infomax objective to perform unsupervised node representation learning. Experiments on the Cora citation network and a large-scale genomic SNP dataset demonstrate that our model remains competitive with prior quantum and hybrid approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) in combinatorial optimization (CO) in the past few years. However, existing discovery pipelines often require extensive manual trial-and-error or reliance on domain expertise to adapt to new or complex problems. This stems from tightly coupled internal mechanisms that limit systematic improvement of the LLM-driven design process. To address this challenge, we propose a structured framework for LLM-driven AHD that explicitly decomposes the heuristic discovery process into modular stages: a forward pass for evaluation, a backward pass for analytical feedback, and an update step for program refinement. This separation provides a clear abstraction for iterative refinement and enables principled improvements of individual components. We validate our framework across four diverse real-world CO domains, where it consistently outperforms baselines, achieving up to $0.17$ improvement in QYI on unseen test sets. Finally, we show that several popular AHD methods are restricted instantiations of our framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bradley McDanel, Steven Li, Harshit Khaitan</p>
<p>Abstract: The prefill stage in long-context LLM inference remains a computational bottleneck. Recent token-ranking heuristics accelerate inference by selectively processing a subset of semantically relevant tokens. However, existing methods suffer from unstable token importance estimation, often varying between layers. Evaluating token-ranking quality independently from heuristic-specific architectures is challenging. To address this, we introduce an Answer-Informed Oracle, which defines ground-truth token importance by measuring attention from generated answers back to the prompt. This oracle reveals that existing heuristics exhibit high variance across layers: rankings can degrade sharply at specific layers, a failure mode invisible to end-to-end benchmarks. The diagnosis suggests a simple fix: aggregate scores across layers rather than relying on any single one. We implement this as Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA), which closes the gap to the oracle upper bound and reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 39\% compared to the Full KV Cache baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Chen, David Simchi-Levi, Ruoxuan Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating population quantities such as mean outcomes from user feedback is fundamental to platform evaluation and social science, yet feedback is often missing not at random (MNAR): users with stronger opinions are more likely to respond, so standard estimators are biased and the estimand is not identified without additional assumptions. Existing approaches typically rely on strong parametric assumptions or bespoke auxiliary variables that may be unavailable in practice. In this paper, we develop a partial identification framework in which sharp bounds on the estimand are obtained by solving a pair of linear programs whose constraints encode the observed data structure. This formulation naturally incorporates outcome predictions from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs), as additional linear constraints that tighten the feasible set. We call these predictions weak shadow variables: they satisfy a conditional independence assumption with respect to missingness but need not meet the completeness conditions required by classical shadow-variable methods. When predictions are sufficiently informative, the bounds collapse to a point, recovering standard identification as a special case. In finite samples, to provide valid coverage of the identified set, we propose a set-expansion estimator that achieves slower-than-$\sqrt{n}$ convergence rate in the set-identified regime and the standard $\sqrt{n}$ rate under point identification. In simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on customer-service dialogues, we find that LLM predictions are often ill-conditioned for classical shadow-variable methods yet remain highly effective in our framework. They shrink identification intervals by 75--83\% while maintaining valid coverage under realistic MNAR mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nelson Salazar-Pena, Alejandra Tabares, Andres Gonzalez-Mancera</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes implicit cooperation, a framework enabling decentralized agents to approximate optimal coordination in local energy markets without explicit peer-to-peer communication. We formulate the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision problem that is solved through a multi-agent reinforcement learning task in which agents use stigmergic signals (key performance indicators at the system level) to infer and react to global states. Through a 3x3 factorial design on an IEEE 34-node topology, we evaluated three training paradigms (CTCE, CTDE, DTDE) and three algorithms (PPO, APPO, SAC). Results identify APPO-DTDE as the optimal configuration, achieving a coordination score of 91.7% relative to the theoretical centralized benchmark (CTCE). However, a critical trade-off emerges between efficiency and stability: while the centralized benchmark maximizes allocative efficiency with a peer-to-peer trade ratio of 0.6, the fully decentralized approach (DTDE) demonstrates superior physical stability. Specifically, DTDE reduces the variance of grid balance by 31% compared to hybrid architectures, establishing a highly predictable, import-biased load profile that simplifies grid regulation. Furthermore, topological analysis reveals emergent spatial clustering, where decentralized agents self-organize into stable trading communities to minimize congestion penalties. While SAC excelled in hybrid settings, it failed in decentralized environments due to entropy-driven instability. This research proves that stigmergic signaling provides sufficient context for complex grid coordination, offering a robust, privacy-preserving alternative to expensive centralized communication infrastructure.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, open-source MARL simulation framework for studying implicit cooperation in LEMs, modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and implemented as a Gymnasium environment for MARL. Our framework features a modular market platform with plug-and-play clearing mechanisms, physically constrained agent models (including battery storage), a realistic grid network, and a comprehensive analytics suite to evaluate emergent coordination. The main contribution is a novel method to foster implicit cooperation, where agents' observations and rewards are enhanced with system-level key performance indicators to enable them to independently learn strategies that benefit the entire system and aim for collectively beneficial outcomes without explicit communication. Through representative case studies (available in a dedicated GitHub repository in https://github.com/salazarna/marlem, we show the framework's ability to analyze how different market configurations (such as varying storage deployment) impact system performance. This illustrates its potential to facilitate emergent coordination, improve market efficiency, and strengthen grid stability. The proposed simulation framework is a flexible, extensible, and reproducible tool for researchers and practitioners to design, test, and validate strategies for future intelligent, decentralized energy systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravi Raju, Mengmeng Ji, Shubhangi Upasani, Bo Li, Urmish Thakker</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapidly increasing context lengths have led to the assumption that large language models (LLMs) can directly reason over entire codebases. Concurrently, recent advances in LLMs have enabled strong performance on software engineering benchmarks, particularly when paired with agentic workflows. In this work, we systematically evaluate whether current LLMs can reliably perform long-context code debugging and patch generation. Using SWE-bench Verified as a controlled experimental setting, we first evaluate state-of-the-art models within an agentic harness (mini-SWE-agent), where performance improves substantially: GPT-5-nano achieves up to a 31\% resolve rate on 100 samples, and open-source models such as Deepseek-R1-0528 obtain competitive results. However, token-level analysis shows that successful agentic trajectories typically remain under 20k tokens, and that longer accumulated contexts correlate with lower success rates, indicating that agentic success primarily arises from task decomposition into short-context steps rather than effective long-context reasoning. To directly test long-context capability, we construct a data pipeline where we artificially inflate the context length of the input by placing the relevant files into the context (ensuring perfect retrieval recall); we then study single-shot patch generation under genuinely long contexts (64k-128k tokens). Despite this setup, performance degrades sharply: Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B achieves only a 7\% resolve rate at 64k context, while GPT-5-nano solves none of the tasks. Qualitative analysis reveals systematic failure modes, including hallucinated diffs, incorrect file targets, and malformed patch headers. Overall, our findings highlight a significant gap between nominal context length and usable context capacity in current LLMs, and suggest that existing agentic coding benchmarks do not meaningfully evaluate long-context reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aruna Sankaranarayanan, Amir Zur, Atticus Geiger, Dylan Hadfield-Menell</p>
<p>Abstract: Where should we intervene in a language model (LM) to control behaviors that are diffused across many tokens of a long-form response? We introduce Generative Causal Mediation (GCM), a procedure for selecting model components, e.g., attention heads, to steer a binary concept (e.g., talk in verse vs. talk in prose) from contrastive long-form responses. In GCM, we first construct a dataset of contrasting inputs and responses. Then, we quantify how individual model components mediate the contrastive concept and select the strongest mediators for steering. We evaluate GCM on three tasks--refusal, sycophancy, and style transfer--across three language models. GCM successfully localizes concepts expressed in long-form responses and consistently outperforms correlational probe-based baselines when steering with a sparse set of attention heads. Together, these results demonstrate that GCM provides an effective approach for localizing and controlling the long-form responses of LMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Idil Bilge Altun, Mert Onur Cakiroglu, Elham Buxton, Mehmet Dalkilic, Hasan Kurban</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete image tokenization is a key bottleneck for scalable visual generation: a tokenizer must remain compact for efficient latent-space priors while preserving semantic structure and using discrete capacity effectively. Existing quantizers face a trade-off: vector-quantized tokenizers learn flexible geometries but often suffer from biased straight-through optimization, codebook under-utilization, and representation collapse at large vocabularies. Structured scalar or implicit tokenizers ensure stable, near-complete utilization by design, yet rely on fixed discretization geometries that may allocate capacity inefficiently under heterogeneous latent statistics.
  We introduce Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end. LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training while recovering hard assignments at inference. The assignments correspond to posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimize a variational free-energy objective, provably converging to nearest-neighbor quantization in the low-temperature limit. LGQ combines a token-level peakedness regularizer with a global usage regularizer to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without imposing rigid grids.
  Under a controlled VQGAN-style backbone on ImageNet across multiple vocabulary sizes, LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization. At 16K codebook size, LGQ improves rFID by 11.88% over FSQ while using 49.96% fewer active codes, and improves rFID by 6.06% over SimVQ with 49.45% lower effective representation rate, achieving comparable fidelity with substantially fewer active entries.

<p>Abstract: The response of the climate system to increased greenhouse gases and other radiative perturbations is governed by a combination of fast and slow feedbacks. Slow feedbacks are typically activated in response to changes in ocean temperatures on decadal timescales and manifest as changes in climatic state with no recent historical analogue. However, fast feedbacks are activated in response to rapid atmospheric physical processes on weekly timescales, and they are already operative in the present-day climate. This distinction implies that the physics of fast radiative feedbacks is present in the historical meteorological reanalyses used to train many recent successful machine-learning-based (ML) emulators of weather and climate. In addition, these feedbacks are functional under the historical boundary conditions pertaining to the top-of-atmosphere radiative balance and sea-surface temperatures. Together, these factors imply that we can use historically trained ML weather emulators to study the response of radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and hence the global hydrological cycle, to perturbations in carbon dioxide and other well-mixed greenhouse gases. Without retraining on prospective Earth system conditions, we use ML weather emulators to quantify the fast precipitation response to reduced and elevated carbon dioxed concentrations with no recent historical precedent. We show that the responses from historically trained emulators agree with those produced by full-physics Earth System Models (ESMs). In conclusion, we discuss the prospects for and advantages from using ESMs and ML emulators to study fast processes in global climate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirmohammad Pasdar, Shabnam Kasra Kermanshahi, Nour Moustafa, Van-Thuan Pham</p>
<p>Abstract: The Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) relies on heterogeneous, bandwidth-constrained, and intermittently connected tactical networks that face rapidly evolving cyber threats. In this setting, intrusion detection cannot depend on continuous central collection of raw traffic due to disrupted links, latency, operational security limits, and non-IID traffic across zones. We present Zone-Adaptive Intrusion Detection (ZAID), a collaborative detection and model-improvement framework for unseen attack types, where "zero-day" refers to previously unobserved attack families and behaviours (not vulnerability disclosure timing). ZAID combines a universal convolutional model for generalisable traffic representations, an autoencoder-based reconstruction signal as an auxiliary anomaly score, and lightweight adapter modules for parameter-efficient zone adaptation. To support cross-zone generalisation under constrained connectivity, ZAID uses federated aggregation and pseudo-labelling to leverage locally observed, weakly labelled behaviours. We evaluate ZAID on ToN_IoT using a zero-day protocol that excludes MITM, DDoS, and DoS from supervised training and introduces them during zone-level deployment and adaptation. ZAID achieves up to 83.16% accuracy on unseen attack traffic and transfers to UNSW-NB15 under the same procedure, with a best accuracy of 71.64%. These results indicate that parameter-efficient, zone-personalised collaboration can improve the detection of previously unseen attacks in contested IoBT environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Sun, Stefan Nielsen, Rio Yokota, Yujin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models cannot reliably acquire new knowledge post-deployment -- even when relevant text resources exist, models fail to transform them into actionable knowledge without retraining. Retrieval-Augmented Generation attempts to bridge this gap by surfacing relevant documents at inference time, yet similarity-based retrieval often fails to identify context that actually improves task performance. We introduce Evolutionary Context Search (ECS), an evolutionary method that searches context combinations using accuracy on a small development set, requiring only inference calls without weight updates. ECS moves beyond semantic similarity to discover non-obvious context pairings that significantly boost performance. Our empirical results show that ECS improves BackendBench by 27\% and $\tau$-bench airline by 7\%. The evolved contexts are model-agnostic, as those evolved with Gemini-3-Flash transfer effectively to Claude Sonnet and DeepSeek. This suggests that ECS opens a path toward automated context discovery for skill acquisition -- an efficient alternative to manual prompt engineering or costly fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is widely used in the retrieval stage of large-scale recommendation systems. In this stage, candidate items are indexed using their learned embedding vectors, and ANN search is executed for each user (or item) query to retrieve a set of relevant items. However, ANN-based retrieval has two key limitations. First, item embeddings and their indices are typically learned in separate stages: indexing is often performed offline after embeddings are trained, which can yield suboptimal retrieval quality-especially for newly created items. Second, although ANN offers sublinear query time, it must still be run for every request, incurring substantial computation cost at industry scale. In this paper, we propose MultiFaceted Learnable Index (MFLI), a scalable, real-time retrieval paradigm that learns multifaceted item embeddings and indices within a unified framework and eliminates ANN search at serving time. Specifically, we construct a multifaceted hierarchical codebook via residual quantization of item embeddings and co-train the codebook with the embeddings. We further introduce an efficient multifaceted indexing structure and mechanisms that support real-time updates. At serving time, the learned hierarchical indices are used directly to identify relevant items, avoiding ANN search altogether. Extensive experiments on real-world data with billions of users show that MFLI improves recall on engagement tasks by up to 11.8\%, cold-content delivery by up to 57.29\%, and semantic relevance by 13.5\% compared with prior state-of-the-art methods. We also deploy MFLI in the system and report online experimental results demonstrating improved engagement, less popularity bias, and higher serving efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chihiro Watanabe, Jingyu Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as agents to solve complex tasks such as question answering (QA), scientific debate, and software development. A standard evaluation procedure aggregates multiple responses from LLM agents into a single final answer, often via majority voting, and compares it against reference answers. However, this process can obscure the quality and distributional characteristics of the original responses. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of cosine similarities between generated responses and reference answers. This enables a more nuanced assessment of response quality beyond exact match metrics. To analyze the response distributions across different agent configurations, we further introduce a clustering method for ECDFs using their distances and the $k$-medoids algorithm. Our experiments on a QA dataset demonstrate that ECDFs can distinguish between agent settings with similar final accuracies but different quality distributions. The clustering analysis also reveals interpretable group structures in the responses, offering insights into the impact of temperature, persona, and question topics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models deliver impressive results but remain slow because of the sequential denoising of 3D latents. Existing approaches to speed up inference either require expensive model retraining or use heuristic-based step skipping, which struggles to maintain video quality as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our work, CHAI, aims to use cross-inference caching to reduce latency while maintaining video quality. We introduce Cache Attention as an effective method for attending to shared objects/scenes across cross-inference latents. This selective attention mechanism enables effective reuse of cached latents across semantically related prompts, yielding high cache hit rates. We show that it is possible to generate high-quality videos using Cache Attention with as few as 8 denoising steps. When integrated into the overall system, CHAI is 1.65x - 3.35x faster than baseline OpenSora 1.2 while maintaining video quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spencer Compton, G\'abor Lugosi, Jaouad Mourtada, Jian Qian, Nikita Zhivotovskiy</p>
<p>Abstract: We study density estimation in Kullback-Leibler divergence: given an i.i.d. sample from an unknown density $p$, the goal is to construct an estimator $\widehat p$ such that $\mathrm{KL}(p,\widehat p)$ is small with high probability. We consider two settings involving a finite dictionary of $M$ densities: (i) model aggregation, where $p$ belongs to the dictionary, and (ii) convex aggregation (mixture density estimation), where $p$ is a mixture of densities from the dictionary. Crucially, we make no assumption on the base densities: their ratios may be unbounded and their supports may differ. For both problems, we identify the best possible high-probability guarantees in terms of the dictionary size, sample size, and confidence level. These optimal rates are higher than those achievable when density ratios are bounded by absolute constants; for mixture density estimation, they match existing lower bounds in the special case of discrete distributions.
  Our analysis of the mixture case hinges on two new covering results. First, we provide a sharp, distribution-free upper bound on the local Hellinger entropy of the class of mixtures of $M$ distributions. Second, we prove an optimal ratio covering theorem for convex sets: for every convex compact set $K\subset \mathbb{R}_+^d$, there exists a subset $A\subset K$ with at most $2^{8d}$ elements such that each element of $K$ is coordinate-wise dominated by an element of $A$ up to a universal constant factor. This geometric result is of independent interest; notably, it yields new cardinality estimates for $\varepsilon$-approximate Pareto sets in multi-objective optimization when the attainable set of objective vectors is convex.</p>

<p>Abstract: As multimodal systems increasingly process sensitive personal data, the ability to selectively revoke specific data modalities has become a critical requirement for privacy compliance and user autonomy. We present Missing-by-Design (MBD), a unified framework for revocable multimodal sentiment analysis that combines structured representation learning with a certifiable parameter-modification pipeline. Revocability is critical in privacy-sensitive applications where users or regulators may request removal of modality-specific information. MBD learns property-aware embeddings and employs generator-based reconstruction to recover missing channels while preserving task-relevant signals. For deletion requests, the framework applies saliency-driven candidate selection and a calibrated Gaussian update to produce a machine-verifiable Modality Deletion Certificate. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that MBD achieves strong predictive performance under incomplete inputs and delivers a practical privacy-utility trade-off, positioning surgical unlearning as an efficient alternative to full retraining.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the distributed composite optimization problem over networks, where agents aim to minimize a sum of local smooth components and a common nonsmooth term. Leveraging the probabilistic local updates mechanism, we propose a communication-efficient Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) framework, FlexATC, unifying numerous ATC-based distributed algorithms. Under stepsizes independent of the network topology and the number of local updates, we establish sublinear and linear convergence rates for FlexATC in convex and strongly convex settings, respectively. Remarkably, in the strong convex setting, the linear rate is decoupled from the objective functions and network topology, and FlexATC permits communication to be skipped in most iterations without any deterioration of the linear rate. In addition, the proposed unified theory demonstrates for the first time that local updates provably lead to communication acceleration for ATC-based distributed algorithms. Numerical experiments further validate the efficacy of the proposed framework and corroborate the theoretical results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emotional expression underpins natural communication and effective human-computer interaction. We present Emotion Collider (EC-Net), a hyperbolic hypergraph framework for multimodal emotion and sentiment modeling. EC-Net represents modality hierarchies using Poincare-ball embeddings and performs fusion through a hypergraph mechanism that passes messages bidirectionally between nodes and hyperedges. To sharpen class separation, contrastive learning is formulated in hyperbolic space with decoupled radial and angular objectives. High-order semantic relations across time steps and modalities are preserved via adaptive hyperedge construction. Empirical results on standard multimodal emotion benchmarks show that EC-Net produces robust, semantically coherent representations and consistently improves accuracy, particularly when modalities are partially available or contaminated by noise. These findings indicate that explicit hierarchical geometry combined with hypergraph fusion is effective for resilient multimodal affect understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern AI agents are powerful but often fail to align with the idiosyncratic, evolving preferences of individual users. Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binchuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a notion of practical learnability grounded in finite sample settings, and develop a conjugate learning theoretical framework based on convex conjugate duality to characterize this learnability property. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that training deep neural networks (DNNs) with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) achieves global optima of empirical risk by jointly controlling the extreme eigenvalues of a structure matrix and the gradient energy, and we establish a corresponding convergence theorem. We further elucidate the impact of batch size and model architecture (including depth, parameter count, sparsity, skip connections, and other characteristics) on non-convex optimization. Additionally, we derive a model-agnostic lower bound for the achievable empirical risk, theoretically demonstrating that data determines the fundamental limit of trainability. On the generalization front, we derive deterministic and probabilistic bounds on generalization error based on generalized conditional entropy measures. The former explicitly delineates the range of generalization error, while the latter characterizes the distribution of generalization error relative to the deterministic bounds under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling conditions. Furthermore, these bounds explicitly quantify the influence of three key factors: (i) information loss induced by irreversibility in the model, (ii) the maximum attainable loss value, and (iii) the generalized conditional entropy of features with respect to labels. Moreover, they offer a unified theoretical lens for understanding the roles of regularization, irreversible transformations, and network depth in shaping the generalization behavior of deep neural networks. Extensive experiments validate all theoretical predictions, confirming the framework's correctness and consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sushant Mehta, Logan Ritchie, Suhaas Garre, Nick Heiner, Edwin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that training AI agents on high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond the training distribution. We introduce \corecraft{}, the first environment in \textsc{EnterpriseGym}, Surge AI's suite of agentic RL environments. \corecraft{} is a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization, comprising over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types with 23 unique tools, designed to measure whether AI agents can perform the multi-step, domain-specific work that real jobs demand. Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30\% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM~4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37\% to 36.76\% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5\% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4\% on $\tau^2$-Bench Retail, and +6.8\% on Toolathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns. Our results suggest that environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subham Pokhriyal, Shweta Jain, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the \emph{Submodular Welfare Problem} (SWP), where items are partitioned among agents with monotone submodular utilities to maximize the total welfare under \emph{bandit feedback}. Classical SWP assumes full value-oracle access, achieving $(1-1/e)$ approximations via continuous-greedy algorithms. We extend this to a \emph{multi-agent combinatorial bandit} framework (\textsc{MA-CMAB}), where actions are partitions under full-bandit feedback with non-communicating agents. Unlike prior single-agent or separable multi-agent CMAB models, our setting couples agents through shared allocation constraints. We propose an explore-then-commit strategy with randomized assignments, achieving $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret against a $(1-1/e)$ benchmark, the first such guarantee for partition-based submodular welfare problem under bandit feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroaki Yamanaka, Daisuke Miyashita, Takashi Toi, Asuka Maki, Taiga Ikeda, Jun Deguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Driven by our mission of "uplifting the world with memory," this paper explores the design concept of "memory" that is essential for achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI). Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed "extract then store," involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the "store then on-demand extract" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16233">DistributedEstimator: Distributed Training of Quantum Neural Networks via Circuit Cutting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Prabhjot Singh, Adel N. Toosi, Rajkumar Buyya</p>
<p>Abstract: Circuit cutting decomposes a large quantum circuit into a collection of smaller subcircuits. The outputs of these subcircuits are then classically reconstructed to recover the original expectation values. While prior work characterises cutting overhead largely in terms of subcircuit counts and sampling complexity, its end-to-end impact on iterative, estimator-driven training pipelines remains insufficiently measured from a systems perspective. In this paper, we propose a cut-aware estimator execution pipeline that treats circuit cutting as a staged distributed workload and instruments each estimator query into partitioning, subexperiment generation, parallel execution, and classical reconstruction phases. Using logged runtime traces and learning outcomes on two binary classification workloads (Iris and MNIST), we quantify cutting overheads, scaling limits, and sensitivity to injected stragglers, and we evaluate whether accuracy and robustness are preserved under matched training budgets. Our measurements show that cutting introduces substantial end-to-end overheads that grow with the number of cuts, and that reconstruction constitutes a dominant fraction of per-query time, bounding achievable speed-up under increased parallelism. Despite these systems costs, test accuracy and robustness are preserved in the measured regimes, with configuration-dependent improvements observed in some cut settings. These results indicate that practical scaling of circuit cutting for learning workloads hinges on reducing and overlapping reconstruction and on scheduling policies that account for barrier-dominated critical paths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Lin, Toshihisa Tanaka, Qibin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Encoding classical data into quantum states is a central bottleneck in quantum machine learning: many widely used encodings are circuit-inefficient, requiring deep circuits and substantial quantum resources, which limits scalability on quantum hardware. In this work, we propose TNQE, a circuit-efficient quantum data encoding framework built on structured unitary tensor network (TN) representations. TNQE first represents each classical input via a TN decomposition and then compiles the resulting tensor cores into an encoding circuit through two complementary core-to-circuit strategies. To make this compilation trainable while respecting the unitary nature of quantum operations, we introduce a unitary-aware constraint that parameterizes TN cores as learnable block unitaries, enabling them to be directly optimized and directly encoded as quantum operators. The proposed TNQE framework enables explicit control over circuit depth and qubit resources, allowing the construction of shallow, resource-efficient circuits. Across a range of benchmarks, TNQE achieves encoding circuits as shallow as $0.04\times$ the depth of amplitude encoding, while naturally scaling to high-resolution images ($256 \times 256$) and demonstrating practical feasibility on real quantum hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houtan Ghaffari, Lukas Rauch, Christoph Scholz, Paul Devos</p>
<p>Abstract: Probing is widely adopted in computer vision to faithfully evaluate self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings, as fine-tuning may misrepresent their inherent quality. In contrast, audio SSL models still rely on fine-tuning because simple probing fails to unlock their full potential and alters their rankings when competing for SOTA on AudioSet. Hence, a robust and efficient probing mechanism is required to guide the trajectory of audio SSL towards reliable and reproducible methods. We introduce Convex Gated Probing (CGP), a prototype-based method that drastically closes the gap between fine-tuning and probing in audio. CGP efficiently utilizes all frozen layers via a gating mechanism and exposes the location of latent task-relevant information. Guided by CGP, we rework the entire SSL pipeline of current SOTA audio models that use legacy implementations of prior SSL methods. By refining data preprocessing, model architecture, and pre-training recipe, we introduce Better Audio Transformer (BAT), and establish new SOTA on audio benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kavyansh Tyagi, Vishwas Rathi, Puneet Goyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and computationally efficient 3D medical image segmentation remains a critical challenge in clinical workflows. Transformer-based architectures often demonstrate superior global contextual modeling but at the expense of excessive parameter counts and memory demands, restricting their clinical deployment. We propose RefineFormer3D, a lightweight hierarchical transformer architecture that balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency for volumetric medical imaging. The architecture integrates three key components: (i) GhostConv3D-based patch embedding for efficient feature extraction with minimal redundancy, (ii) MixFFN3D module with low-rank projections and depthwise convolutions for parameter-efficient feature extraction, and (iii) a cross-attention fusion decoder enabling adaptive multi-scale skip connection integration. RefineFormer3D contains only 2.94M parameters, substantially fewer than contemporary transformer-based methods. Extensive experiments on ACDC and BraTS benchmarks demonstrate that RefineFormer3D achieves 93.44\% and 85.9\% average Dice scores respectively, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, the model achieves fast inference (8.35 ms per volume on GPU) with low memory requirements, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish RefineFormer3D as an effective and scalable solution for practical 3D medical image segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Xiao, Florian Lux, Alejandro P\'erez-Gonz\'alez-de-Martos, Ngoc Thang Vu</p>
<p>Abstract: Since Text-to-Speech systems typically don't produce waveforms directly, recent spoof detection studies use resynthesized waveforms from vocoders and neural audio codecs to simulate an attacker. Unlike vocoders, which are specifically designed for speech synthesis, neural audio codecs were originally developed for compressing audio for storage and transmission. However, their ability to discretize speech also sparked interest in language-modeling-based speech synthesis. Owing to this dual functionality, codec resynthesized data may be labeled as either bonafide or spoof. So far, very little research has addressed this issue. In this study, we present a challenging extension of the ASVspoof 5 dataset constructed for this purpose. We examine how different labeling choices affect detection performance and provide insights into labeling strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nivya Talokar, Ayush K Tarun, Murari Mandal, Maksym Andriushchenko, Antoine Bosselut</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-based agents execute real-world workflows via tools and memory. These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings. Overall, STING provides a practical way to evaluate and stress-test agent misuse in realistic deployment settings, where interactions are inherently multi-turn and often multilingual.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirill Khrylchenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used in recommender systems, both for modeling user behavior as event sequences and for integrating large language models into recommendation pipelines. A key challenge in this setting is the extremely large cardinality of item spaces, which makes training generative models difficult and introduces a vocabulary gap between natural language and item identifiers. Semantic identifiers (semantic IDs), which represent items as sequences of low-cardinality tokens, have recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem.
  However, existing approaches generate semantic identifiers of fixed length, assigning the same description length to all items. This is inefficient, misaligned with natural language, and ignores the highly skewed frequency structure of real-world catalogs, where popular items and rare long-tail items exhibit fundamentally different information requirements. In parallel, the emergent communication literature studies how agents develop discrete communication protocols, often producing variable-length messages in which frequent concepts receive shorter descriptions. Despite the conceptual similarity, these ideas have not been systematically adopted in recommender systems.
  In this work, we bridge recommender systems and emergent communication by introducing variable-length semantic identifiers for recommendation. We propose a discrete variational autoencoder with Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization that learns item representations of adaptive length under a principled probabilistic framework, avoiding the instability of REINFORCE-based training and the fixed-length constraints of prior semantic ID methods.</p>

Experimental results show that acoustic maps provide a compact and physically interpretable feature space for replay attack detection across different devices and acoustic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arun Vignesh Malarkkan, Wangyang Ying, Yanjie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated feature engineering (AFE) enables AI systems to autonomously construct high-utility representations from raw tabular data. However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.</p>

<p>Abstract: The pursuit of general-purpose robotic manipulation is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, real-world interaction data. Unlike data collection from web in vision or language, robotic data collection is an active process incurring prohibitive physical costs. Consequently, automated task curation to maximize data value remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions. To address this, we introduce RoboGene, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks across single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots. RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. We conduct extensive quantitative analysis and large-scale real-world experiments, collecting datasets of 18k trajectories and introducing novel metrics to assess task quality, feasibility, and diversity. Results demonstrate that RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, real-world experiments show that VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene achieve higher success rates and superior generalization, underscoring the importance of high-quality task generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Chang Chen, Chen Chian Fuh, Shang En Tsai</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating consumer preferences is central to many problems in economics and marketing. This paper develops a flexible framework for learning individual preferences from partial ranking information by interpreting observed rankings as collections of pairwise comparisons with logistic choice probabilities. We model latent utility as the sum of interpretable product attributes, item fixed effects, and a low-rank user-item factor structure, enabling both interpretability and information sharing across consumers and items. We further correct for selection in which comparisons are observed: a comparison is recorded only if both items enter the consumer's consideration set, inducing exposure bias toward frequently encountered items. We model pair observability as the product of item-level observability propensities and estimate these propensities with a logistic model for the marginal probability that an item is observable. Preference parameters are then estimated by maximizing an inverse-probability-weighted (IPW), ridge-regularized log-likelihood that reweights observed comparisons toward a target comparison population. To scale computation, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm based on inverse-probability resampling, which draws comparisons in proportion to their IPW weights. In an application to transaction data from an online wine retailer, the method improves out-of-sample recommendation performance relative to a popularity-based benchmark, with particularly strong gains in predicting purchases of previously unconsumed products.</p>

<p>Abstract: Looping, reusing a block of layers across depth, and depth growing, training shallow-to-deep models by duplicating middle layers, have both been linked to stronger reasoning, but their relationship remains unclear. We provide a mechanistic unification: looped and depth-grown models exhibit convergent depth-wise signatures, including increased reliance on late layers and recurring patterns aligned with the looped or grown block. These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop. Overall, our results position depth growth and looping as complementary, practical methods for inducing and scaling iterative computation to improve reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hazard and survival functions are natural, interpretable targets in time-to-event prediction, but their inherent non-additivity fundamentally limits standard additive explanation methods. We introduce Survival Functional Decomposition (SurvFD), a principled approach for analyzing feature interactions in machine learning survival models. By decomposing higher-order effects into time-dependent and time-independent components, SurvFD offers a previously unrecognized perspective on survival explanations, explicitly characterizing when and why additive explanations fail. Building on this theoretical decomposition, we propose SurvSHAP-IQ, which extends Shapley interactions to time-indexed functions, providing a practical estimator for higher-order, time-dependent interactions. Together, SurvFD and SurvSHAP-IQ establish an interaction- and time-aware interpretability approach for survival modeling, with broad applicability across time-to-event prediction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiadong Liang, Zhimei Ren, Yuxin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We study online conformal prediction for non-stationary data streams subject to unknown distribution drift. While most prior work studied this problem under adversarial settings and/or assessed performance in terms of gaps of time-averaged marginal coverage, we instead evaluate performance through training-conditional cumulative regret. We specifically focus on independently generated data with two types of distribution shift: abrupt change points and smooth drift.
  When non-conformity score functions are pretrained on an independent dataset, we propose a split-conformal style algorithm that leverages drift detection to adaptively update calibration sets, which provably achieves minimax-optimal regret. When non-conformity scores are instead trained online, we develop a full-conformal style algorithm that again incorporates drift detection to handle non-stationarity; this approach relies on stability - rather than permutation symmetry - of the model-fitting algorithm, which is often better suited to online learning under evolving environments. We establish non-asymptotic regret guarantees for our online full conformal algorithm, which match the minimax lower bound under appropriate restrictions on the prediction sets. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiting Liu, Hazel Doughty</p>
<p>Abstract: Video recognition models are typically trained on fixed taxonomies which are often too coarse, collapsing distinctions in object, manner or outcome under a single label. As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Plank, Yufei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze independent policy-gradient (PG) learning in $N$-player linear-quadratic (LQ) stochastic differential games. Each player employs a distributed policy that depends only on its own state and updates the policy independently using the gradient of its own objective. We establish global linear convergence of these methods to an equilibrium by showing that the LQ game admits an $\alpha$-potential structure, with $\alpha$ determined by the degree of pairwise interaction asymmetry. For pairwise-symmetric interactions, we construct an affine distributed equilibrium by minimizing the potential function and show that independent PG methods converge globally to this equilibrium, with complexity scaling linearly in the population size and logarithmically in the desired accuracy. For asymmetric interactions, we prove that independent projected PG algorithms converge linearly to an approximate equilibrium, with suboptimality proportional to the degree of asymmetry. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results across both symmetric and asymmetric interaction networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyun Chen, Jerry Li, Kevin Tian, Yusong Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse recovery is among the most well-studied problems in learning theory and high-dimensional statistics. In this work, we investigate the statistical and computational landscapes of sparse recovery with $\ell_\infty$ error guarantees. This variant of the problem is motivated by \emph{variable selection} tasks, where the goal is to estimate the support of a $k$-sparse signal in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main contribution is a provable separation between the \emph{oblivious} (``for each'') and \emph{adaptive} (``for all'') models of $\ell_\infty$ sparse recovery. We show that under an oblivious model, the optimal $\ell_\infty$ error is attainable in near-linear time with $\approx k\log d$ samples, whereas in an adaptive model, $\gtrsim k^2$ samples are necessary for any algorithm to achieve this bound. This establishes a surprising contrast with the standard $\ell_2$ setting, where $\approx k \log d$ samples suffice even for adaptive sparse recovery. We conclude with a preliminary examination of a \emph{partially-adaptive} model, where we show nontrivial variable selection guarantees are possible with $\approx k\log d$ measurements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi You, Yitai Cheng, Zichao Zeng, James Haworth</p>
<p>Abstract: Street-view image attribute classification is a vital downstream task of image classification, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, urban analytics, and high-definition map construction. It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost.

<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly trained or fine-tuned on synthetic data. Recursively training on such data has been observed to significantly degrade performance in a wide range of tasks, often characterized by a progressive drift away from the target distribution. In this work, we theoretically analyze this phenomenon in the setting of score-based diffusion models. For a realistic pipeline where each training round uses a combination of synthetic data and fresh samples from the target distribution, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the accumulated divergence between the generated and target distributions. This allows us to characterize different regimes of drift, depending on the score estimation error and the proportion of fresh data used in each generation. We also provide empirical results on synthetic data and images to illustrate the theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melkamu Abay Mersha, Jugal Kalita</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains and tasks, yet their deeply layered representations make their predictions difficult to interpret. Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengjie Qian, Guangzhi Sun, Mark J. F. Gales, Kate M. Knill</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied as automatic evaluators for natural language generation assessment often using pairwise comparative judgements. Existing approaches typically rely on single judges or aggregate multiple judges assuming equal reliability. In practice, LLM judges vary substantially in performance across tasks and aspects, and their judgment probabilities may be biased and inconsistent. Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rare-event sampling problem has long been the central limiting factor in molecular dynamics (MD), especially in biomolecular simulation. Recently, diffusion models such as BioEmu have emerged as powerful equilibrium samplers that generate independent samples from complex molecular distributions, eliminating the cost of sampling rare transition events. However, a sampling problem remains when computing observables that rely on states which are rare in equilibrium, for example folding free energies. Here, we introduce enhanced diffusion sampling, enabling efficient exploration of rare-event regions while preserving unbiased thermodynamic estimators. The key idea is to perform quantitatively accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles and subsequently recover equilibrium statistics via exact reweighting. We instantiate our framework in three algorithms: UmbrellaDiff (umbrella sampling with diffusion models), $\Delta$G-Diff (free-energy differences via tilted ensembles), and MetaDiff (a batchwise analogue for metadynamics). Across toy systems, protein folding landscapes and folding free energies, our methods achieve fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties within GPU-minutes to hours per system -- closing the rare-event sampling gap that remained after the advent of diffusion-model equilibrium samplers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jithu J. Athalathil, Mohammed H. Talafha, Bhargav Vaidya</p>
<p>Abstract: The solar dynamo relies on the regeneration of the poloidal magnetic field through processes strongly modulated by nonlinear feedbacks such as tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation, embedding physical constraints directly into the neural network framework. By systematically varying transport parameters, we isolate the relative contributions of TQ and LQ to polar dipole buildup. We use the residual dipole moment as a diagnostic for cycle-to-cycle amplification and show that TQ suppression strengthens with increasing diffusivity, while LQ dominates in advection-dominated regimes. The ratio $\Delta D_{\mathrm{LQ}}/\Delta D_{\mathrm{TQ}}$ exhibits a smooth inverse-square dependence on the dynamo effectivity range, refining previous empirical fits with improved accuracy and reduced scatter. The results further reveal that the need for a decay term is not essential for PINN set-up due to the training process. Compared with the traditional 1D SFT model, the PINN framework achieves significantly lower error metrics and more robust recovery of nonlinear trends. Our results suggest that the nonlinear interplay between LQ and TQ can naturally produce alternations between weak and strong cycles, providing a physical explanation for the observed even-odd cycle modulation. These findings demonstrate the potential of PINN as an accurate, efficient, and physically consistent tool for solar cycle prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyan Bu, Xiaohao Liu, ZhaoXing Ren, Yaodong Yang, Juntao Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across linguistic communities necessitates reliable multilingual safety alignment. However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhas Thejaswi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the hardness of approximation of the fair $k$-center problem. Here the data points are partitioned into groups and the task is to choose a prescribed number of data points from each group, called centers, while minimizing the maximum distance from any point to its closest center. Although a polynomial-time $3$-approximation is known for this problem in general metrics, it has remained open whether this approximation guarantee is tight or could be further improved, especially since the unconstrained $k$-center problem admits a polynomial-time factor-$2$ approximation. We resolve this open question by proving that, for every $\epsilon>0$, achieving a $(3-\epsilon)$-approximation is NP-hard, assuming $\text{P} \neq \text{NP}$.
  Our inapproximability results hold even when only two disjoint groups are present and at least one center must be chosen from each group. Further, it extends to the canonical one-per-group setting with $k$-groups (for arbitrary $k$), where exactly one center must be selected from each group. Consequently, the factor-$3$ barrier for fair $k$-center in general metric spaces is inherent, and existing $3$-approximation algorithms are optimal up to lower-order terms even in these restricted regimes. This result stands in sharp contrast to the $k$-supplier formulation, where both the unconstrained and fair variants admit factor-$3$ approximation in polynomial time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to reason about novel combinations of familiar concepts, is fundamental to human cognition and a critical challenge for machine learning. Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multiple hypothesis testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control is a fundamental problem in statistical inference, with broad applications in genomics, drug screening, and outlier detection. In many such settings, researchers may have access not only to real experimental observations but also to auxiliary or synthetic data -- from past, related experiments or generated by generative models -- that can provide additional evidence about the hypotheses of interest. We introduce SynthBH, a synthetic-powered multiple testing procedure that safely leverages such synthetic data. We prove that SynthBH guarantees finite-sample, distribution-free FDR control under a mild PRDS-type positive dependence condition, without requiring the pooled-data p-values to be valid under the null. The proposed method adapts to the (unknown) quality of the synthetic data: it enhances the sample efficiency and may boost the power when synthetic data are of high quality, while controlling the FDR at a user-specified level regardless of their quality. We demonstrate the empirical performance of SynthBH on tabular outlier detection benchmarks and on genomic analyses of drug-cancer sensitivity associations, and further study its properties through controlled experiments on simulated data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data exhibit strong and reproducible statistical structure. This has motivated the development of large-scale foundation models, such as TranscriptFormer, that use transformer-based architectures to learn a generative model for gene expression by embedding genes into a latent vector space. These embeddings have been used to obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on downstream tasks such as cell-type classification, disease-state prediction, and cross-species learning. Here, we ask whether similar performance can be achieved without utilizing computationally intensive deep learning-based representations. Using simple, interpretable pipelines that rely on careful normalization and linear methods, we obtain SOTA or near SOTA performance across multiple benchmarks commonly used to evaluate single-cell foundation models, including outperforming foundation models on out-of-distribution tasks involving novel cell types and organisms absent from the training data. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking and suggest that the biology of cell identity can be captured by simple linear representations of single cell gene expression data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanja Karilanova, Maxime Fabre, Emre Neftci, Ay\c{c}a \"Oz\c{c}elikkale</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically-inspired deep neural networks that efficiently extract temporal information while offering promising gains in terms of energy efficiency and latency when deployed on neuromorphic devices. SNN parameters are sensitive to temporal resolution, leading to significant performance drops when the temporal resolution of target data during deployment is not the same as that of the source data used for training, especially when fine-tuning with the target data is not possible during deployment. To address this challenge, we propose three novel domain adaptation methods for adapting neuron parameters to account for the change in time resolution without re-training on target time resolution. The proposed methods are based on a mapping between neuron dynamics in SNNs and State Space Models (SSMs) and are applicable to general neuron models. We evaluate the proposed methods under spatio-temporal data tasks, namely the audio keyword spotting datasets SHD and MSWC, and the neuromorphic image NMINST dataset. Our methods provide an alternative to-and in most cases significantly outperform-the existing reference method that consists of scaling only the time constant. Notably, when the temporal resolution of the target data is double that of the source data, applying one of our proposed methods instead of the benchmark achieves classification accuracy of 89.5% instead of 53.0% on SHD, 93.6% instead of 38.8% on MSWC and 98.5% instead of 97.2% aon NMNIST. Moreover, our results show that high accuracy on high temporal resolution data can be obtained by time-efficient training on lower temporal resolution data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akiyoshi Tomihari, Issei Sato</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers are difficult to optimize with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and largely rely on adaptive optimizers such as Adam. Despite their empirical success, the reasons behind Adam's superior performance over SGD remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyze the optimization of Transformer models through the lens of \emph{gradient heterogeneity}, defined as the variation in gradient norms across parameter blocks. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that gradient heterogeneity, together with Hessian heterogeneity, degrades the convergence of gradient-based methods such as SGD, while sign-based methods are substantially less sensitive to this effect. Adam's coordinate-wise normalization makes its update directions depend mainly on gradient signs, so Adam can be interpreted as a soft variant of SignSGD. Our analysis uses the fact that SGD and SignSGD follow steepest descent directions under different norms, and derives upper bounds on the iteration complexity with implications for learning rate scaling in SignSGD. We further investigate the origin of gradient heterogeneity in Transformer architectures and show that it is strongly influenced by the placement of layer normalization, with Post-LN architectures exhibiting particularly pronounced heterogeneity. Experimental results from fine-tuning Transformers in both NLP and vision domains validate our theoretical analysis. Code is available at https://github.com/tom4649/gradient-heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongkyu Cho, Taesup Moon, Rumi Chunara, Kyunghyun Cho, Sungmin Cha</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has traditionally focused on minimizing exemplar memory, a constraint often misaligned with modern systems where GPU time, not storage, is the primary bottleneck. This paper challenges this paradigm by investigating a more realistic regime: one where memory is abundant enough to mitigate forgetting, but full retraining from scratch remains prohibitively expensive. In this practical "middle ground", we find that the core challenge shifts from stability to plasticity, as models become biased toward prior tasks and struggle to learn new ones. Conversely, improved stability allows simple replay baselines to outperform the state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the GPU cost. To address this newly surfaced trade-off, we propose Weight Space Consolidation, a lightweight method that combines (1) rank-based parameter resets to restore plasticity with (2) weight averaging to enhance stability. Validated on both class-incremental learning with image classifiers and continual instruction tuning with large language models, our approach outperforms strong baselines while matching the low computational cost of replay, offering a scalable alternative to expensive full-retraining. These findings challenge long-standing CL assumptions and establish a new, cost-efficient baseline for real-world CL systems where exemplar memory is no longer the limiting factor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibram Abdelmalak, Kiran Madhusudhanan, Jungmin Choi, Christian Kloetergens, Vijaya Krishna Yalavarit, Maximilian Stubbemann, Lars Schmidt-Thieme</p>
<p>Abstract: In Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), the lookback window is a critical hyperparameter often set arbitrarily, undermining the validity of model evaluations. We argue that the lookback window must be tuned on a per-task basis to ensure fair comparisons. Our empirical results show that failing to do so can invert performance rankings, particularly when comparing univariate and multivariate methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks reposition Channel-Independent (CI) models, such as PatchTST, as state-of-the-art methods. However, we reveal this superior performance is largely an artifact of weak inter-channel correlations and simplicity of patterns within these specific datasets. Using Granger causality analysis and ODE datasets (with implicit channel correlations), we demonstrate that the true strength of multivariate Channel-Dependent (CD) models emerges on datasets with strong, inherent cross-channel dependencies, where they significantly outperform CI models. We conclude with four key recommendations for improving TSF research: (i) consider the lookback window as a key hyperparameter to tune, (ii) for standard datasets, examining CI architectures is advantageous, (iii) leverage statistical analysis of datasets to guide the choice between CI and CD architectures, and (iv) prefer CD models in scenarios with limited data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rosie Zhao, Tian Qin, David Alvarez-Melis, Sham Kakade, Naomi Saphra</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models famously improve under a smooth scaling law, but some specific capabilities exhibit sudden breakthroughs in performance. Advocates of "emergence" view these capabilities as unlocked at a specific scale, but others attribute breakthroughs to superficial metric thresholding effects. We propose that breakthroughs are instead driven by continuous changes in the probability distribution of training outcomes when performance is bimodally distributed across random seeds. we show that different random seeds can produce either smooth or emergent scaling trends in synthetic length generalization tasks, multiple choice question answering, and grammatical generalization. We reveal that sharp breakthroughs in metrics are produced by underlying continuous changes in their distribution across seeds. These distributions may become abruptly bimodal at a capacity threshold but this threshold appears at scales well before most seeds achieve breakthrough. Our observations hold true even under continuous loss metrics, confirming that random variation must be considered when predicting a model's performance from its scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghun Yu, Jin-Hyun Ahn, Joonhyuk Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful framework for privacy-preserving distributed learning. It enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, handling noisy labels in FL remains a major challenge due to heterogeneous data distributions and communication constraints, which can severely degrade model performance. To address this issue, we propose FedEFC, a novel method designed to tackle the impact of noisy labels in FL. FedEFC mitigates this issue through two key techniques: (1) prestopping, which prevents overfitting to mislabeled data by dynamically halting training at an optimal point, and (2) loss correction, which adjusts model updates to account for label noise. In particular, we develop an effective loss correction tailored to the unique challenges of FL, including data heterogeneity and decentralized training. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis, leveraging the composite proper loss property, to demonstrate that the FL objective function under noisy label distributions can be aligned with the clean label distribution. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it consistently outperforms existing FL techniques in mitigating the impact of noisy labels, particularly under heterogeneous data settings (e.g., achieving up to 41.64% relative performance improvement over the existing loss correction method).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shutong Chen, Tianyi Zhou, Guodong Long, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: One global model in federated learning (FL) might not be sufficient to serve many clients with non-IID tasks and distributions. While there has been advances in FL to train multiple global models for better personalization, they only provide limited choices to clients so local finetuning is still indispensable. In this paper, we propose a novel ``FedMerge'' approach that can create a personalized model per client by simply merging multiple global models with automatically optimized and customized weights. In FedMerge, a few global models can serve many non-IID clients, even without further local finetuning. We formulate this problem as a joint optimization of global models and the merging weights for each client. Unlike existing FL approaches where the server broadcasts one or multiple global models to all clients, the server only needs to send a customized, merged model to each client. Moreover, instead of periodically interrupting the local training and re-initializing it to a global model, the merged model aligns better with each client's task and data distribution, smoothening the local-global gap between consecutive rounds caused by client drift. We evaluate FedMerge on three different non-IID settings applied to different domains with diverse tasks and data types, in which FedMerge consistently outperforms existing FL approaches, including clustering-based and mixture-of-experts (MoE) based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiran You, Hongyang Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) pose critical challenges for intelligent management due to the diverse user requirements and time-varying wireless conditions. These factors introduce significant decision complexity, which limits the adaptability of existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods. In many DRL algorithms, especially those involving value-based or actor-critic structures, the critic component plays a key role in guiding policy learning by estimating value functions. However, conventional critic models often use shallow architectures that map observations directly to scalar estimates, limiting their ability to handle multi-task complexity. In contrast, recent progress in inference-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown that generating intermediate reasoning steps can significantly improve decision quality. Motivated by this, we propose ReaCritic, a reasoning transformer-based critic-model scaling scheme that brings reasoning-like ability into DRL. ReaCritic performs horizontal reasoning over parallel state-action inputs and vertical reasoning through deep transformer stacks. It is compatible with a broad range of value-based and actor-critic DRL algorithms and enhances generalization in dynamic wireless environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaCritic improves convergence speed and final performance across various HetNet settings and standard OpenAI Gym control tasks. The code of ReaCritic is available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/ReaCritic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in deep generative modeling have made it increasingly plausible to train human-level embodied agents. Yet progress has been limited by the absence of large-scale, real-time, multi-modal, and socially interactive datasets that reflect the sensory-motor complexity of natural environments. To address this, we present PLAICraft, a novel data collection platform and dataset capturing multiplayer Minecraft interactions across five time-aligned modalities: video, game output audio, microphone input audio, mouse, and keyboard actions. Each modality is logged with millisecond time precision, enabling the study of synchronous, embodied behaviour in a rich, open-ended world. The dataset comprises over 10,000 hours of gameplay from more than 10,000 global participants. Alongside the dataset, we provide an evaluation suite for benchmarking model capabilities in object recognition, spatial awareness, language grounding, and long-term memory. PLAICraft opens a path toward training and evaluating agents that act fluently and purposefully in real time, paving the way for truly embodied artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihan Chen, Dan Zhao, Jongwoo Ko, Colby Banbury, Huiping Zhuang, Luming Liang, Pashmina Cameron, Tianyi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs) make efficient inference and activation strategies increasingly critical. While recent approaches, such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), leverage selective activation but require specialized training, training-free sparse activation methods offer broader applicability and superior resource efficiency through their plug-and-play design. However, many existing methods rely solely on hidden state magnitudes to determine activation, resulting in high approximation errors and suboptimal inference accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose WINA (Weight Informed Neuron Activation), a novel, simple, and training-free sparse activation framework that jointly considers hidden state magnitudes and the column-wise $\ell_2$-norms of weight matrices. We show that this leads to a sparsification strategy that obtains optimal approximation error bounds with theoretical guarantees tighter than existing techniques. Empirically, WINA also outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., TEAL) by up to $2.94\%$ in average performance at the same sparsity levels, across a diverse set of LLM architectures and datasets. These results position WINA as a new performance frontier for training-free sparse activation in LLM inference, advancing training-free sparse activation methods and setting a robust baseline for efficient inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Poiani, Martino Bernasconi, Andrea Celli</p>
<p>Abstract: In pure exploration problems, a statistician sequentially collects information to answer a question about some stochastic and unknown environment. The probability of returning a wrong answer should not exceed a maximum risk parameter $\delta$ and good algorithms make as few queries to the environment as possible. The Track-and-Stop algorithm is a pioneering method to solve these problems. Specifically, it is well-known that it enjoys asymptotic optimality sample complexity guarantees for $\delta\to 0$ whenever the map from the environment to its correct answers is single-valued (e.g., best-arm identification with a unique optimal arm). The Sticky Track-and-Stop algorithm extends these results to settings where, for each environment, there might exist multiple correct answers (e.g., $\epsilon$-optimal arm identification). Although both methods are optimal in the asymptotic regime, their non-asymptotic guarantees remain unknown. In this work, we fill this gap and provide non-asymptotic guarantees for both algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungjoon Lee, Suhwan Kim, Minhyeon Oh, Youngsik Yoon, Jungseul Ok</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based planning has advanced embodied agents in long-horizon environments such as Minecraft, where acquiring latent knowledge of goal (or item) dependencies and feasible actions is critical. However, LLMs often begin with flawed priors and fail to correct them through prompting, even with feedback. We present XENON (eXpErience-based kNOwledge correctioN), an agent that algorithmically revises knowledge from experience, enabling robustness to flawed priors and sparse binary feedback. XENON integrates two mechanisms: Adaptive Dependency Graph, which corrects item dependencies using past successes, and Failure-aware Action Memory, which corrects action knowledge using past failures. Together, these components allow XENON to acquire complex dependencies despite limited guidance. Experiments across multiple Minecraft benchmarks show that XENON outperforms prior agents in both knowledge learning and long-horizon planning. Remarkably, with only a 7B open-weight LLM, XENON surpasses agents that rely on much larger proprietary models. Project page: https://sjlee-me.github.io/XENON</p>

<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-experts networks (MoEs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in modern deep learning. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical foundations underlying their ability to model complex tasks remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the expressive power of MoEs in modeling complex tasks with two common structural priors: low-dimensionality and sparsity. For shallow MoEs, we prove that they can efficiently approximate functions supported on low-dimensional manifolds, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. For deep MoEs, we show that $\mathcal{O}(L)$-layer MoEs with $E$ experts per layer can approximate piecewise functions comprising $E^L$ pieces with compositional sparsity, i.e., they can exhibit an exponential number of structured tasks. Our analysis reveals the roles of critical architectural components and hyperparameters in MoEs, including the gating mechanism, expert networks, the number of experts, and the number of layers, and offers natural suggestions for MoE variants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Makoto Shing, Masanori Koyama, Takuya Akiba</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end backpropagation requires storing activations throughout all layers, creating memory bottlenecks that limit model scalability. Existing block-wise training methods offer means to alleviate this problem, but they rely on ad-hoc local objectives and remain largely unexplored beyond classification tasks. We propose $\textit{DiffusionBlocks}$, a principled framework for transforming transformer-based networks into genuinely independent trainable blocks that maintain competitive performance with end-to-end training. Our key insight leverages the fact that residual connections naturally correspond to updates in a dynamical system. With minimal modifications to this system, we can convert the updates to those of a denoising process, where each block can be learned independently by leveraging the score matching objective. This independence enables training with gradients for only one block at a time, thereby reducing memory requirements in proportion to the number of blocks. Our experiments on a range of transformer architectures (vision, diffusion, autoregressive, recurrent-depth, and masked diffusion) demonstrate that DiffusionBlocks training matches the performance of end-to-end training while enabling scalable block-wise training on practical tasks beyond small-scale classification. DiffusionBlocks provides a theoretically grounded approach that successfully scales to modern generative tasks across diverse architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolin Liu, Adrien Siproudhis, Samuel Experton, Peter Lorenz, Christina Boura, Thomas Peyrin</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network model extraction has recently emerged as an important security concern, as adversaries attempt to recover a network's parameters via black-box queries. Carlini et al. proposed in CRYPTO'20 a model extraction approach, consisting of two steps: signature extraction and sign extraction. However, in practice this signature-extraction method is limited to very shallow networks only, and the proposed sign-extraction method is exponential in time. Recently, Canales-Martinez et al. (Eurocrypt'24) proposed a polynomial-time sign-extraction method, but it assumes the corresponding signatures have already been successfully extracted and can fail on so-called low-confidence neurons.
  In this work, we first revisit and refine the signature extraction process by systematically identifying and addressing for the first time critical limitations of Carlini et al.'s signature-extraction method. These limitations include rank deficiency and noise propagation from deeper layers. To overcome these challenges, we propose efficient algorithmic solutions for each of the identified issues. Our approach permits the extraction of much deeper networks than previously possible. In addition, we propose new methods to improve numerical precision in signature extraction, and enhance the sign extraction part by combining two polynomial methods to avoid exponential exhaustive search in the case of low-confidence neurons. This leads to the very first end-to-end model extraction method that runs in polynomial time.
  We validate our attack through extensive experiments on ReLU-based neural networks, demonstrating significant improvements in extraction depth. For instance, our attack extracts consistently at least eight layers of neural networks trained on either the MNIST or CIFAR-10 datasets, while previous works could barely extract the first three layers of networks of similar width.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuta Sato, Kazuhiko Kawamoto, Hiroshi Kera</p>
<p>Abstract: The chain of thought, i.e., step-by-step reasoning, is one of the fundamental mechanisms of Transformers. While the design of intermediate reasoning steps has been extensively studied and shown to critically influence performance on mathematical, multi-step reasoning tasks, the ordering of these steps has received little attention, despite its significant effect on the difficulty of reasoning. This study addresses a novel task of unraveling the chain of thought -- reordering decoder input tokens into a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers, for learning arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space grows factorially in sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on seven order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior studies for the multiplication task.</p>

We point out the theoretical challenges of such tasks and review the main approaches in stochastic approximation algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the benchmark by implementing and comparing three recently proposed, but as-of-yet unimplemented, algorithms both in terms of optimization performance, and fairness improvement.

It imposes minimal assumptions about task specifications and decouples the definition of dataset, deep neural network architecture, and interpretability technique through well defined interfaces. This ensures the ease of importing new datasets, custom architectures, and the definition of different interpretability paradigms while maintaining on-the-fly modeling and interpretation of different aspects of a user's own time series data. KnowIt aims to provide an environment where users can perform knowledge discovery on their own complex time series data through building powerful deep learning models and explaining their behavior. With ongoing development, collaboration and application our goal is to make this a platform to progress this underexplored field and produce a trusted tool for deep time series modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics, neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD) have been proposed; however, they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise, resulting in spurious causal inferences in real data. In this paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of many real-world time series follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the extraction of power-law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures, demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Fumanal-Idocin, Raquel Fernandez-Peralta, Javier Andreu-Perez</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) addresses budget constraints in decision-making by sequentially acquiring features for each instance, making it appealing for resource-limited scenarios. However, existing DFS methods require models specifically designed for the sequential acquisition setting, limiting compatibility with models already deployed in practice. Furthermore, they provide limited uncertainty quantification, undermining trust in high-stakes decisions. In this work, we show that DFS introduces new uncertainty sources compared to the static setting. We formalise how model adaptation to feature subsets induces epistemic uncertainty, how standard imputation strategies bias aleatoric uncertainty estimation, and why predictive confidence fails to discriminate between good and bad selection policies. We also propose a model-agnostic DFS framework compatible with pre-trained classifiers, including interpretable-by-design models, through efficient subset reparametrization strategies. Empirical evaluation on tabular and image datasets demonstrates competitive accuracy against state-of-the-art greedy and reinforcement learning-based DFS methods with both neural and rule-based classifiers. We further show that the identified uncertainty sources persist across most existing approaches, highlighting the need for uncertainty-aware DFS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning (ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML). At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners, complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research communities. To address this gap, we present the first systematization of knowledge (SoK) for DMML. We introduce a general framework for DMML, encompassing a unified data pipeline, adversarial models, and points of minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review data minimization literature as well as DM-adjacent methodologies whose link to DM was often overlooked. Our structured overview is designed to help practitioners and researchers effectively adopt and apply DM principles in ML, by helping them identify relevant techniques and understand underlying assumptions and trade-offs through a DM-centric lens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nitish Nagesh, Salar Shakibhamedan, Mahdi Bagheri, Ziyu Wang, Nima TaheriNejad, Axel Jantsch, Amir M. Rahmani</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic healthcare data generation offers a promising solution to research limitations in clinical settings caused by privacy and regulatory constraints. However, current synthetic data generation approaches require specialized knowledge about training generative models and require high computational resources. In this paper, we propose FairTabGen, an LLM-based tabular data generation framework that produces high-quality synthetic healthcare data using only a small subset of the original dataset. Our method combines in-context learning, prompt curation and embedding structural constraints for data synthesis. We evaluate performance on MIMIC-IV dataset. Our method using 99% less data and achieving 50% improvement for fairness through unawareness while maintaining competitive predictive utility. However, we observe data distribution of racial groups is skewed affecting demographic parity. We thereafter apply bias mitigation algorithms in the pre-processing stage, improving overall fairness by 10% highlighting effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ismail Lamaakal, Chaymae Yahyati, Khalid El Makkaoui, Ibrahim Ouahbi, Yassine Maleh</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is a key missing piece for on-device monitoring in TinyML: microcontrollers must detect failures, distribution shift, or accuracy drops under strict flash/latency budgets, yet common uncertainty approaches (deep ensembles, MC dropout, early exits, temporal buffering) typically require multiple passes, extra branches, or state that is impractical on milliwatt hardware. This paper proposes a novel and practical method, SNAP-UQ, for single-pass, label-free uncertainty estimation based on depth-wise next-activation prediction. SNAP-UQ taps a small set of backbone layers and uses tiny int8 heads to predict the mean and scale of the next activation from a low-rank projection of the previous one; the resulting standardized prediction error forms a depth-wise surprisal signal that is aggregated and mapped through a lightweight monotone calibrator into an actionable uncertainty score. The design introduces no temporal buffers or auxiliary exits and preserves state-free inference, while increasing deployment footprint by only a few tens of kilobytes. Across vision and audio backbones, SNAP-UQ reduces flash and latency relative to early-exit and deep-ensemble baselines (typically $\sim$40--60% smaller and $\sim$25--35% faster), with several competing methods at similar accuracy often exceeding MCU memory limits. On corrupted streams, it improves accuracy-drop event detection by multiple AUPRC points and maintains strong failure detection (AUROC $\approx 0.9$) in a single forward pass. By grounding uncertainty in layer-to-layer dynamics rather than solely in output confidence, SNAP-UQ offers a novel, resource-efficient basis for robust TinyML monitoring.

<p>Abstract: Activation sparsity is an intriguing property of deep neural networks that has been extensively studied in ReLU-based models, due to its advantages for efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However, methods relying on exact zero activations do not directly apply to modern Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to fragmented, model-specific strategies for LLM activation sparsity and a gap in its general understanding. In this work, we introduce a general framework for evaluating sparsity robustness in contemporary LLMs and conduct a systematic investigation of this phenomenon in their feedforward~(FFN) layers. Our results uncover universal properties of activation sparsity across diverse model families and scales. Importantly, we observe that the potential for effective activation sparsity grows with model size, highlighting its increasing relevance as models scale. Furthermore, we present the first study of activation sparsity in diffusion-based LLMs. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive perspective and practical guidance for harnessing activation sparsity in LLM design and acceleration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujun Zhou, Zhenwen Liang, Haolin Liu, Wenhao Yu, Kishan Panaganti, Linfeng Song, Dian Yu, Xiangliang Zhang, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing self-improvement approaches primarily rely on self-confirmation signals (e.g., confidence, entropy, or consistency) to generate rewards. This reliance drives models toward over-confident, majority-favored solutions, causing an entropy collapse that degrades pass@n and reasoning complexity. To address this, we propose EVOL-RL, a label-free framework that mirrors the evolutionary principle of balancing selection with variation. Concretely, EVOL-RL retains the majority-voted answer as an anchor for stability, but adds a novelty-aware reward that scores each sampled solution by how different its reasoning is from other concurrently generated responses. This majority-for-stability + novelty-for-exploration rule mirrors the variation-selection principle: selection prevents drift, while novelty prevents collapse. Evaluation results show that EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the majority-only baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from baseline's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5% to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents in-domain diversity collapse but also improves out-of-domain generalization (from math reasoning to broader tasks, e.g., MMLU-Pro and BBEH).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Jin, Qitan Shi, Yuantao Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral, but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction, diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it consistently improves both quality and diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shane Bergsma, Nolan Dey, Joel Hestness</p>
<p>Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the *training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of *when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be *predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankitkumar Joshi, Milos Hauskrecht</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear what the true benefits of some of these architectures are, and whether clever modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i) observation-triggered reset to account for the new observation, and (ii) time-triggered reset that relies on learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can indeed achieve competitive or superior performance compared to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational overhead in the online deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Bethell, Simos Gerasimou, Radu Calinescu, Calum Imrie</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qilin Ye, Deqing Fu, Robin Jia, Vatsal Sharan</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified Transformer architecture, the Disentangled Transformer, and prove that an $L$-layer model can compute connectivity in graphs with diameters up to $3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the adjacency matrix. By analyzing training dynamics, we prove that whether the model learns this strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of the algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically show that restricting training data to stay within a model's capacity makes both standard and Disentangled Transformers learn the exact algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prajit Bhaskaran, Tom Viering</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster. Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data, outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable and flexible Bayesian clustering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoke Huang, Ningsen Wang, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Yuyin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable, high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures, captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema; a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over 14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions. Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of 55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA, outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable medical VQA training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanning Zeng, Zhaoyi Zhou, Daman Arora, Andrea Zanette</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using policy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods typically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean reward for each prompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (baseline), reducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator. In practice, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages computed from the generations for each prompt in a batch. Motivated by Stein's paradox, we propose shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt means to improve per-prompt mean estimation accuracy, especially in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we construct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance policy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our baseline is a drop-in replacement for standard per-prompt mean baselines and requires no additional hyperparameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines consistently outperform empirical-mean baselines, producing lower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient training based on low-rank optimization has become a highly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep learning models. However, these methods often fail for low-rank pre-training, where simultaneously maintaining low-rank weight structure and optimizing the task objective remains challenging. We propose the $\textit{Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer}$ ($\texttt{Q3R}$), which leads to a novel low-rank-inducing training strategy inspired by the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) framework. $\texttt{Q3R}$ is based on a quadratic regularizer term that majorizes a smoothed log-determinant rank surrogate. Unlike other low-rank training techniques, $\texttt{Q3R}$ can train weight matrices to prescribed low target ranks while achieving predictive performance comparable to dense models, with small computational overhead and full compatibility with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrate a $\texttt{Q3R}$-regularized ViT-Tiny experiment where truncating the model to $60\%$ and $80\%$ of its parameters results in only minor absolute accuracy drops of $1.3\%$ and $4\%$, respectively, on CIFAR-10. We confirm the efficacy of $\texttt{Q3R}$ on Transformers across both vision and language tasks, including low-rank fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their effectiveness on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed an algorithmic framework for variational quantum kernels utilizing resource-efficient ans\"atze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real-world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our results show that the proposed quantum kernels demonstrate competitive classification accuracy compared to standard classical kernels in classical simulation, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical performance of quantum methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many bioacoustics, neuroscience, and linguistics research utilize birdsongs as proxy models to acquire knowledge in diverse areas. Developing models generally requires precisely annotated data at the level of syllables. Hence, automated and data-efficient methods that reduce annotation costs are in demand. This work presents a lightweight, yet performant neural network architecture for birdsong annotation called Residual-MLP-RNN. Then, it presents a robust three-stage training pipeline for developing reliable deep birdsong syllable detectors with minimal expert labor. The first stage is self-supervised learning from unlabeled data. Two of the most successful pretraining paradigms are explored, namely, masked prediction and online clustering. The second stage is supervised training with effective data augmentations to create a robust model for frame-level syllable detection. The third stage is semi-supervised post-training, which leverages the unlabeled data again. However, unlike the initial phase, this time it is aligned with the downstream task. The performance of this data-efficient approach is demonstrated for the complex song of the Canary in extreme label-scarcity scenarios. Canary has one of the most difficult songs to annotate, which implicitly validates the method for other birds. Finally, the potential of self-supervised embeddings is assessed for linear probing and unsupervised birdsong analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bastien Vuillod, Pierre-Alain Moellic, Jean-Max Dutertre</p>
<p>Abstract: Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Forkel, Constantin Ruhdorfer, Andreas Bulling, Jakob Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: We prove that in any Dec-POMDP, sufficiently high entropy regularization ensures that policy gradient ascent with tabular softmax parametrization always converges, for any initialization, to the same joint policy, and that this joint policy is equivariant w.r.t. all symmetries of the Dec-POMDP. In particular, policies coming from different random seeds will be fully compatible, in that their cross-play returns are equal to their self-play returns. Through extensive empirical evaluation of independent PPO in the Hanabi, Overcooked, and Yokai environments, we find that the entropy coefficient has a massive influence on the cross-play returns between independently trained policies, and that the drop in self-play returns coming from increased entropy regularization can often be counteracted by greedifying the learned policies after training. In Hanabi we achieve a new SOTA in inter-seed cross-play this way. Despite clear limitations of this recipe, which we point out, both our theoretical and empirical results indicate that during hyperparameter sweeps in Dec-POMDPs, one should consider far higher entropy coefficients than is typically done.</p>

Classical aggregation rules assume euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, limiting their suitability for emerging quantum federated systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Graber, Victor Armegioiu, Rebecca Buller, Siddhartha Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive machine learning models generally excel on in-distribution data, but their performance degrades on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Reliable deployment therefore requires robust OOD detection, yet this is particularly challenging for irregular 3D graphs that combine continuous geometry with categorical identities and are unordered by construction. Here, we present a probabilistic OOD detection framework for complex 3D graph data built on a diffusion model that learns a density of the training distribution in a fully unsupervised manner. A key ingredient we introduce is a unified continuous diffusion over both 3D coordinates and discrete features: categorical identities are embedded in a continuous space and trained with cross-entropy, while the corresponding diffusion score is obtained analytically via posterior-mean interpolation from predicted class probabilities. This yields a single self-consistent probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) that produces per-sample log-likelihoods, providing a principled typicality score for distribution shift. We validate the approach on protein-ligand complexes and construct strict OOD datasets by withholding entire protein families from training. PF-ODE likelihoods identify held-out families as OOD and correlate strongly with prediction errors of an independent binding-affinity model (GEMS), enabling a priori reliability estimates on new complexes. Beyond scalar likelihoods, we show that multi-scale PF-ODE trajectory statistics - including path tortuosity, flow stiffness, and vector-field instability - provide complementary OOD information. Modeling the joint distribution of these trajectory features yields a practical, high-sensitivity detector that improves separation over likelihood-only baselines, offering a label-free OOD quantification workflow for geometric deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomas Ortega, Chun-Yin Huang, Xiaoxiao Li, Hamid Jafarkhani</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), faces a significant bottleneck in the communication cost, particularly the uplink transmission of client-to-server updates, which is often constrained by asymmetric bandwidth limits at the edge. Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian J. Wetzel</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-injective functions are not globally invertible. However, they can often be restricted to locally injective subdomains where the inversion is well-defined. In many settings a preferred solution can be selected even when multiple valid preimages exist or input and output dimensions differ. This manuscript describes a natural reformulation of the inverse learning problem for non-injective functions as a collection of locally invertible problems. More precisely, Twin Neural Network Regression is trained to predict local inverse corrections around known anchor points. By anchoring predictions to points within the same locally invertible region, the method consistently selects a valid branch of the inverse. In contrast to current probabilistic state-of-the art inversion methods, Inverse Twin Neural Network Regression is a deterministic framework for resolving multi-valued inverse mappings. I demonstrate the approach on problems that are defined by mathematical equations or by data, including multi-solution toy problems and robot arm inverse kinematics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakash Gawas, Antoine Legrain, Louis-Martin Rousseau</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) provides a data-driven framework for approximating policies for large-scale combinatorial optimisation problems formulated as sequential decision problems (SDPs), where exact solution methods are computationally intractable. A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance. This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for imitation learning in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. The literature is classified along three principal dimensions: (i) treatment of uncertainty; (ii) level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. We further identify additional categories capturing other relevant expert characteristics. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) framework that accommodates multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.
  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints. Computational experiments compare learning outcomes across expert types and interaction regimes. The results show that policies learned from stochastic experts consistently outperform those learned from deterministic or full-information experts, while interactive learning improves solution quality using fewer expert demonstrations. Aggregated deterministic experts provide an effective alternative when stochastic optimisation becomes computationally challenging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feilong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are widely used for efficiency and conditional computation, but their effect on the geometry of learned functions and representations remains poorly understood. We study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as soft partitioning into overlapping expert-local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA spectral probe that analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting with exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully soft routing under matched capacity. Across random seeds, MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity: expert-local Jacobians show smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. Weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across more principal directions, indicating higher effective rank. We further observe low alignment among expert Jacobians, suggesting decomposition into low-overlap expert-specific transformations. Routing sharpness modulates these effects: Top-k routing yields more concentrated, lower-rank expert structure, while fully soft routing produces broader, higher-rank representations. Experiments on a 3-layer transformer with WikiText confirm curvature reduction on natural language and show lower cross-expert alignment for Top-k routing. These findings support interpreting MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance, yielding testable predictions for expert scaling, hallucination reduction, and ensemble diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Chen, Sihan Chen, Xiaoyi Qu, Dan Zhao, Ruomei Yan, Jongwoo Ko, Luming Liang, Pashmina Cameron</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential for deploying large models under strict memory and latency constraints, yet achieving stable and robust optimization at ultra-low bitwidths remains challenging. Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Efstratios Zaradoukas, Bardh Prenkaj, Gjergji Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: During pretraining, LLMs inadvertently memorize sensitive or copyrighted data, posing significant compliance challenges under legal frameworks like the GDPR and the EU AI Act. Fulfilling these mandates demands techniques that can remove information from a deployed model without retraining from scratch. Existing unlearning approaches attempt to address this need, but often leak the very data they aim to erase, sacrifice fluency and robustness, or depend on costly external reward models. We introduce PURGE (Policy Unlearning through Relative Group Erasure), a novel method grounded in the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework that formulates unlearning as a verifiable problem. PURGE uses an intrinsic reward signal that penalizes any mention of forbidden concepts, allowing safe and consistent unlearning. Our approach achieves up to x46 lower token usage per target than state-of-the-art methods, while improving fluency by +5.48% and adversarial robustness by +12.02% over the base model. Extensive evaluation on the Real World Knowledge Unlearning (RWKU) benchmark shows that PURGE reaches 11% unlearning effectiveness while preserving 98% of original utility. PURGE shows that framing LLM unlearning as a verifiable task enables more reliable, efficient, and scalable forgetting, suggesting a promising new direction for unlearning research that combines theoretical guarantees, improved safety, and practical deployment efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yadang Alexis Rouzoumka, Jean Pinsolle, Eug\'enie Terreaux, Christ\`ele Morisseau, Jean-Philippe Ovarlez, Chengfang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models learn a time-indexed score field $\mathbf{s}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)$ that often inherits approximate equivariances (flips, rotations, circular shifts) from in-distribution (ID) data and convolutional backbones. Most diffusion-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors exploit score magnitude or local geometry (energies, curvature, covariance spectra) and largely ignore equivariances. We introduce Group-Equivariant Posterior Consistency (GEPC), a training-free probe that measures how consistently the learned score transforms under a finite group $\mathcal{G}$, detecting equivariance breaking even when score magnitude remains unchanged. At the population level, we propose the ideal GEPC residual, which averages an equivariance-residual functional over $\mathcal{G}$, and we derive ID upper bounds and OOD lower bounds under mild assumptions. GEPC requires only score evaluations and produces interpretable equivariance-breaking maps. On OOD image benchmark datasets, we show that GEPC achieves competitive or improved AUROC compared to recent diffusion-based baselines while remaining computationally lightweight. On high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery where OOD corresponds to targets or anomalies in clutter, GEPC yields strong target-background separation and visually interpretable equivariance-breaking maps.

This work presents CardinalGraphFormer, a graph transformer augmented with a query-conditioned cardinality-preserving attention (CPA) channel that retains dynamic support-size signals complementary to static centrality embeddings. The approach combines structured sparse attention with Graphormer-inspired biases (shortest-path distance, centrality, direct-bond features) and unified dual-objective self-supervised pretraining (masked reconstruction and contrastive alignment of augmented views). Evaluation on 11 public benchmarks spanning MoleculeNet, OGB, and TDC ADMET demonstrates consistent improvements over protocol-matched baselines under matched pretraining, optimization, and hyperparameter tuning. Rigorous ablations confirm CPA's contributions and rule out simple size shortcuts. Code and reproducibility artifacts are provided.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autoregressive video diffusion, an emerging system algorithm bottleneck limits both deployability and generation capability: KV cache memory. In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: The multi-armed bandit problem is a core framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical algorithms often fail in environments with hidden, time-varying states that confound reward estimation and optimal action selection. We address key challenges arising from unobserved confounders, such as biased reward estimates and limited state information, by introducing a family of state-model-free bandit algorithms that leverage lagged contextual features and coordinated probing strategies. These implicitly track latent states and disambiguate state-dependent reward patterns. Our methods and their adaptive variants can learn optimal policies without explicit state modeling, combining computational efficiency with robust adaptation to non-stationary rewards. Empirical results across diverse settings demonstrate superior performance over classical approaches, and we provide practical recommendations for algorithm selection in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duc-Anh Nguyen, Nhien-An Le-Khac</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal multiview learning seeks to integrate information from diverse sources to enhance task performance. Existing approaches often struggle with flexible view configurations, including arbitrary view combinations, numbers of views, and heterogeneous modalities. Focusing on the context of human activity recognition, we propose AliAd, a model that combines multiview contrastive learning with a mixture-of-experts module to support arbitrary view availability during both training and inference. Instead of trying to reconstruct missing views, an adjusted center contrastive loss is used for self-supervised representation learning and view alignment, mitigating the impact of missing views on multiview fusion. This loss formulation allows for the integration of view weights to account for view quality. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity from $O(V^2)$ to $O(V)$, where $V$ is the number of views. To address residual discrepancies not captured by contrastive learning, we employ a mixture-of-experts module with a specialized load balancing strategy, tasked with adapting to arbitrary view combinations. We highlight the geometric relationship among components in our model and how they combine well in the latent space. AliAd is validated on four datasets encompassing inertial and human pose modalities, with the number of views ranging from three to nine, demonstrating its performance and flexibility.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09238">Feature salience -- not task-informativeness -- drives machine learning model explanations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedict Clark, Marta Oliveira, Rick Wilming, Stefan Haufe</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) promises to provide insight into machine learning models' decision processes, where one goal is to identify failures such as shortcut learning. This promise relies on the field's assumption that input features marked as important by an XAI must contain information about the target variable. However, it is unclear whether informativeness is indeed the main driver of importance attribution in practice, or if other data properties such as statistical suppression, novelty at test-time, or high feature salience substantially contribute. To clarify this, we trained deep learning models on three variants of a binary image classification task, in which translucent watermarks are either absent, act as class-dependent confounds, or represent class-independent noise. Results for five popular attribution methods show substantially elevated relative importance in watermarked areas (RIW) for all models regardless of the training setting ($R^2 \geq .45$). By contrast, whether the presence of watermarks is class-dependent or not only has a marginal effect on RIW ($R^2 \leq .03$), despite a clear impact impact on model performance and generalisation ability. XAI methods show similar behaviour to model-agnostic edge detection filters and attribute substantially less importance to watermarks when bright image intensities are encoded by smaller instead of larger feature values. These results indicate that importance attribution is most strongly driven by the salience of image structures at test time rather than statistical associations learned by machine learning models. Previous studies demonstrating successful XAI application should be reevaluated with respect to a possibly spurious concurrency of feature salience and informativeness, and workflows using feature attribution methods as building blocks should be scrutinised.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaditya Vikram Prasad, Connor Watts, Jack Merullo, Dhruvil Gala, Owen Lewis, Thomas McGrath, Ekdeep Singh Lubana</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models trained on large-scale datasets have been shown to learn features that encode abstract concepts such as factuality or intent. Such features are traditionally used for test-time monitoring or steering. We present an alternative affordance: features as scalable supervision for open-ended tasks. We consider the case of hallucination-reduction as a desirable, yet open-ended behavior and design a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline, titled RLFR (Reinforcement Learning from Feature Rewards), that uses features as reward functions. Grounded in a novel probing framework that identifies candidate hallucinated claims, our pipeline teaches a model to intervene and correct its completions when it is uncertain of their factuality. Furthermore, the pipeline enables scalable test-time compute, guided once more by our reward features. This end-to-end process operationalized on Gemma-3-12B-IT results in a policy that is 58% less likely to hallucinate compared to the original model (when run in tandem with our probing harness), while preserving performance on standard benchmarks. Taken together, by grounding supervision in the language of features, this paper introduces a novel paradigm in the use of interpretability for learning open-ended tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal models analyze spatial structures and temporal dynamics, which makes them prone to information degeneration among space and time. Prior literature has demonstrated that over-squashing in causal attention or temporal convolutions creates a bias on the first tokens. To analyze whether such a bias is present in temporal attention mechanisms, we derive sensitivity bounds on the expected value of the Jacobian of a temporal attention layer. We theoretically show how off-diagonal attention scores depend on the sequence length, and that temporal attention matrices suffer a diagonal attention sink. We suggest regularization methods, and experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jamie Mahowald, Brian Bell, Alex Ho, Michael Geyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural tangent kernel (NTK) methods are computationally limited by the need to evaluate large Jacobians across many data points. Existing approaches reduce this cost primarily through projecting and sketching the Jacobian. We show that NTK computation can also be reduced by compressing the data dimension itself using NTK-tuned dataset distillation. We demonstrate that the neural tangent space spanned by the input data can be induced by dataset distillation, yielding a 20-100$\times$ reduction in required Jacobian calculations. We further show that per-class NTK matrices have low effective rank that is preserved by this reduction. Building on these insights, we propose the distilled neural tangent kernel (DNTK), which combines NTK-tuned dataset distillation with state-of-the-art projection methods to reduce up NTK computational complexity by up to five orders of magnitude while preserving kernel structure and predictive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xander Davies, Giorgi Giglemiani, Edmund Lau, Eric Winsor, Geoffrey Irving, Yarin Gal</p>
<p>Abstract: Frontier LLMs are safeguarded against attempts to extract harmful information via adversarial prompts known as "jailbreaks". Recently, defenders have developed classifier-based systems that have survived thousands of hours of human red teaming. We introduce Boundary Point Jailbreaking (BPJ), a new class of automated jailbreak attacks that evade the strongest industry-deployed safeguards. Unlike previous attacks that rely on white/grey-box assumptions (such as classifier scores or gradients) or libraries of existing jailbreaks, BPJ is fully black-box and uses only a single bit of information per query: whether or not the classifier flags the interaction. To achieve this, BPJ addresses the core difficulty in optimising attacks against robust real-world defences: evaluating whether a proposed modification to an attack is an improvement. Instead of directly trying to learn an attack for a target harmful string, BPJ converts the string into a curriculum of intermediate attack targets and then actively selects evaluation points that best detect small changes in attack strength ("boundary points"). We believe BPJ is the first fully automated attack algorithm that succeeds in developing universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers, as well as the first automated attack algorithm that succeeds against GPT-5's input classifier without relying on human attack seeds. BPJ is difficult to defend against in individual interactions but incurs many flags during optimisation, suggesting that effective defence requires supplementing single-interaction methods with batch-level monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengzhi Hu, Jonas Dornbusch, David L\"udke, Stephan G\"unnemann, Leo Schwinn</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training for LLMs is one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against adversaries. However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT. We leverage Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, enabling generation of diverse, high-likelihood samples that address generalization failures. By combining optimization over the data distribution provided by the diffusion model with continuous adversarial training, DAT achieves substantially higher adversarial robustness than previous methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cocktail party problem is the scenario where it is difficult to separate or distinguish individual speaker from a mixed speech from several speakers. There have been several researches going on in this field but the size and complexity of the model is being traded off with the accuracy and robustness of speech separation. "Monaural multi-speaker speech separation" presents a speech-separation model based on the Transformer architecture and its efficient forms. The model has been trained with the LibriMix dataset containing diverse speakers' utterances. The model separates 2 distinct speaker sources from a mixed audio input. The developed model approaches the reduction in computational complexity of the speech separation model, with minimum tradeoff with the performance of prevalent speech separation model and it has shown significant movement towards that goal. This project foresees, a rise in contribution towards the ongoing research in the field of speech separation with computational efficiency at its core.</p>

Negotiation games enable us to study multi-turn, and cross-model interactions, modulate complexity, and side-step accidental evaluation data leakage. We use our approach to test six widely used and publicly accessible LMs, evaluating performance and alignment in both self-play and cross-play settings. Noteworthy findings include: (i) only closed-source models tested here were able to complete these tasks; (ii) cooperative bargaining games proved to be most challenging to the models; and (iii) even the most powerful models sometimes "lose" to weaker opponents</p>

Diffusion-based generative augmentation approaches present a promising solution to this issue, having been proven effective in advancing downstream medical recognition tasks. Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and sequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and neglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable synthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks. In this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid medical sequence classification. Specifically, we first design a multimodal conditions-guided sequence generator for controllably synthesizing diagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic and sequential levels. Extensive experiments on 3 medical datasets, using 11 networks trained on 3 paradigms, comprehensively analyze the effectiveness and generality of Ctrl-GenAug, particularly in underrepresented high-risk populations and out-domain conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuzanna Buchnajzer, Kacper Dobek, Stanis{\l}aw Hapke, Daniel Jankowski, Krzysztof Krawiec</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning architectures based on convolutional neural networks tend to rely on continuous, smooth features. While this characteristics provides significant robustness and proves useful in many real-world tasks, it is strikingly incompatible with the physical characteristic of the world, which, at the scale in which humans operate, comprises crisp objects, typically representing well-defined categories. This study proposes a class of neurosymbolic systems that learn by reconstructing images in terms of visual primitives and are thus forced to form high-level, structural explanations of them. When applied to the task of diagnosing abnormalities in histological imaging, the method proved superior to a conventional deep learning architecture in terms of classification accuracy, while being more transparent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huadong Tang, Youpeng Zhao, Yan Huang, Min Xu, Jun Wang, Qiang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: It is widely agreed that open-vocabulary-based approaches outperform classical closed-set training solutions for recognizing unseen objects in images for semantic segmentation. Existing open-vocabulary approaches leverage vision-language models, such as CLIP, to align visual features with rich semantic features acquired through pre-training on large-scale vision-language datasets. However, the text prompts employed in these methods are short phrases based on fixed templates, failing to capture comprehensive object attributes. Moreover, while the CLIP model excels at exploiting image-level features, it is less effective at pixel-level representation, which is crucial for semantic segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose to alleviate the above-mentioned issues by leveraging multiple large-scale models to enhance the alignment between fine-grained visual features and enriched linguistic features. Specifically, our method employs large language models (LLMs) to generate enriched language prompts with diverse visual attributes for each category, including color, shape/size, and texture/material. Additionally, for enhanced visual feature extraction, the SAM model is adopted as a supplement to the CLIP visual encoder through a proposed learnable weighted fusion strategy. Built upon these techniques, our method, termed LMSeg, achieves state-of-the-art performance across all major open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. The code will be made available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinnan Guo, Kapil Vaswani, Andrew Paverd, Peter Pietzuch</p>
<p>Abstract: In federated learning (FL), data providers jointly train a machine learning model without sharing their training data. This makes it challenging to provide verifiable claims about the trained FL model, e.g., related to the employed training data, any data sanitization, or the correct training algorithm-a malicious data provider can simply deviate from the correct training protocol without detection. While prior FL training systems have explored the use of trusted execution environments (TEEs) to protect the training computation, such approaches rely on the confidentiality and integrity of TEEs. The confidentiality guarantees of TEEs, however, have been shown to be vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, such as side-channel attacks. We describe VerifiableFL, a system for training FL models that establishes verifiable claims about trained FL models with the help of fine-grained runtime attestation proofs. Since these runtime attestation proofs only require integrity protection, VerifiableFL generates them using the new abstraction of exclaves. Exclaves are integrity-only execution environments, which do not contain software-managed secrets and thus are immune to data leakage attacks. VerifiableFL uses exclaves to attest individual data transformations during FL training without relying on confidentiality guarantees. The runtime attestation proofs then form an attested dataflow graph of the entire FL model training computation. The graph is checked by an auditor to ensure that the trained FL model satisfies its claims, such as the use of data sanitization by data providers or correct aggregation by the model provider. VerifiableFL extends NVFlare FL framework to use exclaves. We show that VerifiableFL introduces less than 12% overhead compared to unprotected FL training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Wu, Jia Hu, Geyong Min, Shiqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated their superiority and versatility in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), effectively adapting to various downstream tasks through further fine-tuning. Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising solution to address privacy and efficiency challenges in distributed training for PLMs on resource-constrained local devices. However, our measurements reveal two key limitations of FedPEFT: heterogeneous data across devices exacerbates performance degradation of low-rank adaptation, and a fixed parameter configuration results in communication inefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose FedARA, a novel adaptive rank allocation framework for federated parameter-efficient fine-tuning of language models. Specifically, FedARA employs truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) adaptation to enhance similar feature representation across clients, significantly mitigating the adverse effects of data heterogeneity. Subsequently, it utilizes dynamic rank allocation to progressively identify critical ranks, effectively improving communication efficiency. Lastly, it leverages rank-based module pruning to automatically remove inactive modules, steadily reducing local computational cost and memory usage in each federated learning round. Extensive experiments show that FedARA consistently outperforms baselines by an average of 6.95% to 8.49% across various datasets and models under heterogeneous data while significantly improving communication efficiency by 2.40$ \times$. Moreover, experiments on various edge devices demonstrate substantial decreases in total training time and energy consumption by up to 48.90% and 46.95%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jowaria Khan, Alexa Friedman, Sydney Evans, Rachel Klein, Runzi Wang, Katherine E. Manz, Kaley Beins, David Q. Andrews, Elizabeth Bondi-Kelly</p>
<p>Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental contaminants with significant public health impacts, yet large-scale monitoring remains severely limited due to the high cost and logistical challenges of field sampling. The lack of samples leads to difficulty simulating their spread with physical models and limited scientific understanding of PFAS transport in surface waters. Yet, rich geospatial and satellite-derived data describing land cover, hydrology, and industrial activity are widely available. We introduce FOCUS, a geospatial deep learning framework for PFAS contamination mapping that integrates sparse PFAS observations with large-scale environmental context, including priors derived from hydrological connectivity, land cover, source proximity, and sampling distance. These priors are integrated into a principled, noise-aware loss, yielding a robust training objective under sparse labels. Across extensive ablations, robustness analyses, and real-world validation, FOCUS consistently outperforms baselines including sparse segmentation, Kriging, and pollutant transport simulations, while preserving spatial coherence and scalability over large regions. Our results demonstrate how AI can support environmental science by providing screening-level risk maps that prioritize follow-up sampling and help connect potential sources to surface-water contamination patterns in the absence of complete physical models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jackie Baek, Hamsa Bastani, Shihan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the impact of strategic behavior in labor markets characterized by algorithmic monoculture, where firms compete for a shared pool of applicants using a common algorithmic evaluation. In this setting, "naive" hiring strategies lead to severe congestion, as firms collectively target the same high-scoring candidates. We model this competition as a game with capacity-constrained firms and fully characterize the set of Nash equilibria. We demonstrate that equilibrium strategies, which naturally diversify firms' interview targets, significantly outperform naive selection, increasing social welfare for both firms and applicants. Specifically, the Price of Naive Selection (welfare gain from strategy) grows linearly with the number of firms, while the Price of Anarchy (efficiency loss from decentralization) approaches 1, implying that the decentralized equilibrium is nearly socially optimal. Finally, we analyze convergence, and we show that a simple sequential best-response process converges to the desired equilibrium. However, we show that firms generally cannot infer the key input needed to compute best responses, namely congestion for specific candidates, from their own historical data alone. Consequently, to realize the welfare gains of strategic differentiation, algorithmic platforms must explicitly reveal congestion information to participating firms.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02642">Weight transport through spike timing for robust local gradients</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Timo Gierlich, Andreas Baumbach, Akos F. Kungl, Kevin Max, Mihai A. Petrovici</p>
<p>Abstract: In both machine learning and in computational neuroscience, plasticity in functional neural networks is frequently expressed as gradient descent on a cost. Often, this imposes symmetry constraints that are difficult to reconcile with local computation, as is required for biological networks or neuromorphic hardware. For example, wake-sleep learning in networks characterized by Boltzmann distributions assumes symmetric connectivity. Similarly, the error backpropagation algorithm is notoriously plagued by the weight transport problem between the representation and the error stream. Existing solutions such as feedback alignment circumvent the problem by deferring to the robustness of these algorithms to weight asymmetry. However, they scale poorly with network size and depth. We introduce spike-based alignment learning (SAL), a complementary learning rule for spiking neural networks, which uses spike timing statistics to extract and correct the asymmetry between effective reciprocal connections. Apart from being spike-based and fully local, our proposed mechanism takes advantage of noise. Based on an interplay between Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity, synapses can thereby recover the true local gradient. This also alleviates discrepancies that arise from neuron and synapse variability -- an omnipresent property of physical neuronal networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our mechanism using different spiking network models. First, SAL can significantly improve convergence to the target distribution in probabilistic spiking networks versus Hebbian plasticity alone. Second, in neuronal hierarchies based on cortical microcircuits, SAL effectively aligns feedback weights to the forward pathway, thus allowing the backpropagation of correct feedback errors. Third, our approach enables competitive performance in deep networks using only local plasticity for weight transport.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinon Goldshtein, Gal Perelman, Assaf Schuster, Avi Ostfeld</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into engineering workflows presents new opportunities for making computational tools more accessible. Especially where such tools remain underutilized due to technical or expertise barriers, such as water distribution system (WDS) management. This study introduces LLM-EPANET, an agent-based framework that enables natural language interaction with EPANET, the benchmark WDS simulator. The framework combines retrieval-augmented generation and multi-agent orchestration to automatically translate user queries into executable code, run simulations, and return structured results. A curated set of 69 benchmark queries is introduced to evaluate performance across state-of-the-art LLMs. Results show that LLMs can effectively support a wide range of modeling tasks, achieving 56-81% accuracy overall, and over 90% for simpler queries. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based modeling to democratize data-driven decision-making in the water sector through transparent, interactive AI interfaces.

This approach enables demand estimation even when researchers lack data on product attributes or when consumers value hard-to-quantify attributes such as visual design.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yipeng Sun, Linda-Sophie Schneider, Siyuan Mei, Jinhua Wang, Ge Hu, Mingxuan Gu, Chengze Ye, Fabian Wagner, Lan Song, Siming Bayer, Andreas Maier</p>
<p>Abstract: Noise in low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) can obscure important diagnostic details. While deep learning offers powerful denoising, supervised methods require impractical paired data, and self-supervised alternatives often use opaque, parameter-heavy networks that limit clinical trust. We propose Filter2Noise (F2N), a novel self-supervised framework for interpretable, zero-shot denoising from a single LDCT image. Instead of a black-box network, its core is an Attention-Guided Bilateral Filter, a transparent, content-aware mathematical operator. A lightweight attention module predicts spatially varying filter parameters, making the process transparent and allowing interactive radiologist control. To learn from a single image with correlated noise, we introduce a multi-scale self-supervised loss coupled with Euclidean Local Shuffle (ELS) to disrupt noise patterns while preserving anatomical integrity. On the Mayo Clinic LDCT Challenge, F2N achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming competing zero-shot methods by up to 3.68 dB in PSNR. It accomplishes this with only 3.6k parameters, orders of magnitude fewer than competing models, which accelerates inference and simplifies deployment. By combining high performance with transparency, user control, and high parameter efficiency, F2N offers a trustworthy solution for LDCT enhancement. We further demonstrate its applicability by validating it on clinical photon-counting CT data. Code is available at: https://github.com/sypsyp97/Filter2Noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Baumann, Leonardo Ayala, Silvia Seidlitz, Jan Sellner, Alexander Studier-Fischer, Berkin \"Ozdemir, Lena Maier-Hein, Slobodan Ilic</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce CARL, a model for Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic representation, we introduce a novel spectral encoder, featuring a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism, to distill salient spectral information into learned spectral representations. Spatio-spectral pre-training is achieved with a novel feature-based self-supervision strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.

<p>Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for manual optimization. Audio examples are available on our demo page (https://ntt-hilab-gensp.github.io/is2025voiceimpression/).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josh Qixuan Sun, Xiaoying Xing, Huaiyuan Weng, Chul Min Yeum, Mark Crowley</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive, multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation, and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15 open-source models across 4 families, under five prompting strategies: zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-based, and chain-of-thought. Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as a scoring function for best-of-N selection, we fine-tune 3 lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally constrained literary texts.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games, we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured, language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meshi Bashari, Yonghoon Lee, Roy Maor Lotan, Edgar Dobriban, Yaniv Romano</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of high-quality synthetic data -- generated by advanced AI models or collected as auxiliary data from related tasks -- presents both opportunities and challenges for statistical inference. This paper introduces a GEneral Synthetic-Powered Inference (GESPI) framework that wraps around any statistical inference procedure to safely enhance sample efficiency by combining synthetic and real data. Our framework leverages high-quality synthetic data to boost statistical power, yet adaptively defaults to the standard inference method using only real data when synthetic data is of low quality. The error of our method remains below a user-specified bound without any distributional assumptions on the synthetic data, and decreases as the quality of the synthetic data improves. This flexibility enables seamless integration with conformal prediction, risk control, hypothesis testing, and multiple testing procedures, all without modifying the base inference method. We demonstrate the benefits of our method on challenging tasks with limited labeled data, including AlphaFold protein structure prediction, and comparing large reasoning models on complex math problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanfeng Yang, Siwei Chen, Pingping Hu, Zhaotong Shen, Yingjie Zhang, Zhuoran Sun, Shuai Li, Ziqi Chen, Kenji Fukumizu</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. While recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance. Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models (CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow). Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance, capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Bandarkar, Chenyuan Yang, Mohsen Fayyaz, Junlin Hu, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the key to scaling modern LLMs, yet little is understood about how their sparse routing dynamics respond to multilingual data. In this work, we analyze expert routing patterns using parallel multilingual datasets and present highly interpretable layer-wise phenomena. We find that MoE models route tokens in language-specific ways in the early and late decoder layers but exhibit significant cross-lingual routing alignment in middle layers, mirroring parameter-sharing trends observed in dense LLMs. In particular, we reveal a clear, strong correlation between a model's performance in a given language and how similarly its tokens are routed to English in these layers. Extending beyond correlation, we explore inference-time interventions that induce higher cross-lingual routing alignment. We introduce a method that steers the router by promoting middle-layer task experts frequently activated in English, and it successfully increases multilingual performance. These 1-2% gains are remarkably consistent across two evaluation tasks, three models, and 15+ languages, especially given that these simple interventions override routers of extensively trained, state-of-the-art LLMs. In comparison, interventions outside of the middle layers or targeting multilingual-specialized experts only yield performance degradation. Altogether, we present numerous findings that explain how MoEs process non-English text and demonstrate that generalization is limited by the model's ability to leverage language-universal experts in all languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daiki Chijiwa, Taku Hasegawa, Kyosuke Nishida, Shin'ya Yamaguchi, Tomoya Ohba, Tamao Sakao, Susumu Takeuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. This framework allows language models with different tokenization to cooperate with each other efficiently by reduction to their maximal common vocabulary. Specifically, we empirically demonstrate its applicability to model ensemble with different tokenization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongzhi Zhang, Liqin Ye, Yuzhao Heng, Xiang Chen, Tong Yu, Lingkai Kong, Sudheer Chava, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM) outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods, however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks: preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angelo Giorgio Cavaliere, Riki Nagasawa, Shuta Yokoi, Tomoyuki Obuchi, Hajime Yoshino</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the components of relatively high rank tensors. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in completion of relatively high rank matrices for recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting in some specific cases. We also develop a replica theory to examine the performance of statistical inference in the dense limit based on a cumulant expansion. The latter approach allows one to avoid blind usage of Gaussian ansatz which fails in some fully connected systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aukosh Jagannath, Taj Jones-McCormick, Varnan Sarangian</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a high-dimensional scaling limit for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Polyak Momentum (SGD-M) and adaptive step-sizes. This provides a framework to rigourously compare online SGD with some of its popular variants. We show that the scaling limits of SGD-M coincide with those of online SGD after an appropriate time rescaling and a specific choice of step-size. However, if the step-size is kept the same between the two algorithms, SGD-M will amplify high-dimensional effects, potentially degrading performance relative to online SGD. We demonstrate our framework on two popular learning problems: Spiked Tensor PCA and Single Index Models. In both cases, we also examine online SGD with an adaptive step-size based on normalized gradients. In the high-dimensional regime, this algorithm yields multiple benefits: its dynamics admit fixed points closer to the population minimum and widens the range of admissible step-sizes for which the iterates converge to such solutions. These examples provide a rigorous account, aligning with empirical motivation, of how early preconditioners can stabilize and improve dynamics in settings where online SGD fails.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level. Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs. Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m - S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop an imaging algorithm that exploits strong scattering to achieve super-resolution in changing random media. The method processes large and diverse array datasets using sparse dictionary learning, clustering, and multidimensional scaling. Starting from random initializations, the algorithm reliably extracts the unknown medium properties necessary for accurate imaging using back-propagation, $\ell_2$ or $\ell_1$ methods. Remarkably, scattering enhances resolution beyond homogeneous medium limits. When abundant data are available, the algorithm allows the realization of super-resolution in imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Bou-Sakr-El-Tayar, Jason J. Bramburger, Matthew J. Colbrook</p>
<p>Abstract: Many data-driven algorithms in dynamical systems rely on ergodic averages that converge painfully slowly. One simple idea changes this: taper the ends. Weighted Birkhoff averages can converge much faster (sometimes superpolynomially, even exponentially) and can be incorporated seamlessly into existing methods. We demonstrate this with five weighted algorithms: weighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (wtDMD), weighted Extended DMD (wtEDMD), weighted Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (wtSINDy), weighted spectral measure estimation, and weighted diffusion forecasting. Across examples ranging from fluid flows to El Ni\~no data, the message is clear: weighting costs nothing, is easy to implement, and often delivers markedly better results from the same data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ho Jang, Jackson C. Glass, Gia-Wei Chern</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a flexible generative framework for modeling spin configurations in disordered yet strongly correlated phases of frustrated magnets. As a benchmark, we first demonstrate that an RBM can learn the zero-temperature ground-state manifold of the one-dimensional ANNNI model at its multiphase point, accurately reproducing its characteristic oscillatory and exponentially decaying correlations. We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking. These results highlight the utility of RBMs as generative models for learning constrained and highly frustrated magnetic states.</p>

<p>Abstract: The current literature on memorization in Natural Language Models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), poses severe security and privacy risks, as models tend to memorize personally identifying information (PIIs) from training data. We introduce Randomized Masked Fine-Tuning (RMFT), a novel privacy-preserving fine-tuning technique that reduces PII memorization while minimizing performance impact. Using the Enron Email Dataset, we demonstrate that RMFT achieves an 80.81% reduction in Total Extraction Rate and 80.17% reduction in Seen Extraction Rate compared to baseline fine-tuning, outperforming deduplication methods while maintaining only a 5.73% increase in perplexity. We present MaxTER, a Pareto-optimal evaluation framework for assessing privacy-utility tradeoffs, and show the performance of RMFT vs Deduplication by Area Under The Response Curve (AURC) metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Quadrio, Antonio Candelieri</p>
<p>Abstract: This thesis examines self-attention training through the lens of Optimal Transport (OT) and develops an OT-based alternative for tabular classification. The study tracks intermediate projections of the self-attention layer during training and evaluates their evolution using discrete OT metrics, including Wasserstein distance, Monge gap, optimality, and efficiency. Experiments are conducted on classification tasks with two and three classes, as well as on a biomedical dataset.
  Results indicate that the final self-attention mapping often approximates the OT optimal coupling, yet the training trajectory remains inefficient. Pretraining the MLP section on synthetic data partially improves convergence but is sensitive to their initialization. To address these limitations, an OT-based algorithm is introduced: it generates class-specific dummy Gaussian distributions, computes an OT alignment with the data, and trains an MLP to generalize this mapping. The method achieves accuracy comparable to Transformers while reducing computational cost and scaling more efficiently under standardized inputs, though its performance depends on careful dummy-geometry design. All experiments and implementations are conducted in R.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duc Hoang, Aarush Gupta, Philip Harris</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-latency, resource-efficient neural network inference on FPGAs is essential for applications demanding real-time capability and low power. Lookup table (LUT)-based neural networks are a common solution, combining strong representational power with efficient FPGA implementation. In this work, we introduce KANEL\'E, a framework that exploits the unique properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for FPGA deployment. Unlike traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs employ learnable one-dimensional splines with fixed domains as edge activations, a structure naturally suited to discretization and efficient LUT mapping. We present the first systematic design flow for implementing KANs on FPGAs, co-optimizing training with quantization and pruning to enable compact, high-throughput, and low-latency KAN architectures. Our results demonstrate up to a 2700x speedup and orders of magnitude resource savings compared to prior KAN-on-FPGA approaches. Moreover, KANEL\'E matches or surpasses other LUT-based architectures on widely used benchmarks, particularly for tasks involving symbolic or physical formulas, while balancing resource usage across FPGA hardware. Finally, we showcase the versatility of the framework by extending it to real-time, power-efficient control systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anshima Singh, David J. Silvester</p>
<p>Abstract: An adaptive sampling approach for efficient detection of bifurcation boundaries in parametrized fluid flow problems is presented herein. The study extends the machine-learning approach of Silvester~(J. Comput. Phys., 553 (2026), 114743), where a classifier network was trained on preselected simulation data to identify bifurcated and nonbifurcated flow regimes. In contrast, the proposed methodology introduces adaptivity through a flow-based deep generative model that automatically refines the sampling of the parameter space. The strategy has two components: a classifier network maps the flow parameters to a bifurcation probability, and a probability density estimation technique (KRnet) for the generation of new samples at each adaptive step. The classifier output provides a probabilistic measure of flow stability, and the Shannon entropy of these predictions is employed as an uncertainty indicator. KRnet is trained to approximate a probability density function that concentrates sampling in regions of high entropy, thereby directing computational effort towards the evolving bifurcation boundary. This coupling between classification and generative modeling establishes a feedback-driven adaptive learning process analogous to error-indicator based refinement in contemporary partial differential equation solution strategies. Starting from a uniform parameter distribution, the new approach achieves accurate bifurcation boundary identification with significantly fewer Navier--Stokes simulations, providing a scalable foundation for high-dimensional stability analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Bian, Grace Y. Yi, Wenqing He</p>
<p>Abstract: Boosting has garnered significant interest across both machine learning and statistical communities. Traditional boosting algorithms, designed for fully observed random samples, often struggle with real-world problems, particularly with interval-censored data. This type of data is common in survival analysis and time-to-event studies where exact event times are unobserved but fall within known intervals. Effective handling of such data is crucial in fields like medical research, reliability engineering, and social sciences. In this work, we introduce novel nonparametric boosting methods for regression and classification tasks with interval-censored data. Our approaches leverage censoring unbiased transformations to adjust loss functions and impute transformed responses while maintaining model accuracy. Implemented via functional gradient descent, these methods ensure scalability and adaptability. We rigorously establish their theoretical properties, including optimality and mean squared error trade-offs. Our proposed methods not only offer a robust framework for enhancing predictive accuracy in domains where interval-censored data are common but also complement existing work, expanding the applicability of existing boosting techniques. Empirical studies demonstrate robust performance across various finite-sample scenarios, highlighting the practical utility of our approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhou Fan, Leda Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the learning dynamics of a multi-pass, mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedure for empirical risk minimization in high-dimensional multi-index models with isotropic random data. In an asymptotic regime where the sample size $n$ and data dimension $d$ increase proportionally, for any sub-linear batch size $\kappa \asymp n^\alpha$ where $\alpha \in [0,1)$, and for a commensurate ``critical'' scaling of the learning rate, we provide an asymptotically exact characterization of the coordinate-wise dynamics of SGD. This characterization takes the form of a system of dynamical mean-field equations, driven by a scalar Poisson jump process that represents the asymptotic limit of SGD sampling noise. We develop an analogous characterization of the Stochastic Modified Equation (SME) which provides a Gaussian diffusion approximation to SGD.
  Our analyses imply that the limiting dynamics for SGD are the same for any batch size scaling $\alpha \in [0,1)$, and that under a commensurate scaling of the learning rate, dynamics of SGD, SME, and gradient flow are mutually distinct, with those of SGD and SME coinciding in the special case of a linear model. We recover a known dynamical mean-field characterization of gradient flow in a limit of small learning rate, and of one-pass/online SGD in a limit of increasing sample size $n/d \to \infty$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian P. Kr\"uger, Andrea Hunklinger, Adrian Wolny, Tim J. Adler, Igor Tetko, Santiago David Villalba</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing the structure of molecules to achieve desired properties is a central bottleneck across the chemical sciences, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where it underlies the discovery of new drugs. Since molecular property evaluation often relies on costly and rate-limited oracles, such as experimental assays, molecular optimization must be highly sample-efficient. To address this, we introduce SEISMO, an LLM agent that performs strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization, updating after every oracle call without the need for population-based or batched learning. SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls. Our additional medicinal-chemistry tasks show that providing explanatory feedback further improves efficiency, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to sample-efficient molecular optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damien Ferbach, Courtney Paquette, Gauthier Gidel, Katie Everett, Elliot Paquette</p>
<p>Abstract: In practice, the hyperparameters $(\beta_1, \beta_2)$ and weight-decay $\lambda$ in AdamW are typically kept at fixed values. Is there any reason to do otherwise? We show that for large-scale language model training, the answer is yes: by exploiting the power-law structure of language data, one can design time-varying schedules for $(\beta_1, \beta_2, \lambda)$ that deliver substantial performance gains.
  We study logarithmic-time scheduling, in which the optimizer's gradient memory horizon grows with training time. Although naive variants of this are unstable, we show that suitable damping mechanisms restore stability while preserving the benefits of longer memory. Based on this, we present ADANA, an AdamW-like optimizer that couples log-time schedules with explicit damping to balance stability and performance. We empirically evaluate ADANA across transformer scalings (45M to 2.6B parameters), comparing against AdamW, Muon, and AdEMAMix.
  When properly tuned, ADANA achieves up to 40% compute efficiency relative to a tuned AdamW, with gains that persist--and even improve--as model scale increases. We further show that similar benefits arise when applying logarithmic-time scheduling to AdEMAMix, and that logarithmic-time weight-decay alone can yield significant improvements. Finally, we present variants of ADANA that mitigate potential failure modes and improve robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: The phase ordering problem has been a long-standing challenge since the late 1970s, yet it remains an open problem due to having a vast optimization space and an unbounded nature, making it an open-ended problem without a finite solution, one can limit the scope by reducing the number and the length of optimizations. Traditionally, such locally optimized decisions are made by hand-coded algorithms tuned for a small number of benchmarks, often requiring significant effort to be retuned when the benchmark suite changes. In the past 20 years, Machine Learning has been employed to construct performance models to improve the selection and ordering of compiler optimizations, however, the approaches are not baked into the compiler seamlessly and never materialized to be leveraged at a fine-grained scope of code segments. This paper presents Protean Compiler: An agile framework to enable LLVM with built-in phase-ordering capabilities at a fine-grained scope. The framework also comprises a complete library of more than 140 handcrafted static feature collection methods at varying scopes, and the experimental results showcase speedup gains of up to 4.1% on average and up to 15.7% on select Cbench applications wrt LLVM's O3 by just incurring a few extra seconds of build time on Cbench. Additionally, Protean compiler allows for an easy integration with third-party ML frameworks and other Large Language Models, and this two-step optimization shows a gain of 10.1% and 8.5% speedup wrt O3 on Cbench's Susan and Jpeg applications. Protean compiler is seamlessly integrated into LLVM and can be used as a new, enhanced, full-fledged compiler. We plan to release the project to the open-source community in the near future.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful representation learning systems that align visual observations with natural language concepts, offering new opportunities for semantic reasoning in safety-critical autonomous driving. This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soham Bakshi, Sunrit Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of model collapse has presented new challenges in iterative training of generative models, where such training with synthetic data leads to an overall degradation of performance. This paper looks at the problem from a statistical viewpoint, illustrating that one can actually hope for improvement when models are trained on data contaminated with synthetic samples, as long as there is some amount of fresh information from the true target distribution. In particular, we consider iterative training on samples sourced from a mixture of the true target and synthetic distributions. We analyze the entire iterative evolution in a next-token prediction language model, capturing how the interplay between the mixture weights and the sample size controls the overall long-term performance. With non-trivial mixture weight of the true distribution, even if it decays over time, simply training the model in a contamination-agnostic manner with appropriate sample sizes can avoid collapse and even recover the true target distribution under certain conditions. Simulation studies support our findings and also show that such behavior is more general for other classes of models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Pedram Dadfar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models produce rich introspective language when prompted for self-examination, but whether this language reflects internal computation or sophisticated confabulation has remained unclear. We show that self-referential vocabulary tracks concurrent activation dynamics, and that this correspondence is specific to self-referential processing. We introduce the Pull Methodology, a protocol that elicits extended self-examination through format engineering, and use it to identify a direction in activation space that distinguishes self-referential from descriptive processing in Llama 3.1. The direction is orthogonal to the known refusal direction, localised at 6.25% of model depth, and causally influences introspective output when used for steering. When models produce "loop" vocabulary, their activations exhibit higher autocorrelation (r = 0.44, p = 0.002); when they produce "shimmer" vocabulary under steering, activation variability increases (r = 0.36, p = 0.002). Critically, the same vocabulary in non-self-referential contexts shows no activation correspondence despite nine-fold higher frequency. Qwen 2.5-32B, with no shared training, independently develops different introspective vocabulary tracking different activation metrics, all absent in descriptive controls. The findings indicate that self-report in transformer models can, under appropriate conditions, reliably track internal computational states.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grant Norman, Conor Rowan, Kurt Maute, Alireza Doostan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of data-driven equation discovery for dynamical systems to model and forecast continuous-time dynamics of unconstrained optimization problems. To avoid expensive evaluations of the objective function and its gradient, we leverage trajectory data on the optimization variables to learn the continuous-time dynamics associated with gradient descent, Newton's method, and ADAM optimization. The discovered gradient flows are then solved as a surrogate for the original optimization problem. To this end, we introduce the Learned Gradient Flow (LGF) optimizer, which is equipped to build surrogate models of variable polynomial order in full- or reduced-dimensional spaces at user-defined intervals in the optimization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on several standard problems from engineering mechanics and scientific machine learning, including two inverse problems, structural topology optimization, and two forward solves with different discretizations. Our results suggest that the learned gradient flows can significantly expedite convergence by capturing critical features of the optimization trajectory while avoiding expensive evaluations of the objective and its gradient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenichi Fujita, Yusuke Ijima</p>
<p>Abstract: Paralinguistic and non-linguistic aspects of speech strongly influence listener impressions. While most research focuses on absolute impression scoring, this study investigates relative voice impression estimation (RIE), a framework for predicting the perceptual difference between two utterances from the same speaker. The estimation target is a low-dimensional vector derived from subjective evaluations, quantifying the perceptual shift of the second utterance relative to the first along an antonymic axis (e.g., ``Dark--Bright''). To isolate expressive and prosodic variation, we used recordings of a professional speaker reading a text in various styles. We compare three modeling approaches: classical acoustic features commonly used for speech emotion recognition, self-supervised speech representations, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our results demonstrate that models using self-supervised representations outperform methods with classical acoustic features, particularly in capturing complex and dynamic impressions (e.g., ``Cold--Warm'') where classical features fail. In contrast, current MLLMs prove unreliable for this fine-grained pairwise task. This study provides the first systematic investigation of RIE and demonstrates the strength of self-supervised speech models in capturing subtle perceptual variations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Sobol Mark, Jacky Liang, Maria Attarian, Chuyuan Fu, Debidatta Dwibedi, Dhruv Shah, Aviral Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Many robot tasks require attending to the history of past observations. For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations. Videos are available at https://bigpicturepolicies.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Thei{\ss}inger, Thore Gerlach, David Berghaus, Christian Bauckhage</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum unitary synthesis addresses the problem of translating abstract quantum algorithms into sequences of hardware-executable quantum gates. Solving this task exactly is infeasible in general due to the exponential growth of the underlying combinatorial search space. Existing approaches suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, substantial training costs and limited generalization across different qubit counts. We mitigate these limitations by using supervised learning to approximate the minimum description length of residual unitaries and combining this estimate with stochastic beam search to identify near optimal gate sequences. Our method relies on a lightweight model with zero-shot generalization, substantially reducing training overhead compared to prior baselines. Across multiple benchmarks, we achieve faster wall-clock synthesis times while exceeding state-of-the-art methods in terms of success rate for complex circuits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Puertolas Merenciano, Ekaterina Vasyagina, Raghav Dixit, Kevin Zhu, Ruizhe Li, Javier Ferrando, Maheep Chaudhary</p>
<p>Abstract: LoRA adapters let users fine-tune large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, LoRA adapters are shared through open repositories like Hugging Face Hub \citep{huggingface_hub_docs}, making them vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Current detection methods require running the model with test input data -- making them impractical for screening thousands of adapters where the trigger for backdoor behavior is unknown. We detect poisoned adapters by analyzing their weight matrices directly, without running the model -- making our method data-agnostic. Our method extracts simple statistics -- how concentrated the singular values are, their entropy, and the distribution shape -- and flags adapters that deviate from normal patterns. We evaluate the method on 500 LoRA adapters -- 400 clean, and 100 poisoned for Llama-3.2-3B on instruction and reasoning datasets: Alpaca, Dolly, GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, SQuADv2, NaturalQuestions, HumanEval, and GLUE dataset. We achieve 97\% detection accuracy with less than 2\% false positives.</p>
