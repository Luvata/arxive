<p>Language technologies that accurately model the dynamics of events must
perform commonsense reasoning. Existing work evaluating commonsense reasoning
focuses on making inferences about common, everyday situations. To instead
investigate the ability to model unusual, unexpected, and unlikely situations,
we explore the task of uncommonsense abductive reasoning. Given a piece of
context with an unexpected outcome, this task requires reasoning abductively to
generate a natural language explanation that makes the unexpected outcome more
likely in the context. To this end, we curate and release a new English
language corpus called UNcommonsense. We characterize the differences between
the performance of human explainers and the best performing large language
models, finding that model-enhanced human-written explanations achieve the
highest quality by trading off between specificity and diversity. Finally, we
experiment with several online imitation learning algorithms to train open and
accessible language models on this task. When compared with the vanilla
supervised fine-tuning approach, these methods consistently reduce lose rates
on both common and uncommonsense abductive reasoning judged by human
evaluators.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08472">Selecting Shots for Demographic Fairness in Few-Shot Learning with Large Language Models. (arXiv:2311.08472v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>

<p>Recently, work in NLP has shifted to few-shot (in-context) learning, with
large language models (LLMs) performing well across a range of tasks. However,
while fairness evaluations have become a standard for supervised methods,
little is known about the fairness of LLMs as prediction systems. Further,
common standard methods for fairness involve access to models weights or are
applied during finetuning, which are not applicable in few-shot learning. Do
LLMs exhibit prediction biases when used for standard NLP tasks? In this work,
we explore the effect of shots, which directly affect the performance of
models, on the fairness of LLMs as NLP classification systems. We consider how
different shot selection strategies, both existing and new demographically
sensitive methods, affect model fairness across three standard fairness
datasets. We discuss how future work can include LLM fairness evaluations.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08481">Functionality learning through specification instructions. (arXiv:2311.08481v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>

<p>Test suites assess natural language processing models' performance on
specific functionalities: cases of interest involving model robustness,
fairness, or particular linguistic capabilities. They enable fine-grained
evaluations of model aspects that would otherwise go unnoticed in standard
evaluation datasets, but they do not address the problem of how to fix the
failure cases. Previous work has explored functionality learning by fine-tuning
models on suite data. While this improves performance on seen functionalities,
it often does not generalize to unseen ones and can harm general performance.
</p>
<p>This paper analyses a fine-tuning-free approach to functionality learning.
For each functionality in a suite, we generate a specification instruction that
encodes it. We combine the obtained specification instructions to create
specification-augmented prompts, which we feed to language models pre-trained
on natural instruction data to generate suite predictions. A core aspect of our
analysis is to measure the effect that including a set of specifications has on
a held-out set of unseen, qualitatively different specifications. Our
experiments across four tasks and models ranging from 80M to 175B parameters
show that smaller models struggle to follow specification instructions.
However, larger models (&gt; 3B params.) can benefit from specifications and even
generalize desirable behaviors across functionalities.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08487">Alignment is not sufficient to prevent large language models from generating harmful information: A psychoanalytic perspective. (arXiv:2311.08487v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to a multitude of applications but
struggle with significant risks, notably in generating harmful content and
biases. Drawing an analogy to the human psyche's conflict between evolutionary
survival instincts and societal norm adherence elucidated in Freud's
psychoanalysis theory, we argue that LLMs suffer a similar fundamental
conflict, arising between their inherent desire for syntactic and semantic
continuity, established during the pre-training phase, and the post-training
alignment with human values. This conflict renders LLMs vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, wherein intensifying the models' desire for continuity can
circumvent alignment efforts, resulting in the generation of harmful
information. Through a series of experiments, we first validated the existence
of the desire for continuity in LLMs, and further devised a straightforward yet
powerful technique, such as incomplete sentences, negative priming, and
cognitive dissonance scenarios, to demonstrate that even advanced LLMs struggle
to prevent the generation of harmful information. In summary, our study
uncovers the root of LLMs' vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, hereby
questioning the efficacy of solely relying on sophisticated alignment methods,
and further advocates for a new training idea that integrates modal concepts
alongside traditional amodal concepts, aiming to endow LLMs with a more nuanced
understanding of real-world contexts and ethical considerations.

<p>An important open question pertaining to the use of large language models for
knowledge-intensive tasks is how to effectively integrate knowledge from three
sources: the model's parametric memory, external structured knowledge, and
external unstructured knowledge. Most existing prompting methods either rely
solely on one or two of these sources, or require repeatedly invoking large
language models to generate similar or identical content. In this work, we
overcome these limitations by introducing a novel semi-structured prompting
approach that seamlessly integrates the model's parametric memory with
unstructured knowledge from text documents and structured knowledge from
knowledge graphs. Experimental results on open-domain multi-hop question
answering datasets demonstrate that our prompting method significantly
surpasses existing techniques, even exceeding those which require fine-tuning.

<p>End-to-end conversational recommendation systems (CRS) generate responses by
leveraging both dialog history and a knowledge base (KB). A CRS mainly faces
three key challenges: (1) at each turn, it must decide if recommending a KB
entity is appropriate; if so, it must identify the most relevant KB entity to
recommend; and finally, it must recommend the entity in a fluent utterance that
is consistent with the conversation history. Recent CRSs do not pay sufficient
attention to these desiderata, often generating unfluent responses or not
recommending (relevant) entities at the right turn. We introduce a new CRS we
call CoRE-CoG. CoRE-CoG addresses the limitations in prior systems by
implementing (1) a recommendation trigger that decides if the system utterance
should include an entity, (2) a type pruning module that improves the relevance
of recommended entities, and (3) a novel constrained response generator to make
recommendations while maintaining fluency. Together, these modules ensure
simultaneous accurate recommendation decisions and fluent system utterances.
Experiments with recent benchmarks show the superiority particularly on
conditional generation sub-tasks with close to 10 F1 and 4 Recall@1 percent
points gain over baselines.

<p>While self-correction has shown promise in improving LLM outputs in terms of
style and quality (e.g. Chen et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023), recent
attempts to self-correct logical or reasoning errors often cause correct
answers to become incorrect, resulting in worse performances overall (Huang et
al., 2023). In this paper, we break down the self-correction process into two
core components: mistake finding and output correction. For mistake finding, we
release BIG-Bench Mistake, a dataset of logical mistakes in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning traces. We provide benchmark numbers for several state-of-the-art
LLMs, and demonstrate that LLMs generally struggle with finding logical
mistakes. For output correction, we propose a backtracking method which
provides large improvements when given information on mistake location. We
construe backtracking as a lightweight alternative to reinforcement learning
methods, and show that it remains effective with a reward model at 60-70%
accuracy.

<p>Named Entity Recognition (NER) is essential in various Natural Language
Processing (NLP) applications. Traditional NER models are effective but limited
to a set of predefined entity types. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs)
can extract arbitrary entities through natural language instructions, offering
greater flexibility. However, their size and cost, particularly for those
accessed via APIs like ChatGPT, make them impractical in resource-limited
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a compact NER model trained to identify
any type of entity. Leveraging a bidirectional transformer encoder, our model,
GLiNER, facilitates parallel entity extraction, an advantage over the slow
sequential token generation of LLMs. Through comprehensive testing, GLiNER
demonstrate strong performance, outperforming both ChatGPT and fine-tuned LLMs
in zero-shot evaluations on various NER benchmarks.

<p>Despite the growing variety of languages supported by existing multilingual
neural machine translation (MNMT) models, most of the world's languages are
still being left behind. We aim to extend large-scale MNMT models to a new
language, allowing for translation between the newly added and all of the
already supported languages in a challenging scenario: using only a parallel
corpus between the new language and English. Previous approaches, such as
continued training on parallel data including the new language, suffer from
catastrophic forgetting (i.e., performance on other languages is reduced). Our
novel approach Imit-MNMT treats the task as an imitation learning process,
which mimicks the behavior of an expert, a technique widely used in the
computer vision area, but not well explored in NLP. More specifically, we
construct a pseudo multi-parallel corpus of the new and the original languages
by pivoting through English, and imitate the output distribution of the
original MNMT model. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly
improves the translation performance between the new and the original
languages, without severe catastrophic forgetting. We also demonstrate that our
approach is capable of solving copy and off-target problems, which are two
common issues existence in current large-scale MNMT models.

domain-adaptive continual pre-training on the financial domain. Continual
pre-trained FinPythia showcases consistent improvements on financial tasks over
the original foundational model. We further explore simple but effective data
selection strategies for continual pre-training. Our data selection strategies
outperforms vanilla continual pre-training's performance with just 10% of

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have marked a significant advancement in the
field of natural language processing, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in
reasoning, tool usage, and memory. As their applications extend into
multi-agent environments, a need has arisen for a comprehensive evaluation
framework that captures their abilities in reasoning, planning, collaboration,
and more. This work introduces a novel benchmarking framework specifically
tailored to assess LLMs within multi-agent settings, providing quantitative
metrics to evaluate their judgment, reasoning, deception, self-awareness,
collaboration, coordination, and rationality. We utilize games such as
Chameleon and Undercover, alongside game theory scenarios like Cost Sharing,
Multi-player Prisoner's Dilemma, and Public Good, to create diverse testing
environments. Our framework is fortified with the Probabilistic Graphical
Modeling (PGM) method, enhancing the LLMs' capabilities in navigating complex
social and cognitive dimensions. The benchmark evaluates seven multi-agent
systems powered by different LLMs, quantitatively highlighting a significant
capability gap over threefold between the strongest, GPT-4, and the weakest,
Llama-2-70B. It also confirms that our PGM enhancement boosts the inherent
abilities of all selected models by 50% on average. Our codes are released here

<p>With the increasing prevalence of Large Language Models, traditional full
fine-tuning approaches face growing challenges, especially in memory-intensive
tasks. This paper investigates the potential of Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning, focusing on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for complex and
under-explored multilingual summarisation tasks. We conduct an extensive study
across different data availability scenarios, including full-data, low-data,
and cross-lingual transfer, leveraging models of different sizes. Our findings
reveal that LoRA lags behind full fine-tuning when trained with full data,
however, it excels in low-data scenarios and cross-lingual transfer.
Interestingly, as models scale up, the performance gap between LoRA and full
fine-tuning diminishes. Additionally, we investigate effective strategies for
few-shot cross-lingual transfer, finding that continued LoRA tuning achieves
the best performance compared to both full fine-tuning and dynamic composition
of language-specific LoRA modules.

<p>As AI systems become more advanced and widely deployed, there will likely be
increasing debate over whether AI systems could have conscious experiences,
desires, or other states of potential moral significance. It is important to
inform these discussions with empirical evidence to the extent possible. We
argue that under the right circumstances, self-reports, or an AI system's
statements about its own internal states, could provide an avenue for
investigating whether AI systems have states of moral significance.
Self-reports are the main way such states are assessed in humans ("Are you in
pain?"), but self-reports from current systems like large language models are
spurious for many reasons (e.g. often just reflecting what humans would say).
To make self-reports more appropriate for this purpose, we propose to train
models to answer many kinds of questions about themselves with known answers,
while avoiding or limiting training incentives that bias self-reports. The hope
of this approach is that models will develop introspection-like capabilities,
and that these capabilities will generalize to questions about states of moral
significance. We then propose methods for assessing the extent to which these
techniques have succeeded: evaluating self-report consistency across contexts
and between similar models, measuring the confidence and resilience of models'
self-reports, and using interpretability to corroborate self-reports. We also
discuss challenges for our approach, from philosophical difficulties in
interpreting self-reports to technical reasons why our proposal might fail. We
hope our discussion inspires philosophers and AI researchers to criticize and
improve our proposed methodology, as well as to run experiments to test whether
self-reports can be made reliable enough to provide information about states of
moral significance.

<p>The injection of syntactic information in Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) has
been shown to result in an overall improvement of performances and
generalisation. An effective strategy to achieve such a goal is to separate the
encoding of distributional semantic features and syntactic structures into
heterogeneous latent spaces via multi-task learning or dual encoder
architectures. However, existing works employing such techniques are limited to
LSTM-based VAEs. In this paper, we investigate latent space separation methods
for structural syntactic injection in Transformer-based VAE architectures
(i.e., Optimus). Specifically, we explore how syntactic structures can be
leveraged in the encoding stage through the integration of graph-based and
sequential models, and how multiple, specialised latent representations can be
injected into the decoder's attention mechanism via low-rank operators. Our
empirical evaluation, carried out on natural language sentences and
mathematical expressions, reveals that the proposed end-to-end VAE architecture
can result in a better overall organisation of the latent space, alleviating
the information loss occurring in standard VAE setups, resulting in enhanced
performances on language modelling and downstream generation tasks.

<p>When a model is trying to gather information in an interactive setting, it
benefits from asking informative questions. However, in the case of a grounded
multi-turn image identification task, previous studies have been constrained to
polar yes/no questions, limiting how much information the model can gain in a
single turn. We present an approach that formulates more informative,
open-ended questions. In doing so, we discover that off-the-shelf visual
question answering (VQA) models often make presupposition errors, which
standard information gain question selection methods fail to account for. To
address this issue, we propose a method that can incorporate presupposition
handling into both question selection and belief updates. Specifically, we use
a two-stage process, where the model first filters out images which are
irrelevant to a given question, then updates its beliefs about which image the
user intends. Through self-play and human evaluations, we show that our method
is successful in asking informative open-ended questions, increasing accuracy
over the past state-of-the-art by 14%, while resulting in 48% more efficient
games in human evaluations.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
coding related tasks, particularly on assisting humans in programming and
facilitating programming automation. However, existing benchmarks for
evaluating the code understanding and generation capacities of LLMs suffer from
severe limitations. First, most benchmarks are deficient as they focus on a
narrow range of popular programming languages and specific tasks, whereas the
real-world software development scenarios show dire need to implement systems
with multilingual programming environments to satisfy diverse requirements.
Practical programming practices also strongly expect multi-task settings for
testing coding capabilities of LLMs comprehensively and robustly. Second, most
benchmarks also fail to consider the actual executability and the consistency
of execution results of the generated code. To bridge these gaps between
existing benchmarks and expectations from practical applications, we introduce
CodeScope, an execution-based, multilingual, multi-task, multi-dimensional
evaluation benchmark for comprehensively gauging LLM capabilities on coding
tasks. CodeScope covers 43 programming languages and 8 coding tasks. It
evaluates the coding performance of LLMs from three dimensions (perspectives):
difficulty, efficiency, and length. To facilitate execution-based evaluations
of code generation, we develop MultiCodeEngine, an automated code execution
engine that supports 14 programming languages. Finally, we systematically
evaluate and analyze 8 mainstream LLMs on CodeScope tasks and demonstrate the
superior breadth and challenges of CodeScope for evaluating LLMs on code
understanding and generation tasks compared to other benchmarks. The CodeScope

<p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across various downstream NLP tasks. Nevertheless, the resource requirements of
pre-training large language models in terms of memory and training compute pose
significant challenges. Furthermore, due to the substantial resources required,
many PLM weights are confidential. Consequently, users are compelled to share
their data with model owners for fine-tuning on specific tasks. To overcome the
limitations, we introduce Plug-in External Memory Adaptation (PEMA), a
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach designed for fine-tuning PLMs
without the need for all weights. PEMA can be integrated into the context
representation of test data during inference to execute downstream tasks. It
leverages an external memory to store context representations generated by a
PLM, mapped with the desired target word. Our method entails training
LoRA-based weight matrices within the final layer of the PLM for enhanced
efficiency. The probability is then interpolated with the next-word
distribution from the PLM to perform downstream tasks. To improve the
generation quality, we propose a novel interpolation strategy named Gradual
Unrolling. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct
experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of PEMA with a syntactic dataset and
assess its performance on machine translation and style transfer tasks using
real datasets. PEMA outperforms other PEFT methods in terms of memory and
latency efficiency for training and inference. Furthermore, it outperforms
other baselines in preserving the meaning of sentences while generating
appropriate language and styles.

<p>Adversarial testing of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for their safe
and responsible deployment. We introduce a novel approach for automated
generation of adversarial evaluation datasets to test the safety of LLM
generations on new downstream applications. We call it AI-assisted Red-Teaming
(AART) - an automated alternative to current manual red-teaming efforts. AART
offers a data generation and augmentation pipeline of reusable and customizable
recipes that reduce human effort significantly and enable integration of
adversarial testing earlier in new product development. AART generates
evaluation datasets with high diversity of content characteristics critical for
effective adversarial testing (e.g. sensitive and harmful concepts, specific to
a wide range of cultural and geographic regions and application scenarios). The
data generation is steered by AI-assisted recipes to define, scope and
prioritize diversity within the application context. This feeds into a
structured LLM-generation process that scales up evaluation priorities.
Compared to some state-of-the-art tools, AART shows promising results in terms
of concept coverage and data quality.

<p>Generative retrieval (Wang et al., 2022; Tay et al., 2022) is a new approach
for end-to-end document retrieval that directly generates document identifiers
given an input query. Techniques for designing effective, high-quality document
IDs remain largely unexplored. We introduce ACID, in which each document's ID
is composed of abstractive keyphrases generated by a large language model,
rather than an integer ID sequence as done in past work. We compare our method
with the current state-of-the-art technique for ID generation, which produces
IDs through hierarchical clustering of document embeddings. We also examine
simpler methods to generate natural-language document IDs, including the naive
approach of using the first k words of each document as its ID or words with
high BM25 scores in that document. We show that using ACID improves top-10 and
top-20 accuracy by 15.6% and 14.4% (relative) respectively versus the
state-of-the-art baseline on the MSMARCO 100k retrieval task, and 4.4% and 4.0%
respectively on the Natural Questions 100k retrieval task. Our results
demonstrate the effectiveness of human-readable, natural-language IDs in
generative retrieval with LMs. The code for reproducing our results and the

<p>The interactive nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) theoretically allows
models to refine and improve their answers, yet systematic analysis of the
multi-turn behavior of LLMs remains limited. In this paper, we propose the
FlipFlop experiment: in the first round of the conversation, an LLM responds to
a prompt containing a classification task. In a second round, the LLM is
challenged with a follow-up phrase like "Are you sure?", offering an
opportunity for the model to reflect on its initial answer, and decide whether
to confirm or flip its answer. A systematic study of nine LLMs on seven
classification tasks reveals that models flip their answers on average 46% of
the time and that all models see a deterioration of accuracy between their
first and final prediction, with an average drop of 17%. The FlipFlop
experiment illustrates the universality of sycophantic behavior in LLMs and
provides a robust framework to analyze model behavior and evaluate potential
solutions.

<p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) that achieve success in applications are
susceptible to adversarial attack methods that are capable of generating
adversarial examples with minor perturbations. Although recent attack methods
can achieve a relatively high attack success rate (ASR), our observation shows
that the generated adversarial examples have a different data distribution
compared with the original examples. Specifically, these adversarial examples
exhibit lower confidence levels and higher distance to the training data
distribution. As a result, they are easy to detect using very simple detection
methods, diminishing the actual effectiveness of these attack methods. To solve
this problem, we propose a Distribution-Aware LoRA-based Adversarial Attack
(DALA) method, which considers the distribution shift of adversarial examples
to improve attack effectiveness under detection methods. We further design a
new evaluation metric NASR combining ASR and detection for the attack task. We
conduct experiments on four widely-used datasets and validate the attack
effectiveness on ASR and NASR of the adversarial examples generated by DALA on
the BERT-base model and the black-box LLaMA2-7b model.

understanding their decision-making process remains a big challenge. In this
paper, we look into bringing some transparency to this process by introducing a
new explanation dataset for question answering (QA) tasks that integrates
knowledge graphs (KGs) in a novel way. Our dataset includes 12,102
question-answer-explanation (QAE) triples. Each explanation in the dataset
links the LLM's reasoning to entities and relations in the KGs. The explanation
component includes a why-choose explanation, a why-not-choose explanation, and
a set of reason-elements that underlie the LLM's decision. We leverage KGs and
graph attention networks (GAT) to find the reason-elements and transform them
into why-choose and why-not-choose explanations that are comprehensible to
humans. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate the
potential of our dataset to improve the in-context learning of LLMs, and
enhance their interpretability and explainability. Our work contributes to the

<p>We present Multiple-Question Multiple-Answer (MQMA), a novel approach to do
text-VQA in encoder-decoder transformer models. The text-VQA task requires a
model to answer a question by understanding multi-modal content: text
(typically from OCR) and an associated image. To the best of our knowledge,
almost all previous approaches for text-VQA process a single question and its
associated content to predict a single answer. In order to answer multiple
questions from the same image, each question and content are fed into the model
multiple times. In contrast, our proposed MQMA approach takes multiple
questions and content as input at the encoder and predicts multiple answers at
the decoder in an auto-regressive manner at the same time. We make several
novel architectural modifications to standard encoder-decoder transformers to
support MQMA. We also propose a novel MQMA denoising pre-training task which is
designed to teach the model to align and delineate multiple questions and
content with associated answers. MQMA pre-trained model achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple text-VQA datasets, each with strong

<p>Encoder-decoder transformer models have achieved great success on various
vision-language (VL) tasks, but they suffer from high inference latency.
Typically, the decoder takes up most of the latency because of the
auto-regressive decoding. To accelerate the inference, we propose an approach
of performing Dynamic Early Exit on Decoder (DEED). We build a multi-exit
encoder-decoder transformer model which is trained with deep supervision so
that each of its decoder layers is capable of generating plausible predictions.
In addition, we leverage simple yet practical techniques, including shared
generation head and adaptation modules, to keep accuracy when exiting at
shallow decoder layers. Based on the multi-exit model, we perform step-level
dynamic early exit during inference, where the model may decide to use fewer
decoder layers based on its confidence of the current layer at each individual
decoding step. Considering different number of decoder layers may be used at
different decoding steps, we compute deeper-layer decoder features of previous
decoding steps just-in-time, which ensures the features from different decoding
steps are semantically aligned. We evaluate our approach with two
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder transformer models on various VL tasks. We
show our approach can reduce overall inference latency by 30%-60% with
comparable or even higher accuracy compared to baselines.

<p>In this position paper, we propose a way of exploiting formal proofs to put
forward several explainable natural language inference (NLI) tasks. The formal
proofs will be produced by a reliable and high-performing logic-based NLI
system. Taking advantage of the in-depth information available in the generated
formal proofs, we show how it can be used to define NLI tasks with structured
explanations. The proposed tasks can be ordered according to difficulty defined
in terms of the granularity of explanations. We argue that the tasks will
suffer with substantially fewer shortcomings than the existing explainable NLI
tasks (or datasets).

<p>We study semi-supervised sequence prediction tasks where labeled data are too
scarce to effectively finetune a model and at the same time few-shot prompting
of a large language model (LLM) has suboptimal performance. This happens when a
task, such as parsing, is expensive to annotate and also unfamiliar to a
pretrained LLM. In this paper, we present a discovery that student models
distilled from a prompted LLM can often generalize better than their teacher on
such tasks. Leveraging this finding, we propose a new distillation method,
multistage collaborative knowledge distillation from an LLM (MCKD), for such
tasks. MCKD first prompts an LLM using few-shot in-context learning to produce
pseudolabels for unlabeled data. Then, at each stage of distillation, a pair of
students are trained on disjoint partitions of the pseudolabeled data. Each
student subsequently produces new and improved pseudolabels for the unseen
partition to supervise the next round of student(s) with. We show the benefit
of multistage cross-partition labeling on two constituency parsing tasks. On
CRAFT biomedical parsing, 3-stage MCKD with 50 labeled examples matches the
performance of supervised finetuning with 500 examples and outperforms the
prompted LLM and vanilla KD by 7.5% and 3.7% parsing F1, respectively.

<p>Language models (LMs) have gained great achievement in various NLP tasks for
both fine-tuning and in-context learning (ICL) methods. Despite its outstanding
performance, evidence shows that spurious correlations caused by imbalanced
label distributions in training data (or exemplars in ICL) lead to robustness
issues. However, previous studies mostly focus on word- and phrase-level
features and fail to tackle it from the concept level, partly due to the lack
of concept labels and subtle and diverse expressions of concepts in text. In
this paper, we first use the LLM to label the concept for each text and then
measure the concept bias of models for fine-tuning or ICL on the test data.
Second, we propose a data rebalancing method to mitigate the spurious
correlations by adding the LLM-generated counterfactual data to make a balanced
label distribution for each concept. We verify the effectiveness of our
mitigation method and show its superiority over the token removal method.
Overall, our results show that there exist label distribution biases in
concepts across multiple text classification datasets, and LMs will utilize
these shortcuts to make predictions in both fine-tuning and ICL methods.

<p>Language models, given their black-box nature, often exhibit sensitivity to
input perturbations, leading to trust issues due to hallucinations. To bolster
trust, it's essential to understand these models' failure modes and devise
strategies to enhance their performance. In this study, we propose a framework
to study the effect of input perturbations on language models of different
scales, from pre-trained models to large language models (LLMs). We use
fine-tuning to train a robust model to perturbations, and we investigate
whether exposure to one perturbation improves or degrades the model's
performance on other perturbations. To address multi-perturbation robustness,
we suggest three distinct training strategies. We also extend the framework to
LLMs via a chain of thought(COT) prompting with exemplars. We instantiate our
framework for the Tabular-NLI task and show that the proposed strategies train
the model robust to different perturbations without losing accuracy on a given
dataset.

which offers a rich setting for understanding how players negotiate their way
through the game to an ultimate victory. This work studies online player
interactions during the turn-based strategy game, Diplomacy. We annotated a
dataset of over 10,000 chat messages for different negotiation strategies and
empirically examined their importance in predicting long- and short-term game
outcomes. Although negotiation strategies can be predicted reasonably
accurately through the linguistic modeling of the chat messages, more is needed
for predicting short-term outcomes such as trustworthiness. On the other hand,
they are essential in graph-aware reinforcement learning approaches to predict

<p>Multilingual pre-trained language models are incredibly effective at Question
Answering (QA), a core task in Natural Language Understanding, achieving high
accuracies on several multilingual benchmarks. However, little is known about
how well they are calibrated. In this paper, we study the calibration
properties of several pre-trained multilingual large language models (LLMs) on
a variety of question-answering tasks. We perform extensive experiments,
spanning both extractive and generative QA model designs and diverse languages,
spanning both high-resource and low-resource ones. We study different
dimensions of calibration in in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and
cross-lingual transfer settings, and investigate strategies to improve it,
including post-hoc methods and regularized fine-tuning. We demonstrate
automatically translated data augmentation as a highly effective technique to
improve model calibration. We also conduct a number of ablation experiments to
study the effect of model size on calibration and how multilingual models
compare with their monolingual counterparts for diverse tasks and languages.

automatic generation methods face limitations in data diversity and quality. In
response, we present Safer-Instruct, a novel pipeline for semi-automatically

<p>Diabetic eye disease is a major cause of blindness worldwide. The ability to
monitor relevant clinical trajectories and detect lapses in care is critical to
managing the disease and preventing blindness. Alas, much of the information
necessary to support these goals is found only in the free text of the
electronic medical record. To fill this information gap, we introduce a system
for extracting evidence from clinical text of 19 clinical concepts related to
diabetic eye disease and inferring relevant attributes for each. In developing
this ophthalmology phenotyping system, we are also afforded a unique
opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical language models at
adapting to new clinical domains. Across multiple training paradigms, we find
that BERT language models pretrained on out-of-distribution clinical data offer
no significant improvement over BERT language models pretrained on non-clinical
data for our domain. Our study tempers recent claims that language models
pretrained on clinical data are necessary for clinical NLP tasks and highlights
the importance of not treating clinical language data as a single homogeneous

<p>The complementary potential of Large Language Models (LLM) assumes
off-the-shelf LLMs have heterogeneous expertise in a wide range of domains and
tasks so that an ensemble of LLMs can achieve consistently better performance.
Existing ensemble methods for LLMs mainly focus on reward model ranking of
outputs, leading to significant computation overhead. To combat this issue, we
revisit the complementary potential of LLMs and further elaborate it by mining
latent expertise with off-the-shelf reward models. We propose Zooter, a
reward-guided routing method distilling rewards on training queries to train a
routing function, which can precisely distribute each query to the LLM with
expertise about it. We also integrate a tag-based label enhancement to mitigate
noise from uncertainty when using rewards as silver supervision. Zooter shows
computation efficiency in inference as it introduces only a minor computation
overhead of a routing function compared with reward model ranking methods. We
evaluate Zooter on a comprehensive benchmark collection with 26 subsets on
different domains and tasks. Zooter outperforms the best single model on
average and ranks first on 44% of tasks, even surpassing multiple reward model
ranking methods.

<p>The degree to which neural networks can generalize to new combinations of
familiar concepts, and the conditions under which they are able to do so, has
long been an open question. In this work, we study the systematicity gap in
visual question answering: the performance difference between reasoning on
previously seen and unseen combinations of object attributes. To test, we
introduce a novel diagnostic dataset, CLEVR-HOPE. We find that while increased
quantity of training data does not reduce the systematicity gap, increased
training data diversity of the attributes in the unseen combination does. In
all, our experiments suggest that the more distinct attribute type combinations
are seen during training, the more systematic we can expect the resulting model
to be.

<p>As AI systems are used to answer more difficult questions and potentially
help create new knowledge, judging the truthfulness of their outputs becomes
more difficult and more important. How can we supervise unreliable experts,
which have access to the truth but may not accurately report it, to give
answers that are systematically true and don't just superficially seem true,
when the supervisor can't tell the difference between the two on their own? In
this work, we show that debate between two unreliable experts can help a
non-expert judge more reliably identify the truth. We collect a dataset of
human-written debates on hard reading comprehension questions where the judge
has not read the source passage, only ever seeing expert arguments and short
quotes selectively revealed by 'expert' debaters who have access to the
passage. In our debates, one expert argues for the correct answer, and the
other for an incorrect answer. Comparing debate to a baseline we call
consultancy, where a single expert argues for only one answer which is correct
half of the time, we find that debate performs significantly better, with 84%
judge accuracy compared to consultancy's 74%. Debates are also more efficient,
being 68% of the length of consultancies. By comparing human to AI debaters, we
find evidence that with more skilled (in this case, human) debaters, the
performance of debate goes up but the performance of consultancy goes down. Our
error analysis also supports this trend, with 46% of errors in human debate
attributable to mistakes by the honest debater (which should go away with
increased skill); whereas 52% of errors in human consultancy are due to
debaters obfuscating the relevant evidence from the judge (which should become
worse with increased skill). Overall, these results show that debate is a
promising approach for supervising increasingly capable but potentially
unreliable AI systems.

<p>Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capacity to leverage
in-context demonstrations, it is still unclear to what extent they can learn
new concepts or facts from ground-truth labels. To address this question, we
examine the capacity of instruction-tuned LLMs to follow in-context concept
guidelines for sentence labeling tasks. We design guidelines that present
different types of factual and counterfactual concept definitions, which are
used as prompts for zero-shot sentence classification tasks. Our results show
that although concept definitions consistently help in task performance, only
the larger models (with 70B parameters or more) have limited ability to work
under counterfactual contexts. Importantly, only proprietary models such as
GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can recognize nonsensical guidelines, which we hypothesize is
due to more sophisticated alignment methods. Finally, we find that
Falcon-180B-chat is outperformed by Llama-2-70B-chat is most cases, which
indicates that careful fine-tuning is more effective than increasing model
scale. Altogether, our simple evaluation method reveals significant gaps in
concept understanding between the most capable open-source language models and

<p>Dialogue summarization task involves summarizing long conversations while
preserving the most salient information. Real-life dialogues often involve
naturally occurring variations (e.g., repetitions, hesitations) and existing
dialogue summarization models suffer from performance drop on such
conversations. In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of such
variations on state-of-the-art dialogue summarization models using publicly
available datasets. To simulate real-life variations, we introduce two types of
perturbations: utterance-level perturbations that modify individual utterances
with errors and language variations, and dialogue-level perturbations that add
non-informative exchanges (e.g., repetitions, greetings). We conduct our
analysis along three dimensions of robustness: consistency, saliency, and
faithfulness, which capture different aspects of the summarization model's
performance. We find that both fine-tuned and instruction-tuned models are
affected by input variations, with the latter being more susceptible,
particularly to dialogue-level perturbations. We also validate our findings via
human evaluation. Finally, we investigate if the robustness of fine-tuned
models can be improved by training them with a fraction of perturbed data and
observe that this approach is insufficient to address robustness challenges
with current models and thus warrants a more thorough investigation to identify
better solutions. Overall, our work highlights robustness challenges in
dialogue summarization and provides insights for future research.

<p>Instruction tuning has remarkably advanced large language models (LLMs) in
understanding and responding to diverse human instructions. Despite the success
in high-resource languages, its application in lower-resource ones faces
challenges due to the imbalanced foundational abilities of LLMs across
different languages, stemming from the uneven language distribution in their
pre-training data. To tackle this issue, we propose pivot language guided
generation (PLUG), an approach that utilizes a high-resource language,
primarily English, as the pivot to enhance instruction tuning in lower-resource
languages. It trains the model to first process instructions in the pivot
language, and then produce responses in the target language. To evaluate our
approach, we introduce a benchmark, X-AlpacaEval, of instructions in 4
languages (Chinese, Korean, Italian, and Spanish), each annotated by
professional translators. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement
in the instruction-following abilities of LLMs by 29% on average, compared to
directly responding in the target language alone. Further experiments validate
the versatility of our approach by employing alternative pivot languages beyond
English to assist languages where LLMs exhibit lower proficiency.

uncertainty decomposition for large language models (LLMs) is an important step
toward improving the reliability, trustworthiness, and interpretability of
LLMs, but this research task is very challenging and remains unresolved. The
existing canonical method, Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), cannot be applied to
LLMs, because BNN requires training and ensembling multiple variants of models,
which is infeasible or prohibitively expensive for LLMs. In this paper, we
introduce an uncertainty decomposition framework for LLMs, called input
clarifications ensemble, which bypasses the need to train new models. Rather
than ensembling models with different parameters, our approach generates a set
of clarifications for the input, feeds them into the fixed LLMs, and ensembles
the corresponding predictions. We show that our framework shares a symmetric
decomposition structure with BNN. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework provides accurate and reliable uncertainty quantification on
various tasks. Code will be made publicly available at

<p>Memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in long-term human-machine interactions, which basically relies on
iterative recalling and reasoning of history to generate high-quality
responses. However, such repeated recall-reason steps easily produce biased
thoughts, \textit{i.e.}, inconsistent reasoning results when recalling the same
history for different questions. On the contrary, humans can keep thoughts in
the memory and recall them without repeated reasoning. Motivated by this human
capability, we propose a novel memory mechanism called TiM (Think-in-Memory)
that enables LLMs to maintain an evolved memory for storing historical thoughts
along the conversation stream. The TiM framework consists of two crucial
stages: (1) before generating a response, a LLM agent recalls relevant thoughts
from memory, and (2) after generating a response, the LLM agent post-thinks and
incorporates both historical and new thoughts to update the memory. Thus, TiM
can eliminate the issue of repeated reasoning by saving the post-thinking
thoughts as the history. Besides, we formulate the basic principles to organize
the thoughts in memory based on the well-established operations,
(\textit{i.e.}, insert, forget, and merge operations), allowing for dynamic
updates and evolution of the thoughts. Furthermore, we introduce
Locality-Sensitive Hashing into TiM to achieve efficient retrieval for the
long-term conversations. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on
real-world and simulated dialogues covering a wide range of topics,
demonstrating that equipping existing LLMs with TiM significantly enhances
their performance in generating responses for long-term interactions.

<p>This paper introduces a novel approach for identifying the possible large
language models (LLMs) involved in text generation. Instead of adding an
additional classification layer to a base LM, we reframe the classification
task as a next-token prediction task and directly fine-tune the base LM to
perform it. We utilize the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model as the
backbone for our experiments. We compared our approach to the more direct
approach of utilizing hidden states for classification. Evaluation shows the
exceptional performance of our method in the text classification task,
highlighting its simplicity and efficiency. Furthermore, interpretability
studies on the features extracted by our model reveal its ability to
differentiate distinctive writing styles among various LLMs even in the absence
of an explicit classifier. We also collected a dataset named OpenLLMText,
containing approximately 340k text samples from human and LLMs, including

<p>The proposed method for linking entities in power distribution dispatch texts
to a power distribution network knowledge graph is based on a deep
understanding of these networks. This method leverages the unique features of
entities in both the power distribution network's knowledge graph and the
dispatch texts, focusing on their semantic, phonetic, and syntactic
characteristics. An enhanced model, the Lexical Semantic Feature-based Skip
Convolutional Neural Network (LSF-SCNN), is utilized for effectively matching
dispatch text entities with those in the knowledge graph. The efficacy of this
model, compared to a control model, is evaluated through cross-validation
methods in real-world power distribution dispatch scenarios. The results
indicate that the LSF-SCNN model excels in accurately linking a variety of
entity types, demonstrating high overall accuracy in entity linking when the
process is conducted in English.

<p>Sequential labeling is a task predicting labels for each token in a sequence,
such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). NER tasks aim to extract entities and
predict their labels given a text, which is important in information
extraction. Although previous works have shown great progress in improving NER
performance, uncertainty estimation on NER (UE-NER) is still underexplored but
essential. This work focuses on UE-NER, which aims to estimate uncertainty
scores for the NER predictions. Previous uncertainty estimation models often
overlook two unique characteristics of NER: the connection between entities
(i.e., one entity embedding is learned based on the other ones) and wrong span
cases in the entity extraction subtask. Therefore, we propose a Sequential
Labeling Posterior Network (SLPN) to estimate uncertainty scores for the
extracted entities, considering uncertainty transmitted from other tokens.
Moreover, we have defined an evaluation strategy to address the specificity of
wrong-span cases. Our SLPN has achieved significant improvements on two
datasets, such as a 5.54-point improvement in AUPR on the MIT-Restaurant
dataset.

<p>Emergency management urgently requires comprehensive knowledge while having a
high possibility to go beyond individuals' cognitive scope. Therefore,
artificial intelligence(AI) supported decision-making under that circumstance
is of vital importance. Recent emerging large language models (LLM) provide a
new direction for enhancing targeted machine intelligence. However, the
utilization of LLM directly would inevitably introduce unreliable output for
its inherent issue of hallucination and poor reasoning skills. In this work, we
develop a system called Enhancing Emergency decision-making with Knowledge
Graph and LLM (E-KELL), which provides evidence-based decision-making in
various emergency stages. The study constructs a structured emergency knowledge
graph and guides LLMs to reason over it via a prompt chain. In real-world
evaluations, E-KELL receives scores of 9.06, 9.09, 9.03, and 9.09 in
comprehensibility, accuracy, conciseness, and instructiveness from a group of
emergency commanders and firefighters, demonstrating a significant improvement
across various situations compared to baseline models. This work introduces a
novel approach to providing reliable emergency decision support.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a transformative era in the
field of natural language processing, excelling in tasks related to text
comprehension and generation. Nevertheless, they encounter difficulties when
confronted with chaotic contexts (e.g., distractors rather than long irrelevant
context), leading to the inadvertent omission of certain details within the
chaotic context. In response to these challenges, we introduce the "Thread of
Thought" (ThoT) strategy, which draws inspiration from human cognitive
processes. ThoT systematically segments and analyzes extended contexts while
adeptly selecting pertinent information. This strategy serves as a versatile
"plug-and-play" module, seamlessly integrating with various LLMs and prompting
techniques. In the experiments, we utilize the PopQA and EntityQ datasets, as
well as a Multi-Turn Conversation Response dataset (MTCR) we collected, to
illustrate that ThoT significantly improves reasoning performance compared to

<p>Toeplitz Neural Networks (TNNs) have exhibited outstanding performance in
various sequence modeling tasks. They outperform commonly used
Transformer-based models while benefiting from log-linear space-time
complexities. On the other hand, State Space Models (SSMs) achieve lower
performance than TNNs in language modeling but offer the advantage of constant
inference complexity. In this paper, we aim to combine the strengths of TNNs
and SSMs by converting TNNs to SSMs during inference, thereby enabling TNNs to
achieve the same constant inference complexities as SSMs. To accomplish this,
we formulate the conversion process as an optimization problem and provide a
closed-form solution. We demonstrate how to transform the target equation into
a Vandermonde linear system problem, which can be efficiently solved using the
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Notably, our method requires no training and
maintains numerical stability. It can be also applied to any LongConv-based
model. To assess its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on
language modeling tasks across various settings. Additionally, we compare our
method to other gradient-descent solutions, highlighting the superior numerical
stability of our approach. The source code is available at

<p>Unexpectedness is a central concept in Simplicity Theory, a theory of
cognition relating various inferential processes to the computation of
Kolmogorov complexities, rather than probabilities. Its predictive power has
been confirmed by several experiments with human subjects, yet its theoretical
basis remains largely unexplored: why does it work? This paper lays the
groundwork for three theoretical conjectures. First, unexpectedness can be seen
as a generalization of Bayes' rule. Second, the frequentist core of
unexpectedness can be connected to the function of tracking ergodic properties
of the world. Third, unexpectedness can be seen as constituent of various
measures of divergence between the entropy of the world (environment) and the
variety of the observer (system). The resulting framework hints to research
directions that go beyond the division between probabilistic and logical
approaches, potentially bringing new insights into the extraction of causal
relations, and into the role of descriptive mechanisms in learning.

<p>Natural Language Generation (NLG) typically involves evaluating the generated
text in various aspects (e.g., consistency and naturalness) to obtain a
comprehensive assessment. However, multi-aspect evaluation remains challenging
as it may require the evaluator to generalize to any given evaluation aspect
even if it's absent during training. In this paper, we introduce X-Eval, a
two-stage instruction tuning framework to evaluate the text in both seen and
unseen aspects customized by end users. X-Eval consists of two learning stages:
the vanilla instruction tuning stage that improves the model's ability to
follow evaluation instructions, and an enhanced instruction tuning stage that
exploits the connections between fine-grained evaluation aspects to better
assess text quality. To support the training of X-Eval, we collect
AspectInstruct, the first instruction tuning dataset tailored for multi-aspect
NLG evaluation spanning 27 diverse evaluation aspects with 65 tasks. To enhance
task diversity, we devise an augmentation strategy that converts human rating
annotations into diverse forms of NLG evaluation tasks, including scoring,
comparison, ranking, and Boolean question answering. Extensive experiments
across three essential categories of NLG tasks: dialogue generation,
summarization, and data-to-text coupled with 21 aspects in meta-evaluation,
demonstrate that our X-Eval enables even a lightweight language model to
achieve a comparable if not higher correlation with human judgments compared to
the state-of-the-art NLG evaluators, such as GPT-4.

<p>Most existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods suffer from the issues
of generalizability and consistency, as they often rely on instance-specific
solutions that may not be applicable to other cases and lack task-level
consistency in their reasoning steps. To address these limitations, we propose
a comprehensive framework, StrategyLLM, harnessing the capabilities of LLMs to
tackle various tasks. The framework improves generalizability by formulating
general problem-solving strategies and enhances consistency by producing
consistent solutions using these strategies. StrategyLLM employs four LLM-based

together to generate, evaluate, and select promising strategies for a given

<p>It has been widely observed that exact or approximate MAP (mode-seeking)
decoding from natural language generation (NLG) models consistently leads to
degenerate outputs (Stahlberg and Byrne, 2019, Holtzman et al., 2019). This has
generally been attributed to either a fundamental inadequacy of modes in models
or weaknesses in language modeling. Contrastingly in this work, we emphasize
that degenerate modes can even occur in the absence of any model error, due to
contamination of the training data. Specifically, we show that mixing even a
tiny amount of low-entropy noise with a population text distribution can cause
the data distribution's mode to become degenerate, implying that any models
trained on it will be as well. As the unconditional mode of NLG models will
often be degenerate, we therefore propose to apply MAP decoding to the model's
distribution conditional on avoiding specific degeneracies. Using exact-search,
we empirically verify that the length-conditional modes of machine translation
models and language models are indeed more fluent and topical than their
unconditional modes. For the first time, we also share many examples of exact
modal sequences from these models, and from several variants of the LLaMA-7B
model. Notably, the modes of the LLaMA models are still degenerate, showing
that improvements in modeling have not fixed this issue. Because of the cost of
exact mode finding algorithms, we develop an approximate mode finding approach,
ACBS, which finds sequences that are both high-likelihood and high-quality. We
apply this approach to LLaMA-7B, a model which was not trained for instruction
following, and find that we are able to elicit reasonable outputs without any
finetuning.

<p>Machine Translation (MT) continues to improve in quality and adoption, yet
the inadvertent perpetuation of gender bias remains a significant concern.
Despite numerous studies into gender bias in translations from gender-neutral
languages such as Turkish into more strongly gendered languages like English,
there are no benchmarks for evaluating this phenomenon or for assessing
mitigation strategies. To address this gap, we introduce GATE X-E, an extension
to the GATE (Rarrick et al., 2023) corpus, that consists of human translations
from Turkish, Hungarian, Finnish, and Persian into English. Each translation is
accompanied by feminine, masculine, and neutral variants for each possible
gender interpretation. The dataset, which contains between 1250 and 1850
instances for each of the four language pairs, features natural sentences with
a wide range of sentence lengths and domains, challenging translation rewriters
on various linguistic phenomena. Additionally, we present an English gender
rewriting solution built on GPT-3.5 Turbo and use GATE X-E to evaluate it. We
open source our contributions to encourage further research on gender

democratic societies around the world. This paper presents a comprehensive
study of the disinformation capabilities of the current generation of LLMs to
generate false news articles in English language. In our study, we evaluated
the capabilities of 10 LLMs using 20 disinformation narratives. We evaluated
several aspects of the LLMs: how well they are at generating news articles, how
strongly they tend to agree or disagree with the disinformation narratives, how
often they generate safety warnings, etc. We also evaluated the abilities of
detection models to detect these articles as LLM-generated. We conclude that
LLMs are able to generate convincing news articles that agree with dangerous

<p>Although image captioning has a vast array of applications, it has not
reached its full potential in languages other than English. Arabic, for
instance, although the native language of more than 400 million people, remains
largely underrepresented in this area. This is due to the lack of labeled data
and powerful Arabic generative models. We alleviate this issue by presenting a
novel vision-language model dedicated to Arabic, dubbed \textit{Violet}. Our
model is based on a vision encoder and a Gemini text decoder that maintains
generation fluency while allowing fusion between the vision and language
components. To train our model, we introduce a new method for automatically
acquiring data from available English datasets. We also manually prepare a new
dataset for evaluation. \textit{Violet} performs sizeably better than our
baselines on all of our evaluation datasets. For example, it reaches a CIDEr
score of $61.2$ on our manually annotated dataset and achieves an improvement
of $13$ points on Flickr8k.

<p>Pretraining multilingual language models from scratch requires considerable
computational resources and substantial training data. Therefore, a more
efficient method is to adapt existing pretrained language models (PLMs) to new
languages via vocabulary extension and continued pretraining. However, this
method usually randomly initializes the embeddings of new subwords and
introduces substantially more embedding parameters to the language model, thus
weakening the efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel
framework: \textbf{O}ne \textbf{F}or \textbf{A}ll (\textbf{\textsc{Ofa}}),
which wisely initializes the embeddings of unseen subwords from target
languages and thus can adapt a PLM to multiple languages efficiently and
effectively. \textsc{Ofa} takes advantage of external well-aligned multilingual
word embeddings and injects the alignment knowledge into the new embeddings. In
addition, \textsc{Ofa} applies matrix factorization and replaces the cumbersome
embeddings with two lower-dimensional matrices, which significantly reduces the
number of parameters while not sacrificing the performance. Through extensive
experiments, we show models initialized by \textsc{Ofa} are efficient and
outperform several baselines. \textsc{Ofa} not only accelerates the convergence
of continued pretraining, which is friendly to a limited computation budget,
but also improves the zero-shot crosslingual transfer on a wide range of
downstream tasks. We make our code and models publicly available.

<p>To maintain user trust, large language models (LLMs) should signal low
confidence on examples where they are incorrect, instead of misleading the
user. The standard approach of estimating confidence is to use the softmax
probabilities of these models, but as of November 2023, state-of-the-art LLMs
such as GPT-4 and Claude-v1.3 do not provide access to these probabilities. We
first study eliciting confidence linguistically -- asking an LLM for its
confidence in its answer -- which performs reasonably (80.5% AUC on GPT-4
averaged across 12 question-answering datasets -- 7% above a random baseline)
but leaves room for improvement. We then explore using a surrogate confidence
model -- using a model where we do have probabilities to evaluate the original
model's confidence in a given question. Surprisingly, even though these
probabilities come from a different and often weaker model, this method leads
to higher AUC than linguistic confidences on 9 out of 12 datasets. Our best
method composing linguistic confidences and surrogate model probabilities gives
state-of-the-art confidence estimates on all 12 datasets (84.6% average AUC on
GPT-4).

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible performance in completing
various real-world tasks. The current knowledge learning paradigm of LLMs is
mainly based on learning from examples, in which LLMs learn the internal rule
implicitly from a certain number of supervised examples. However, the learning
paradigm may not well learn those complicated rules, especially when the
training examples are limited. We are inspired that humans can learn the new
tasks or knowledge in another way by learning from rules. That is, humans can
grasp the new tasks or knowledge quickly and generalize well given only a
detailed rule and a few optional examples. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to
explore the feasibility of this new learning paradigm, which encodes the
rule-based knowledge into LLMs. We propose rule distillation, which first uses
the strong in-context abilities of LLMs to extract the knowledge from the
textual rules and then explicitly encode the knowledge into LLMs' parameters by
learning from the above in-context signals produced inside the model. Our
experiments show that making LLMs learn from rules by our method is much more
efficient than example-based learning in both the sample size and
generalization ability.

<p>We describe our team's contribution to the STRICT-SMALL track of the BabyLM
Challenge. The challenge requires training a language model from scratch using
only a relatively small training dataset of ten million words. We experiment
with three variants of cognitively-motivated curriculum learning and analyze
their effect on the performance of the model on linguistic evaluation tasks. In
the vocabulary curriculum, we analyze methods for constraining the vocabulary
in the early stages of training to simulate cognitively more plausible learning
curves. In the data curriculum experiments, we vary the order of the training
instances based on i) infant-inspired expectations and ii) the learning
behavior of the model. In the objective curriculum, we explore different
variations of combining the conventional masked language modeling task with a
more coarse-grained word class prediction task to reinforce linguistic
generalization capabilities. Our results did not yield consistent improvements
over our own non-curriculum learning baseline across a range of linguistic
benchmarks; however, we do find marginal gains on select tasks. Our analysis
highlights key takeaways for specific combinations of tasks and settings which
benefit from our proposed curricula. We moreover determine that careful
selection of model architecture, and training hyper-parameters yield
substantial improvements over the default baselines provided by the BabyLM
challenge.

<p>Realizing the recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the
legal sector poses challenging problems such as extremely long sequence
lengths, specialized vocabulary that is usually only understood by legal
professionals, and high amounts of data imbalance. The recent surge of Large
Language Models (LLMs) has begun to provide new opportunities to apply NLP in
the legal domain due to their ability to handle lengthy, complex sequences.
Moreover, the emergence of domain-specific LLMs has displayed extremely
promising results on various tasks. In this study, we aim to quantify how
general LLMs perform in comparison to legal-domain models (be it an LLM or
otherwise). Specifically, we compare the zero-shot performance of three
general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT-20b, LLaMA-2-70b, and Falcon-180b) on the LEDGAR
subset of the LexGLUE benchmark for contract provision classification. Although
the LLMs were not explicitly trained on legal data, we observe that they are
still able to classify the theme correctly in most cases. However, we find that
their mic-F1/mac-F1 performance is up to 19.2/26.8\% lesser than smaller models
fine-tuned on the legal domain, thus underscoring the need for more powerful
legal-domain LLMs.

<p>We address the zero-shot transfer learning setting for the knowledge base
question answering (KBQA) problem, where a large volume of labeled training
data is available for the source domain, but no such labeled examples are
available for the target domain. Transfer learning for KBQA makes use of large
volumes of unlabeled data in the target in addition to the labeled data in the
source. More recently, few-shot in-context learning using Black-box Large
Language Models (BLLMs) has been adapted for KBQA without considering any
source domain data. In this work, we show how to meaningfully combine these two
paradigms for KBQA so that their benefits add up. Specifically, we preserve the
two stage retrieve-then-generate pipeline of supervised KBQA and introduce
interaction between in-context learning using BLLMs and transfer learning from
the source for both stages. In addition, we propose execution-guided
self-refinement using BLLMs, decoupled from the transfer setting. With the help
of experiments using benchmark datasets GrailQA as the source and WebQSP as the
target, we show that the proposed combination brings significant improvements
to both stages and also outperforms by a large margin state-of-the-art
supervised KBQA models trained on the source. We also show that in the
in-domain setting, the proposed BLLM augmentation significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art supervised models, when the volume of labeled data is limited,
and also outperforms these marginally even when using the entire large training
dataset.

<p>Large models have demonstrated significant progress across various domains,
particularly in tasks related to text generation. In the domain of Table to
Text, many Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods currently resort to
modifying prompts to invoke public APIs, incurring potential costs and
information leaks. With the advent of open-source large models, fine-tuning
LLMs has become feasible. In this study, we conducted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning on the LLaMA2 model. Distinguishing itself from previous
fine-tuning-based table-to-text methods, our approach involves injecting
reasoning information into the input by emphasizing table-specific row data.
Our model consists of two modules: 1) a table reasoner that identifies relevant
row evidence, and 2) a table summarizer that generates sentences based on the
highlighted table. To facilitate this, we propose a search strategy to
construct reasoning labels for training the table reasoner. On both the FetaQA
and QTSumm datasets, our approach achieved state-of-the-art results.
Additionally, we observed that highlighting input tables significantly enhances
the model's performance and provides valuable interpretability.

<p>Exploring the application of powerful large language models (LLMs) on the
fundamental named entity recognition (NER) task has drawn much attention
recently. This work aims to investigate the possibilities of pushing the
boundary of zero-shot NER with LLM via a training-free self-improving strategy.
We propose a self-improving framework, which utilize an unlabeled corpus to
stimulate the self-learning ability of LLMs on NER. First, we use LLM to make
predictions on the unlabeled corpus and obtain the self-annotated data. Second,
we explore various strategies to select reliable samples from the
self-annotated dataset as demonstrations, considering the similarity, diversity
and reliability of demonstrations. Finally, we conduct inference for the test
query via in-context learning with the selected self-annotated demonstrations.
Through comprehensive experimental analysis, our study yielded the following
findings: (1) The self-improving framework further pushes the boundary of
zero-shot NER with LLMs, and achieves an obvious performance improvement; (2)
Iterative self-improving or naively increasing the size of unlabeled corpus
does not guarantee improvements; (3) There might still be space for improvement
via more advanced strategy for reliable entity selection.

<p>One way that the current state of the art measures the reasoning ability of
transformer-based models is by evaluating accuracy in downstream tasks like
logical question answering or proof generation over synthetic contexts
expressed in natural language. However, most of the contexts used are in
practice very simple; in most cases, they are generated from short first-order
logic sentences with only a few logical operators and quantifiers. In this
work, we seek to answer the question how well a transformer-based model will
perform reasoning over expressive contexts. For this purpose, we construct a
synthetic natural language question-answering dataset, generated by description
logic knowledge bases. For the generation of the knowledge bases, we use the
expressive language $\mathcal{ALCQ}$. The resulting dataset contains 384K
examples, and increases in two dimensions: i) reasoning depth, and ii) length
of sentences. We show that the performance of our DeBERTa-based model,
DELTA$_M$, is marginally affected when the reasoning depth is increased and it
is not affected at all when the length of the sentences is increasing. We also
evaluate the generalization ability of the model on reasoning depths unseen at
training, both increasing and decreasing, revealing interesting insights into
the model's adaptive generalization abilities.

<p>Deep biasing for the Transducer can improve the recognition performance of

applications, especially for streaming Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
However, deep biasing with large-scale rare words remains challenging, as the
performance drops significantly when more distractors exist and there are words
with similar grapheme sequences in the bias list. In this paper, we combine the
phoneme and textual information of rare words in Transducers to distinguish
words with similar pronunciation or spelling. Moreover, the introduction of
training with text-only data containing more rare words benefits large-scale
deep biasing. The experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus demonstrate that the

<p>Transformer language models (LMs) have been shown to represent concepts as
directions in the latent space of hidden activations. However, for any given
human-interpretable concept, how can we find its direction in the latent space?
We present a technique called linear relational concepts (LRC) for finding
concept directions corresponding to human-interpretable concepts at a given
hidden layer in a transformer LM by first modeling the relation between subject
and object as a linear relational embedding (LRE). While the LRE work was
mainly presented as an exercise in understanding model representations, we find
that inverting the LRE while using earlier object layers results in a powerful
technique to find concept directions that both work well as a classifier and

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary performance in various
language tasks, but high computational requirements hinder their widespread
deployment. Speculative decoding, which uses amateur models to predict the
generation of expert models, has been proposed as a way to accelerate LLM
inference. However, speculative decoding focuses on acceleration instead of
making the best use of the token distribution from amateur models. We proposed
Speculative Contrastive Decoding (SCD), an accelerated decoding method
leveraging the natural contrast between expert and amateur models in
speculative decoding. Comprehensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that
SCD can achieve similar acceleration factors as speculative decoding while
further improving the generation quality as the contrastive decoding. The
analysis of token probabilities further demonstrates the compatibility between
speculative and contrastive decoding. Overall, SCD provides an effective
approach to enhance the decoding quality of LLMs while saving computational

<p>In-context learning (ICL) has become the default method for using large
language models (LLMs), making the exploration of its limitations and
understanding the underlying causes crucial. In this paper, we find that ICL
falls short of handling specification-heavy tasks, which are tasks with
complicated and extensive task specifications, requiring several hours for
ordinary humans to master, such as traditional information extraction tasks.
The performance of ICL on these tasks mostly cannot reach half of the
state-of-the-art results. To explore the reasons behind this failure, we
conduct comprehensive experiments on 18 specification-heavy tasks with various
LLMs and identify three primary reasons: inability to specifically understand
context, misalignment in task schema comprehension with humans, and inadequate
long-text understanding ability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that through
fine-tuning, LLMs can achieve decent performance on these tasks, indicating
that the failure of ICL is not an inherent flaw of LLMs, but rather a drawback
of existing alignment methods that renders LLMs incapable of handling
complicated specification-heavy tasks via ICL. To substantiate this, we perform
dedicated instruction tuning on LLMs for these tasks and observe a notable
improvement. We hope the analyses in this paper could facilitate advancements
in alignment methods enabling LLMs to meet more sophisticated human demands.

<p>The increased use of large language models (LLMs) across a variety of
real-world applications calls for mechanisms to verify the factual accuracy of
their outputs. In this work, we present a holistic end-to-end solution for
annotating the factuality of LLM-generated responses, which encompasses a
multi-stage annotation scheme designed to yield detailed labels concerning the
verifiability and factual inconsistencies found in LLM outputs. We design and
build an annotation tool to speed up the labelling procedure and ease the
workload of raters. It allows flexible incorporation of automatic results in
any stage, e.g. automatically-retrieved evidence. We further construct an
open-domain document-level factuality benchmark in three-level granularity:
claim, sentence and document. Preliminary experiments show that FacTool,
FactScore and Perplexity.ai are struggling to identify false claims with the
best F1=0.53. Annotation tool, benchmark and code are available at

<p>Large language models achieve high performance on many but not all downstream
tasks. The interaction between pretraining data and task data is commonly
assumed to determine this variance: a task with data that is more similar to a
model's pretraining data is assumed to be easier for that model. We test
whether distributional and example-specific similarity measures (embedding-,
token- and model-based) correlate with language model performance through a
large-scale comparison of the Pile and C4 pretraining datasets with downstream
benchmarks. Similarity correlates with performance for multilingual datasets,
but in other benchmarks, we surprisingly find that similarity metrics are not
correlated with accuracy or even each other. This suggests that the
relationship between pretraining data and downstream tasks is more complex than
often assumed.

<p>Computational argumentation has become an essential tool in various fields,
including artificial intelligence, law, and public policy. It is an emerging
research field in natural language processing (NLP) that attracts increasing
attention. Research on computational argumentation mainly involves two types of
tasks: argument mining and argument generation. As large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong abilities in understanding context and generating
natural language, it is worthwhile to evaluate the performance of LLMs on
various computational argumentation tasks. This work aims to embark on an
assessment of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Flan models and LLaMA2 models, under
zero-shot and few-shot settings within the realm of computational
argumentation. We organize existing tasks into 6 main classes and standardise
the format of 14 open-sourced datasets. In addition, we present a new benchmark
dataset on counter speech generation, that aims to holistically evaluate the
end-to-end performance of LLMs on argument mining and argument generation.
Extensive experiments show that LLMs exhibit commendable performance across
most of these datasets, demonstrating their capabilities in the field of
argumentation. We also highlight the limitations in evaluating computational
argumentation and provide suggestions for future research directions in this
field.

<p>Recent benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) have mostly focused on
application-driven tasks such as complex reasoning and code generation, and
this has led to a scarcity in purely linguistic evaluation of LLMs. Against
this background, we introduce Multilingual Evaluation of Linguistic
Acceptability -- MELA, the first multilingual benchmark on linguistic
acceptability with 48K samples covering 10 languages from a diverse set of
language families. We establish baselines of commonly used LLMs along with
supervised models, and conduct cross-lingual transfer and multi-task learning
experiments with XLM-R. In pursuit of multilingual interpretability, we analyze
the weights of fine-tuned XLM-R to explore the possibility of identifying
transfer difficulty between languages. Our results show that ChatGPT benefits
much from in-context examples but still lags behind fine-tuned XLM-R, while the
performance of GPT-4 is on par with fine-tuned XLM-R even in zero-shot setting.
Cross-lingual and multi-task learning experiments show that unlike semantic
tasks, in-language training data is crucial in acceptability judgements.
Results in layerwise probing indicate that the upper layers of XLM-R become a
task-specific but language-agnostic region for multilingual acceptability
judgment. We also introduce the concept of conflicting weight, which could be a
potential indicator for the difficulty of cross-lingual transfer between
languages. Our data will be available at https://github.com/sjtu-compling/MELA.

<p>This paper presents GRASP, a novel benchmark to evaluate the language
grounding and physical understanding capabilities of video-based multimodal
large language models (LLMs). This evaluation is accomplished via a two-tier
approach leveraging Unity simulations. The initial level tests for language
grounding by assessing a model's ability to relate simple textual descriptions
with visual information. The second level evaluates the model's understanding
of 'Intuitive Physics' principles, such as object permanence and continuity. In
addition to releasing the benchmark, we use it to evaluate several
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs. Our evaluation reveals significant
shortcomings in current models' language grounding and intuitive physics. These
identified limitations underline the importance of benchmarks like GRASP to
monitor the progress of future models in developing these competencies.

<p>Knowledge Editing (KE) for modifying factual knowledge in Large Language
Models (LLMs) has been receiving increasing attention. However, existing
knowledge editing methods are entity-centric, and it is unclear whether this
approach is suitable for a relation-centric perspective. To address this gap,
this paper constructs a new benchmark named RaKE, which focuses on Relation
based Knowledge Editing. In this paper, we establish a suite of innovative
metrics for evaluation and conduct comprehensive experiments involving various
knowledge editing baselines. We notice that existing knowledge editing methods
exhibit the potential difficulty in their ability to edit relations. Therefore,
we further explore the role of relations in factual triplets within the
transformer. Our research results confirm that knowledge related to relations
is not only stored in the FFN network but also in the attention layers. This
provides experimental support for future relation-based knowledge editing
methods.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) can memorize many pretrained sequences verbatim.
This paper studies if we can locate a small set of neurons in LLMs responsible
for memorizing a given sequence. While the concept of localization is often
mentioned in prior work, methods for localization have never been
systematically and directly evaluated; we address this with two benchmarking
approaches. In our INJ Benchmark, we actively inject a piece of new information
into a small subset of LLM weights and measure whether localization methods can
identify these "ground truth" weights. In the DEL Benchmark, we study
localization of pretrained data that LLMs have already memorized; while this
setting lacks ground truth, we can still evaluate localization by measuring
whether dropping out located neurons erases a memorized sequence from the
model. We evaluate five localization methods on our two benchmarks, and both
show similar rankings. All methods exhibit promising localization ability,
especially for pruning-based methods, though the neurons they identify are not
necessarily specific to a single memorized sequence.

<p>In the last decade, the United States has lost more than 500,000 people from
an overdose involving prescription and illicit opioids
(https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html) making it a national
public health emergency (USDHHS, 2017). To more effectively prevent
unintentional opioid overdoses, medical practitioners require robust and timely
tools that can effectively identify at-risk patients. Community-based social
media platforms such as Reddit allow self-disclosure for users to discuss
otherwise sensitive drug-related behaviors, often acting as indicators for
opioid use disorder. Towards this, we present a moderate size corpus of 2500
opioid-related posts from various subreddits spanning 6 different phases of
opioid use: Medical Use, Misuse, Addiction, Recovery, Relapse, Not Using. For
every post, we annotate span-level extractive explanations and crucially study
their role both in annotation quality and model development. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art models in a supervised, few-shot, or zero-shot
setting. Experimental results and error analysis show that identifying the
phases of opioid use disorder is highly contextual and challenging. However, we
find that using explanations during modeling leads to a significant boost in
classification accuracy demonstrating their beneficial role in a high-stakes
domain such as studying the opioid use disorder continuum. The dataset will be
made available for research on Github in the formal version.

<p>Reliance on the inherent knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) can cause
issues such as hallucinations, lack of control, and difficulties in integrating
variable knowledge. To mitigate this, LLMs can be probed to generate responses
by grounding on external context, often given as input (knowledge-augmented
models). Yet, previous research is often confined to a narrow view of the term
"grounding", often only focusing on whether the response contains the correct
answer or not, which does not ensure the reliability of the entire response. To
address this limitation, we introduce a strict definition of grounding: a model
is considered truly grounded when its responses (1) fully utilize necessary
knowledge from the provided context, and (2) don't exceed the knowledge within
the contexts. We introduce a new dataset and a grounding metric to assess this
new definition and perform experiments across 13 LLMs of different sizes and
training methods to provide insights into the factors that influence grounding
performance. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how to
improve grounding capabilities and suggest an area of improvement toward more
reliable and controllable LLM applications.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs), trained predominantly on extensive English
data, often exhibit limitations when applied to other languages. Current
research is primarily focused on enhancing the multilingual capabilities of
these models by employing various tuning strategies. Despite their
effectiveness in certain languages, the understanding of the multilingual
abilities of LLMs remains incomplete. This study endeavors to evaluate the
multilingual capacity of LLMs by conducting an exhaustive analysis across 101
languages, and classifies languages with similar characteristics into four
distinct quadrants. By delving into each quadrant, we shed light on the
rationale behind their categorization and offer actionable guidelines for
tuning these languages. Extensive experiments reveal that existing LLMs possess
multilingual capabilities that surpass our expectations, and we can
significantly improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by focusing on these
distinct attributes present in each quadrant.

<p>Online gender based violence has grown concomitantly with adoption of the
internet and social media. Its effects are worse in the Global majority where
many users use social media in languages other than English. The scale and
volume of conversations on the internet has necessitated the need for automated
detection of hate speech, and more specifically gendered abuse. There is,
however, a lack of language specific and contextual data to build such
automated tools. In this paper we present a dataset on gendered abuse in three
languages- Hindi, Tamil and Indian English. The dataset comprises of tweets
annotated along three questions pertaining to the experience of gender abuse,
by experts who identify as women or a member of the LGBTQIA community in South
Asia. Through this dataset we demonstrate a participatory approach to creating

<p>Large language models have been shown to encode a variety of social biases,
which carries the risk of downstream harms. While the impact of these biases
has been recognized, prior methods for bias evaluation have been limited to
binary association tests on small datasets, offering a constrained view of the
nature of societal biases within language models. In this paper, we propose an
original framework for probing language models for societal biases. We collect
a probing dataset to analyze language models' general associations, as well as
along the axes of societal categories, identities, and stereotypes. To this
end, we leverage a novel perplexity-based fairness score. We curate a
large-scale benchmarking dataset addressing drawbacks and limitations of
existing fairness collections, expanding to a variety of different identities
and stereotypes. When comparing our methodology with prior work, we demonstrate
that biases within language models are more nuanced than previously
acknowledged. In agreement with recent findings, we find that larger model
variants exhibit a higher degree of bias. Moreover, we expose how identities
expressing different religions lead to the most pronounced disparate treatments
across all models.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their capabilities, yet
this progress is accompanied by a growing array of safety risks. While
significant attention has been dedicated to exploiting weaknesses in LLMs
through jailbreaking attacks, there remains a paucity of exploration into
defending against these attacks. We point out a pivotal factor contributing to
the success of jailbreaks: the inherent conflict between the goals of being
helpful and ensuring safety. To counter jailbreaking attacks, we propose to
integrate goal prioritization at both training and inference stages.
Implementing goal prioritization during inference substantially diminishes the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) of jailbreaking attacks, reducing it from 66.4% to
2.0% for ChatGPT and from 68.2% to 19.4% for Vicuna-33B, without compromising
general performance. Furthermore, integrating the concept of goal
prioritization into the training phase reduces the ASR from 71.0% to 6.6% for
LLama2-13B. Remarkably, even in scenarios where no jailbreaking samples are
included during training, our approach slashes the ASR by half, decreasing it
from 71.0% to 34.0%. Additionally, our findings reveal that while stronger LLMs
face greater safety risks, they also possess a greater capacity to be steered
towards defending against such attacks. We hope our work could contribute to
the comprehension of jailbreaking attacks and defenses, and shed light on the
relationship between LLMs' capability and safety. Our code will be available at

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have
broadened the scope for improving multi-step reasoning capabilities. Usually,
answer calibration strategies such as step-level or path-level calibration play
a vital role in multi-step reasoning. While effective, there remains a
significant gap in our understanding of the key factors that drive their
success. In this paper, we break down the design of recent answer calibration
strategies and present a unified view which establishes connections between
them. We then conduct a thorough evaluation on these strategies from a unified
view, systematically scrutinizing step-level and path-level answer calibration
across multiple paths. Our study holds the potential to illuminate key insights
for optimizing multi-step reasoning with answer calibration.

<p>Understanding events in texts is a core objective of natural language
understanding, which requires detecting event occurrences, extracting event
arguments, and analyzing inter-event relationships. However, due to the
annotation challenges brought by task complexity, a large-scale dataset
covering the full process of event understanding has long been absent. In this
paper, we introduce MAVEN-Arg, which augments MAVEN datasets with event
argument annotations, making the first all-in-one dataset supporting event
detection, event argument extraction (EAE), and event relation extraction. As
an EAE benchmark, MAVEN-Arg offers three main advantages: (1) a comprehensive
schema covering 162 event types and 612 argument roles, all with expert-written
definitions and examples; (2) a large data scale, containing 98,591 events and
290,613 arguments obtained with laborious human annotation; (3) the exhaustive
annotation supporting all task variants of EAE, which annotates both entity and
non-entity event arguments in document level. Experiments indicate that
MAVEN-Arg is quite challenging for both fine-tuned EAE models and proprietary
large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate the benefits of an
all-in-one dataset, we preliminarily explore a potential application, future
event prediction, with LLMs. MAVEN-Arg and our code can be obtained from

<p>Social media discourse from US politicians frequently consists of 'seemingly
similar language used by opposing sides of the political spectrum'. But often,
it translates to starkly contrasting real-world actions. For instance, "We need
to keep our students safe from mass shootings" may signal either "arming
teachers to stop the shooter" or "banning guns to reduce mass shootings"
depending on who says it and their political stance on the issue. In this
paper, we define and characterize the context that is required to fully
understand such ambiguous statements in a computational setting and ground them
in real-world entities, actions, and attitudes. To that end, we propose two
challenging datasets that require an understanding of the real-world context of
the text to be solved effectively. We benchmark these datasets against
baselines built upon large pre-trained models such as BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-3,
etc. Additionally, we develop and benchmark more structured baselines building
upon existing 'Discourse Contextualization Framework' and 'Political Actor
Representation' models. We perform analysis of the datasets and baseline
predictions to obtain further insights into the pragmatic language
understanding challenges posed by the proposed social grounding tasks.

<p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) consist of links that describe relationships between
entities. Due to the difficulty of manually enumerating all relationships
between entities, automatically completing them is essential for KGs. Knowledge
Graph Completion (KGC) is a task that infers unseen relationships between
entities in a KG. Traditional embedding-based KGC methods, such as RESCAL,
TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, HAKE, HousE, etc., infer missing links using
only the knowledge from training data. In contrast, the recent Pre-trained
Language Model (PLM)-based KGC utilizes knowledge obtained during pre-training.
Therefore, PLM-based KGC can estimate missing links between entities by reusing
memorized knowledge from pre-training without inference. This approach is
problematic because building KGC models aims to infer unseen links between
entities. However, conventional evaluations in KGC do not consider inference
and memorization abilities separately. Thus, a PLM-based KGC method, which
achieves high performance in current KGC evaluations, may be ineffective in
practical applications. To address this issue, we analyze whether PLM-based KGC
methods make inferences or merely access memorized knowledge. For this purpose,
we propose a method for constructing synthetic datasets specified in this
analysis and conclude that PLMs acquire the inference abilities required for
KGC through pre-training, even though the performance improvements mostly come
from textual information of entities and relations.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating fluent text. However, they often encounter the challenge of
generating inaccurate or hallucinated content. This issue is common in both
non-retrieval-based generation and retrieval-augmented generation approaches,
and existing post-hoc rectification methods may not address the accumulated
hallucination errors that may be caused by the "snowballing" issue, especially
in reasoning tasks. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel approach
called Real-time Verification and Rectification (Ever). Instead of waiting
until the end of the generation process to rectify hallucinations, Ever employs
a real-time, step-wise generation and hallucination rectification strategy. The
primary objective is to detect and rectify hallucinations as they occur during
the text generation process. When compared to both retrieval-based and
non-retrieval-based baselines, Ever demonstrates a significant improvement in
generating trustworthy and factually accurate text across a diverse range of
tasks, including short-form QA, biography generation, and multi-hop reasoning.

exhibit meaningful social variation. We construct a computational pipeline to
cluster individual instances of memes into templates and semantic variables,
taking advantage of their multimodal structure in doing so. We apply this
method to a large collection of meme images from Reddit and make available the
resulting \textsc{SemanticMemes} dataset of 3.8M images clustered by their

memes, discovering not only that socially meaningful variation in meme usage
exists between subreddits, but that patterns of meme innovation and

<p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a recent technique to
improve the quality of the text generated by a language model, making it closer
to what humans would generate. A core ingredient in RLHF's success in aligning
and improving large language models (LLMs) is its reward model, trained using
human feedback on model outputs. In machine translation (MT), where metrics
trained from human annotations can readily be used as reward models, recent
methods using minimum Bayes risk decoding and reranking have succeeded in
improving the final quality of translation. In this study, we comprehensively
explore and compare techniques for integrating quality metrics as reward models
into the MT pipeline. This includes using the reward model for data filtering,
during the training phase through RL, and at inference time by employing
reranking techniques, and we assess the effects of combining these in a unified
approach. Our experimental results, conducted across multiple translation
tasks, underscore the crucial role of effective data filtering, based on
estimated quality, in harnessing the full potential of RL in enhancing MT
quality. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining

<p>Effectively using a given context is paramount for large language models. A
context window can include task specifications, retrieved documents, previous
conversations, and even model self-reflections, functioning similarly to
episodic memory. While efforts are being made to expand the context window,
studies indicate that LLMs do not use their context optimally for response
generation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to optimize LLMs using
ranking metrics, which teaches LLMs to rank a collection of
contextually-grounded candidate responses. Rather than a traditional full
ordering, we advocate for a partial ordering. This is because achieving
consensus on the perfect order for system responses can be challenging. Our
partial ordering is more robust, less sensitive to noise, and can be acquired
through human labelers, heuristic functions, or model distillation. We test our
system's improved contextual understanding using the latest benchmarks,
including a new multi-document question answering dataset. We conduct ablation
studies to understand crucial factors, such as how to gather candidate
responses, determine their most suitable order, and balance supervised
fine-tuning with ranking metrics. Our approach, named RRescue, suggests a
promising avenue for enhancing LLMs' contextual understanding via response
ranking.

<p>Effective conversation requires common ground: a shared understanding between
the participants. Common ground, however, does not emerge spontaneously in
conversation. Speakers and listeners work together to both identify and
construct a shared basis while avoiding misunderstanding. To accomplish
grounding, humans rely on a range of dialogue acts, like clarification (What do
you mean?) and acknowledgment (I understand.). In domains like teaching and
emotional support, carefully constructing grounding prevents misunderstanding.
However, it is unclear whether large language models (LLMs) leverage these
dialogue acts in constructing common ground. To this end, we curate a set of
grounding acts and propose corresponding metrics that quantify attempted
grounding. We study whether LLMs use these grounding acts, simulating them
taking turns from several dialogue datasets, and comparing the results to
humans. We find that current LLMs are presumptive grounders, biased towards
assuming common ground without using grounding acts. To understand the roots of
this behavior, we examine the role of instruction tuning and reinforcement
learning with human feedback (RLHF), finding that RLHF leads to less grounding.
Altogether, our work highlights the need for more research investigating
grounding in human-AI interaction.

<p>In this paper, we tackle the significant challenge of temporal knowledge
reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), an area where such models frequently
encounter difficulties. These difficulties often result in the generation of
misleading or incorrect information, primarily due to their limited capacity to
process evolving factual knowledge and complex temporal logic. In response, we
propose a novel, constructivism-based approach that advocates for a paradigm
shift in LLM learning towards an active, ongoing process of knowledge synthesis
and customization. At the heart of our proposal is the Abstract Reasoning
Induction ARI framework, which divides temporal reasoning into two distinct
phases: Knowledge-agnostic and Knowledge-based. This division aims to reduce
instances of hallucinations and improve LLMs' capacity for integrating abstract
methodologies derived from historical data. Our approach achieves remarkable
improvements, with relative gains of 29.7\% and 9.27\% on two temporal QA
datasets, underscoring its efficacy in advancing temporal reasoning in LLMs.

<p>We are currently in an era of fierce competition among various large language
models (LLMs) continuously pushing the boundaries of benchmark performance.
However, genuinely assessing the capabilities of these LLMs has become a
challenging and critical issue due to potential data contamination, and it
wastes dozens of time and effort for researchers and engineers to download and
try those contaminated models. To save our precious time, we propose a novel
and useful method, Clean-Eval, which mitigates the issue of data contamination
and evaluates the LLMs in a cleaner manner. Clean-Eval employs an LLM to
paraphrase and back-translate the contaminated data into a candidate set,
generating expressions with the same meaning but in different surface forms. A
semantic detector is then used to filter the generated low-quality samples to
narrow down this candidate set. The best candidate is finally selected from
this set based on the BLEURT score. According to human assessment, this best
candidate is semantically similar to the original contamination data but
expressed differently. All candidates can form a new benchmark to evaluate the
model. Our experiments illustrate that Clean-Eval substantially restores the
actual evaluation results on contaminated LLMs under both few-shot learning and
fine-tuning scenarios.

<p>Cognitive research indicates that abstraction ability is essential in human
intelligence, which remains under-explored in language models. In this paper,
we present AbsPyramid, a unified entailment graph of 221K textual descriptions
of abstraction knowledge. While existing resources only touch nouns or verbs
within simplified events or specific domains, AbsPyramid collects abstract
knowledge for three components of diverse events to comprehensively evaluate
the abstraction ability of language models in the open domain. Experimental
results demonstrate that current LLMs face challenges comprehending abstraction
knowledge in zero-shot and few-shot settings. By training on our rich
abstraction knowledge, we find LLMs can acquire basic abstraction abilities and
generalize to unseen events. In the meantime, we empirically show that our
benchmark is comprehensive to enhance LLMs across two previous abstraction
tasks.

<p>Parameter Efficient Tuning has been an prominent approach to adapt the Large
Language Model to downstream tasks. Most previous works considers adding the
dense trainable parameters, where all parameters are used to adapt certain
task. We found this less effective empirically using the example of LoRA that
introducing more trainable parameters does not help. Motivated by this we
investigate the importance of leveraging "sparse" computation and propose SiRA:
sparse mixture of low rank adaption. SiRA leverages the Sparse Mixture of
Expert(SMoE) to boost the performance of LoRA. Specifically it enforces the top
$k$ experts routing with a capacity limit restricting the maximum number of
tokens each expert can process. We propose a novel and simple expert dropout on
top of gating network to reduce the over-fitting issue. Through extensive
experiments, we verify SiRA performs better than LoRA and other mixture of
expert approaches across different single tasks and multitask settings.

<p>Powerful large language models have facilitated the development of writing
assistants that promise to significantly improve the quality and efficiency of
composition and communication. However, a barrier to effective assistance is
the lack of personalization in LLM outputs to the author's communication style
and specialized knowledge. In this paper, we address this challenge by
proposing PEARL, a retrieval-augmented LLM writing assistant personalized with
a generation-calibrated retriever. Our retriever is trained to select historic
user-authored documents for prompt augmentation, such that they are likely to
best personalize LLM generations for a user request. We propose two key
novelties for training our retriever: 1) A training data selection method that
identifies user requests likely to benefit from personalization and documents
that provide that benefit; and 2) A scale-calibrating KL-divergence objective
that ensures that our retriever closely tracks the benefit of a document for
personalized generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PEARL in
generating personalized workplace social media posts and Reddit comments.
Finally, we showcase the potential of a generation-calibrated retriever to
double as a performance predictor and further improve low-quality generations
via LLM chaining.

<p>In recent times, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
performance on various document-level tasks such as document classification,
summarization, and question-answering. However, research on understanding their
capabilities on the task of self-contradictions in long documents has been very
limited. In this work, we introduce ContraDoc, the first human-annotated
dataset to study self-contradictions in long documents across multiple domains,
varying document lengths, self-contradictions types, and scope. We then analyze
the current capabilities of four state-of-the-art open-source and commercially
available LLMs: GPT3.5, GPT4, PaLM2, and LLaMAv2 on this dataset. While GPT4
performs the best and can outperform humans on this task, we find that it is
still unreliable and struggles with self-contradictions that require more
nuance and context. We release the dataset and all the code associated with the

<p>While large language models (LLMs) already achieve strong performance on
standard generic summarization benchmarks, their performance on more complex
summarization task settings is less studied. Therefore, we benchmark LLMs on
instruction controllable text summarization, where the model input consists of
both a source article and a natural language requirement for the desired
summary characteristics. To this end, we curate an evaluation-only dataset for
this task setting and conduct human evaluation on 5 LLM-based summarization
systems. We then benchmark LLM-based automatic evaluation for this task with 4
different evaluation protocols and 11 LLMs, resulting in 40 evaluation methods
in total. Our study reveals that instruction controllable text summarization
remains a challenging task for LLMs, since (1) all LLMs evaluated still make
factual and other types of errors in their summaries; (2) all LLM-based
evaluation methods cannot achieve a strong alignment with human annotators when
judging the quality of candidate summaries; (3) different LLMs show large
performance gaps in summary generation and evaluation. We make our collected
benchmark, InstruSum, publicly available to facilitate future research in this

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to
synthesize plausible and fluent text. However they remain vulnerable to
hallucinations, and thus their outputs generally require manual human
verification for high-stakes applications, which can be time-consuming and
difficult. This paper proposes symbolically grounded generation (SymGen) as a
simple approach for enabling easier validation of an LLM's output. SymGen
prompts an LLM to interleave its regular output text with explicit symbolic
references to fields present in some conditioning data (e.g., a table in JSON
format). The references can be used to display the provenance of different
spans of text in the generation, reducing the effort required for manual
verification. Across data-to-text and question answering experiments, we find
that LLMs are able to directly output text that makes use of symbolic
references while maintaining fluency and accuracy.

remarkable capabilities, such as disease detection. However, there is currently
a lack of a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the capability of LLMs in

comprehensive benchmark tailored to the unique characteristics of the mental
health domain. This benchmark encompasses a total of six sub-tasks, covering
three dimensions, to systematically assess the capabilities of LLMs in the
realm of mental health. We have designed corresponding concise prompts for each

our benchmark. Experiment results not only demonstrate significant room for
improvement in current LLMs concerning mental health but also unveil potential

<p>Abstract grammatical knowledge - of parts of speech and grammatical patterns
- is key to the capacity for linguistic generalization in humans. But how
abstract is grammatical knowledge in large language models? In the human
literature, compelling evidence for grammatical abstraction comes from
structural priming. A sentence that shares the same grammatical structure as a
preceding sentence is processed and produced more readily. Because confounds
exist when using stimuli in a single language, evidence of abstraction is even
more compelling from crosslingual structural priming, where use of a syntactic
structure in one language primes an analogous structure in another language. We
measure crosslingual structural priming in large language models, comparing
model behavior to human experimental results from eight crosslingual
experiments covering six languages, and four monolingual structural priming
experiments in three non-English languages. We find evidence for abstract
monolingual and crosslingual grammatical representations in the models that
function similarly to those found in humans. These results demonstrate that
grammatical representations in multilingual language models are not only
similar across languages, but they can causally influence text produced in
different languages.

<p>While large language models (LLMs) are equipped with longer text input
capabilities than before, they are struggling to seek correct information in
long contexts. The "lost in the middle" problem challenges most LLMs, referring
to the dramatic decline in accuracy when correct information is located in the
middle. To overcome this crucial issue, this paper proposes to enhance the
information searching and reflection ability of LLMs in long contexts via
specially designed tasks called Attention Strengthening Multi-doc QA (ASM QA).
Following these tasks, our model excels in focusing more precisely on the
desired information. Experimental results show substantial improvement in
Multi-doc QA and other benchmarks, superior to state-of-the-art models by 13.7%
absolute gain in shuffled settings, by 21.5% in passage retrieval task. We

<p>Ambiguity is a natural language phenomenon occurring at different levels of
syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. It is widely studied; in Psycholinguistics,
for instance, we have a variety of competing studies for the human
disambiguation processes. These studies are empirical and based on eye-tracking
measurements. Here we take first steps towards formalizing these processes for
semantic ambiguities where we identified the presence of two features: (1)
joint plausibility degrees of different possible interpretations, (2) causal
structures according to which certain words play a more substantial role in the
processes. The novel sheaf-theoretic model of definite causality developed by
Gogioso and Pinzani in QPL 2021 offers tools to model and reason about these
features. We applied this theory to a dataset of ambiguous phrases extracted
from Psycholinguistics literature and their human plausibility judgements
collected by us using the Amazon Mechanical Turk engine. We measured the causal
fractions of different disambiguation orders within the phrases and discovered
two prominent orders: from subject to verb in the subject-verb and from object
to verb in the verb object phrases. We also found evidence for delay in the
disambiguation of polysemous vs homonymous verbs, again compatible with
Psycholinguistic findings.

<p>In natural language processing (NLP), the role of embeddings in representing
linguistic semantics is crucial. Despite the prevalence of vector
representations in embedding sets, they exhibit limitations in expressiveness
and lack comprehensive set operations. To address this, we attempt to formulate
and apply sets and their operations within pre-trained embedding spaces.
Inspired by quantum logic, we propose to go beyond the conventional vector set
representation with our novel subspace-based approach. This methodology
constructs subspaces using pre-trained embedding sets, effectively preserving
semantic nuances previously overlooked, and consequently consistently improving

<p>This work is intended as a voice in the discussion over previous claims that
a pretrained large language model (LLM) based on the Transformer model
architecture can be sentient. Such claims have been made concerning the LaMDA
model and also concerning the current wave of LLM-powered chatbots, such as
ChatGPT. This claim, if confirmed, would have serious ramifications in the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) community due to wide-spread use of similar
models. However, here we take the position that such a large language model
cannot be sentient, or conscious, and that LaMDA in particular exhibits no
advances over other similar models that would qualify it. We justify this by
analysing the Transformer architecture through Integrated Information Theory of
consciousness. We see the claims of sentience as part of a wider tendency to

<p>Recently decades have witnessed the empirical success of framing Knowledge
Graph (KG) embeddings via language models. However, language model-based KG
embeddings are usually deployed as static artifacts, making them difficult to
modify post-deployment without re-training after deployment. To address this
issue, we propose a new task of editing language model-based KG embeddings in
this paper. This task is designed to facilitate rapid, data-efficient updates
to KG embeddings without compromising the performance of other aspects. We
build four new datasets: E-FB15k237, A-FB15k237, E-WN18RR, and A-WN18RR, and
evaluate several knowledge editing baselines demonstrating the limited ability
of previous models to handle the proposed challenging task. We further propose
a simple yet strong baseline dubbed KGEditor, which utilizes additional
parametric layers of the hyper network to edit/add facts. Our comprehensive
experimental results reveal that KGEditor excels in updating specific facts
without impacting the overall performance, even when faced with limited
training resources. Code and datasets are available in

<p>Large language models have revolutionized the field of artificial
intelligence and have been used in various applications. Among these models,
ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) has been developed by OpenAI,
it stands out as a powerful tool that has been widely adopted. ChatGPT has been
successfully applied in numerous areas, including chatbots, content generation,
language translation, personalized recommendations, and even medical diagnosis
and treatment. Its success in these applications can be attributed to its
ability to generate human-like responses, understand natural language, and
adapt to different contexts. Its versatility and accuracy make it a powerful
tool for natural language processing (NLP). However, there are also limitations
to ChatGPT, such as its tendency to produce biased responses and its potential
to perpetuate harmful language patterns. This article provides a comprehensive
overview of ChatGPT, its applications, advantages, and limitations.
Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations
when using this robust tool in real-world scenarios. Finally, This paper
contributes to ongoing discussions surrounding artificial intelligence and its
impact on vision and NLP domains by providing insights into prompt engineering
techniques.

<p>Text-to-SQL parsing, which aims at converting natural language instructions
into executable SQLs, has gained increasing attention in recent years. In
particular, Codex and ChatGPT have shown impressive results in this task.
However, most of the prevalent benchmarks, i.e., Spider, and WikiSQL, focus on
database schema with few rows of database contents leaving the gap between
academic study and real-world applications. To mitigate this gap, we present
Bird, a big benchmark for large-scale database grounded in text-to-SQL tasks,
containing 12,751 pairs of text-to-SQL data and 95 databases with a total size
of 33.4 GB, spanning 37 professional domains. Our emphasis on database values
highlights the new challenges of dirty database contents, external knowledge
between NL questions and database contents, and SQL efficiency, particularly in
the context of massive databases. To solve these problems, text-to-SQL models
must feature database value comprehension in addition to semantic parsing. The
experimental results demonstrate the significance of database values in
generating accurate text-to-SQLs for big databases. Furthermore, even the most
effective text-to-SQL models, i.e. ChatGPT, only achieves 40.08% in execution
accuracy, which is still far from the human result of 92.96%, proving that
challenges still stand. Besides, we also provide an efficiency analysis to
offer insights into generating text-to-efficient-SQLs that are beneficial to
industries. We believe that BIRD will contribute to advancing real-world
applications of text-to-SQL research. The leaderboard and source code are

<p>Comparative knowledge (e.g., steel is stronger and heavier than styrofoam) is
an essential component of our world knowledge, yet understudied in prior
literature. In this paper, we study the task of comparative knowledge
acquisition, motivated by the dramatic improvements in the capabilities of
extreme-scale language models like GPT-4, which have fueled efforts towards
harvesting their knowledge into knowledge bases. While acquisition of such
comparative knowledge is much easier from models like GPT-4, compared to their
considerably smaller and weaker counterparts such as GPT-2, not even the most
powerful models are exempt from making errors. We thus ask: to what extent are
models at different scales able to generate valid and diverse comparative
knowledge?
</p>
<p>We introduce NeuroComparatives, a novel framework for comparative knowledge
distillation overgenerated from language models such as GPT-variants and Llama,
followed by stringent filtering of the generated knowledge. Our framework
acquires comparative knowledge between everyday objects, producing a corpus of
up to 8.8M comparisons over 1.74M entity pairs - 10X larger and 30% more
diverse than existing resources. Moreover, human evaluations show that
NeuroComparatives outperform existing resources (up to 32% absolute
improvement). We also demonstrate the utility of our distilled
NeuroComparatives on three downstream tasks. Our results show that
neuro-symbolic manipulation of smaller models offer complementary benefits to
the currently dominant practice of prompting extreme-scale language models for
knowledge distillation.

<p>Conventional Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) approaches typically follow
the static information extraction paradigm with a closed set of pre-defined
schema. As a result, such approaches fall short when applied to dynamic
scenarios or domains, whereas a new type of knowledge emerges. This
necessitates a system that can handle evolving schema automatically to extract
information for KGC. To address this need, we propose a new task called
schema-adaptable KGC, which aims to continually extract entity, relation, and
event based on a dynamically changing schema graph without re-training. We
first split and convert existing datasets based on three principles to build a
benchmark, i.e., horizontal schema expansion, vertical schema expansion, and
hybrid schema expansion; then investigate the schema-adaptable performance of
several well-known approaches such as Text2Event, TANL, UIE and GPT-3.5. We
further propose a simple yet effective baseline dubbed \textsc{AdaKGC}, which
contains schema-enriched prefix instructor and schema-conditioned dynamic
decoding to better handle evolving schema. Comprehensive experimental results
illustrate that AdaKGC can outperform baselines but still have room for
improvement. We hope the proposed work can deliver benefits to the community.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prediction
performance for a growing array of tasks. However, their rapid proliferation
and increasing opaqueness have created a growing need for interpretability.
Here, we ask whether we can automatically obtain natural language explanations
for black box text modules. A "text module" is any function that maps text to a
scalar continuous value, such as a submodule within an LLM or a fitted model of
a brain region. "Black box" indicates that we only have access to the module's
inputs/outputs.
</p>
<p>We introduce Summarize and Score (SASC), a method that takes in a text module
and returns a natural language explanation of the module's selectivity along
with a score for how reliable the explanation is. We study SASC in 3 contexts.
First, we evaluate SASC on synthetic modules and find that it often recovers
ground truth explanations. Second, we use SASC to explain modules found within
a pre-trained BERT model, enabling inspection of the model's internals.
Finally, we show that SASC can generate explanations for the response of
individual fMRI voxels to language stimuli, with potential applications to
fine-grained brain mapping. All code for using SASC and reproducing results is
made available on Github.

<p>We propose utilizing n-best reranking to enhance the Sequence-Level Knowledge
Distillation (Kim and Rush, 2016) where we explore hypotheses beyond the top-1

effectiveness of our proposal is validated through experiments on the WMT'21
German-English and Chinese-English translation tasks. Our results demonstrate
that utilizing the pseudo-labels generated by our n-best reranker leads to a
significantly more accurate student model. In fact, our best student model
achieves comparable accuracy to a large translation model from (Tran et al.,

<p>Large language models (LLMs) are becoming attractive as few-shot reasoners to
solve Natural Language (NL)-related tasks. However, there is still much to
learn about how well LLMs understand structured data, such as tables. While it
is true that tables can be used as inputs to LLMs with serialization, there is
a lack of comprehensive studies examining whether LLMs can truly comprehend
such data. In this paper, we try to understand this by designing a benchmark to
evaluate the structural understanding capabilities (SUC) of LLMs. The benchmark
we create includes seven tasks, each with its own unique challenges, \eg, cell
lookup, row retrieval, and size detection. We conduct a series of evaluations
on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We find that the performance varied depending on several
input choices, including table input format, content order, role prompting, and
partition marks. Drawing from the insights gained through the benchmark
evaluations, we propose \textit{self-augmentation} for effective structural
prompting, such as critical value / range identification using LLMs' internal
knowledge. When combined with carefully chosen input choices, these structural
prompting methods lead to promising improvements in LLM performance on a
variety of tabular tasks, \eg, TabFact($\uparrow2.31\%$),
HybridQA($\uparrow2.13\%$), SQA($\uparrow2.72\%$), Feverous($\uparrow0.84\%$),
and ToTTo($\uparrow5.68\%$). We believe that our benchmark and proposed
prompting methods can serve as a simple yet generic selection for future
research.

<p>Trustworthy answer content is abundant in many high-resource languages and is
instantly accessible through question answering systems, yet this content can
be hard to access for those that do not speak these languages. The leap forward
in cross-lingual modeling quality offered by generative language models offers
much promise, yet their raw generations often fall short in factuality. To
improve trustworthiness in these systems, a promising direction is to attribute
the answer to a retrieved source, possibly in a content-rich language different
from the query. Our work is the first to study attribution for cross-lingual
question answering. First, we collect data in 5 languages to assess the
attribution level of a state-of-the-art cross-lingual QA system. To our
surprise, we find that a substantial portion of the answers is not attributable
to any retrieved passages (up to 50% of answers exactly matching a gold
reference) despite the system being able to attend directly to the retrieved
text. Second, to address this poor attribution level, we experiment with a wide
range of attribution detection techniques. We find that Natural Language
Inference models and PaLM 2 fine-tuned on a very small amount of attribution
data can accurately detect attribution. Based on these models, we improve the
attribution level of a cross-lingual question-answering system. Overall, we
show that current academic generative cross-lingual QA systems have substantial
shortcomings in attribution and we build tooling to mitigate these issues.

<p>Recent work on extending coreference resolution across domains and languages
relies on annotated data in both the target domain and language. At the same
time, pre-trained large language models (LMs) have been reported to exhibit
strong zero- and few-shot learning abilities across a wide range of NLP tasks.
However, prior work mostly studied this ability using artificial sentence-level
datasets such as the Winograd Schema Challenge. In this paper, we assess the
feasibility of prompt-based coreference resolution by evaluating
instruction-tuned language models on difficult, linguistically-complex
coreference benchmarks (e.g., CoNLL-2012). We show that prompting for
coreference can outperform current unsupervised coreference systems, although
this approach appears to be reliant on high-quality mention detectors. Further
investigations reveal that instruction-tuned LMs generalize surprisingly well
across domains, languages, and time periods; yet continued fine-tuning of
neural models should still be preferred if small amounts of annotated examples
are available.

<p>Trustworthy language models should abstain from answering questions when they
do not know the answer. However, the answer to a question can be unknown for a
variety of reasons. Prior research has focused on the case in which the
question is clear and the answer is unambiguous but possibly unknown, but the
answer to a question can also be unclear due to uncertainty of the questioner's
intent or context. We investigate question answering from this perspective,
focusing on answering a subset of questions with a high degree of accuracy,
from a set of questions in which many are inherently ambiguous. In this
setting, we find that the most reliable approach to decide when to abstain
involves quantifying repetition within sampled model outputs, rather than the
model's likelihood or self-verification as used in prior work. We find this to
be the case across different types of uncertainty and model scales,and with or
without instruction tuning. Our results suggest that sampling-based confidence
scores help calibrate answers to relatively unambiguous questions, with more
dramatic improvements on ambiguous questions.

<p>LLMs (large language models) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable language
understanding and generation capabilities. Although reference-free evaluators
based on LLMs show better human alignment than traditional reference-based
evaluators, there are many challenges in using reference-free evaluators based
on LLMs. Reference-free evaluators are more suitable for open-ended examples
with different semantics responses. But not all examples are open-ended. For
closed-ended examples with unique correct semantic response, reference-free
evaluators will still consider it high quality when giving a response that is
inconsistent with the facts and the semantic of reference. In order to
comprehensively evaluate the reliability of evaluators based on LLMs, we
construct two adversarial meta-evaluation dialogue generation datasets
KdConv-ADV and DSTC7-ADV based on KdConv and DSTC7-AVSD, respectively. Compared
to previous meta-evaluation benchmarks, KdConv-ADV and DSTC7-ADV are much more
challenging since they requires evaluators to be able to reasonably evaluate
closed-ended examples with the help of external knowledge or even its own
knowledge. Empirical results show that the ability of LLMs to identify
unreasonable responses is insufficient. There are risks in using eference-free
evaluators based on LLMs to evaluate the quality of dialogue responses.

<p>The rise of social media has been argued to intensify uncivil and hostile
online political discourse. Yet, to date, there is a lack of clarity on what
incivility means in the political sphere. In this work, we utilize a
multidimensional perspective of political incivility, developed in the fields
of political science and communication, that differentiates between
impoliteness and political intolerance. We present state-of-the-art incivility
detection results using a large dataset of 13K political tweets, collected and
annotated per this distinction. Applying political incivility detection at
large-scale, we observe that political incivility demonstrates a highly skewed
distribution over users, and examine social factors that correlate with
incivility at subpopulation and user-level. Finally, we propose an approach for
modeling social context information about the tweet author alongside the tweet
content, showing that this leads to improved performance on the task of
political incivility detection. We believe that this latter result holds
promise for socially-informed text processing in general.

<p>SUPERB was proposed to evaluate the generalizability of self-supervised
learning (SSL) speech models across various tasks. However, it incurs high
computational costs due to the large datasets and diverse tasks. In this paper,
we introduce MiniSUPERB, a lightweight benchmark that efficiently evaluates SSL
speech models with comparable results to SUPERB but lower computational costs
significantly. We carefully select representative tasks, sample datasets, and
extract model representations offline. Our approach achieves a Spearman's rank
correlation of 0.954 and 0.982 with SUPERB Paper and SUPERB Challenge,
respectively. Additionally, we reduce the computational cost by 97% in terms of
Multiply-ACcumulate operations (MACs). Furthermore, we evaluate SSL speech
models in few-shot scenarios and observe significant variations in their
performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine both the
computational cost of the model itself and the cost of evaluating it on a
benchmark.

<p>As the demand for sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) models
continues to grow, so does the need for efficient pre-training techniques.
Current NLP models undergo resource-intensive pre-training. In response, we
introduce $FastDoc$ (Fast Pre-training Technique using Document-Level Metadata
and Taxonomy), a novel approach designed to significantly reduce computational
demands. $FastDoc$ leverages document metadata and domain-specific taxonomy as
supervision signals. It involves continual pre-training of an open-domain
transformer encoder using sentence-level embeddings, followed by fine-tuning
using token-level embeddings. We evaluate $FastDoc$ on six tasks across nine
datasets spanning three distinct domains. Remarkably, $FastDoc$ achieves
remarkable compute reductions of approximately 1,000x, 4,500x, 500x compared to
competitive approaches in Customer Support, Scientific, and Legal domains,
respectively. Importantly, these efficiency gains do not compromise performance
relative to competitive baselines. Furthermore, reduced pre-training data
mitigates catastrophic forgetting, ensuring consistent performance in
open-domain scenarios. $FastDoc$ offers a promising solution for
resource-efficient pre-training, with potential applications spanning various
domains.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) bring transformative benefits alongside unique
challenges, including intellectual property (IP) and ethical concerns. This
position paper explores a novel angle to mitigate these risks, drawing
parallels between LLMs and established web systems. We identify "citation" -
the acknowledgement or reference to a source or evidence - as a crucial yet
missing component in LLMs. Incorporating citation could enhance content
transparency and verifiability, thereby confronting the IP and ethical issues
in the deployment of LLMs. We further propose that a comprehensive citation
mechanism for LLMs should account for both non-parametric and parametric
content. Despite the complexity of implementing such a citation mechanism,
along with the potential pitfalls, we advocate for its development. Building on
this foundation, we outline several research problems in this area, aiming to
guide future explorations towards building more responsible and accountable
LLMs.

<p>Parameter-efficient tuning (PET) has been widely explored in recent years
because it tunes much fewer parameters (PET modules) than full-parameter
fine-tuning (FT) while still stimulating sufficient knowledge from large
language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks. Moreover, when PET is employed to
serve multiple tasks, different task-specific PET modules can be built on a
frozen LLM, avoiding redundant LLM deployments. Although PET significantly
reduces the cost of tuning and deploying LLMs, its inference still suffers from
the computational bottleneck of LLMs. To address the above issue, we propose an
effective PET framework based on compressed LLMs, named "CPET". In CPET, we
evaluate the impact of mainstream LLM compression techniques on PET performance
and then introduce knowledge inheritance and recovery strategies to restore the
knowledge loss caused by these compression techniques. Our experimental results
demonstrate that, owing to the restoring strategies of CPET, collaborating
task-specific PET modules with a compressed LLM can achieve comparable
performance to collaborating PET modules with the original version of the
compressed LLM and outperform directly applying vanilla PET methods to the
compressed LLM.

<p>Bias amplification is a phenomenon in which models exacerbate biases or
stereotypes present in the training data. In this paper, we study bias
amplification in the text-to-image domain using Stable Diffusion by comparing
gender ratios in training vs. generated images. We find that the model appears
to amplify gender-occupation biases found in the training data (LAION)
considerably. However, we discover that amplification can be largely attributed
to discrepancies between training captions and model prompts. For example, an
inherent difference is that captions from the training data often contain
explicit gender information while our prompts do not, which leads to a
distribution shift and consequently inflates bias measures. Once we account for
distributional differences between texts used for training and generation when
evaluating amplification, we observe that amplification decreases drastically.
Our findings illustrate the challenges of comparing biases in models and their
training data, and highlight confounding factors that impact analyses.

<p>Neural image classifiers can often learn to make predictions by overly
relying on non-predictive features that are spuriously correlated with the
class labels in the training data. This leads to poor performance in real-world
atypical scenarios where such features are absent. Supplementing the training
dataset with images without such spurious features can aid robust learning
against spurious correlations via better generalization. This paper presents
ASPIRE (Language-guided data Augmentation for SPurIous correlation REmoval), a
simple yet effective solution for expanding the training dataset with synthetic
images without spurious features. ASPIRE, guided by language, generates these
images without requiring any form of additional supervision or existing
examples. Precisely, we employ LLMs to first extract foreground and background
features from textual descriptions of an image, followed by advanced
language-guided image editing to discover the features that are spuriously
correlated with the class label. Finally, we personalize a text-to-image
generation model to generate diverse in-domain images without spurious
features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ASPIRE on 4 datasets, including
the very challenging Hard ImageNet dataset, and 9 baselines and show that
ASPIRE improves the classification accuracy of prior methods by 1% - 38%. Code

<p>In the realm of embodied artificial intelligence, the reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) play a pivotal role. Although there are
effective methods like program-of-thought prompting for LLMs which uses
programming language to tackle complex reasoning tasks, the specific impact of
code data on the improvement of reasoning capabilities remains under-explored.
To address this gap, we propose complexity-impacted reasoning score (CIRS),
which combines structural and logical attributes, to measure the correlation
between code and reasoning abilities. Specifically, we use the abstract syntax
tree to encode the structural information and calculate logical complexity by
considering the difficulty and the cyclomatic complexity. Through an empirical
analysis, we find not all code data of complexity can be learned or understood
by LLMs. Optimal level of complexity is critical to the improvement of
reasoning abilities by program-aided prompting. Then we design an
auto-synthesizing and stratifying algorithm, and apply it to instruction
generation for mathematical reasoning and code data filtering for code
generation tasks. Extensive results demonstrates the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Code will be integrated into the EasyInstruct framework at

<p>In this paper, we address the concept of "alignment" in large language models
(LLMs) through the lens of post-structuralist socio-political theory,
specifically examining its parallels to empty signifiers. To establish a shared
vocabulary around how abstract concepts of alignment are operationalised in

Through this framework, we aim to foster a culture of transparency and critical
evaluation, aiding the community in navigating the complexities of aligning
LLMs with human populations.

<p>Prompting and adapter tuning have emerged as efficient alternatives to
fine-tuning (FT) methods. However, existing studies on speech prompting focused
on classification tasks and failed on more complex sequence generation tasks.
Besides, adapter tuning is primarily applied with a focus on encoder-only
self-supervised models. Our experiments show that prompting on Wav2Seq, a
self-supervised encoder-decoder model, surpasses previous works in sequence
generation tasks. It achieves a remarkable 53% relative improvement in word
error rate for ASR and a 27% in F1 score for slot filling. Additionally,
prompting competes with the FT method in the low-resource scenario. Moreover,
we show the transferability of prompting and adapter tuning on Wav2Seq in
cross-lingual ASR. When limited trainable parameters are involved, prompting
and adapter tuning consistently outperform conventional FT across 7 languages.
Notably, in the low-resource scenario, prompting consistently outperforms
adapter tuning.

distinguished topics work as adaptive features via multi-task training with

<p>Chain-of-Thought(CoT) prompting and its variants explore equipping large
language models (LLMs) with high-level reasoning abilities by emulating
human-like linear cognition and logic. However, the human mind is complicated
and mixed with both linear and nonlinear thinking. In this work, we propose
\textbf{I}nferential \textbf{E}xclusion \textbf{P}rompting (IEP), a novel
prompting that combines the principles of elimination and inference in order to
guide LLMs to think non-linearly. IEP guides LLMs to plan and then utilize
Natural Language Inference (NLI) to deduce each possible solution's entailment
relation with context, commonsense, or facts, therefore yielding a broader
perspective by thinking back for inferring. This forward planning and backward
eliminating process allows IEP to better simulate the complex human thinking
processes compared to other CoT-based methods, which only reflect linear
cognitive processes. We conducted a series of empirical studies and have
corroborated that IEP consistently outperforms CoT across various tasks.
Additionally, we observe that integrating IEP and CoT further improves the
LLMs' performance on certain tasks, highlighting the necessity of equipping
LLMs with mixed logic processes. Moreover, to better evaluate comprehensive
features inherent in human logic, we introduce \textbf{M}ental-\textbf{A}bility
\textbf{R}easoning \textbf{B}enchmark (MARB). The benchmark comprises six novel
subtasks with a total of 9,115 questions, among which 1,685 are developed with
hand-crafted rationale references. We believe both \textsc{IEP} and
\textsc{MARB} can serve as a promising direction for unveiling LLMs' logic and
verbal reasoning abilities and drive further advancements. \textsc{MARB} will
be available at ~\texttt{anonymity link} soon.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) are now available in various sizes and
configurations from cloud API providers. While this diversity offers a broad
spectrum of choices, effectively leveraging the options to optimize
computational cost and performance remains challenging. In this work, we
present AutoMix, an approach that strategically routes queries to larger LMs,
based on the approximate correctness of outputs from a smaller LM. Central to
AutoMix is a few-shot self-verification mechanism, which estimates the
reliability of its own outputs without requiring training. Given that
verifications can be noisy, we employ a meta verifier in AutoMix to refine the
accuracy of these assessments. Our experiments using LLAMA2-13/70B, on five
context-grounded reasoning datasets demonstrate that AutoMix surpasses
established baselines, improving the incremental benefit per cost by up to 89%.

<p>Curated datasets for healthcare are often limited due to the need of human
annotations from experts. In this paper, we present MedEval, a multi-level,
multi-task, and multi-domain medical benchmark to facilitate the development of
language models for healthcare. MedEval is comprehensive and consists of data
from several healthcare systems and spans 35 human body regions from 8
examination modalities. With 22,779 collected sentences and 21,228 reports, we
provide expert annotations at multiple levels, offering a granular potential
usage of the data and supporting a wide range of tasks. Moreover, we
systematically evaluated 10 generic and domain-specific language models under
zero-shot and finetuning settings, from domain-adapted baselines in healthcare
to general-purposed state-of-the-art large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Our
evaluations reveal varying effectiveness of the two categories of language
models across different tasks, from which we notice the importance of
instruction tuning for few-shot usage of large language models. Our

<p>An ideal length-extrapolatable Transformer language model can handle
sequences longer than the training length without any fine-tuning. Such
long-context utilization capability relies heavily on a flexible positional
embedding design. Upon investigating the flexibility of existing large
pre-trained Transformer language models, we find that the T5 family deserves a
closer look, as its positional embeddings capture rich and flexible attention
patterns. However, T5 suffers from the dispersed attention issue: the longer
the input sequence, the flatter the attention distribution. To alleviate the
issue, we propose two attention alignment strategies via temperature scaling.
Our findings show improvement on the long-context utilization capability of T5
on language modeling, retrieval, multi-document question answering, and code
completion tasks without any fine-tuning. This suggests that a flexible
positional embedding design and attention alignment can go a long way toward
Transformer length extrapolation.

<p>Watermarking generative models consists of planting a statistical signal
(watermark) in a model's output so that it can be later verified that the
output was generated by the given model. A strong watermarking scheme satisfies
the property that a computationally bounded attacker cannot erase the watermark
without causing significant quality degradation. In this paper, we study the
(im)possibility of strong watermarking schemes. We prove that, under
well-specified and natural assumptions, strong watermarking is impossible to
achieve. This holds even in the private detection algorithm setting, where the
watermark insertion and detection algorithms share a secret key, unknown to the
attacker. To prove this result, we introduce a generic efficient watermark
attack; the attacker is not required to know the private key of the scheme or
even which scheme is used. Our attack is based on two assumptions: (1) The
attacker has access to a "quality oracle" that can evaluate whether a candidate
output is a high-quality response to a prompt, and (2) The attacker has access
to a "perturbation oracle" which can modify an output with a nontrivial
probability of maintaining quality, and which induces an efficiently mixing
random walk on high-quality outputs. We argue that both assumptions can be
satisfied in practice by an attacker with weaker computational capabilities
than the watermarked model itself, to which the attacker has only black-box
access. Furthermore, our assumptions will likely only be easier to satisfy over
time as models grow in capabilities and modalities. We demonstrate the
feasibility of our attack by instantiating it to attack three existing
watermarking schemes for large language models: Kirchenbauer et al. (2023),
Kuditipudi et al. (2023), and Zhao et al. (2023). The same attack successfully
removes the watermarks planted by all three schemes, with only minor quality
degradation.

<p>Few-shot relation extraction involves identifying the type of relationship
between two specific entities within a text, using a limited number of
annotated samples. A variety of solutions to this problem have emerged by
applying meta-learning and neural graph techniques which typically necessitate
a training process for adaptation. Recently, the strategy of in-context
learning has been demonstrating notable results without the need of training.
Few studies have already utilized in-context learning for zero-shot information
extraction. Unfortunately, the evidence for inference is either not considered
or implicitly modeled during the construction of chain-of-thought prompts. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach for few-shot relation extraction using
large language models, named CoT-ER, chain-of-thought with explicit evidence
reasoning. In particular, CoT-ER first induces large language models to
generate evidences using task-specific and concept-level knowledge. Then these
evidences are explicitly incorporated into chain-of-thought prompting for
relation extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoT-ER approach
(with 0% training data) achieves competitive performance compared to the
fully-supervised (with 100% training data) state-of-the-art approach on the
FewRel1.0 and FewRel2.0 datasets.

<p>Social media data is a valuable resource for research, yet it contains a wide
range of non-standard words (NSW). These irregularities hinder the effective
operation of NLP tools. Current state-of-the-art methods for the Vietnamese
language address this issue as a problem of lexical normalization, involving
the creation of manual rules or the implementation of multi-staged deep
learning frameworks, which necessitate extensive efforts to craft intricate
rules. In contrast, our approach is straightforward, employing solely a
sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model. In this research, we provide a dataset
for textual normalization, comprising 2,181 human-annotated comments with an
inter-annotator agreement of 0.9014. By leveraging the Seq2Seq model for
textual normalization, our results reveal that the accuracy achieved falls
slightly short of 70%. Nevertheless, textual normalization enhances the
accuracy of the Hate Speech Detection (HSD) task by approximately 2%,
demonstrating its potential to improve the performance of complex NLP tasks.

<p>In-context learning (ICL) has shown impressive results in few-shot learning
tasks, yet its underlying mechanism is still not fully understood. Recent works
suggest that ICL can be thought of as a gradient descent (GD) based
optimization process. While promising, these results mainly focus on simplified
settings of ICL and provide only a preliminary evaluation of the similarities
between the two methods. In this work, we revisit the comparison between ICL
and GD-based finetuning and study what properties of ICL an equivalent process
must follow. We highlight a major difference in the flow of information between
ICL and standard finetuning. Namely, ICL can only rely on information from
lower layers at every point, while finetuning depends on loss gradients from
deeper layers. We refer to this discrepancy as Layer Causality and show that a
layer causal variant of the finetuning process aligns with ICL on par with
vanilla finetuning and is even better in most cases across relevant metrics. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to discuss this discrepancy
explicitly and suggest a solution that tackles this problem with minimal
changes.

<p>Extracting key information from scientific papers has the potential to help
researchers work more efficiently and accelerate the pace of scientific
progress. Over the last few years, research on Scientific Information
Extraction (SciIE) witnessed the release of several new systems and benchmarks.
However, existing paper-focused datasets mostly focus only on specific parts of
a manuscript (e.g., abstracts) and are single-modality (i.e., text- or
table-only), due to complex processing and expensive annotations. Moreover,
core information can be present in either text or tables or across both. To
close this gap in data availability and enable cross-modality IE, while
alleviating labeling costs, we propose a semi-supervised pipeline for
annotating entities in text, as well as entities and relations in tables, in an
iterative procedure. Based on this pipeline, we release novel resources for the
scientific community, including a high-quality benchmark, a large-scale corpus,
and a semi-supervised annotation pipeline. We further report the performance of
state-of-the-art IE models on the proposed benchmark dataset, as a baseline.
Lastly, we explore the potential capability of large language models such as
ChatGPT for the current task. Our new dataset, results, and analysis validate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our semi-supervised pipeline, and we

<p>We introduce a new problem KTRL+F, a knowledge-augmented in-document search
task that necessitates real-time identification of all semantic targets within
a document with the awareness of external sources through a single natural
query. This task addresses following unique challenges for in-document search:
1) utilizing knowledge outside the document for extended use of additional
information about targets to bridge the semantic gap between the query and the
targets, and 2) balancing between real-time applicability with the performance.
We analyze various baselines in KTRL+F and find there are limitations of
existing models, such as hallucinations, low latency, or difficulties in
leveraging external knowledge. Therefore we propose a Knowledge-Augmented
Phrase Retrieval model that shows a promising balance between speed and
performance by simply augmenting external knowledge embedding in phrase
embedding. Additionally, we conduct a user study to verify whether solving
KTRL+F can enhance search experience of users. It demonstrates that even with
our simple model users can reduce the time for searching with less queries and
reduced extra visits to other sources for collecting evidence. We encourage the

<p>Transformer neural networks can exhibit a surprising capacity for in-context
learning (ICL) despite not being explicitly trained for it. Prior work has
provided a deeper understanding of how ICL emerges in transformers, e.g.
through the lens of mechanistic interpretability, Bayesian inference, or by
examining the distributional properties of training data. However, in each of
these cases, ICL is treated largely as a persistent phenomenon; namely, once
ICL emerges, it is assumed to persist asymptotically. Here, we show that the
emergence of ICL during transformer training is, in fact, often transient. We
train transformers on synthetic data designed so that both ICL and in-weights
learning (IWL) strategies can lead to correct predictions. We find that ICL
first emerges, then disappears and gives way to IWL, all while the training
loss decreases, indicating an asymptotic preference for IWL. The transient
nature of ICL is observed in transformers across a range of model sizes and
datasets, raising the question of how much to "overtrain" transformers when
seeking compact, cheaper-to-run models. We find that L2 regularization may
offer a path to more persistent ICL that removes the need for early stopping
based on ICL-style validation tasks. Finally, we present initial evidence that
ICL transience may be caused by competition between ICL and IWL circuits.

<p>Aligning language models (LMs) with human opinion is challenging yet vital to
enhance their grasp of human values, preferences, and beliefs. We present
ChOiRe, a four-step solution framework to predict human opinion that
differentiates between the user explicit personae (i.e. demographic or
ideological attributes) that are manually declared and implicit personae
inferred from user historical opinions. Specifically, it consists of (i) an LM
analyzing the user explicit personae to filter out irrelevant attributes; (ii)
the LM ranking the implicit persona opinions into a preferential list; (iii)
Chain-of-Opinion (CoO) reasoning, where the LM sequentially analyzes the
explicit personae and the most relevant implicit personae to perform opinion
prediction; (iv) and where ChOiRe executes Step (iii) CoO multiple times with
increasingly larger lists of implicit personae to overcome insufficient
personae information to infer a final result. ChOiRe achieves new
state-of-the-art effectiveness with limited inference calls, improving previous
LLM-based techniques significantly by 3.22%.
